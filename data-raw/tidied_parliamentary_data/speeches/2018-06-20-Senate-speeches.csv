Senator HINCH
 (Victoria) (09:31):  Mr President, I want to draw your attention to a matter that occurred yesterday during formal motions which I believe may have invalidated a vote. I seek your guidance. Senator Dean Smith introduced a formal motion, No. 831. The Deputy President was in the chair and passed it on the ayes. It was disputed, and she then asked if a division was required. There were two dissenting voices, and, amid some confusion, the chair actually put the question again. The dissenting voices were those of Senator Anning and Senator Burston. During the division, Senator Burston left the chamber. Standing order 100(2) states:


A senator calling for a division shall not leave the chamber until the division has taken place.


Subsection (3) states:


A senator shall vote in a division in accordance with that senator's vote by voice.


That did not happen yesterday. Mr President, I hope you'll make a ruling as to the validity of that division, given that one of the voices calling for the division, that being the voice of Senator Burston, was not present during the division. I also hope that you will remind senators of the Senate rules governing divisions.

The PRESIDENT
 (09:32):  Thank you, Senator Hinch. This matter was brought to my attention this morning. You correctly point out the requirements of standing order 100, subclauses (2) and (3). With respect to the vote held yesterday, yes, senators should remain in the chamber and are required to when they call for a division, and their vote is required to reflect their voice when the question was put. However, upon taking advice, I believe the result of the division would not have been any different. It is not an invalid division, but you correctly give us the opportunity to remind all senators that, when they call for a division, they must remain in the chamber, and their vote must reflect their voice call when the matter was first put. To do otherwise is a breach of standing orders. But the division is not invalidated by that, given the result would have been no different.

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (09:33):  When I left off my contribution last night, when the adjournment intervened, I was talking about how I would spend the $26 billion a year of tax cuts in the areas of my portfolio. I realise that other senators also have priorities for their portfolios, but I am focusing on my portfolios. I went through issues about Newstart, reparations for the stolen generations and making sure that we have adequate housing in remote communities. I'd also make sure that we were properly addressing redress for those affected by institutional sexual abuse and making sure the cap was $200,000, for example, instead of the $150,000 which was in the legislation that passed this place yesterday. I'd also make sure that we had adequate services in emergency departments for people suffering from a mental health crisis. I'd also make sure that grants for organisations delivering vital services in our communities were indexed so that community organisations weren't suffering a reduction every year in the funding and services they could provide. I'd make sure that Centrelink actually worked and that we had a functioning system where people actually answer the phone and calls are answered the first time people ring.


We Greens would increase the minimum wage by 60 per cent. I reckon that's a much better way of spending the money this government is spending on these tax cuts. And, from the feedback that we have had, Australians would prefer that's the way the money was spent. They would prefer that we were delivering good, strong public services rather than funnelling this money to the big end of town. We need to address inequality in this country. We need a poverty plan, not a plan to make the wealthy even wealthier, which is what these tax cuts do. Most people won't benefit at all. The rich will get even richer. The fact is the majority of the benefits flow to the top 20 per cent of income earners. We have a plan to make the rich richer. We don't have a plan in this country to address poverty. Three million Australians are living in poverty and 3.6 million Australians do not have food security, according to the latest Foodbank report. We have people living in poverty, and the people that are most vulnerable are those trying to get by on the inadequate payment of Newstart and the youth allowance. We have people who are trying to survive below the poverty line, but the government's argument is: 'They're not really in poverty. The Anderson line and the poverty line are just an indication.' The research shows that there's a very good correlation between the poverty line and the expression of the poverty line as a measurement and the deprivation measures and deprivation structures. The research finds there's a good correlation between those in deprivation and where those poverty line measurements are.


The government likes to play fancy with words to imply that those on Newstart are doing relatively okay, thank you very much, because those poverty lines not a very good indication. But we know they are a good reflection of those suffering from various measures of deprivation, such as how often they've eaten, what they can buy to send their children to school with and whether their children are missing out on going to school because they don't have the necessary resources and supports to be at school. Those measures of deprivation are reflected well in the poverty line. The government also says, 'Those living on Newstart get other benefits.' But we know that, for the vast majority of those receiving the Newstart allowance, the main additional payment is the energy supplement, which is a whole four bucks a week. Hurray! They could go out and buy a cup of coffee. And that's the very measure that the government wants to take away and still has on the books to take away. In terms of the so-called supplementary income for income support payment recipients, as I've just said, the only payment received by the majority of people is the energy supplement, and we all know the government plans to cut that. Thirty-eight per cent of people receiving Newstart do receive rent assistance because they pay private rent. The maximum rate for single adults without children is $67 a week. In what we know is an unaffordable rental market, that goes very little way to being able to pay rent. Anglicare does a study every year about access to housing. From their recent study, we know that three properties out of 67,000 nationally were affordable for a single person on Newstart receiving rent assistance. So it is just a joke that the government thinks that rent assistance goes anywhere near addressing the need for affordable housing or making sure people aren't living below the poverty line. 


The Salvation Army reported a couple of weeks ago that their latest study has found that, when you take out the cost of accommodation, those on Newstart have $17 a day to try and survive on. Again, I renew my challenge to those on the other side of the chamber to try living on Newstart, even for a week. A week gives you a taste of what it's like to try and survive on Newstart. Other additional payments, such as family tax benefit, are only received by 19 per cent of the people on Newstart—again blowing a massive hole in the government's argument that those living on Newstart really aren't living below the poverty line and there's no need to increase Newstart. The family tax benefit is actually to help parents raise their children. 


There is only one job available for every eight people looking for paid work. Two-thirds of people receiving Newstart are having to rely on the allowance for 12 months or more. When this payment originally came in, when we were calling it the dole and other previous names, it was about people being temporarily out of work for around six weeks, and people could survive on the payment for that length of time. That situation, of course, has changed. So many more people are having to rely on Newstart for much longer, work is not as readily available and there is much more active age discrimination against older workers trying to find work. And we all know the appalling statistics for young people who are unemployed. We used to talk about this affecting people in their early 20s. Now we're talking about those over 25 being unable to find permanent full-time work; they're more likely to be in temporary or part-time work. So our work situation is much more precarious than it used to be. People need to rely much more on income support. 


We also know living in poverty is a barrier to employment. We know that many people on Newstart have a number of vulnerabilities. Due to cuts from the Howard government, the Rudd-Gillard government and then the Abbott government, people with disability applying for the disability support pension have not been able to access it, and there's been an active push by this government, started by Mr Abbott and followed by Mr Turnbull, to try and kick more and more people off the disability support pension. Rather than enable them to remain on the disability support pension and improve their prospects of finding work, they are being actively assessed to kick them off the disability support pension. So they're living on the poorer payment of Newstart while they're trying to find work. This all adds up to a mess, where we have hundreds of thousands of Australians living below the poverty line while they are trying to survive on Newstart. 


Because of the way the government chose to index Newstart, it has not adequately kept pace with the true cost of living. It is not indexed the same as the age pension, so it has fallen further and further behind. The money that is being given away to the big end of town should be spent on those people that are living below the poverty line, that are trying to find work on Newstart, on youth allowance and on other payments. That's where we should be focusing that money.


We should invest in the services that support Australians, as I articulated earlier. We have a commitment in this country to universal service. The Greens are deeply committed to universality to ensure that we have a health system and an education system, and a social security safety net that truly is a social security safety net. That's where we should be spending the money that the government is giving away to the big end of town. As I said, the majority of it's going to the top 20 per cent of income earners. That money is not addressing inequality in this country; in fact, it will be driving inequality. Instead of focusing on those on the very lowest incomes, the government's saying, 'Big end of town, work on the trickle-down effect.' We in Western Australia know very well, from when we had the mining boom, that that money does not trickle down to those on the lowest incomes.


Let's remember a little bit of history. I was in this place when John Howard decided before the 2007 election that he would hand out money hand over fist for tax cuts. Let's have a quick look at where that ended up. Mr Rudd came in and continued with those tax cuts. Then we had the GFC, but those tax cuts were in place. That largesse was still in place. Instead of spending that money on services that would have better supported those who would be most affected by the GFC or by a downturn from good economic times to bad economic times, those tax cuts were allowed to flow through. Then we got to Mr Abbott, who came in and slashed the social security safety net—he absolutely slashed it—and came up with a brilliant idea: 'Oh! We'll force young people to wait six months before they can access Newstart or youth allowance.' Fortunately, this Senate stopped that ridiculous plan. It would not support that ridiculous plan. The government also took half a billion dollars out of funding for Aboriginal services. This can be related directly back to the fact that they gave away all that money in tax cuts. Now we're seeing a slight increase in revenue, and the government rushes to give it away. 


And what does the ALP do? It wants tax cuts that are 'bigger, better and fairer'. I don't know where the ALP came up with the term 'fair' in terms of tax cuts, when they are not supporting an increase to the most vulnerable people in our community, those who are struggling on Newstart, on youth allowance, on the age pension and on disability support pension. Those are the people that we need to be supporting not only through an increase in Newstart and an increase in youth allowance but by making sure that we are addressing and supporting the services that really will make a difference in people's lives.


The 10 richest families in Australia own as much wealth as the poorest four million Australians combined. Three million of those poorest Australians are living below the poverty line. As I said, 3.6 million, part of those four million, are suffering from food insecurity, and yet what does this government want to do? It wants to hand over more money to the wealthiest in this nation, to those earning the highest incomes. We Greens say no, that is not good enough. We need to make sure that we are funding Australians who need the support, and we do that by making sure that we can fund Newstart and youth allowance, that we can fund those most in need. 


How about we have a redress scheme for those children who were in institutional care but suffered other forms of abuse, such as physical and mental abuse, who still have not received reparations and who will not be able to access the counselling services under the National Redress Scheme—limited though they are, because they're not lifelong services? How about a redress scheme for those survivors, for those care leavers? Many of them were brought to this country by our government, were subjected to abuse and have not received redress. How about spending some money on them? How about providing services that all the community wants?


When you ask Australians if they want public services or tax cuts, they'll tell you they want public services. They want to make sure that they and their children can access a top-quality education system. They want to make sure that they can get health services when they need it. They want to be able to ring Centrelink and the Department of Human Services and get the information they want without having to keep dialling and dialling. They want a social security net for when they fall on hard times. I want to be able to look in the faces of people with disability and say that our country can provide them with the support and services they need, instead of demonising them and making them jump through all sorts of hoops, trying to find work for 18 months before they can access the disability support pension. That's not the country I want to live in. (Time expired)

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Treasury Laws Amendment (Personal Income Tax Plan) Bill 2018</title>,BILLS,3,1
"Pratt, Sen Louise",ALP,2018-06-20,"



Senator PRATT
 (Western Australia) (09:51):  We've heard a lot from the government so far in this debate about their tax plan making things more fair; however, it's very clear to Australians, because they're fair-minded people, that there's nothing fair about the 2018 budget or about the Treasury Laws Amendment (Personal Income Tax Plan) Bill 2018. What most people think is fair in this nation is a greater sense of equity and equality. For example, when there are two people at a football match, and one can see over the fence and the other can't, it's not fair to keep them both standing on the ground; it's fair to give the short person a leg-up and put them on a box so they can see. That is the principle of progressive taxation. Fairness is about levelling the playing field for people.


What we have in this budget is big business and the banks getting an $80 billion tax handout, which will be paid for with cuts to our schools and hospitals. In this bill the flattening of the progressive nature of our tax system would give high-income earners in our country a much higher benefit than lower income earners. Here we have it again for all to see: high-income earners and big business are the true priorities of the Turnbull government. Under the proposal the government has put forward, 62 per cent of the benefits would go to higher income earners while just seven per cent would go to the 30 per cent of Australians on the lowest wages. Why would you do that? Are you insane? Do you not care about the working poor in our nation?


This bill continues to demonstrate how out of touch this government is with the reality of Australians' lives and in particular the people doing it toughest. This bill also demonstrates a government that is prepared to risk the budget bottom line—our capacity to pay down debt, to pay for services, to have a good Defence Force and to bail ourselves out of bad times—so it can hand out tax cuts to big business and top-income earners while doing very little for middle-income households. Whilst those opposite will argue that they're flattening the tax system, making it fairer, and that lower income households are getting a tax cut, it's a much smaller tax cut in dollar terms than the one for those who are already substantially much better off.


In our current economic climate, we should have a government that's concerned about workforce participation, concerned about lack of wage growth and concerned about increasing the disposable income of targeted households as a way of boosting consumer spending. It's very clear that this government is not interested in that. What happens when you boost the incomes of higher income households? They invest more. They save more. These are worthy aspirations, but, when you put income into lower income households, they spend it and stimulate the economy, and everyone benefits. Investing more when you are on a higher income is all very well, except that people are accumulating wealth, in many instances, above and beyond that which ordinary Australians will ever be able to see or access in their own lives.


Under the coalition, we see the cost of living set to increase. Workers in the retail, food and accommodation industries are losing up to $77 a week in penalty rates. We see families and pensioners paying around $20 a week or more, or about $1,000 a year, for private health insurance. We see parents paying more for child care—$40 a week, or $2,000 a year, more in fees. And we see record costs to visit a GP—on average, about $9 more every time you visit a doctor. These are the reasons why Labor is very prepared to support the government's proposed changes that are set to take effect on 1 July—those tax cuts that are targeted at people who need them. Labor will support tax cuts for 10 million people on 1 July, and we are ready to vote for those tax cuts today.


If Labor is elected, we want to double these tax cuts and make them permanent, while asking those in the top tax bracket to pay a little more to help reduce debt. People in the top tax bracket, relative to people in the lower tax brackets, still have the resources to pay for their accommodation and pay for their retirement. Labor's bigger, better, fairer income tax will see those earning up to $125,000 a year better off when compared to Malcolm Turnbull's plan for the next four years.


It is simply absurd to us in the Labor Party that someone on $200,000 a year should pay the same tax rate as someone on $40,000 a year. It is unfair and absurd. So we don't agree with the Turnbull government giving more tax cuts for the top bracket—and this is after the Turnbull government cut the tax rate for high-income earners just last year. The idea that a corporate executive or a politician on $200,000 a year should pay the same marginal tax rate as a worker earning close to the minimum wage, on a salary of about $41,000, strips away every shred of progressiveness in our taxation system. Yet, absurdly, this government is trying to pull the wool over Australians' eyes—and I don't think they will fall for it—to sell the idea that this is a tax cut for ordinary Australians. It's not a tax cut for teachers, police, cleaners or aged-care workers. It's a tax cut for the high end of town, for well-paid professionals, who will have a high standard of living relative to others without a tax cut. That's why Labor will move amendments in the Senate to the Treasury Laws Amendment (Personal Income Tax Plan) Bill 2018 to ensure the passage of tax cuts starting on 1 July.


We will seek to implement better, fairer tax cuts through Labor's tax refund for working Australians. This would double the tax relief up to $928 a year. It will mean that the 57,000 people in Canning, the 63,000 people in Forrest and the 65,000 people in Moore will receive an increased tax refund. However, what we've seen is the Turnbull government's tax cuts overwhelmingly benefit wealthier electorates. So it's not surprising to me that this government has seen tax cuts that overwhelmingly benefit inner Melbourne and inner Sydney electorates, but it is of great concern and a disgrace that Mr Andrew Hastie and the Turnbull government are not standing up for the people of Canning—the good, hardworking people of Mandurah, Pinjarra and Byford and all those across the Canning electorate. As I move around Canning, I talk to constituents about their struggle to make ends meet and the fact that they juggle numerous jobs just to earn a modest income. They will tell you how they're overworked and underpaid or struggling to find enough work to get by. People who are struggling to find enough work to get by deserve a better, bigger tax cut than the high end of town because they rely on every cent of what they earn just to get by. There's no rational reason to take the same amount of tax out of their income as is taken out of my or your much higher incomes.


We see that up to 70 per cent of taxpayers will be better off under Labor's fairer tax plan, and that includes 57,000 residents who live in Canning. Seventy per cent of the hardworking taxpayers in Mandurah, Pinjarra and Byford will be better off under our tax plan. And I suppose the Prime Minister does try to help, in his own way, when he says, 'They should just get a better job.' Try telling that to every single cleaner, storeperson, shop assistant, orderly, retail worker or hospitality worker. We need people to do these jobs. We need them to have incomes that keep those industries viable. They need good wages. We need to see wages growth in those industries. We know those industries will never see wages growth that compares with wages growth for high-paid professionals, but we need them to do those jobs. Why do you rub people's faces in their own professions in that way? We have to value the work that Australians do, because it needs to be done. Every day, in our communities and in our cities, we depend on the great diversity of work that people do, be it well paid or low paid. People on low wages should get better pay, but the simple fact is, because they are on lower wages and we need people to do that work, we should not, in our right mind, ever consider taxing them at the same rate as wealthier Australians. The absurdity of it is absolutely disgusting.


In our nation, inequality is at a 70-year high. We should be taking steps to do exactly the opposite of what the government is doing, and that is taking steps to improve and address inequality and to remove inequality in our system by using our tax and transfer system and implementing principles that are exactly the opposite of what this government is seeking to do.


With overall inequality worsening, there are negative impacts on our economic growth. The best thing we can do to fix that is to have a strong, progressive taxation system where those who can afford to pay more do pay more and those who can't afford to pay as much aren't asked to pay as much. We need a government that stops standing in the way of tax relief for the 10 million Australians who need it. We need a more progressive taxation system, not a less progressive one. Tax cuts this year for teachers and tradies should not be held hostage to tax cuts for bankers or highly-paid professionals in six years time.


The Turnbull government's priority is for tax cuts for big business and high income earners, at a stupendous cost of $25 billion a year in 10 years time. I don't think our nation can afford that—our schools and hospitals can't afford it, our TAFE system can't afford it, our social services can't afford it, our public sector can't afford it and our defence force can't afford it. The fabric that holds our community together simply cannot afford it.


Labor, on the other hand, because we're not giving millionaires another tax cut and we're not giving big business an $80 billion tax handout, can put more money into the pockets of working Australians while funding better schools and hospitals and paying down debt quicker. This bill will make our tax system in Australia less progressive and it will continue to erode our tax base. It doesn't deserve the paper it's written on.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Treasury Laws Amendment (Personal Income Tax Plan) Bill 2018</title>,BILLS,3,1
"Hanson-Young, Sen Sarah",AG,2018-06-20,"



Senator HANSON-YOUNG
 (South Australia) (10:07):  I rise today to contribute to this debate on a tax cut for millionaires, put forward, of course, by the Turnbull government. The whole essence of this debate on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Personal Income Tax Plan) Bill rests on what types of priorities we have in this place and on what types of priorities we have for the nation. On one side we have the Turnbull government wanting to spend hundreds of billions of dollars—taxpayers' money—in tax cuts for the big end of town, in addition to the tax cuts they've already flagged and have tried to push through this place already in relation to corporate Australia and the big banks. Malcolm Turnbull's priority is to look after the big end of town—to look after the corporates, the big banks and rich, wealthy Australians. Meanwhile, everybody else is going to cop a cut in access to public services.


That is the choice here. It's about priorities. Malcolm Turnbull wants to fund the billionaires and the big banks but those of us trying to stop these tax cuts from going through are asking: 'What happens when regular Australians need to go to hospital? What happens when someone's kid is sick? What happens when you rock up to school and you realise your public school is charging families school fees up to $4,000 to send their children to public schools, because we don't have money for the education system? What happens when a mother can't go back to work because childcare is too expensive?' These are the choices that we are being presented with in this bill today.


The government can only spend and invest money based on what it collects. We know that we don't just have a tax problem here. We have a problem with collecting the right amount of tax, because tax avoidance in this country, particularly from the big end of town, is rife. If you're a big corporate bank and if you're in corporate Australia, you can find many, many ways to reduce your taxable income. If you're a rich Australian, you can find the best accountant in the country to make sure you pay no tax at all. Meanwhile, average Australians are struggling day by day, and they rely on public essential services right around the country.


If you collect less tax as a government, you're going to have less money to spend on public services. If we have less revenue, that fundamentally undermines the ability of governments to do what they need to do, and that is to underpin essential services that are available to everybody—schools, hospitals and the broader health system—and to ensure that, if you lose your job and you're on unemployment benefits, Newstart payments are enough to live on so you can be supported until you get another job, not punished by living on less than $40 a day just because this government wants to prioritise giving millionaires $7,000 back. That's what's on the table here. Someone on an average income is perhaps, if they're lucky, going to get around $200 in a tax cut. And yet the wealthy Australians, the millionaires and, in fact, the politicians—those of us in this place—will get $7,000 out of this. That must be pretty galling to people out there listening to this debate.


We're told by the neoliberals on the other side that, despite being a wealthy nation, we can't afford things like proper funding of hospitals, or to ensure our elderly are taken care of in their aged-care homes, or for schools to be funded properly so parents don't have to fork out thousands of dollars just to send their kid to a public school. We're told we can't afford these things, and yet hundreds of billions of dollars in this package today are going to roll out the door in election bribes by this government.


The neoliberals on the other side have done a very good job at trying to hoodwink the Australian people. Although we are a very wealthy country, the neoliberals have done everything they can to undermine and run public essential services into the ground. They want to give people a false choice: you can choose between Malcolm Turnbull's handout to millionaires or you can choose to fund public services. Spending, of course, is all about priorities, so is revenue and so is where we collect our revenue from. This government finds many, many ways to undermine the bare collection of revenue, because they don't want to upset their big mates in the banks, in corporate Australia or, indeed, in the rich end of town. This government says to average Australians and those who are struggling living on the median wage: 'We can't afford to help you, if you fall through the cracks. It's 40 bucks a day from Newstart if you lose your job. Suck it up.' No. That is not a choice we should be forcing Australians to make.


If you turn up to university in this country, you should be able to access a good-quality education, regardless of how much money is in your parents' bank account and regardless of what private or public school you may have attended. We need more young people, not fewer, being able to access good-quality higher education, whether it's through universities or the TAFE sector. That means we have to fund education properly. We have to make it available and accessible for all, not just for those whose parents are on the top of the rich list and are going to bank a $7,000 tax cut out of this and their kids will be okay. We need all Australian children to access good-quality education and know from a very early age that if they want to go on to university or TAFE they'll be supported in doing so. We should make that a guarantee. Every Australian child should know that if they want to get a higher education they can get one; they shouldn't have to be in the top income bracket to do it.


This is what making government spending priorities is all about. Australians overwhelmingly know that the trade-off, or the dividend, of paying their taxes should be good quality public services. Australians don't mind paying tax if it means having good quality schools and being able to access the emergency ward in the hospital if someone falls over and breaks their hip or if a child is sick in the middle of the night. Australians don't mind paying taxes if they know that they're going to go to a well-funded NDIS. Australians don't mind paying their taxes if they're going to have a strong Medicare safety net. Australians know that being part of a decent democratic society is all about having the people who can afford to pay a bit more pay a bit more so that those who are struggling can be helped to get back on their feet.


A progressive taxation system is essential for the fair and decent society that we are all proud to live in here in Australia. That is under attack from this legislation and agenda of the government because all they care about is looking after the big banks, the rich end of town and Malcolm Turnbull's mates. If the Prime Minister really cared about productivity growth in this country, he'd fund child care properly so that more women were actively supported to go back to work. But what we will see come 2 July is a bunch of families losing access to their childcare support, particularly those families where both parents struggle to be in the workforce.


The absolute lunacy of this tax bill is that it spends hundreds of billions of dollars as an election bribe, yet the majority of Australians who work hard every day and those who struggle to get into the workforce, those on unemployment benefits, really get nothing from this. No wonder Malcolm Turnbull's mates want this to pass, because they're going to bank $7,000 from it. Meanwhile, average Australians and the rest of the country will lose out because hospital waiting lists will grow, because school fees will rise and because our older Australians will continue to suffer in old aged-care homes.


Look at my home state of South Australia. We know that the overwhelming majority of the tax cuts outlined in this bill are going to go to those who are already the most well-off, those who are earning well above $120,000 a year. That's about five per cent of South Australians. So five per cent of South Australians might get something out of this, but 95 per cent of South Australians will get very little. In fact, there will be a double whammy because our state relies significantly on well-funded essential public services. As a result of this priority choice by this government to fund the rich and cut services most South Australians will lose out. By the time the full impact of these tax cuts is realised, South Australia will be losing around $2 billion from essential services—that's cuts to schools, that's cuts to hospitals and that's cuts to other essential services. Bad luck if you need to put your kid in child care so that you can take an extra day of work a week. You won't be able to afford it, because the Turnbull government isn't going to be able to fund child care in this country. 


Our universities and TAFEs are going to lose funding. They'll be $105 million worse off. We'll lose $305 million in spending on hospitals and health care. We can't afford that. We have an ageing population, particularly in South Australia, and we want to make sure our older Australians are looked after with dignity and with care. Yet the government is going to slash $305 million in funding used to support essential health care in South Australia. 


We'll lose $905 million on pensions and payments, and this is a very clear message to the people of Mayo—those South Australians who live in the Adelaide Hills and down along the Fleurieu Peninsula down to Victor Harbor. This tax cut for Malcolm Turnbull's mates is going to cost age pensioners and other recipients of government funding almost a billion dollars! How are we going to look after our aged and elderly Australians if we don't have the money to fund it? But who will be laughing? It'll be Malcolm Turnbull's mates, who are banking $7,000 a year. I guess that's a nice overseas holiday. 


The government says: 'Look, don't worry about it. Everyone'll be paying less tax.' The reality is most Australians rely on public services to ensure that we can get through our daily lives. We all respect our well-funded public hospitals and health system. We all know that we need a public education system to ensure that there is a proper safety net, to ensure that our kids can go to school and get a good education, regardless of whether their parents have a job at the time or how much money their parents have in their bank account. In South Australia, these tax cuts mean that for every dollar that is given in a tax cut, South Australians are going to lose $1.40 in public services. On anyone's maths, that's a lose-lose. 


South Australia loses massively in this bill, and that's a message I have for the members of Centre Alliance here today. Don't buy this government furphy. You've got a choice here: tax cuts for millionaires and Malcolm Turnbull's mates, or funding for South Australian schools, hospitals and services. As one of the smaller states and as one of the states with the lowest number of high-income earners in the country, South Australia loses out significantly under this bill. As a South Australian senator, I'm standing here today to say: do not risk it. Do not buy the furphy that you have to hand politicians a $7,000 tax cut in order to make everybody else feel okay. We don't need the $7,000 tax cut. What we need is more money for schools, more money to cut hospital waiting lists, and more money to ensure that working mums and dads in the electorate of Mayo actually can access well-funded child care. That's what we want the government to prioritise. 


I say to the Centre Alliance members in this place today: don't buy the lie that you should just tick this tax cut through. Does anyone really believe that if we start giving tax cuts to the big end of town, to politicians, to Malcolm Turnbull's millionaire mates—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Kitching
):  Senator Hanson-Young, I will remind you—




Senator HANSON-YOUNG:
  Does anyone believe if we start giving tax cuts to the big end of town, to Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull's millionaire mates, that anyone is going to come in here after the next election and rescind any of this? I don't believe the Labor Party's going to do that, and I certainly don't believe the Liberal Party will ever do that. Don't be fooled, I say to senators Griff and Patrick of the Centre Alliance. Once this tax cut is in, it will stay. Don't risk it.


On that, I want to point out the sheer hypocrisy of Pauline Hanson and One Nation in relation to all of this.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Hanson-Young, again, if you could—




Senator HANSON-YOUNG:
  I think it's absolutely important to understand the sheer hypocrisy of the One Nation party, led by Senator Hanson. Supporting this bill means supporting rich Australians, millionaires, and doing nothing for those battling on average incomes. This gives money to the richest and wealthiest Australians at the expense of funding for the age pension and funding for hospitals. This final stage of the tax cut does absolutely nothing for 60 per cent of taxpayers in this country. We have Senator Hanson snuggling up to the government again, selling out the majority of Australians—all of her voters—to tick off on what is going to be the biggest tax cut given to millionaires in a long, long time. Senator Pauline Hanson is going to vote for this bill to give herself a $7,000 tax cut! What a grub! What a sneaky, sneaky move! What a sellout!



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Hanson-Young, I would remind you of the standing orders. Perhaps 'grub' was not particularly parliamentary. I'd ask you to withdraw that.




Senator HANSON-YOUNG:
  Thank you, Madam Acting Deputy President. I withdraw calling Senator Pauline Hanson a grub. I'll replace it: Senator Pauline Hanson is going to come into this place to vote to give herself a $7,000 tax cut—sheer hypocrisy! What an absolute sellout! 


This tax cut will do nothing to lift wages. We know we have a wage-growth issue in this country. This tax cut will do nothing to help people on Newstart or, indeed, the minimum wage. What this proves, and what Senator Pauline Hanson and One Nation's deal with the government proves, is that they're all about feathering their own nests and doing nothing to help regular Australians!

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Treasury Laws Amendment (Personal Income Tax Plan) Bill 2018</title>,BILLS,3,1
"O'Neill, Sen Deb",ALP,2018-06-20,"



Senator O'NEILL
 (New South Wales) (10:27):  I too rise to put my remarks on the record with regard to this very important proposed piece of legislation, the Treasury Laws Amendment (Personal Income Tax Plan) Bill 2018. This bill has the potential to have a significant and profoundly negative impact on Australians, as it is constructed by this government. 


I find that we hear once more—in the throes of the drama and intensity of these last two weeks of sitting before we go to another break—the government saying: 'This has got to be done now. This has got to get sorted now. On 1 July, the whole world's going to fall apart unless we get this resolved.' The pressure, right now, as I am making this contribution to the debate, is being applied to the crossbench, some of whom—or their advisers—I hope might be listening to my contribution. I want to point out how important it is that everyone understands that the Treasurer himself has conceded that the legislation does not need to be in place by 1 July for the tax relief that's being discussed to be received by the end of next financial year. That's the reality. This pressure cooker that's being created is an artifice. In this hastily constructed pressure cooker, we shouldn't be making decisions that would affect people six or seven years hence with such negative consequences, in my view, for our economy and, more profoundly, for our community.


We're being faced with a choice by this government, with its litany of failures in service provision, between continuing along the path that it has set of taking away more and more services from Australians and throwing money, a little bit of money, at those who need it most and extraordinary sums at people on $200,000, who are not clamouring at the doors of this place saying: 'Give me $7,000. I can't survive without it.' That is not the challenge that is facing us in this parliament. The challenge is people clamouring at our doors, day in, day out, asking for the funding of basic services. There are over 100,000 Australians right now who are seeking aged-care packages. They're desperate for some help in their home so they can stay there. They're desperately in need. I see Senator Brown has joined us in the chamber here. People are trying to get decent services for disability needs. People are speaking to me in my role as the assistant shadow minister for mental health, despairing about suicide in their community and being unable to access services.


That's the landscape: the service deprivation that has been imposed upon this nation by this government over five years of ripping money out of the services that Australians should have a right to expect. And having done that now, its grand plan, in addition to having abandoned any sense of fiscal responsibility and budgetary constraint, is to try and buy off Australians by throwing some tax money at them in an entirely inappropriate and unfair way. That's why Labor will oppose the way in which this government wants to advance tax reform in this country.


Budgetary decisions are all about choices, and Labor is going to choose services for all and tax cuts for those who need it most. It contrasts profoundly with the government's proposal of giving tax cuts of a shape and form that six years from now—when kids in year 7 have finished high school—in 2024 will deliver a tax structure where 80 per cent of the benefit will flow to the top 20 per cent of wage earners in this country. If I only repeated that fact over and over and over in my contribution, if only that single fact could seep into the conversation about this proposed tax reform by the government, Australians would understand what a dog they're being sold and how cruel and unfair this government's proposal is. The bottom 60 per cent of all workers will get no tax benefit at all by 2024, if this government's bill passes as it is. That's the shape and form of what we're discussing here and why the debate that we're having is so important.


This government's Personal Income Tax Plan demonstrates exactly how out of touch this government is. We as the Labor Party do not support someone on $200,000, which is the standard pay for most of the people who work in this parliament, paying the same tax rate as someone on $40,000. That is plainly unfair. We've seen this over and over in the course of this Liberal-National Party government with the prioritising of the top end of town over ordinary Australians; the prioritising in terms of tax where the cost is not just a lack of income benefit to low- and middle-income earners but the ongoing removal of services and the ongoing cuts to services absolutely across the horizon, if it gets this piece of legislation through. 


I want to have a little bit of a look at a distributional analysis. If we look at the impact of this government's decisions, we can see that it has failed to provide any form of a distribution analysis of its Personal Income Tax Plan. But Labor and interest groups have, and it's very clear that stages 2 and 3 of the proposed tax reform by this government absolutely and totally fail the fairness test. Let's be absolutely clear here: stages 2 and 3 of the government's tax plan will flatten out Australia's personal income tax system, and that structural change to the personal income tax system is eroding its progressivity. This is a fundamental principle of our tax system, and it's based on the premise that, if you earn a small amount of income, pretty well everything that you earn goes to keeping a roof over your head, providing food, providing shelter and providing for the basics, but as you go up the tax scale, with those things accommodated, there is an increase in your capacity to contribute to the general wellbeing of the community and to pay a bit more tax so that we have decent hospitals and schools that are properly funded, where parents can send their children through the gates of any school in the country and know that there'll be readers for the kindergarten kids to read from and paper and resources for teachers to creatively engage with young people in high school. We trust that our tax dollars, invested on a slightly higher scale by those with a bigger income, benefit our entire community.


I can tell you from this morning, when I was at the Kids' Cancer Project breakfast, that no-one in that room thinks there's adequate funding going into the prevention and treatment of cancer for young people. They were there asking the government, the opposition and anybody who would listen to hear their pleas for further investment in proper research capacity. The reality that we face right at this moment in our country is a choice between Labor and a Liberal government who have no commitment to decency, to fairness or to equity. The attempt to force this inequitable piece of legislation through the chamber should be abandoned.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Treasury Laws Amendment (Personal Income Tax Plan) Bill 2018</title>,BILLS,3,1
"Di Natale, Sen Richard",AG,2018-06-20,"



Senator DI NATALE
 (Victoria—Leader of the Australian Greens) (10:37):  These tax cuts are saying to Australians that whatever government might be providing for you at the moment is more than you need. Whatever you receive at the moment, whether it be an education in a public school, treatment in a public hospital, using public transport or, indeed, some sort of family assistance payment, it's too much. You're already getting too much, because what the Treasury Laws Amendment (Personal Income Tax Plan) Bill 2018 does is strip away vital public revenue from those essential services.


This bill, more than most of the other bills that come through this place, is going to help determine what sort of country we want to create. We've got some big choices ahead of us: we can choose to continue down the path of the Liberal and National parties to a dog-eat-dog world where everyone's in it for themselves and we shrink public services, or we can create a different sort of world, where we collectively come together, understand that we're in this together, invest in our people and ensure that no person languishes for months on a waiting list and that every young child gets access to the best possible education they can get—a world where we have publicly owned infrastructure that provides all of the vital services that people need and where we have a strong social safety net so that no-one's left behind. That's the sort of future we can create. It's not a utopian dream; it's actually within our grasp here. It's just about the choices that we make in this chamber.


We've been told by politicians of all stripes for more than a decade that Australia can't afford to do these things—that we can't afford to increase Newstart, tackle climate change or protect the threatened species that exist in this continent and are disappearing at an alarming rate. In fact, we're going to do worse; we're going to cut the jobs of the people responsible for looking after the precious biodiversity in this island continent of ours. And we're now hearing a debate where the premise seems to be, 'My tax cut's bigger than your tax cut.' Some $144 billion is going to be taken out of public services. We're told that the reason for this change is to address bracket creep, yet wages are at an all-time low. This bill's not about bracket creep. It's about shrinking the size of government and the public services that follow from that, and it's about making sure that people who need a little bit of help don't get that help.


We've got some choices ahead of us. We know that healthcare costs are increasing. We know that our education system needs more support. We know that our infrastructure is failing. We can afford to invest in all of those things. We could have a world-class public health system so that no person in this country languishes on a public waiting list. We could make sure that every child in the country gets access to a world-class education and, indeed, that those people who choose to send their child to a public school don't have to spend a cent out of their own pocket. We could build cities and regions that create no net pollution. We could preserve our planet for future generations to enjoy while they prosper. We can start restoring our environment, rather than destroying it.


And at the heart of this debate is a lie. We're told that income taxes are too high, but the reality is very, very different. Australia is, by all indicators, a low-taxing country. When you consider our total tax take as a proportion of GDP compared to other similar OECD countries, we do very well. We're a low-taxing country. Yet we're told again that we have to reduce taxes, and the consequences of that are alarming. Our Public Service is already so badly decimated that it can't answer the phone when you call to find out why it's cancelled your pension or a family assistance payment. Past governments have spent the last two decades privatising government. We've got big corporates enjoying all of the upsides and everyday people getting stuck with all of the downsides. You only need to look at the announcement today from Telstra. Do you remember when Telstra was privatised? 'Better services. People will be looked after. We're going to save money.' There are 8,000 people today who don't know how they're going to be able to put food on their table. Yet we've got no-one in this place who's got the political courage to stand up and say: 'We don't need tax cuts. We need investment in services. We need to look after people. We need to raise Newstart. We need to start protecting our environment.' No-one has had the courage to stand up and do that apart from my colleagues in the Greens, and I want to thank each and every one of them for it.


These are financially reckless tax cuts. They're going to punch a $23 billion hole in the budget annually. If you look at stage 3 alone, they're going to grow by 12 per cent each year. It's completely unsustainable. We can't afford it. We know what the costs are. And we all know that, when it comes to issues like global warming, housing, student debt or work security, it's not going to be the people in this chamber who are going to have to deal with those issues; it's going to be the generations that come after us. It's going to be young people today who are going to be lumbered with the costs of this decision that we make in this chamber. We know that these tax cuts are a prescription for turbocharging inequality in Australia. When stage 3 kicks in, someone on the minimum wage will be paying the same rate as a bank executive or a politician. That's not a progressive tax system. It's taking us down the US route.


And, of course, like the Turnbull cabinet itself, the big winners are men, and women get a few scraps, with less than one-third of the top-end tax cuts. We've seen some analysis today from Professor Miranda Stewart at ANU, who has added more evidence of just how discriminatory against women these tax cuts are. You have to be working full time to get the benefit, yet 45 per cent of women work part time. For men, it's only 16 per cent. And 61 per cent of women caring for a child under the age of five are working part time, while for men it's only eight per cent. If you look at the interaction between these tax cuts and the new childcare payment starting next month, the research shows that a mother wanting to work a few extra days would get to keep just $4,000 if she earnt $27,000 in additional income. If you're a young mother not earning a high wage, you face an effective marginal tax rate of between 85 per cent and 95 per cent. Professor Stewart's conclusion is that we'd be better off investing the tax cut money into universal child care. Now there's a ripping idea which benefits women so they can live the lives they want to lead and doesn't hand out tax cuts which largely benefit men.


Of course, the Treasurer's been deceptive in selling the benefits of this tax cut to senators and the public: $82,000 isn't the normal wage; it's the average salary of a full-time working bloke. The median wage of all Australians is around $54,000. Under even stage 1 of this tax cut, you can be a family with a combined income of just under $250,000 and you'll get a tax cut. The benchmark that the government's using, of a regular worker on 82 grand, is only a quarter of the workforce. Three-quarters of the workforce earn less than that. This plan's too focused on wealthy Australians. It does nothing for ordinary people. I reckon that if the majority of Australians—by definition, those earning less than $54,001, so, anyone under the median wage—knew they were getting nothing in exchange for having their local schools and hospitals completely gutted, people in this place might reconsider. Let me be clear about that: there will be a few dollars a week in the pocket of somebody who's a childcare worker, a nurse or a teacher and, under stage 3 of this plan, an extra $7,000 for CEOs, politicians and bank executives.


This bill does nothing to address the concerns of the most vulnerable people in our community. People on Newstart or on a pension get nothing out of this bill—not a cent. If you're somebody who can't afford to take out private health insurance to jump a queue and you're languishing on a waiting list for a year to have your hip replaced, you get nothing out of this; in fact, you'll be waiting for longer, because every cent of this money that's spent on giving out a big tax cut is a cent not spent on cutting waiting lists. If you're somebody languishing in an emergency department for half a day to be seen, you get nothing out of this tax cut; in fact, you'll be waiting for longer. If you're a family who sends their child to a public school and are noticing that those out-of-pocket costs are growing each year, they will continue to grow, at a faster rate, because every cent that goes into the pocket of somebody on a high income is a cent that's not invested in our public schools. It does nothing for mums re-entering the workforce for one or two days a week. It does nothing for a carer who is looking after their elderly parents and can just fit in a few days a week of work. It does nothing for the lowest 40 per cent, but this bill does everything for the investment banker, for the politician, for the CEO and for the partner in a law firm helping their clients to avoid paying taxes.


We've got choices to make. If we want to have tax reform in this country, let's start talking about the real problems that we face. We don't have a tax system; we have a tax avoidance system. Let's start talking about the tax reform that's necessary to close those loopholes that mean the wealthiest Australians and corporations aren't paying their fair share at the moment. Let's introduce a Buffett rule which says to people, 'It doesn't matter whether you've got the fanciest accountants and lawyers in the world; you will be paying a minimum of 30 per cent tax on every cent over $300,000.' Let's look at reforming our tax system. Let's have a PRRT that means that those oil and gas companies, who are currently ripping out Australian resources and not paying a cent of tax on them, start paying for Australian resources, for the things that we all own. Let's make sure that miners who are not paying a cent of excise on the diesel that they use start paying that. If it's good enough for every Australian in the country when they go to the bowser to have to pay a diesel excise, why isn't it good enough for our mining companies? Let's do something about multinational tax avoidance. Let's stop the practice of those big companies lending themselves money from offshore tax havens. Let's make sure we close that loophole by introducing worldwide gearing ratios. There's so much that we could be doing right now to close the loopholes to ensure that the wealthiest Australians, those corporations that aren't paying their fair share right now, pay their fair share, and we wouldn't be having a debate about stripping money away from our schools and our hospitals.


We in the Greens believe unashamedly that now is not the time for income tax cuts. We believe that a decent society is founded on how we look after the most vulnerable people, those people who are struggling, which is why we've made a strong case for increasing Newstart. And we've heard nothing from the government or, indeed, from the Labor Party on that. We don't need a review into Newstart; we need to increase it. Let's make sure that as a nation that is losing biodiversity at a rate greater than almost any other nation on earth we start putting into practice some of the things that we know can help us protect our iconic Australian animals.


We oppose this retrograde package in its entirety because we believe this is going to fundamentally reshape Australian society. This is a nation founded on the notion of egalitarianism, of a fair go, and there's nothing fair about this tax package. When economic inequality is already at dire levels, this is a prescription for turbocharging inequality in Australia. It will leave our schools, our hospitals and our public infrastructure to wither on the vine and it will make Australia a less equal society. It's not a future for this country that I want to see. It's not a future for this country that my colleagues want to see. That's why when this bill comes before this Senate we will be opposing each and every element of it.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Treasury Laws Amendment (Personal Income Tax Plan) Bill 2018</title>,BILLS,3,1
"Hanson, Sen Pauline",PHON,2018-06-20,"



Senator HANSON
 (Queensland) (10:52):  No-one can say that One Nation is responsible for the passage or the fall of the Treasury Laws Amendment (Personal Income Tax Plan) Bill 2018. Everyone in this chamber carries that responsibility. I would like to see families, those hardworking Australians, and resident companies pay less tax, but the question is: can we afford it? The government says we can afford $140 billion of personal tax cuts and $60 billion of company tax cuts over a 10-year period, which means the cost to the revenue base is $20 billion a year, or seven per cent of the income tax base. The government has no plans to reduce wasteful spending, so how will the $20 billion shortfall in taxation income be made up?


In the last financial year, high commodity prices, particularly for iron ore and coal, led to the surprise increase of 22½ per cent in company income tax receipts. The government says these additional taxes are sustainable income in the long term, even though commodity prices go through a boom-and-bust cycle. The government has made a large number of assumptions about future income that in my view are not realistic, and a never-ending commodity boom is but one of them.


I come back to whether the tax cuts proposed by the government, both personal and corporate, are affordable. If they prove not to be affordable then we will see a dramatic decline in frontline services or an increased national debt. It is no accident that in an election year the government wants to rain money down on citizens in the form of tax cuts. There are five by-elections coming up in July and there will be a general election in the next 12 months. In stage 1 of the proposed personal tax cuts, the government promises $10 a week in the form of a tax offset. Labor say $10 a week is an insult. They will up the bid for your vote to nearly $20 a week, but these tax offsets end in four years. A by-election in the electorate of Longman, in Queensland, will take place in July. The citizens of Longman paid $784 million in income tax to the federal government in 2015-16. These taxpayers paid more in income tax than 80 per cent of multinational companies and their Australian subsidiaries, but still the government says we do not have a revenue hole created by multinationals not paying a fair share of tax.


In the past 20 years we have had both Labor and Liberal national governments, and neither party has had the wit or the will to do anything to fill the revenue hole created by foreign-owned companies and their wholly owned subsidiaries. How can the government say there is not a revenue problem when 39 fossil fuel companies operating in Australia pay no tax, and they include our biggest electricity providers, Origin Energy and EnergyAustralia? The two major parties want to tell you they are different, but when it comes to getting multinational companies to pay tax in Australia they are one. We estimate the revenue hole left by non-resident foreign companies operating in Australia to be big enough to pay for the government's proposed tax cuts for individuals and companies.


When we talk about getting multinationals to pay tax in Australia, Labor is like the scarecrow with no brains and the Liberals are like the tin man with no heart, walking down the yellow brick road in search of everything they lack, which is why so many voters give their vote to a minor party. Around 25 per cent of votes are given to minor parties, which reflects the disconnect between the major parties and what concerns Australians. The majority of Australians do not want population growth driven by high levels of immigration and they do not want to pay more tax than they should. The big four banks in Australia pay 25 per cent more income tax than all the multinational companies and their subsidiaries operating in Australia. The biggest corporate taxpayers in Australia are banks and resource companies. The Commonwealth Bank paid $3.3 billion, followed by Westpac, with $3 billion, and NAB, $2.4 billion. ANZ paid $2 billion. The highest amount of tax paid by a multinational was $386 million. How on earth can the government say there is no problem with the conduct of multinationals and their subsidiaries in Australia?


If citizens want a more equitable and fairer society, then multinationals have to pay their fair share of tax, and citizens need to communicate that at the ballot box when they cast their vote. A vote for the One Nation candidate in Longman is a vote for a change in dealing with multinationals, who expect to pay nothing for all the things that allow them to operate profitably in Australia. Voters in every by-election need to tell politicians that being asleep at the wheel on multinational tax is not good enough, and the best way is to give your vote and your preferences to candidates who say they have a viable plan. The average Longman taxpayer paid $12,000 in income tax in 2015-16, while 26 per cent of multinational subsidiaries operating in Australia paid nothing. The list, of 145, includes Chevron Australia Holdings; ExxonMobil Australia; Puma Energy, who operate petrol stations across Queensland; American Express; and Vodafone Hutchison Australia. There is not time to read out the full list, because it is a long list.


The length of the list of multinationals not paying tax in Australia should be a matter of shame to the government and the previous Labor government. I have been talking about non-resident companies failing to pay their tax for over 20 years. I am sick of hearing that the ATO has all the laws and staff it needs, because self-evidently that cannot be the case when fossil fuel companies pay more in political donations than they do in tax.


I have been talking to the government about budget repair since I became a senator. I have told the government at every opportunity that they need to get multinationals and their wholly owned subsidiaries to contribute to the income tax base. I have strongly advocated for reform of the gas taxation system, but the government is not interested. All I can do is make Australians aware of the facts and let them decide whether it is an issue that will help decide which candidate receives their vote. One Nation's policy on multinational tax reform and reform of the gas taxation system is well documented.


It is pleasing to hear now that Senator Di Natale, in his comments today about taxes and multinationals not paying their taxes, has clearly been listening to my comments in the chamber for the last two years and has now picked it up and is running with it, the same as he did with the Australians building the rail line in Queensland to do with the Adani mine. So it's good to hear that he's actually been listening to me and taking up this case.


I supported company tax cuts for businesses with a turnover of up to $50 million, but I will not support further tax cuts for businesses until the government acts to repair the budget through a new tax base from multinational companies. I find myself in a dilemma over whether or not to support the government's Personal Income Tax Plan, which costs more than the extension of the company tax cut plan. I do not understand why the government is so reluctant to fund tax cuts with a new tax base created by getting multinationals and their wholly owned subsidiaries to pay their fair share of tax. I do not understand why the government's plan for personal income tax cuts is so complex.


In stage 1, the tax offset of $520 ends in four years and becomes a tax offset for those on very low incomes. In stage 2, effective in four years time, the threshold amounts in different brackets change. In stage 3, effective in six years time, one tax bracket disappears and the tax rates change. Once the second reading speeches are finished, the Senate will go into committee to debate amendments to this complex legislation. The government does not want to split the three stages of personal tax cuts even though there is broad support for stage 1, starting on 1 July 2018. Tomorrow, senators will be asked to undertake a difficult process not dissimilar to comparing mobile telephone plans.


The government's failure to split the bill into three stages creates a dilemma for me because stage 3 starts in six years time and no-one can predict whether we will be able to afford tax cuts legislated now. My dilemma is that I know Australians are doing it tough. Wage growth is very low. Certain cost-of-living items are rising much faster than wages. People are struggling to pay electricity bills. They manage by going without adequate heating or cooling when needed. Electricity bills are the No. 1 cost-of-living concern for Australians, and that is a tragedy in a country rich in gas and coal.


Labor has come to see me this week to seek support for their position, which is to support stage 1 of the personal tax cuts while increasing the tax offset. Labor tells me that stage 2 of the personal tax cuts should not be supported, because a threshold move will give those on $90,000 to $120,000 a windfall of $1,350 and later, in stage 3, those on $200,000 tax relief of up to $7,000. Do I need to remind Labor that tens of thousands of electricians, plumbers, nurses, secondary school teachers, lift mechanics and welders earn more than $90,000 and will miss out on a permanent tax cut if Labor opposes stage 2 of the proposed Personal Income Tax Plan? These are your voters. These are people who are possibly just on a basic wage. Then they get offered overtime to earn those few extra dollars, yet you are denying those people you are supposed to support: the battlers. And they are the battlers; it's not a fortune that they're making.


Let me also remind this house that the average backbench politician on $200,000 will receive an extra $4,000, but many will get much more because their salaries are much higher than $200,000. How can Labor and the Greens deny these tax cuts to hundreds of thousands of hardworking Australians on taxable incomes from $120,000 up to $200,000 when they have accepted pay rises in excess of six per cent in recent times? Individuals who work in isolated and dangerous workplaces and are highly skilled have taxable incomes much greater than $100,000, and they include 31,998 coalminers. Mining technicians earn an average taxable income of $118,409; 2,706 plant operators earn an average taxable income of $136,985; and 234 pressure welders earn an average taxable income of $107,210.


I challenge Labor, who argue against tax cuts of $1,350 for those on $90,000 to $120,000 in four years time, to reject their minimum wage increase of $4,000 a year from July 2018. Bill Shorten will pocket an increase of over $7,000 from 1 July 2018 but says those who work long hours do not deserve a tax cut of a similar amount. I challenge Labor to set an example and reject the two per cent pay rise awarded by the Remuneration Tribunal last week. Knock back your pay rise, Labor. You don't want to give anyone—



Opposition senators interjecting—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator O'Sullivan
):  Order!




Senator HANSON:
  I was one of six senators in March last year to vote against a pay rise until a budget surplus is delivered. For the record, all Labor senators and the Greens—



Opposition senators interjecting—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  I urge the chamber to come to order. It has been a fairly diplomatic house since I've been here, so I urge the chamber to come to order and allow the senator to present without disruption.




Senator HANSON:
  I was one of the six senators in March last year to vote against a pay rise until a budget surplus is delivered. For the record, all Labor, Greens and Liberal-National Party senators voted for their pay rise in March 2017. So did some of the crossbenchers. Remember, only six senators—and they sat on this side—voted for a pay cut. But those same senators who voted for their pay rise now say it is unaffordable for others to receive a modest tax cut. Hypocrites!


The Australian Greens do not support any of the tax cuts because they feel every dollar is needed by the government—




Senator Urquhart:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. The senator is reflecting on members of this chamber by calling us hypocrites. I would ask that she withdraw that.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  The expressions in this chamber have been far ranging. The senator didn't direct that remark to any person in particular. I don't think there's a point of order.




Senator HANSON:
  Thank you very much, Mr Acting Deputy President. I've had to toughen up in this place; it's a shame others don't do the same. The Australian Greens do not support any of the tax cuts, because they feel every dollar is needed by the government for refugees, the Safe Schools program and subsidies for unreliable energy sources that will drive up electricity prices, and they want to dramatically lift the amount of money helping those in foreign countries. Labor wants to double the foreign aid budget, but the Greens want to almost triple the foreign aid budget to $12.28 billion. They want to give foreign aid, Australia's taxpayers' dollars, to overseas countries. They're not worried about hardworking Australians and giving them tax relief here. They want the money to go overseas—$12.28 billion.


Senator Hanson-Young read the bill and spoke on it, but unfortunately she did not understand it. It's quite funny when the senator makes comments about me. She said that I'm getting a tax cut. No, I'm not. I'm on the same wage as Senator Hanson-Young. The tax cuts are going to be up to $200,000. I'm a very fortunate Australian to be earning more than $200,000. I am paying tax of 45c in the dollar on that. I'm not getting tax relief. To make that comment is to mislead this parliament. I don't think she understands it. If she's really worried about pensioners and the battlers and everyone out there, then I suggest that she flies economy class, like I do, instead of sitting up the front of the plane, at more cost to taxpayers, or taking her child on a taxpayer funded whale-watch—or the overseas trips.


What can I say? That there are people in here expecting Australians not to get a tax cut makes the whole place a joke—yet they don't want to take tax cuts themselves. The whole thing is that hardworking Australians need a helping hand. They need to know that they are going to get something back—that something is being done for them. They are sick and tired of seeing everyone else around the world getting relief—we give foreign aid to everyone. People here are struggling to pay their bills. Because of the Greens in this room, renewable energy is sending up electricity prices and the cost of living. Australians cannot keep going at this rate.


My dilemma is this: yes, we have a black hole, but are we going to fill that black hole? My proposal is to go after the multinationals to pay their fair share of tax in this country and to look after Australians, the hardworking families that need some relief and need help in this country. Yes, suspend taxation and suspend increases in politicians' wages and those of bureaucrats. How can you say to hardworking Australians, 'You can't get tax relief—even the highest amount of up to $7,000 a year,' yet bureaucrats are receiving pay increases of up to $17,000 a year? That doesn't pass the pub test for the Australian people and it doesn't pass the pub test for me.


My job in the Senate is to represent the Australian people to the best of my ability. I will make my vote clear on the floor of the parliament. I will listen to all the amendments that are going to be put up and I will make a decision based on what I think is right for the Australian people.

"Patrick, Sen Rex",CA,2018-06-20,"



Senator PATRICK
 (South Australia) (11:12):  I will be brief in my contribution to on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Personal Income Tax Plan) Bill. At the outset, I can indicate that Centre Alliance will be moving an amendment that omits stage 3 of the income tax cuts. I understand Labor will move an identical amendment. As an alternative to our amendment we will support theirs. Centre Alliance supports the stage 1 tax cuts. Stage 1 involves an end-of-year rebate for low-income earners and raises from $87,000 to $90,000 the income tax threshold to which the tax rate of 37 per cent applies. The combination of the two will return between $135 and $665 to low-income earners, depending on their income. It's our belief that stage 1 will provide much-needed relief for low-income earners.


Centre Alliance will also support the stage 2 tax cuts. These tax cuts are scheduled to commence from July 2022, with the threshold for the 32.5 per cent bracket being lifted from $37,000 to $41,000 and the threshold for the 37 per cent bracket to go from $90,000 to $120,000. This will give tax relief to low- and medium-income earners and to mum and dad professionals, who have worked hard all of their lives and have helped to generate the recent growth we have seen in the economy. They are entitled to enjoy the fruits of their inputs to our economy. Many of the people in this tax bracket are dealing with large mortgages, high electricity bills and a general rise in the cost of living.


As stated, our amendment knocks out stage 3 of the income tax cuts. Stage 3, which is scheduled to start in 2024, abolishes the 37 per cent tax bracket from the system, creating one middle tax bracket of 32½ per cent for workers who earn between $41,000 and $200,000 a year. We're not convinced that this is prudent at this point in time. We also note the distance in time between the passage of this bill into law and when the amendments come into effect. Whilst we are sympathetic to the idea that companies investing large sums of money on projects spanning multiple years, if not decades, may need to know tax rates into the out years, the same can't be said of individuals. So why commit to this law? Why not wait until there is clarity in the budget bottom line in 2022 or 2023 and then change the tax regime for high-income earners?


Having said that, we do reserve our position in regard to the third stage if our amendments are not successful or if an amended bill is rejected in the House, because we do think that low-income and medium-income earners deserve some tax relief.

"Bernardi, Sen Cory",AC,2018-06-20,"



Senator BERNARDI
 (South Australia) (11:16):  I won't delay the Senate unnecessarily, but I do want to get on the record that the Australian Conservatives wholeheartedly endorse and support the government's approach to making personal income tax simpler and fairer in this country. You won't be getting ducks and drakes from us. There'll be no mysterious, 'I'll consider how it's going to come out in the wash.' I entirely support the government's package, because not only is it putting forward tax relief for low-income earners but it maps a pathway of tax relief and some certainty and surety for all taxpayers in this country.


Quite simply, we pay too much tax. Government does not spend our money well enough to maintain the punitive rates of taxation that are impacting the lifestyles of everyday Australian families. It is absurd that our tax brackets are not indexed, that they are not flatter and that more cannot be done to reduce the need for people to pursue tax schemes which are disadvantageous to a great many. For those in this place who say that they want to see capital gains tax changes or changes to negative gearing, I would argue that, if you flatten the tax scales and reduce the need for people to pursue these schemes, the benefits of them to those that are taking advantage will also be reduced. So what we should be doing is looking to lower the tax thresholds across the board to simplify the accounting and taxation affairs for every single Australian.


I also want to make the point, for the class warriors on the other side of the chamber, that about 48 per cent of Australians don't pay any net tax. The burden of taxation in this country is falling disproportionately on those who pay the most tax. That is the simple fact. If you want to reduce the tax burden, we need to reduce it, necessarily, on those that are paying the bulk of it, and we should also be reducing the cost of living and the onerous requirements that government imposes on those who are less fortunate than many of us. You can do that by reducing or taking out the government rorts and attachments that are in our energy industry. You can make our energy more competitive. You can reduce the need for people to pursue negative gearing, as I've touched upon, which will help make housing more affordable. You can reduce the bureaucracy attached to people's employment so that small business is further empowered to employ people and to drive the growth in our economy. They are the simple measures.


We don't need more government. We don't need to give more money to government. We need to get government the heck out of people's lives and let them take some responsibility for themselves. This tax package goes some way to doing that. I endorse it. I wholeheartedly support it. I hope the Senate will do that as well. If they want to have an election based upon one side of parliament putting up taxes and the other side reducing them, I say bring it on, because you will then have a commitment from the Australian people that they endorse low taxes and they think government is not worthy of taking more of their own money.

"McKim, Sen Nicholas",AG,2018-06-20,"



Senator McKIM
 (Tasmania) (11:20):  Here we are engaged in a race to the bottom between the coalition and the Labor Party on personal tax cuts. Anyone would think there's an election in the air—oh wait; there is an election in the air. Within 12 months the Australian voters are going to be choosing who they want to represent them in this place, to be their government, and—surprise, surprise!—the Labor Party and the coalition are engaged in a race to the bottom on tax cuts. This debate at its heart is about what sort of country we want to be. I'm so proud that the Australian Greens senators are the only ones in this place standing up against this unholy race to the bottom on tax cuts and standing up instead for increasing the funding and quality of essential public services in this country: schools, hospitals and public transport; support for people with disabilities; funding for the environment, the fight against climate change, and threatened species; and funding for productive, long-term infrastructure for this country. The Australian Greens want both the Liberal Party and the Labor Party to properly fund those things, not this race to the bottom on tax cuts, which is designed solely to try to solicit votes at the upcoming election.


Over the last two decades in this country there has been a deliberate attempt by the Labor and Liberal parties to pull apart our society. Economic inequality has massively grown because of decisions made by both the Labor and Liberal parties. Taxes have been cut for the big corporate donors to the Labor and Liberal parties. Personal income tax has been slashed, especially for the wealthiest people, while Newstart, which is supporting the people doing it toughest financially, has not been raised for a generation—nearly 25 years. There has been a transfer of wealth from the less well-off to the most well-off, and now the Labor and Liberal parties are proposing to transfer yet more wealth, via these tax cuts, from people doing it tough to people who already have more than their fair share of our national wealth.


There's a stark choice facing the Australian people and this parliament at the moment. On one hand we can continue to run down our schools, hospitals and essential public services; on the other hand we can stand up for increasing the funding and quality of our essential public services. On one hand Labor and Liberal, neither of whom support raising Newstart, can continue to punish the poor to reward the rich; on the other hand the Australian Greens will stand up for people on Newstart. We want Newstart to be increased by $75 a week to give people a fair crack at rebuilding their lives and to help them avoid those impossible choices between putting food on the table, paying the school levies or paying the power bills. We can rebuild our Australian society in line with the values of looking after people doing it tough and of funding an increase in the quality of essential public services, or we can continue in a race to the bottom on tax cuts.


I want to say something to the people of Braddon, who are facing this choice in their upcoming by-election. The choice for the people of Braddon is clear. They could vote for a tax cut that redistributes wealth from those at the bottom to those who already have more than their fair share. Remember, stage 1 of this tax plan will give a tax cut to people who earn $120,000 a year. That means that, if you're in a household with two people lucky enough to be earning 120 grand a year—that is a household that earns in the region of a quarter of a million dollars a year—that household is going to get a tax cut, but the people of Braddon on Newstart are being offered nothing by the Labor and Liberal parties, so they've got a choice. Either they can vote for a candidate—Jarrod Edwards, an outstanding Greens candidate in Braddon—who knows what it's like to do it tough, who was raised in a family on welfare, who knows what it's like to live on Struggle Street, who's campaigning strongly for a legislated increase in the minimum wage and a legislated increase in Newstart, or they can vote for Labor or Liberal candidates who want to give a tax cut to people on $120,000 a year. That's the choice facing the people of Braddon. I urge them to support Jarrod Edwards, the Australian Greens candidate, as the only candidate taking a policy to this election to increase Newstart.


Of course, that would provide a significant economic benefit to Braddon, which sorely needs it. With an increase in Newstart and with an increase in the minimum wage, you would see cash starting to flow more freely through the economy of Braddon, which would help businesses in Braddon—everything from small businesses in the corner shops to small businesses in the manufacturing sector, to people on farms and right through the economy of the north-west coast of Tasmania. The choice for the people of Braddon is very clear. You can vote for Jarrod Edwards and the Australian Greens for an increase in the minimum wage and an increase in Newstart, or you can vote for your Labor or Liberal candidates and vote to give tax cuts to people on $120,000 a year.

Obviously the Treasury Laws Amendment (Personal Income Tax Plan) Bill 2018, which seeks to implement the government's plan to provide income tax relief to hardworking families across Australia, is a very important part of our plan for the economy and jobs to help low- and middle-income earners with cost-of-living-pressure relief but also to provide the right incentive, reward for effort and encouragement to all working Australians. With those few words, I commend the bill to the Senate.

"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2018-06-20,"



Senator WONG
 (South Australia—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (11:46):  I'd like to seek to move some amendments immediately and then make a few comments. Obviously, in the second reading debate we have outlined in detail Labor's approach to this tax package. We've outlined Labor's better, bigger and fairer tax relief for working Australians. We have also indicated that we do not support steps 2 and 3 of the government's plan and the reasons why, so I don't propose to traverse those again.


I would again remind the chamber that, apart from the Australian Greens, as I have discerned, every contribution from senators in this place has supported step 1 of the tax plan. What we are part of at the moment is a debate on a bill where the government is seeking to hold those tax cuts for working Australians—which would start next month—hostage to a tax plan it wants to implement in six years time. There is no logical reason for that, and the Senate ought not to agree to it.


In addition, I want to come to step 3 of the government's tax plan. As I outlined yesterday, we do regard this as both fiscally irresponsible and inherently unfair. It is fiscally irresponsible because, as I outlined in my speech on the second reading, this is a series of changes which grows in terms of its cost to the budget when it comes to fruition, or when it matures, at 12 per cent a year. I made the point in my speech on the second reading yesterday that that is substantially higher than the growth in expenditure we see across other areas of the budget. It is, for example, from memory, some three times faster annual growth than the defence budget and, I think, close to six times faster annual growth than expenditure on family tax benefits and so forth.


What the Senate is being asked to do is to lock in a change to the structure of taxation in this country which will grow over the longer term at 12 per cent per year, thereby either rendering other decisions by government unsustainable or imposing decisions on key expenditure programs by government such as health, education and arguably even defence. If there were an expenditure program that was growing at 12 per cent a year you would hear those on the other side demanding that it be reduced.


I intend to move a range of amendments consistent with Labor's position that I've outlined in the speech on the second reading. What I would like to get to, because I think it is the area where there is most concern in the chamber about the tax plan, is our amendments on sheet 8450 which seek to remove the step 3 tax rate changes and those in later income years. I will move items (4), (6) and (8) together, which remove the step 3 tax rates.


These are the tax rates that the government is seeking to change from 2024-25. What I would say to members of the crossbench and senators in this place is that we have two objections to this. One is a fundamental policy objection. It is a fiscal risk. It locks in a very fast-growing program which costs not only billions of dollars a year but grows at 12 per cent, which has consequences both for the budget and for economic and fiscal risk. It is also a fundamental restructure of our tax system. As I referred, one of the academics who made submissions to the Senate committee talked about this as being contrary to essentially 100 years of progressive taxation in this country. It is the wrong thing to do. I make the third point that it was well made by Senator Storer in his very careful and considered speech on the second reading that there is no reason to allow the government to hold these tax cuts, which would occur in six years time—you would have to elect Malcolm Turnbull twice—and make them a pre-condition of tax cuts which can be delivered next month. That is nothing other than a political strategy. As Senator Storer said:


There is no reason to legislate tax cuts four and six years away except to hold future parliaments to ransom and hold out to voters what may well prove to be false hopes.


The opposition opposes schedule 2 in the following terms:


(4)     Schedule  2 , item  2 , page 14 (starting at line 3) , table dealing with tax rates for resident taxpayers for the 2024-25 year of income or a later year of income to be opposed .

"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2018-06-20,"



Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Leader of the Government in the Senate, Minister for Finance, Special Minister of State and Vice-President of the Executive Council) (11:51):  The government will be opposing these amendments. We obviously believe—in fact, we are confident—that the bill as drafted is in the best interests of all hardworking Australians. It of course prioritises low- and middle-income earners in the first instance, providing cost of living pressure relief to low- and middle-income earners. It then also ensures that we provide the right and appropriate incentive to all working Australians to continue to work hard and ensure that working Australians don't go backwards as a result of bracket creep. Bracket creep is the result, even without moving up the career ladder, of inflation. Our income tax thresholds aren't indexed, which means that, if we do nothing, more and more middle-income Australians will be pushed into the higher and higher income tax brackets, which is a significant disincentive to work harder. It is also recognised as a drag on economic growth. What does a drag on economic growth mean? It means that growth will be less than it could be. A growth that will be less than it could be means that there will be fewer jobs created in the economy. Who hurts the most when there are fewer jobs created in the economy? It's low- and middle-income earners. They are the most exposed to lower growth and they have the most to gain from stronger growth, and there are a lot of economic studies that back that up. 


I would also make the point in response to what Senator Wong has just indicated. This is not an item of government expenditure. This is a decision by the parliament to leave working families around Australia with more of their own money. It's their money. The government should only take as little as possible but as much as necessary to fund the services and the administration of government, which ought to be and must be as efficient and as effective and as well targeted as possible. That is, of course, the commitment of our government. 


Senator Wong says that this somehow completely undermines the progressivity of our tax system. That is completely and utterly wrong. Right now, the top 20 per cent of income earners across Australia have to pay more than 60 per cent of the income tax revenue generated by government. 




Senator Whish-Wilson:
  So they should.




Senator CORMANN:
  'So they should,' says Senator Whish-Wilson. Okay. Guess what happens if we legislate our seven-year plan in full? At the end of that seven-year period, do you know how much the top 20 per cent of income earners will be paying in income tax generated across Australia? More than 60 per cent. So, there's no change to the progressivity of our tax system. You know what will happen if we don't legislate this plan in full? We will be hitting aspirational, hardworking middle Australians harder and harder, and that 60 per cent will become 65, 70, 80 per cent. 


We in this country don't have automatic indexation of our income tax thresholds. That means that just by wage inflation, just by simple inflation, more and more middle-income earners get pushed into the higher tax brackets, where they have to pay more tax on the income they take home. That is not even taking into account the fact that if you work more hours you get penalised. You work more hours; you get penalised by being pushed into a higher tax bracket. So why would you work more hours if working more hours means that you go from 37 per cent to 45 per cent plus the Medicare levy? It is absolutely recognised that bracket creep is a drag on economic growth and that it is absolutely desirable for bracket creep to be addressed in order to ensure that there isn't an entrenched structural disincentive for working Australians to continue to do everything they can to get ahead.


Senator Wong says that this is about binding future parliaments and that Malcolm Turnbull would have to get elected two more times for this to take effect. No, no; that is actually not true. The Senate is able to legislate today the full seven-year plan and give certainty to working families right across Australia that not only will we provide cost-of-living-pressure relief in the short term, prioritising low- and middle-income earners; we also will do everything we can to appropriately address bracket creep so that all working Australians have the right incentive, the right encouragement, the right reward for effort, the right incentive to continue to work hard and to contribute to our great country. They don't have to elect Malcolm Turnbull two more times to lock this in. The Senate is able to lock this in today.


The Labor Party are making an assumption about what future parliaments might want to do. It might well be that the Labor Party want to add further tax increases to their pre-election agenda. Good luck to them! Good luck to them going to the next election promising to the Australian people that they will increase the tax burden on the economy by more than $200 billion, which everybody knows will hurt the economy. It will hurt families; it will cost jobs. The Labor Party is quite entitled to go to the next election with a higher-taxing agenda. We will not go to the next election with a higher-taxing agenda; we will go to the next election with a commitment to keeping taxes on families as low as possible and to ensuring that taxes on business are maintained at a level that is globally more competitive so that all Australians, today and into the future, have the best possible opportunity to get ahead.


Senator Wong also says these tax cuts are not affordable. Yes, they are. Over the medium term the cost is $144 billion, which is a figure that we've openly and transparently released to the public and to the parliament, in sharp contrast to what the Rudd and Gillard governments did when they tried to increase the tax burden on the mining industry. We had to drag them kicking and screaming into releasing the medium-term projections of the revenue they expected to raise from their resource super profits tax and the minerals resource rent tax. We've provided that information quite openly and transparently. And do you know what you can see in the budget papers? What you can see in the budget papers is that over the medium term, over that whole period, not only does the budget get into a small surplus by 2019-20 and progressively into a larger surplus but we are projected to exceed a surplus of one per cent of the share of GDP by 2026-27 and to remain in surplus all the way through—and that is after we have factored in the cost of this important reform which allows working families around Australia to keep more of their own money.


I just close on this point. I'm very interested to see that Senator Wong is moving an amendment effectively to excise the third stage out of our three-stage, seven-year long-term plan. I guess that means that the Labor Party have already given up on actually doing what they said they would do, which is to oppose everything other than the first stage of our seven-year plan. It's very interesting. Normally in this chamber the way this process is managed is that you start off with getting all you want and then you progressively work your way backwards to being forced into the position where, if you can't get everything you want, you aim to get an amendment up that gives you 70 or 60 per cent of what you want.


It's interesting that Senator Wong in her first amendment hasn't even tried to implement the policy of the Leader of the Opposition. It must mean that the Labor Party's split. It must mean that Senator Wong has stabbed Bill Shorten in the back and turned on Bill Shorten, because she's not in here promoting Bill Shorten's policy to actually excise stages 2 and 3. Maybe Senator Wong is a secret supporter of stage 2 of our three-stage, seven-year plan to provide income tax relief to working families around Australia. I'm very intrigued that the first move that Senator Wong makes in this chamber would not be a move to implement the policy that was articulated by the Leader of the Opposition. Is it now the Labor Party position that you support stages 1 and 2 of our seven-year plan to provide income tax relief to working families around Australia? I would be very interested. Is that now your position? It's a very interesting move by Senator Wong here which is in sharp contrast to what Bill Shorten, as leader of the Labor Party, has signalled into the community would be the Labor Party position.


In fact, as the Labor caucus finished and the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow Treasurer gave a press conference yesterday, the indication that the Australian people were given was that Labor would move to remove both phase 2 and phase 3 from this income tax bill. That is not what Senator Wong is doing in her move now. Senator Wong, essentially, has now accepted stages 1 and 2. I congratulate the Labor Party that you've moved along from one to two. There's only one more step to go! Now that you support the first two phases of our income tax relief plan, which is in three parts, I encourage you strongly to reflect on the fact it is very much in our national interests and in the interests of working families around Australia for us to, yes, provide cost-of-living-pressure relief for low- and middle-income earners but also to address bracket creep so that all working families around Australia have the right incentive, the right encouragement and the right reward for effort so the Australian economy can continue to grow as strongly as possible and as many jobs as possible can be created.

Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (12:02):  The Greens have been very consistent throughout this debate that we won't be supporting any elements of this government's tax cuts package; nor will we engage in an arms race or an auction on tax cuts with the Labor Party. We've been very clear all the way through that we believe in services and not tax cuts. Anybody who thinks that you can take $144 billion out of our economy, out of revenue raised by taxes, without savage cuts to—



The CHAIR:  I beg your pardon; sorry, Minister. Are you seeking a point of order?




Senator Cormann:
  Yes. On a point of order: the senator is misleading the chamber. We are not taking anything out of the economy. At best, there is something that comes out of the budget.



The CHAIR:  Minister, that's a debating point, thank you. Please continue, Senator Whish-Wilson.




Senator WHISH-WILSON:
  The Greens as a party believe that government has a strong role to play in the lives of Australian people. We believe that governments and the provision of services are absolutely essential to our quality of life, for caring for people, for looking after the environment. We've always said that. We also believe governments have a role, a collective responsibility, to invest in the Australian people and in the economy through, for example, infrastructure programs. You can't have $144 billion of revenue without an opportunity cost, Senator Cormann—to you, Chair.


Sadly, we haven't had a debate about the opportunity costs of $144 billion. But I do want to pose this question to the Australian people: if you could invest $144 billion, what would you do with it? What this government's doing today and what the Labor Party are doing with their package is simple. They are saying: 'How much is your vote worth at the next election? If you're earning $37,000, $40,000 or $45,000—up to $60,000—we'll give you $1, $2, $3, $4, $5, maybe $10 a week. That's what your vote is worth to us. This is a bribe.' This is an election trick. It is a bribe for the Australian people.


But if you were to say to the Australian people, 'Would you rather your $5 a week was invested back in a world-class education system, a proper healthcare system, a fully funded NDIS, an NBN, a threatened species plan or reducing climate change?' I bet you, London to a brick, that Australians would say: 'That's your job. That's what I elect you for. You invest that money for the future of our society and our kids.' That's what the Australian people would want. That's not the way this question has been posed, but that is fundamentally what we're debating here today.


We've had a very consistent position that we won't be supporting any of these tax cuts. Now is not the time to be cutting revenue—taking revenue and giving it back in tax cuts. What else have we seen cut in recent times? Can any senator in this chamber put their hand on their heart and say that we have enough revenue now to cover our services and fund our needs in society? No. Everywhere we look, this government is cutting funds, and it has been cutting funds since it was first elected. Think back to the zombie budget cuts in 2013-14. Think of the efficiency dividends. I'll list a few things for you, Senator Cormann. Hundreds of millions of dollars were cut from ARENA and $334 million was cut from the ABC, with more to come—there's absolutely no doubt about that. There've been cuts to legal aid funding, the Medicare rebate freeze, billions cut from family tax benefit supplements, cuts to ASIC, cuts to CSIRO, cuts to the environment department, R&D offsets cut, local government grants cut, ATSI Affairs cut—I could go on. We don't have enough revenue at the moment, so why are we taking $144 billion of tax revenue and giving it back in tax cuts, a few dollars a week, to the Australian public, who I'm sure have put us in this place to make sure that tax revenue is properly invested?


So, while we don't support tax cuts at this point in time, we do want to make sure that what we do in this committee stage at least improves the bill in any way, shape or form so that, when it gets to the final vote, we can at least try to get a better outcome for the Australian people. This tax package is not a good outcome. It is a total con. We'll have a lot more to say about this during the continuing committee stage.

Senator HANSON
 (Queensland) (12:08):  I can't let this go unchallenged. I listened to Senator Whish-Wilson and his comments that we want to cut services. He made a list of where cuts have been made. I think the majority of Australians have no doubt that the ABC budget should be cut back, and it has been cut back, to the tune of about $84 million. But let's have a look at the Greens. What they're saying is that they are concerned about services here in Australia. They want to make sure that there are good educational services and good hospital care for the Australian people. Yet, if they had their way, our foreign aid would go up to $12.28 billion. That's not for Australians. That's to go overseas. They're worried about everyone else around the world. They're not worried about the Australian people here. Where's their concern? They are saying that the people here, hardworking Australians, are not entitled to a tax cut because we need the money for services. How can they say that when they're supposed to be here representing the Australian people and yet they're prepared to say they want over $12 billion to go on foreign aid if they had their way? So I think it is not fair to make that comment. They need to start focusing on Australia and the Australian people, because they want to open up the floodgates to 50,000 refugees. Every refugee in this country in detention costs the Australian taxpayer $572,000. That is a huge cost to the taxpayers. They want to start focusing on what is right for this country and the Australian people.


As I said earlier, the Australian people are doing it tough because of extra costs due to the Greens pushing for renewables. That has escalated the cost of living for every Australian. The cost of electricity is out of control. I was just over in England with a delegation. An average family is charged 500 pounds to 600 pounds a year for electricity. An average household here is looking at around $2,000 a year. This is due to the Greens and the Labor Party wanting to raise the cost of renewables and the billions that will be paid to foreign companies. No-one is really addressing this. So stop tinkering around the edges. Be up-front and honest with the Australian people. Give the Australian people some assistance, because that's what they're crying out for. You are obviously not listening to them.

Senator WONG
 (South Australia—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (12:11):  I have just a few very brief points. The first is that these parts we are opposing are in relation to step 3. The government would be aware and the chamber should be aware that we have a range of amendments across step 2 and we are seeking to insert Labor's tax plan. We seek to knock out the tax changes that would apply only from 2024-25. Senator Cormann sought to rebut some of what I said. He said, 'It's not a fiscal risk.' Well, you don't have to take my words for it. Take John Daley's words. His evidence at the Senate inquiry was:


… economically, the chances of a significant economic downturn over the next six or seven years are pretty large …


He also said:


… we do not think it is prudent to be providing tax cuts of this magnitude that far in the future—certainly not to be legislating them …


Second, he said that it's still progressive. Miranda Stewart of the ANU said that these changes are 'both an inefficient and a retrograde step that undermines 100 years of progressive income tax rate structure in Australia'.


And he said that they're fair. The ANU's Ben Phillips has estimated that the effect of the government's plan is as follows: the top 20 per cent of taxpayers will see a 2.2 per cent rise in their income and the bottom 20 per cent will see a 0.2 per cent rise in their income. So the top 20 per cent of Australian taxpayers get more—a 2.2 per cent rise—and the lowest 20 per cent of Australian taxpayers get 0.2 per cent. Guess how much of this government's tax package will go to the top 20 per cent of households in Australia by 2027? Sixty per cent. I urge the chamber to support our proposal.



The CHAIR:  We are dealing with amendments (4), (6) and (8) on sheet 8450, as opposed by the opposition.

Given our substantial debt challenge—$341 billion net debt in 2017-18, and growing—it is irresponsible to proceed with the full income tax plan proposed by the government at this point in time. The measures commencing in 2022 and 2024 lock in over $120 billion in reductions in revenue out to 2028-29. By Treasury's own admission, uncertainties generally tend to increase as the forecast horizon lengthens; therefore, there are larger error bands around estimates three, four or more years ahead. The geopolitical and economic uncertainties noted by Treasury in budget estimates in May demand the government prepare by focusing on debt and deficit reduction as well as maintaining essential services. We are in a substantially weaker budgetary position now than we were in 2007 in the lead-up to the GFC. There's no need to rush these changes that commence in 2022 and 2024. They are well beyond the scope of the forward estimates and the next election. There will be ample time between now and then for parliament to re-examine the appropriateness of these measures and decide whether to proceed with the additional elements of the government's plan.


History tells us that tax cuts, once legislated, are very difficult to wind back; therefore, we cannot rely on an assumption that these cuts could be repealed or amended if unforeseen economic developments materialised. In the context of a recent uplift in government revenue, the measures set to commence from 1 July 2018 are affordable. Given rising cost-of-living pressures and wage stagnation, the new low- and middle-income tax offset is particularly warranted and should be locked in to provide lasting targeted support to low- and middle-income earners beyond the forward estimates. With that extension, information received from the Parliamentary Budget Office indicates that the amended plan I am putting forward would cost $46.75 billion compared with the $143.95 billion for steps 1, 2 and 3 of the government's plan as it stands, and $102.35 billion for steps 1 and 2. The amended proposal I am putting forward of $46.75 billion generates savings that would help us return to surplus sooner, pay down debt quicker and free up money to spend on critical social and infrastructure programs, and I hope that it meets with the approval of the chamber.

"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2018-06-20,"



Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Leader of the Government in the Senate, Minister for Finance, Special Minister of State and Vice-President of the Executive Council) (12:24):  The government will not be supporting this amendment. We will be opposing this amendment. This amendment proposes to keep taxes around $100 billion higher than the government's plan over the medium term. I have to correct Senator Storer: it's not a saving; it is an increase in taxes compared to what the government is proposing to do.


The government believes in lower taxes because individuals should be rewarded for working hard and be encouraged to get ahead. The government's Personal Income Tax Plan will make personal income tax lower, fairer and simpler. Without action, the tax system will increasingly penalise Australians for earning more as they move into higher tax brackets. This is why the government does not support the amendments proposed by Senator Storer.


The government's plan will simplify and flatten the tax system, reducing the number of brackets from five to four by completely removing the 37 per cent marginal tax rate so that hardworking Australians keep more of what they earn. Senator Storer's amendments would mean that by 2024-25 taxpayers on an average full-time wage would still face a marginal tax rate of 37 per cent. The government's plan rewards these hardworking Australians by removing the 37 per cent marginal rate and will ensure that most Australians will face a marginal tax rate no higher than 32.5 per cent for their whole working life. Under the government's plan, around 94 per cent of taxpayers are projected to face a marginal tax rate of 32.5 per cent or less, compared with the 63 per cent if we leave the system unchanged.


The plan is a package and the government is legislating the whole package. We're committed to giving certainty to Australian families that they will keep more of what they earn in the future. Step 2 of the plan will have to ensure that incomes earned by Australians are protected from bracket creep. It helps to ensure that a pay rise, extra overtime or working more hours do not get eaten up by higher taxes. Step 3 of the plan will make the personal income tax system simpler and flatter by completely removing the 37 per cent tax bracket. By sticking to our plan for a stronger economy, the government is returning the budget to surplus and guaranteeing the essentials.


Because a stronger economy delivers more revenue to the budget, we are able to afford our Personal Income Tax Plan. It is affordable and fiscally responsible. The plan is fully accounted for in the forward estimates and over the medium term fiscal projections, with the underlying cash balance returning to balance in 2019-20 and sustained surpluses thereafter over the medium term. The government is committed to a tax system that rewards effort and promotes opportunity, that is internationally competitive, that is capable of driving stronger investment and stronger growth for our economy and where, above all, all individuals and businesses pay their fair share so the government can deliver the essential services Australians rely on.


In relation to the observations on the fiscal position of the budget, the return to surplus in 2019-20 and continuing projected surpluses over the medium term will, of course, enable a reduction in debt. As a result of living within our means, the government has turned the corner on debt. We're no longer borrowing for our day-to-day living expenses as a government. Net debt, as a share of GDP, is expected to peak at 18.6 per cent of GDP in this 2017-18 financial year. It's projected to fall to 14.7 per cent by 2021-22 and to 3.6 per cent at the end of the medium term. The gross debt will also peak in 2019-20 at below 30 per cent of GDP. Over the medium term gross debt will fall and be $126 billion less in 2027-28 than was estimated in the MYEFO last December, six or seven months ago. I should also say that government net debt is forecast and projected to reduce by $30 billion over the current forward estimates and $232 billion over the medium term. This reduction in debt has been achieved through careful management of the nation's budget, with the average annual real expenditure remaining below two per cent, which is the lowest of any government in the last 50 years, while delivering much needed tax relief to hardworking families and investing to further strengthen our economy and deliver a more prosperous future for all Australians.

Senator HANSON-YOUNG
 (South Australia) (12:28):  I just want to draw people's attention to the fact that we've just seen Senator Pauline Hanson, Leader of One Nation, in here voting to give herself a massive tax cut. I want to be really clear about this, because Senator Hanson was in here only an hour or so ago saying, here on the Hansard record during this debate, that she would not be getting any tax cut if this bill passed. Can you believe it? She's either got no idea what on earth she's voting on or she's lying to the Australian people and she's misleading the Senate. Let's crunch the numbers. Let's find out exactly how much Senator Pauline Hanson is going to get from this tax cut: an $11,815 tax cut. That's how much Senator Pauline Hanson has just pocketed for herself. That's what she's just voted for. She's just voted to feather her own nest. She came in here and lied to the Australian people. She lied to One Nation voters. She said she wasn't getting a tax cut at all. What a fraud.




Senator Cormann:
  Point of order: Senator Hanson-Young is using unparliamentary language directed at a fellow senator and she should withdraw.



The CHAIR:  Thank you, Minister. Senator Hanson-Young, I ask you to withdraw those remarks, without repeating them—without using the terms that you used in relation to Senator Hanson.




Senator HANSON-YOUNG:
  Which words were they? I didn't call her a liar. I said she lied.



The CHAIR:  Nevertheless, I'm asking you in the spirit of good debate to withdraw the comment.




Senator HANSON-YOUNG:
  I didn't actually refer to her as a liar, even though I think she probably is. I said she lied.



The CHAIR:  Senator Hanson-Young, this is not a debating point. I am asking you to withdraw those comments.




Senator HANSON-YOUNG:
  I would like a ruling on this, because I did not call her a liar. I said she lied to the Australian people.



The CHAIR:  Senator Hanson-Young, as Chair I am asking you to withdraw those comments. Is there a further point of order?




Senator Gallacher:
  Yes, Madam Chair. Yesterday I was present in the chamber when Senator Macdonald repeatedly stated: 'Labor lies, Labor lies,' ad infinitum. So, if we're going to raise this point, I think we have to be consistent across the chamber.




Senator Cormann:
  On the point of order: it is clearly against standing orders to reflect on senators in this chamber and to impute improper motive. That is what Senator Hanson-Young has been doing.



The CHAIR:  In response to you, Senator Gallacher, in my view it is clear that Senator Hanson-Young has reflected on a fellow senator. On the broader issue, when parties are referred to, I too was concerned about that and I raised it and sought advice. In my view there has been a reflection on a senator. Senator Wong.




Senator Wong:
  Chair, I make a couple of points. I understand Senator Gallacher's frustration. We get a lot of 'lying' accusations from the other side. I think your ruling is correct. If you look at precedents, past Presidents have ruled that an assertion that a group is lying doesn't have the same status as an assertion that an individual senator is lying. I personally don't quite understand the distinction but, as I understand the advice, that appears to be a distinction that has been observed—the former has been permissible and the latter hasn't. I would implore Senator Hanson-Young to recognise the Chair's request.




Senator Whish-Wilson:
  On the same point of order: my understanding of the standing orders is that the context of how things are said is important, in terms of rulings. Senator Hanson-Young didn't say that Senator Hanson deliberately lied. She said she lied. It may have been inadvertent or it may have been deliberate; we don't know. In that sense, I'd ask you to reflect on the fact that she didn't say she deliberately lied.



The CHAIR:  Senator Whish-Wilson, I am attempting to uphold the standing orders and the spirit of debate. I think we can have a spirited debate without reflecting on, or coming very close to reflecting on, what may or may not have motivated other senators. I have asked Senator Hanson-Young to withdraw her comments. In consideration of open, and yes, robust debate, I would ask her to withdraw those remarks.




Senator HANSON-YOUNG:
  In the spirit of the discussion, I will withdraw those comments and I will say this: Pauline Hanson's One Nation party came in here and lied to the Australian people, because their leader is getting an $11,815 tax cut and she, Senator Pauline Hanson, pretended in this place that she's not going to bank it. Senator Pauline Hanson is a fraud.



The CHAIR:  Senator Hanson-Young, please resume your seat. Minister.




Senator Cormann:
  On a point of order: Senator Hanson-Young is misleading the chamber because she's making an assumption that, by 2024-25, Senator Hanson is still going to be a senator—



The CHAIR:  Minister, that is not a point of order.




Senator Cormann:
  She's clearly very confident that Senator Hanson—



The CHAIR:  Minister, please resume your seat. That's a debating point, which you are free to debate next time you stand.




Senator HANSON-YOUNG:
  The important point here is that Senator Pauline Hanson has no idea what on earth she's voting on and what her party is voting on today, because she came into this chamber and she said that these tax cuts don't affect anybody who earns more than $200,000.




Senator O'Sullivan:
  Why don't you get back to the substantive debate?




Senator HANSON-YOUNG:
  That is what Senator Hanson put to this chamber earlier today. So either Senator Pauline Hanson and One Nation have no idea what on earth they're voting on today or they want to cover it up and keep the Australian people and their voters in the dark. It'll be up to the voters to decide whether they think they're being misled or whether, in fact, Senator Pauline Hanson just has no idea what on earth is going on in this place.

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Leader of the Government in the Senate, Minister for Finance, Special Minister of State and Vice-President of the Executive Council) (12:37):  What I would say is what I've said before: this is a very important, long-term plan to provide the right incentive, the right encouragement and the right reward for effort to hardworking families around Australia. We have a long-term plan to provide income tax relief to families around Australia which prioritises low- and middle-income earners. Over the next four years, the benefit goes to low- and middle-income earners. What I would say to the Senate and what I would say to the Greens is that I would draw the attention of the Greens to the fact that the value of the personal income tax cut for low-income earners is significantly higher than the value, as a percentage, for people at the higher income end.




Senator Rice:
  As a percentage!




Senator CORMANN:
  Senator Rice laughs: 'Ha, ha! As a percentage.' 'As a percentage,' Senator Rice says, 'Oh! Oh!' So let me just explain to the chamber what this means. This means that, if they earn $30,000 a year, the value of our proposed personal income tax cut is a reduction of 8.3 per cent in their tax, an 8.3 per cent cut in their tax, in 2018-19, in 2019-20, in 2020-21 and—yes, you guessed it—in 2021-22. And do you know what happens to somebody on $200,000 in that period? Do you know what happens to somebody on $200,000 in the years 2018-19, 2019-20, 2020-21 and 2021-22? The value of the small proportion of the personal income tax cut that flows through to the higher income earners, because we are lifting the threshold from $87,000 to $90,000, is 0.2 per cent—0.2 per cent!


Do you know how much tax somebody who earns $30,000 a year pays? They pay $2,197. I'm really sorry that we can't cut the tax for somebody who pays $2,197 in tax by $5,000! I'm really sorry! Not even this government can cut the tax for somebody who pays $2,197 by $5,000. That is not physically possible. But do you know how much tax somebody who earns $200,000 pays? They pay $67,097. So somebody who earns $30,000 a year pays $2,197, and somebody who earns $200,000 a year pays $67,097. And do you know what? In 2018-19 the percentage of cumulative tax relief is 0.2 per cent, in 2019-20 it is 0.2 per cent and in 2021-22 it is 0.2 per cent.


It's great to see that the Greens have great confidence in the competitiveness of Pauline Hanson's One Nation and the Greens are very confident that Pauline Hanson's One Nation will secure Senate seats in the election after next. We're going to have an election next year. We're going to have another election in 2022, which is when Senator Hanson will be up for re-election, and clearly the Greens have given Senator Hanson their vote of confidence today. Senator Hanson-Young today has expressed a clear, strong and unambiguous vote of confidence that Senator Hanson will be re-elected at the 2022 election. That is the implication of what Senator Hanson-Young has been saying—that outrageous slur that she has directed at Senator Hanson, one of our fellow senators in this chamber.


Let me just explain further to all Australians who might be listening. If you are earning $50,000 a year, you will get, under this package that we are proposing to legislate today, a 6.2 per cent tax cut every single year over the next four years. If you are earning $80,000 a year, it'll be a lesser tax cut, but you're still getting a 2.8 per cent tax cut. So the point is: the more you earn, the lower the value of the tax cut. Obviously, if you pay more tax in nominal terms, in nominal terms it is inevitable that a small—




Senator McAllister:
  Nothing about this is inevitable; it's a series of choices.




Senator CORMANN:
  Hang on. So here we have Senator McAllister having just stabbed her leader in the back, because she's just voted against Labor Party policy. Yesterday, out of the caucus came the Labor Party, including the Leader of the Labor Party and the shadow Treasurer, and they said, 'We will move to remove phases 2 and 3 of this long-term tax relief plan. Well, guess what: Senator McAllister has just voted in support of both stages 1 and 2, in complete conflict with the stated Labor Party position. She doesn't even realise that she has voted that way. Senator McAllister just shakes her head. Well, that is precisely what you've done: instead of putting your preferred position forward in front of the Senate chamber today, instead of coming in here with a policy that your Labor caucus allegedly adopted and trying to get majority support for the position that you adopted, you came in here with a position of another party. So clearly, somewhere overnight, the Labor Party position has shifted. Yesterday you only supported stage 1 and you were opposed to stages 2 and 3. Today you have voted—including you, Senator McAllister—for stages 1 and 2. That is the reality of it.



Senator McAllister interjecting—




Senator CORMANN:
  Are you saying that you did not vote in favour of stages 1 and 2? You did. That is the implication. The implication of supporting the removal of stage 3 only is that you are now supporting stages 1 and 2. It makes absolutely no sense for you not to have tried to get your policy tested in the Senate. You didn't test it in the Senate. You did not even try. Yesterday, with lots of fanfare, there were Bill Shorten and the shadow Treasurer, Chris Bowen, saying, 'We are opposed to stages 2 and 3.' But here you're coming in now and endorsing stage 2. You're endorsing it. Senator Wong is shaking her head. That is precisely the implication of what the Labor Party has done in the chamber here today. The Labor Party has now shifted from just 1 to 1 and 2. If we keep this debate going for a bit longer, I'm sure that Labor will come all the way with the Liberal and National Party coalition to 1, 2 and 3. Try it! One, then 1 and 2; if we keep going a bit longer—we know that Bill Shorten is the wibble-wobble man—we get to 1, 2 and 3. Just go back to the Labor caucus. Say, 'We've already rolled over on our opposition to stage 2. We have voted for an amendment that locks in stage 2.'


Progress reported.

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2018-06-20,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (09:33):  When I left off my contribution last night, when the adjournment intervened, I was talking about how I would spend the $26 billion a year of tax cuts in the areas of my portfolio. I realise that other senators also have priorities for their portfolios, but I am focusing on my portfolios. I went through issues about Newstart, reparations for the stolen generations and making sure that we have adequate housing in remote communities. I'd also make sure that we were properly addressing redress for those affected by institutional sexual abuse and making sure the cap was $200,000, for example, instead of the $150,000 which was in the legislation that passed this place yesterday. I'd also make sure that we had adequate services in emergency departments for people suffering from a mental health crisis. I'd also make sure that grants for organisations delivering vital services in our communities were indexed so that community organisations weren't suffering a reduction every year in the funding and services they could provide. I'd make sure that Centrelink actually worked and that we had a functioning system where people actually answer the phone and calls are answered the first time people ring.


We Greens would increase the minimum wage by 60 per cent. I reckon that's a much better way of spending the money this government is spending on these tax cuts. And, from the feedback that we have had, Australians would prefer that's the way the money was spent. They would prefer that we were delivering good, strong public services rather than funnelling this money to the big end of town. We need to address inequality in this country. We need a poverty plan, not a plan to make the wealthy even wealthier, which is what these tax cuts do. Most people won't benefit at all. The rich will get even richer. The fact is the majority of the benefits flow to the top 20 per cent of income earners. We have a plan to make the rich richer. We don't have a plan in this country to address poverty. Three million Australians are living in poverty and 3.6 million Australians do not have food security, according to the latest Foodbank report. We have people living in poverty, and the people that are most vulnerable are those trying to get by on the inadequate payment of Newstart and the youth allowance. We have people who are trying to survive below the poverty line, but the government's argument is: 'They're not really in poverty. The Anderson line and the poverty line are just an indication.' The research shows that there's a very good correlation between the poverty line and the expression of the poverty line as a measurement and the deprivation measures and deprivation structures. The research finds there's a good correlation between those in deprivation and where those poverty line measurements are.


The government likes to play fancy with words to imply that those on Newstart are doing relatively okay, thank you very much, because those poverty lines not a very good indication. But we know they are a good reflection of those suffering from various measures of deprivation, such as how often they've eaten, what they can buy to send their children to school with and whether their children are missing out on going to school because they don't have the necessary resources and supports to be at school. Those measures of deprivation are reflected well in the poverty line. The government also says, 'Those living on Newstart get other benefits.' But we know that, for the vast majority of those receiving the Newstart allowance, the main additional payment is the energy supplement, which is a whole four bucks a week. Hurray! They could go out and buy a cup of coffee. And that's the very measure that the government wants to take away and still has on the books to take away. In terms of the so-called supplementary income for income support payment recipients, as I've just said, the only payment received by the majority of people is the energy supplement, and we all know the government plans to cut that. Thirty-eight per cent of people receiving Newstart do receive rent assistance because they pay private rent. The maximum rate for single adults without children is $67 a week. In what we know is an unaffordable rental market, that goes very little way to being able to pay rent. Anglicare does a study every year about access to housing. From their recent study, we know that three properties out of 67,000 nationally were affordable for a single person on Newstart receiving rent assistance. So it is just a joke that the government thinks that rent assistance goes anywhere near addressing the need for affordable housing or making sure people aren't living below the poverty line. 


The Salvation Army reported a couple of weeks ago that their latest study has found that, when you take out the cost of accommodation, those on Newstart have $17 a day to try and survive on. Again, I renew my challenge to those on the other side of the chamber to try living on Newstart, even for a week. A week gives you a taste of what it's like to try and survive on Newstart. Other additional payments, such as family tax benefit, are only received by 19 per cent of the people on Newstart—again blowing a massive hole in the government's argument that those living on Newstart really aren't living below the poverty line and there's no need to increase Newstart. The family tax benefit is actually to help parents raise their children. 


There is only one job available for every eight people looking for paid work. Two-thirds of people receiving Newstart are having to rely on the allowance for 12 months or more. When this payment originally came in, when we were calling it the dole and other previous names, it was about people being temporarily out of work for around six weeks, and people could survive on the payment for that length of time. That situation, of course, has changed. So many more people are having to rely on Newstart for much longer, work is not as readily available and there is much more active age discrimination against older workers trying to find work. And we all know the appalling statistics for young people who are unemployed. We used to talk about this affecting people in their early 20s. Now we're talking about those over 25 being unable to find permanent full-time work; they're more likely to be in temporary or part-time work. So our work situation is much more precarious than it used to be. People need to rely much more on income support. 


We also know living in poverty is a barrier to employment. We know that many people on Newstart have a number of vulnerabilities. Due to cuts from the Howard government, the Rudd-Gillard government and then the Abbott government, people with disability applying for the disability support pension have not been able to access it, and there's been an active push by this government, started by Mr Abbott and followed by Mr Turnbull, to try and kick more and more people off the disability support pension. Rather than enable them to remain on the disability support pension and improve their prospects of finding work, they are being actively assessed to kick them off the disability support pension. So they're living on the poorer payment of Newstart while they're trying to find work. This all adds up to a mess, where we have hundreds of thousands of Australians living below the poverty line while they are trying to survive on Newstart. 


Because of the way the government chose to index Newstart, it has not adequately kept pace with the true cost of living. It is not indexed the same as the age pension, so it has fallen further and further behind. The money that is being given away to the big end of town should be spent on those people that are living below the poverty line, that are trying to find work on Newstart, on youth allowance and on other payments. That's where we should be focusing that money.


We should invest in the services that support Australians, as I articulated earlier. We have a commitment in this country to universal service. The Greens are deeply committed to universality to ensure that we have a health system and an education system, and a social security safety net that truly is a social security safety net. That's where we should be spending the money that the government is giving away to the big end of town. As I said, the majority of it's going to the top 20 per cent of income earners. That money is not addressing inequality in this country; in fact, it will be driving inequality. Instead of focusing on those on the very lowest incomes, the government's saying, 'Big end of town, work on the trickle-down effect.' We in Western Australia know very well, from when we had the mining boom, that that money does not trickle down to those on the lowest incomes.


Let's remember a little bit of history. I was in this place when John Howard decided before the 2007 election that he would hand out money hand over fist for tax cuts. Let's have a quick look at where that ended up. Mr Rudd came in and continued with those tax cuts. Then we had the GFC, but those tax cuts were in place. That largesse was still in place. Instead of spending that money on services that would have better supported those who would be most affected by the GFC or by a downturn from good economic times to bad economic times, those tax cuts were allowed to flow through. Then we got to Mr Abbott, who came in and slashed the social security safety net—he absolutely slashed it—and came up with a brilliant idea: 'Oh! We'll force young people to wait six months before they can access Newstart or youth allowance.' Fortunately, this Senate stopped that ridiculous plan. It would not support that ridiculous plan. The government also took half a billion dollars out of funding for Aboriginal services. This can be related directly back to the fact that they gave away all that money in tax cuts. Now we're seeing a slight increase in revenue, and the government rushes to give it away. 


And what does the ALP do? It wants tax cuts that are 'bigger, better and fairer'. I don't know where the ALP came up with the term 'fair' in terms of tax cuts, when they are not supporting an increase to the most vulnerable people in our community, those who are struggling on Newstart, on youth allowance, on the age pension and on disability support pension. Those are the people that we need to be supporting not only through an increase in Newstart and an increase in youth allowance but by making sure that we are addressing and supporting the services that really will make a difference in people's lives.


The 10 richest families in Australia own as much wealth as the poorest four million Australians combined. Three million of those poorest Australians are living below the poverty line. As I said, 3.6 million, part of those four million, are suffering from food insecurity, and yet what does this government want to do? It wants to hand over more money to the wealthiest in this nation, to those earning the highest incomes. We Greens say no, that is not good enough. We need to make sure that we are funding Australians who need the support, and we do that by making sure that we can fund Newstart and youth allowance, that we can fund those most in need. 


How about we have a redress scheme for those children who were in institutional care but suffered other forms of abuse, such as physical and mental abuse, who still have not received reparations and who will not be able to access the counselling services under the National Redress Scheme—limited though they are, because they're not lifelong services? How about a redress scheme for those survivors, for those care leavers? Many of them were brought to this country by our government, were subjected to abuse and have not received redress. How about spending some money on them? How about providing services that all the community wants?


When you ask Australians if they want public services or tax cuts, they'll tell you they want public services. They want to make sure that they and their children can access a top-quality education system. They want to make sure that they can get health services when they need it. They want to be able to ring Centrelink and the Department of Human Services and get the information they want without having to keep dialling and dialling. They want a social security net for when they fall on hard times. I want to be able to look in the faces of people with disability and say that our country can provide them with the support and services they need, instead of demonising them and making them jump through all sorts of hoops, trying to find work for 18 months before they can access the disability support pension. That's not the country I want to live in. (Time expired)

"Pratt, Sen Louise",ALP,2018-06-20,"



Senator PRATT
 (Western Australia) (09:51):  We've heard a lot from the government so far in this debate about their tax plan making things more fair; however, it's very clear to Australians, because they're fair-minded people, that there's nothing fair about the 2018 budget or about the Treasury Laws Amendment (Personal Income Tax Plan) Bill 2018. What most people think is fair in this nation is a greater sense of equity and equality. For example, when there are two people at a football match, and one can see over the fence and the other can't, it's not fair to keep them both standing on the ground; it's fair to give the short person a leg-up and put them on a box so they can see. That is the principle of progressive taxation. Fairness is about levelling the playing field for people.


What we have in this budget is big business and the banks getting an $80 billion tax handout, which will be paid for with cuts to our schools and hospitals. In this bill the flattening of the progressive nature of our tax system would give high-income earners in our country a much higher benefit than lower income earners. Here we have it again for all to see: high-income earners and big business are the true priorities of the Turnbull government. Under the proposal the government has put forward, 62 per cent of the benefits would go to higher income earners while just seven per cent would go to the 30 per cent of Australians on the lowest wages. Why would you do that? Are you insane? Do you not care about the working poor in our nation?


This bill continues to demonstrate how out of touch this government is with the reality of Australians' lives and in particular the people doing it toughest. This bill also demonstrates a government that is prepared to risk the budget bottom line—our capacity to pay down debt, to pay for services, to have a good Defence Force and to bail ourselves out of bad times—so it can hand out tax cuts to big business and top-income earners while doing very little for middle-income households. Whilst those opposite will argue that they're flattening the tax system, making it fairer, and that lower income households are getting a tax cut, it's a much smaller tax cut in dollar terms than the one for those who are already substantially much better off.


In our current economic climate, we should have a government that's concerned about workforce participation, concerned about lack of wage growth and concerned about increasing the disposable income of targeted households as a way of boosting consumer spending. It's very clear that this government is not interested in that. What happens when you boost the incomes of higher income households? They invest more. They save more. These are worthy aspirations, but, when you put income into lower income households, they spend it and stimulate the economy, and everyone benefits. Investing more when you are on a higher income is all very well, except that people are accumulating wealth, in many instances, above and beyond that which ordinary Australians will ever be able to see or access in their own lives.


Under the coalition, we see the cost of living set to increase. Workers in the retail, food and accommodation industries are losing up to $77 a week in penalty rates. We see families and pensioners paying around $20 a week or more, or about $1,000 a year, for private health insurance. We see parents paying more for child care—$40 a week, or $2,000 a year, more in fees. And we see record costs to visit a GP—on average, about $9 more every time you visit a doctor. These are the reasons why Labor is very prepared to support the government's proposed changes that are set to take effect on 1 July—those tax cuts that are targeted at people who need them. Labor will support tax cuts for 10 million people on 1 July, and we are ready to vote for those tax cuts today.


If Labor is elected, we want to double these tax cuts and make them permanent, while asking those in the top tax bracket to pay a little more to help reduce debt. People in the top tax bracket, relative to people in the lower tax brackets, still have the resources to pay for their accommodation and pay for their retirement. Labor's bigger, better, fairer income tax will see those earning up to $125,000 a year better off when compared to Malcolm Turnbull's plan for the next four years.


It is simply absurd to us in the Labor Party that someone on $200,000 a year should pay the same tax rate as someone on $40,000 a year. It is unfair and absurd. So we don't agree with the Turnbull government giving more tax cuts for the top bracket—and this is after the Turnbull government cut the tax rate for high-income earners just last year. The idea that a corporate executive or a politician on $200,000 a year should pay the same marginal tax rate as a worker earning close to the minimum wage, on a salary of about $41,000, strips away every shred of progressiveness in our taxation system. Yet, absurdly, this government is trying to pull the wool over Australians' eyes—and I don't think they will fall for it—to sell the idea that this is a tax cut for ordinary Australians. It's not a tax cut for teachers, police, cleaners or aged-care workers. It's a tax cut for the high end of town, for well-paid professionals, who will have a high standard of living relative to others without a tax cut. That's why Labor will move amendments in the Senate to the Treasury Laws Amendment (Personal Income Tax Plan) Bill 2018 to ensure the passage of tax cuts starting on 1 July.


We will seek to implement better, fairer tax cuts through Labor's tax refund for working Australians. This would double the tax relief up to $928 a year. It will mean that the 57,000 people in Canning, the 63,000 people in Forrest and the 65,000 people in Moore will receive an increased tax refund. However, what we've seen is the Turnbull government's tax cuts overwhelmingly benefit wealthier electorates. So it's not surprising to me that this government has seen tax cuts that overwhelmingly benefit inner Melbourne and inner Sydney electorates, but it is of great concern and a disgrace that Mr Andrew Hastie and the Turnbull government are not standing up for the people of Canning—the good, hardworking people of Mandurah, Pinjarra and Byford and all those across the Canning electorate. As I move around Canning, I talk to constituents about their struggle to make ends meet and the fact that they juggle numerous jobs just to earn a modest income. They will tell you how they're overworked and underpaid or struggling to find enough work to get by. People who are struggling to find enough work to get by deserve a better, bigger tax cut than the high end of town because they rely on every cent of what they earn just to get by. There's no rational reason to take the same amount of tax out of their income as is taken out of my or your much higher incomes.


We see that up to 70 per cent of taxpayers will be better off under Labor's fairer tax plan, and that includes 57,000 residents who live in Canning. Seventy per cent of the hardworking taxpayers in Mandurah, Pinjarra and Byford will be better off under our tax plan. And I suppose the Prime Minister does try to help, in his own way, when he says, 'They should just get a better job.' Try telling that to every single cleaner, storeperson, shop assistant, orderly, retail worker or hospitality worker. We need people to do these jobs. We need them to have incomes that keep those industries viable. They need good wages. We need to see wages growth in those industries. We know those industries will never see wages growth that compares with wages growth for high-paid professionals, but we need them to do those jobs. Why do you rub people's faces in their own professions in that way? We have to value the work that Australians do, because it needs to be done. Every day, in our communities and in our cities, we depend on the great diversity of work that people do, be it well paid or low paid. People on low wages should get better pay, but the simple fact is, because they are on lower wages and we need people to do that work, we should not, in our right mind, ever consider taxing them at the same rate as wealthier Australians. The absurdity of it is absolutely disgusting.


In our nation, inequality is at a 70-year high. We should be taking steps to do exactly the opposite of what the government is doing, and that is taking steps to improve and address inequality and to remove inequality in our system by using our tax and transfer system and implementing principles that are exactly the opposite of what this government is seeking to do.


With overall inequality worsening, there are negative impacts on our economic growth. The best thing we can do to fix that is to have a strong, progressive taxation system where those who can afford to pay more do pay more and those who can't afford to pay as much aren't asked to pay as much. We need a government that stops standing in the way of tax relief for the 10 million Australians who need it. We need a more progressive taxation system, not a less progressive one. Tax cuts this year for teachers and tradies should not be held hostage to tax cuts for bankers or highly-paid professionals in six years time.


The Turnbull government's priority is for tax cuts for big business and high income earners, at a stupendous cost of $25 billion a year in 10 years time. I don't think our nation can afford that—our schools and hospitals can't afford it, our TAFE system can't afford it, our social services can't afford it, our public sector can't afford it and our defence force can't afford it. The fabric that holds our community together simply cannot afford it.


Labor, on the other hand, because we're not giving millionaires another tax cut and we're not giving big business an $80 billion tax handout, can put more money into the pockets of working Australians while funding better schools and hospitals and paying down debt quicker. This bill will make our tax system in Australia less progressive and it will continue to erode our tax base. It doesn't deserve the paper it's written on.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,3,2
"Hanson-Young, Sen Sarah",AG,2018-06-20,"



Senator HANSON-YOUNG
 (South Australia) (10:07):  I rise today to contribute to this debate on a tax cut for millionaires, put forward, of course, by the Turnbull government. The whole essence of this debate on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Personal Income Tax Plan) Bill rests on what types of priorities we have in this place and on what types of priorities we have for the nation. On one side we have the Turnbull government wanting to spend hundreds of billions of dollars—taxpayers' money—in tax cuts for the big end of town, in addition to the tax cuts they've already flagged and have tried to push through this place already in relation to corporate Australia and the big banks. Malcolm Turnbull's priority is to look after the big end of town—to look after the corporates, the big banks and rich, wealthy Australians. Meanwhile, everybody else is going to cop a cut in access to public services.


That is the choice here. It's about priorities. Malcolm Turnbull wants to fund the billionaires and the big banks but those of us trying to stop these tax cuts from going through are asking: 'What happens when regular Australians need to go to hospital? What happens when someone's kid is sick? What happens when you rock up to school and you realise your public school is charging families school fees up to $4,000 to send their children to public schools, because we don't have money for the education system? What happens when a mother can't go back to work because childcare is too expensive?' These are the choices that we are being presented with in this bill today.


The government can only spend and invest money based on what it collects. We know that we don't just have a tax problem here. We have a problem with collecting the right amount of tax, because tax avoidance in this country, particularly from the big end of town, is rife. If you're a big corporate bank and if you're in corporate Australia, you can find many, many ways to reduce your taxable income. If you're a rich Australian, you can find the best accountant in the country to make sure you pay no tax at all. Meanwhile, average Australians are struggling day by day, and they rely on public essential services right around the country.


If you collect less tax as a government, you're going to have less money to spend on public services. If we have less revenue, that fundamentally undermines the ability of governments to do what they need to do, and that is to underpin essential services that are available to everybody—schools, hospitals and the broader health system—and to ensure that, if you lose your job and you're on unemployment benefits, Newstart payments are enough to live on so you can be supported until you get another job, not punished by living on less than $40 a day just because this government wants to prioritise giving millionaires $7,000 back. That's what's on the table here. Someone on an average income is perhaps, if they're lucky, going to get around $200 in a tax cut. And yet the wealthy Australians, the millionaires and, in fact, the politicians—those of us in this place—will get $7,000 out of this. That must be pretty galling to people out there listening to this debate.


We're told by the neoliberals on the other side that, despite being a wealthy nation, we can't afford things like proper funding of hospitals, or to ensure our elderly are taken care of in their aged-care homes, or for schools to be funded properly so parents don't have to fork out thousands of dollars just to send their kid to a public school. We're told we can't afford these things, and yet hundreds of billions of dollars in this package today are going to roll out the door in election bribes by this government.


The neoliberals on the other side have done a very good job at trying to hoodwink the Australian people. Although we are a very wealthy country, the neoliberals have done everything they can to undermine and run public essential services into the ground. They want to give people a false choice: you can choose between Malcolm Turnbull's handout to millionaires or you can choose to fund public services. Spending, of course, is all about priorities, so is revenue and so is where we collect our revenue from. This government finds many, many ways to undermine the bare collection of revenue, because they don't want to upset their big mates in the banks, in corporate Australia or, indeed, in the rich end of town. This government says to average Australians and those who are struggling living on the median wage: 'We can't afford to help you, if you fall through the cracks. It's 40 bucks a day from Newstart if you lose your job. Suck it up.' No. That is not a choice we should be forcing Australians to make.


If you turn up to university in this country, you should be able to access a good-quality education, regardless of how much money is in your parents' bank account and regardless of what private or public school you may have attended. We need more young people, not fewer, being able to access good-quality higher education, whether it's through universities or the TAFE sector. That means we have to fund education properly. We have to make it available and accessible for all, not just for those whose parents are on the top of the rich list and are going to bank a $7,000 tax cut out of this and their kids will be okay. We need all Australian children to access good-quality education and know from a very early age that if they want to go on to university or TAFE they'll be supported in doing so. We should make that a guarantee. Every Australian child should know that if they want to get a higher education they can get one; they shouldn't have to be in the top income bracket to do it.


This is what making government spending priorities is all about. Australians overwhelmingly know that the trade-off, or the dividend, of paying their taxes should be good quality public services. Australians don't mind paying tax if it means having good quality schools and being able to access the emergency ward in the hospital if someone falls over and breaks their hip or if a child is sick in the middle of the night. Australians don't mind paying taxes if they know that they're going to go to a well-funded NDIS. Australians don't mind paying their taxes if they're going to have a strong Medicare safety net. Australians know that being part of a decent democratic society is all about having the people who can afford to pay a bit more pay a bit more so that those who are struggling can be helped to get back on their feet.


A progressive taxation system is essential for the fair and decent society that we are all proud to live in here in Australia. That is under attack from this legislation and agenda of the government because all they care about is looking after the big banks, the rich end of town and Malcolm Turnbull's mates. If the Prime Minister really cared about productivity growth in this country, he'd fund child care properly so that more women were actively supported to go back to work. But what we will see come 2 July is a bunch of families losing access to their childcare support, particularly those families where both parents struggle to be in the workforce.


The absolute lunacy of this tax bill is that it spends hundreds of billions of dollars as an election bribe, yet the majority of Australians who work hard every day and those who struggle to get into the workforce, those on unemployment benefits, really get nothing from this. No wonder Malcolm Turnbull's mates want this to pass, because they're going to bank $7,000 from it. Meanwhile, average Australians and the rest of the country will lose out because hospital waiting lists will grow, because school fees will rise and because our older Australians will continue to suffer in old aged-care homes.


Look at my home state of South Australia. We know that the overwhelming majority of the tax cuts outlined in this bill are going to go to those who are already the most well-off, those who are earning well above $120,000 a year. That's about five per cent of South Australians. So five per cent of South Australians might get something out of this, but 95 per cent of South Australians will get very little. In fact, there will be a double whammy because our state relies significantly on well-funded essential public services. As a result of this priority choice by this government to fund the rich and cut services most South Australians will lose out. By the time the full impact of these tax cuts is realised, South Australia will be losing around $2 billion from essential services—that's cuts to schools, that's cuts to hospitals and that's cuts to other essential services. Bad luck if you need to put your kid in child care so that you can take an extra day of work a week. You won't be able to afford it, because the Turnbull government isn't going to be able to fund child care in this country. 


Our universities and TAFEs are going to lose funding. They'll be $105 million worse off. We'll lose $305 million in spending on hospitals and health care. We can't afford that. We have an ageing population, particularly in South Australia, and we want to make sure our older Australians are looked after with dignity and with care. Yet the government is going to slash $305 million in funding used to support essential health care in South Australia. 


We'll lose $905 million on pensions and payments, and this is a very clear message to the people of Mayo—those South Australians who live in the Adelaide Hills and down along the Fleurieu Peninsula down to Victor Harbor. This tax cut for Malcolm Turnbull's mates is going to cost age pensioners and other recipients of government funding almost a billion dollars! How are we going to look after our aged and elderly Australians if we don't have the money to fund it? But who will be laughing? It'll be Malcolm Turnbull's mates, who are banking $7,000 a year. I guess that's a nice overseas holiday. 


The government says: 'Look, don't worry about it. Everyone'll be paying less tax.' The reality is most Australians rely on public services to ensure that we can get through our daily lives. We all respect our well-funded public hospitals and health system. We all know that we need a public education system to ensure that there is a proper safety net, to ensure that our kids can go to school and get a good education, regardless of whether their parents have a job at the time or how much money their parents have in their bank account. In South Australia, these tax cuts mean that for every dollar that is given in a tax cut, South Australians are going to lose $1.40 in public services. On anyone's maths, that's a lose-lose. 


South Australia loses massively in this bill, and that's a message I have for the members of Centre Alliance here today. Don't buy this government furphy. You've got a choice here: tax cuts for millionaires and Malcolm Turnbull's mates, or funding for South Australian schools, hospitals and services. As one of the smaller states and as one of the states with the lowest number of high-income earners in the country, South Australia loses out significantly under this bill. As a South Australian senator, I'm standing here today to say: do not risk it. Do not buy the furphy that you have to hand politicians a $7,000 tax cut in order to make everybody else feel okay. We don't need the $7,000 tax cut. What we need is more money for schools, more money to cut hospital waiting lists, and more money to ensure that working mums and dads in the electorate of Mayo actually can access well-funded child care. That's what we want the government to prioritise. 


I say to the Centre Alliance members in this place today: don't buy the lie that you should just tick this tax cut through. Does anyone really believe that if we start giving tax cuts to the big end of town, to politicians, to Malcolm Turnbull's millionaire mates—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Kitching
):  Senator Hanson-Young, I will remind you—




Senator HANSON-YOUNG:
  Does anyone believe if we start giving tax cuts to the big end of town, to Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull's millionaire mates, that anyone is going to come in here after the next election and rescind any of this? I don't believe the Labor Party's going to do that, and I certainly don't believe the Liberal Party will ever do that. Don't be fooled, I say to senators Griff and Patrick of the Centre Alliance. Once this tax cut is in, it will stay. Don't risk it.


On that, I want to point out the sheer hypocrisy of Pauline Hanson and One Nation in relation to all of this.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Hanson-Young, again, if you could—




Senator HANSON-YOUNG:
  I think it's absolutely important to understand the sheer hypocrisy of the One Nation party, led by Senator Hanson. Supporting this bill means supporting rich Australians, millionaires, and doing nothing for those battling on average incomes. This gives money to the richest and wealthiest Australians at the expense of funding for the age pension and funding for hospitals. This final stage of the tax cut does absolutely nothing for 60 per cent of taxpayers in this country. We have Senator Hanson snuggling up to the government again, selling out the majority of Australians—all of her voters—to tick off on what is going to be the biggest tax cut given to millionaires in a long, long time. Senator Pauline Hanson is going to vote for this bill to give herself a $7,000 tax cut! What a grub! What a sneaky, sneaky move! What a sellout!



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Hanson-Young, I would remind you of the standing orders. Perhaps 'grub' was not particularly parliamentary. I'd ask you to withdraw that.




Senator HANSON-YOUNG:
  Thank you, Madam Acting Deputy President. I withdraw calling Senator Pauline Hanson a grub. I'll replace it: Senator Pauline Hanson is going to come into this place to vote to give herself a $7,000 tax cut—sheer hypocrisy! What an absolute sellout! 


This tax cut will do nothing to lift wages. We know we have a wage-growth issue in this country. This tax cut will do nothing to help people on Newstart or, indeed, the minimum wage. What this proves, and what Senator Pauline Hanson and One Nation's deal with the government proves, is that they're all about feathering their own nests and doing nothing to help regular Australians!

"O'Neill, Sen Deb",ALP,2018-06-20,"



Senator O'NEILL
 (New South Wales) (10:27):  I too rise to put my remarks on the record with regard to this very important proposed piece of legislation, the Treasury Laws Amendment (Personal Income Tax Plan) Bill 2018. This bill has the potential to have a significant and profoundly negative impact on Australians, as it is constructed by this government. 


I find that we hear once more—in the throes of the drama and intensity of these last two weeks of sitting before we go to another break—the government saying: 'This has got to be done now. This has got to get sorted now. On 1 July, the whole world's going to fall apart unless we get this resolved.' The pressure, right now, as I am making this contribution to the debate, is being applied to the crossbench, some of whom—or their advisers—I hope might be listening to my contribution. I want to point out how important it is that everyone understands that the Treasurer himself has conceded that the legislation does not need to be in place by 1 July for the tax relief that's being discussed to be received by the end of next financial year. That's the reality. This pressure cooker that's being created is an artifice. In this hastily constructed pressure cooker, we shouldn't be making decisions that would affect people six or seven years hence with such negative consequences, in my view, for our economy and, more profoundly, for our community.


We're being faced with a choice by this government, with its litany of failures in service provision, between continuing along the path that it has set of taking away more and more services from Australians and throwing money, a little bit of money, at those who need it most and extraordinary sums at people on $200,000, who are not clamouring at the doors of this place saying: 'Give me $7,000. I can't survive without it.' That is not the challenge that is facing us in this parliament. The challenge is people clamouring at our doors, day in, day out, asking for the funding of basic services. There are over 100,000 Australians right now who are seeking aged-care packages. They're desperate for some help in their home so they can stay there. They're desperately in need. I see Senator Brown has joined us in the chamber here. People are trying to get decent services for disability needs. People are speaking to me in my role as the assistant shadow minister for mental health, despairing about suicide in their community and being unable to access services.


That's the landscape: the service deprivation that has been imposed upon this nation by this government over five years of ripping money out of the services that Australians should have a right to expect. And having done that now, its grand plan, in addition to having abandoned any sense of fiscal responsibility and budgetary constraint, is to try and buy off Australians by throwing some tax money at them in an entirely inappropriate and unfair way. That's why Labor will oppose the way in which this government wants to advance tax reform in this country.


Budgetary decisions are all about choices, and Labor is going to choose services for all and tax cuts for those who need it most. It contrasts profoundly with the government's proposal of giving tax cuts of a shape and form that six years from now—when kids in year 7 have finished high school—in 2024 will deliver a tax structure where 80 per cent of the benefit will flow to the top 20 per cent of wage earners in this country. If I only repeated that fact over and over and over in my contribution, if only that single fact could seep into the conversation about this proposed tax reform by the government, Australians would understand what a dog they're being sold and how cruel and unfair this government's proposal is. The bottom 60 per cent of all workers will get no tax benefit at all by 2024, if this government's bill passes as it is. That's the shape and form of what we're discussing here and why the debate that we're having is so important.


This government's Personal Income Tax Plan demonstrates exactly how out of touch this government is. We as the Labor Party do not support someone on $200,000, which is the standard pay for most of the people who work in this parliament, paying the same tax rate as someone on $40,000. That is plainly unfair. We've seen this over and over in the course of this Liberal-National Party government with the prioritising of the top end of town over ordinary Australians; the prioritising in terms of tax where the cost is not just a lack of income benefit to low- and middle-income earners but the ongoing removal of services and the ongoing cuts to services absolutely across the horizon, if it gets this piece of legislation through. 


I want to have a little bit of a look at a distributional analysis. If we look at the impact of this government's decisions, we can see that it has failed to provide any form of a distribution analysis of its Personal Income Tax Plan. But Labor and interest groups have, and it's very clear that stages 2 and 3 of the proposed tax reform by this government absolutely and totally fail the fairness test. Let's be absolutely clear here: stages 2 and 3 of the government's tax plan will flatten out Australia's personal income tax system, and that structural change to the personal income tax system is eroding its progressivity. This is a fundamental principle of our tax system, and it's based on the premise that, if you earn a small amount of income, pretty well everything that you earn goes to keeping a roof over your head, providing food, providing shelter and providing for the basics, but as you go up the tax scale, with those things accommodated, there is an increase in your capacity to contribute to the general wellbeing of the community and to pay a bit more tax so that we have decent hospitals and schools that are properly funded, where parents can send their children through the gates of any school in the country and know that there'll be readers for the kindergarten kids to read from and paper and resources for teachers to creatively engage with young people in high school. We trust that our tax dollars, invested on a slightly higher scale by those with a bigger income, benefit our entire community.


I can tell you from this morning, when I was at the Kids' Cancer Project breakfast, that no-one in that room thinks there's adequate funding going into the prevention and treatment of cancer for young people. They were there asking the government, the opposition and anybody who would listen to hear their pleas for further investment in proper research capacity. The reality that we face right at this moment in our country is a choice between Labor and a Liberal government who have no commitment to decency, to fairness or to equity. The attempt to force this inequitable piece of legislation through the chamber should be abandoned.

"Di Natale, Sen Richard",AG,2018-06-20,"



Senator DI NATALE
 (Victoria—Leader of the Australian Greens) (10:37):  These tax cuts are saying to Australians that whatever government might be providing for you at the moment is more than you need. Whatever you receive at the moment, whether it be an education in a public school, treatment in a public hospital, using public transport or, indeed, some sort of family assistance payment, it's too much. You're already getting too much, because what the Treasury Laws Amendment (Personal Income Tax Plan) Bill 2018 does is strip away vital public revenue from those essential services.


This bill, more than most of the other bills that come through this place, is going to help determine what sort of country we want to create. We've got some big choices ahead of us: we can choose to continue down the path of the Liberal and National parties to a dog-eat-dog world where everyone's in it for themselves and we shrink public services, or we can create a different sort of world, where we collectively come together, understand that we're in this together, invest in our people and ensure that no person languishes for months on a waiting list and that every young child gets access to the best possible education they can get—a world where we have publicly owned infrastructure that provides all of the vital services that people need and where we have a strong social safety net so that no-one's left behind. That's the sort of future we can create. It's not a utopian dream; it's actually within our grasp here. It's just about the choices that we make in this chamber.


We've been told by politicians of all stripes for more than a decade that Australia can't afford to do these things—that we can't afford to increase Newstart, tackle climate change or protect the threatened species that exist in this continent and are disappearing at an alarming rate. In fact, we're going to do worse; we're going to cut the jobs of the people responsible for looking after the precious biodiversity in this island continent of ours. And we're now hearing a debate where the premise seems to be, 'My tax cut's bigger than your tax cut.' Some $144 billion is going to be taken out of public services. We're told that the reason for this change is to address bracket creep, yet wages are at an all-time low. This bill's not about bracket creep. It's about shrinking the size of government and the public services that follow from that, and it's about making sure that people who need a little bit of help don't get that help.


We've got some choices ahead of us. We know that healthcare costs are increasing. We know that our education system needs more support. We know that our infrastructure is failing. We can afford to invest in all of those things. We could have a world-class public health system so that no person in this country languishes on a public waiting list. We could make sure that every child in the country gets access to a world-class education and, indeed, that those people who choose to send their child to a public school don't have to spend a cent out of their own pocket. We could build cities and regions that create no net pollution. We could preserve our planet for future generations to enjoy while they prosper. We can start restoring our environment, rather than destroying it.


And at the heart of this debate is a lie. We're told that income taxes are too high, but the reality is very, very different. Australia is, by all indicators, a low-taxing country. When you consider our total tax take as a proportion of GDP compared to other similar OECD countries, we do very well. We're a low-taxing country. Yet we're told again that we have to reduce taxes, and the consequences of that are alarming. Our Public Service is already so badly decimated that it can't answer the phone when you call to find out why it's cancelled your pension or a family assistance payment. Past governments have spent the last two decades privatising government. We've got big corporates enjoying all of the upsides and everyday people getting stuck with all of the downsides. You only need to look at the announcement today from Telstra. Do you remember when Telstra was privatised? 'Better services. People will be looked after. We're going to save money.' There are 8,000 people today who don't know how they're going to be able to put food on their table. Yet we've got no-one in this place who's got the political courage to stand up and say: 'We don't need tax cuts. We need investment in services. We need to look after people. We need to raise Newstart. We need to start protecting our environment.' No-one has had the courage to stand up and do that apart from my colleagues in the Greens, and I want to thank each and every one of them for it.


These are financially reckless tax cuts. They're going to punch a $23 billion hole in the budget annually. If you look at stage 3 alone, they're going to grow by 12 per cent each year. It's completely unsustainable. We can't afford it. We know what the costs are. And we all know that, when it comes to issues like global warming, housing, student debt or work security, it's not going to be the people in this chamber who are going to have to deal with those issues; it's going to be the generations that come after us. It's going to be young people today who are going to be lumbered with the costs of this decision that we make in this chamber. We know that these tax cuts are a prescription for turbocharging inequality in Australia. When stage 3 kicks in, someone on the minimum wage will be paying the same rate as a bank executive or a politician. That's not a progressive tax system. It's taking us down the US route.


And, of course, like the Turnbull cabinet itself, the big winners are men, and women get a few scraps, with less than one-third of the top-end tax cuts. We've seen some analysis today from Professor Miranda Stewart at ANU, who has added more evidence of just how discriminatory against women these tax cuts are. You have to be working full time to get the benefit, yet 45 per cent of women work part time. For men, it's only 16 per cent. And 61 per cent of women caring for a child under the age of five are working part time, while for men it's only eight per cent. If you look at the interaction between these tax cuts and the new childcare payment starting next month, the research shows that a mother wanting to work a few extra days would get to keep just $4,000 if she earnt $27,000 in additional income. If you're a young mother not earning a high wage, you face an effective marginal tax rate of between 85 per cent and 95 per cent. Professor Stewart's conclusion is that we'd be better off investing the tax cut money into universal child care. Now there's a ripping idea which benefits women so they can live the lives they want to lead and doesn't hand out tax cuts which largely benefit men.


Of course, the Treasurer's been deceptive in selling the benefits of this tax cut to senators and the public: $82,000 isn't the normal wage; it's the average salary of a full-time working bloke. The median wage of all Australians is around $54,000. Under even stage 1 of this tax cut, you can be a family with a combined income of just under $250,000 and you'll get a tax cut. The benchmark that the government's using, of a regular worker on 82 grand, is only a quarter of the workforce. Three-quarters of the workforce earn less than that. This plan's too focused on wealthy Australians. It does nothing for ordinary people. I reckon that if the majority of Australians—by definition, those earning less than $54,001, so, anyone under the median wage—knew they were getting nothing in exchange for having their local schools and hospitals completely gutted, people in this place might reconsider. Let me be clear about that: there will be a few dollars a week in the pocket of somebody who's a childcare worker, a nurse or a teacher and, under stage 3 of this plan, an extra $7,000 for CEOs, politicians and bank executives.


This bill does nothing to address the concerns of the most vulnerable people in our community. People on Newstart or on a pension get nothing out of this bill—not a cent. If you're somebody who can't afford to take out private health insurance to jump a queue and you're languishing on a waiting list for a year to have your hip replaced, you get nothing out of this; in fact, you'll be waiting for longer, because every cent of this money that's spent on giving out a big tax cut is a cent not spent on cutting waiting lists. If you're somebody languishing in an emergency department for half a day to be seen, you get nothing out of this tax cut; in fact, you'll be waiting for longer. If you're a family who sends their child to a public school and are noticing that those out-of-pocket costs are growing each year, they will continue to grow, at a faster rate, because every cent that goes into the pocket of somebody on a high income is a cent that's not invested in our public schools. It does nothing for mums re-entering the workforce for one or two days a week. It does nothing for a carer who is looking after their elderly parents and can just fit in a few days a week of work. It does nothing for the lowest 40 per cent, but this bill does everything for the investment banker, for the politician, for the CEO and for the partner in a law firm helping their clients to avoid paying taxes.


We've got choices to make. If we want to have tax reform in this country, let's start talking about the real problems that we face. We don't have a tax system; we have a tax avoidance system. Let's start talking about the tax reform that's necessary to close those loopholes that mean the wealthiest Australians and corporations aren't paying their fair share at the moment. Let's introduce a Buffett rule which says to people, 'It doesn't matter whether you've got the fanciest accountants and lawyers in the world; you will be paying a minimum of 30 per cent tax on every cent over $300,000.' Let's look at reforming our tax system. Let's have a PRRT that means that those oil and gas companies, who are currently ripping out Australian resources and not paying a cent of tax on them, start paying for Australian resources, for the things that we all own. Let's make sure that miners who are not paying a cent of excise on the diesel that they use start paying that. If it's good enough for every Australian in the country when they go to the bowser to have to pay a diesel excise, why isn't it good enough for our mining companies? Let's do something about multinational tax avoidance. Let's stop the practice of those big companies lending themselves money from offshore tax havens. Let's make sure we close that loophole by introducing worldwide gearing ratios. There's so much that we could be doing right now to close the loopholes to ensure that the wealthiest Australians, those corporations that aren't paying their fair share right now, pay their fair share, and we wouldn't be having a debate about stripping money away from our schools and our hospitals.


We in the Greens believe unashamedly that now is not the time for income tax cuts. We believe that a decent society is founded on how we look after the most vulnerable people, those people who are struggling, which is why we've made a strong case for increasing Newstart. And we've heard nothing from the government or, indeed, from the Labor Party on that. We don't need a review into Newstart; we need to increase it. Let's make sure that as a nation that is losing biodiversity at a rate greater than almost any other nation on earth we start putting into practice some of the things that we know can help us protect our iconic Australian animals.


We oppose this retrograde package in its entirety because we believe this is going to fundamentally reshape Australian society. This is a nation founded on the notion of egalitarianism, of a fair go, and there's nothing fair about this tax package. When economic inequality is already at dire levels, this is a prescription for turbocharging inequality in Australia. It will leave our schools, our hospitals and our public infrastructure to wither on the vine and it will make Australia a less equal society. It's not a future for this country that I want to see. It's not a future for this country that my colleagues want to see. That's why when this bill comes before this Senate we will be opposing each and every element of it.

"Hanson, Sen Pauline",PHON,2018-06-20,"



Senator HANSON
 (Queensland) (10:52):  No-one can say that One Nation is responsible for the passage or the fall of the Treasury Laws Amendment (Personal Income Tax Plan) Bill 2018. Everyone in this chamber carries that responsibility. I would like to see families, those hardworking Australians, and resident companies pay less tax, but the question is: can we afford it? The government says we can afford $140 billion of personal tax cuts and $60 billion of company tax cuts over a 10-year period, which means the cost to the revenue base is $20 billion a year, or seven per cent of the income tax base. The government has no plans to reduce wasteful spending, so how will the $20 billion shortfall in taxation income be made up?


In the last financial year, high commodity prices, particularly for iron ore and coal, led to the surprise increase of 22½ per cent in company income tax receipts. The government says these additional taxes are sustainable income in the long term, even though commodity prices go through a boom-and-bust cycle. The government has made a large number of assumptions about future income that in my view are not realistic, and a never-ending commodity boom is but one of them.


I come back to whether the tax cuts proposed by the government, both personal and corporate, are affordable. If they prove not to be affordable then we will see a dramatic decline in frontline services or an increased national debt. It is no accident that in an election year the government wants to rain money down on citizens in the form of tax cuts. There are five by-elections coming up in July and there will be a general election in the next 12 months. In stage 1 of the proposed personal tax cuts, the government promises $10 a week in the form of a tax offset. Labor say $10 a week is an insult. They will up the bid for your vote to nearly $20 a week, but these tax offsets end in four years. A by-election in the electorate of Longman, in Queensland, will take place in July. The citizens of Longman paid $784 million in income tax to the federal government in 2015-16. These taxpayers paid more in income tax than 80 per cent of multinational companies and their Australian subsidiaries, but still the government says we do not have a revenue hole created by multinationals not paying a fair share of tax.


In the past 20 years we have had both Labor and Liberal national governments, and neither party has had the wit or the will to do anything to fill the revenue hole created by foreign-owned companies and their wholly owned subsidiaries. How can the government say there is not a revenue problem when 39 fossil fuel companies operating in Australia pay no tax, and they include our biggest electricity providers, Origin Energy and EnergyAustralia? The two major parties want to tell you they are different, but when it comes to getting multinational companies to pay tax in Australia they are one. We estimate the revenue hole left by non-resident foreign companies operating in Australia to be big enough to pay for the government's proposed tax cuts for individuals and companies.


When we talk about getting multinationals to pay tax in Australia, Labor is like the scarecrow with no brains and the Liberals are like the tin man with no heart, walking down the yellow brick road in search of everything they lack, which is why so many voters give their vote to a minor party. Around 25 per cent of votes are given to minor parties, which reflects the disconnect between the major parties and what concerns Australians. The majority of Australians do not want population growth driven by high levels of immigration and they do not want to pay more tax than they should. The big four banks in Australia pay 25 per cent more income tax than all the multinational companies and their subsidiaries operating in Australia. The biggest corporate taxpayers in Australia are banks and resource companies. The Commonwealth Bank paid $3.3 billion, followed by Westpac, with $3 billion, and NAB, $2.4 billion. ANZ paid $2 billion. The highest amount of tax paid by a multinational was $386 million. How on earth can the government say there is no problem with the conduct of multinationals and their subsidiaries in Australia?


If citizens want a more equitable and fairer society, then multinationals have to pay their fair share of tax, and citizens need to communicate that at the ballot box when they cast their vote. A vote for the One Nation candidate in Longman is a vote for a change in dealing with multinationals, who expect to pay nothing for all the things that allow them to operate profitably in Australia. Voters in every by-election need to tell politicians that being asleep at the wheel on multinational tax is not good enough, and the best way is to give your vote and your preferences to candidates who say they have a viable plan. The average Longman taxpayer paid $12,000 in income tax in 2015-16, while 26 per cent of multinational subsidiaries operating in Australia paid nothing. The list, of 145, includes Chevron Australia Holdings; ExxonMobil Australia; Puma Energy, who operate petrol stations across Queensland; American Express; and Vodafone Hutchison Australia. There is not time to read out the full list, because it is a long list.


The length of the list of multinationals not paying tax in Australia should be a matter of shame to the government and the previous Labor government. I have been talking about non-resident companies failing to pay their tax for over 20 years. I am sick of hearing that the ATO has all the laws and staff it needs, because self-evidently that cannot be the case when fossil fuel companies pay more in political donations than they do in tax.


I have been talking to the government about budget repair since I became a senator. I have told the government at every opportunity that they need to get multinationals and their wholly owned subsidiaries to contribute to the income tax base. I have strongly advocated for reform of the gas taxation system, but the government is not interested. All I can do is make Australians aware of the facts and let them decide whether it is an issue that will help decide which candidate receives their vote. One Nation's policy on multinational tax reform and reform of the gas taxation system is well documented.


It is pleasing to hear now that Senator Di Natale, in his comments today about taxes and multinationals not paying their taxes, has clearly been listening to my comments in the chamber for the last two years and has now picked it up and is running with it, the same as he did with the Australians building the rail line in Queensland to do with the Adani mine. So it's good to hear that he's actually been listening to me and taking up this case.


I supported company tax cuts for businesses with a turnover of up to $50 million, but I will not support further tax cuts for businesses until the government acts to repair the budget through a new tax base from multinational companies. I find myself in a dilemma over whether or not to support the government's Personal Income Tax Plan, which costs more than the extension of the company tax cut plan. I do not understand why the government is so reluctant to fund tax cuts with a new tax base created by getting multinationals and their wholly owned subsidiaries to pay their fair share of tax. I do not understand why the government's plan for personal income tax cuts is so complex.


In stage 1, the tax offset of $520 ends in four years and becomes a tax offset for those on very low incomes. In stage 2, effective in four years time, the threshold amounts in different brackets change. In stage 3, effective in six years time, one tax bracket disappears and the tax rates change. Once the second reading speeches are finished, the Senate will go into committee to debate amendments to this complex legislation. The government does not want to split the three stages of personal tax cuts even though there is broad support for stage 1, starting on 1 July 2018. Tomorrow, senators will be asked to undertake a difficult process not dissimilar to comparing mobile telephone plans.


The government's failure to split the bill into three stages creates a dilemma for me because stage 3 starts in six years time and no-one can predict whether we will be able to afford tax cuts legislated now. My dilemma is that I know Australians are doing it tough. Wage growth is very low. Certain cost-of-living items are rising much faster than wages. People are struggling to pay electricity bills. They manage by going without adequate heating or cooling when needed. Electricity bills are the No. 1 cost-of-living concern for Australians, and that is a tragedy in a country rich in gas and coal.


Labor has come to see me this week to seek support for their position, which is to support stage 1 of the personal tax cuts while increasing the tax offset. Labor tells me that stage 2 of the personal tax cuts should not be supported, because a threshold move will give those on $90,000 to $120,000 a windfall of $1,350 and later, in stage 3, those on $200,000 tax relief of up to $7,000. Do I need to remind Labor that tens of thousands of electricians, plumbers, nurses, secondary school teachers, lift mechanics and welders earn more than $90,000 and will miss out on a permanent tax cut if Labor opposes stage 2 of the proposed Personal Income Tax Plan? These are your voters. These are people who are possibly just on a basic wage. Then they get offered overtime to earn those few extra dollars, yet you are denying those people you are supposed to support: the battlers. And they are the battlers; it's not a fortune that they're making.


Let me also remind this house that the average backbench politician on $200,000 will receive an extra $4,000, but many will get much more because their salaries are much higher than $200,000. How can Labor and the Greens deny these tax cuts to hundreds of thousands of hardworking Australians on taxable incomes from $120,000 up to $200,000 when they have accepted pay rises in excess of six per cent in recent times? Individuals who work in isolated and dangerous workplaces and are highly skilled have taxable incomes much greater than $100,000, and they include 31,998 coalminers. Mining technicians earn an average taxable income of $118,409; 2,706 plant operators earn an average taxable income of $136,985; and 234 pressure welders earn an average taxable income of $107,210.


I challenge Labor, who argue against tax cuts of $1,350 for those on $90,000 to $120,000 in four years time, to reject their minimum wage increase of $4,000 a year from July 2018. Bill Shorten will pocket an increase of over $7,000 from 1 July 2018 but says those who work long hours do not deserve a tax cut of a similar amount. I challenge Labor to set an example and reject the two per cent pay rise awarded by the Remuneration Tribunal last week. Knock back your pay rise, Labor. You don't want to give anyone—



Opposition senators interjecting—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator O'Sullivan
):  Order!




Senator HANSON:
  I was one of six senators in March last year to vote against a pay rise until a budget surplus is delivered. For the record, all Labor senators and the Greens—



Opposition senators interjecting—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  I urge the chamber to come to order. It has been a fairly diplomatic house since I've been here, so I urge the chamber to come to order and allow the senator to present without disruption.




Senator HANSON:
  I was one of the six senators in March last year to vote against a pay rise until a budget surplus is delivered. For the record, all Labor, Greens and Liberal-National Party senators voted for their pay rise in March 2017. So did some of the crossbenchers. Remember, only six senators—and they sat on this side—voted for a pay cut. But those same senators who voted for their pay rise now say it is unaffordable for others to receive a modest tax cut. Hypocrites!


The Australian Greens do not support any of the tax cuts because they feel every dollar is needed by the government—




Senator Urquhart:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. The senator is reflecting on members of this chamber by calling us hypocrites. I would ask that she withdraw that.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  The expressions in this chamber have been far ranging. The senator didn't direct that remark to any person in particular. I don't think there's a point of order.




Senator HANSON:
  Thank you very much, Mr Acting Deputy President. I've had to toughen up in this place; it's a shame others don't do the same. The Australian Greens do not support any of the tax cuts, because they feel every dollar is needed by the government for refugees, the Safe Schools program and subsidies for unreliable energy sources that will drive up electricity prices, and they want to dramatically lift the amount of money helping those in foreign countries. Labor wants to double the foreign aid budget, but the Greens want to almost triple the foreign aid budget to $12.28 billion. They want to give foreign aid, Australia's taxpayers' dollars, to overseas countries. They're not worried about hardworking Australians and giving them tax relief here. They want the money to go overseas—$12.28 billion.


Senator Hanson-Young read the bill and spoke on it, but unfortunately she did not understand it. It's quite funny when the senator makes comments about me. She said that I'm getting a tax cut. No, I'm not. I'm on the same wage as Senator Hanson-Young. The tax cuts are going to be up to $200,000. I'm a very fortunate Australian to be earning more than $200,000. I am paying tax of 45c in the dollar on that. I'm not getting tax relief. To make that comment is to mislead this parliament. I don't think she understands it. If she's really worried about pensioners and the battlers and everyone out there, then I suggest that she flies economy class, like I do, instead of sitting up the front of the plane, at more cost to taxpayers, or taking her child on a taxpayer funded whale-watch—or the overseas trips.


What can I say? That there are people in here expecting Australians not to get a tax cut makes the whole place a joke—yet they don't want to take tax cuts themselves. The whole thing is that hardworking Australians need a helping hand. They need to know that they are going to get something back—that something is being done for them. They are sick and tired of seeing everyone else around the world getting relief—we give foreign aid to everyone. People here are struggling to pay their bills. Because of the Greens in this room, renewable energy is sending up electricity prices and the cost of living. Australians cannot keep going at this rate.


My dilemma is this: yes, we have a black hole, but are we going to fill that black hole? My proposal is to go after the multinationals to pay their fair share of tax in this country and to look after Australians, the hardworking families that need some relief and need help in this country. Yes, suspend taxation and suspend increases in politicians' wages and those of bureaucrats. How can you say to hardworking Australians, 'You can't get tax relief—even the highest amount of up to $7,000 a year,' yet bureaucrats are receiving pay increases of up to $17,000 a year? That doesn't pass the pub test for the Australian people and it doesn't pass the pub test for me.


My job in the Senate is to represent the Australian people to the best of my ability. I will make my vote clear on the floor of the parliament. I will listen to all the amendments that are going to be put up and I will make a decision based on what I think is right for the Australian people.

"Patrick, Sen Rex",CA,2018-06-20,"



Senator PATRICK
 (South Australia) (11:12):  I will be brief in my contribution to on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Personal Income Tax Plan) Bill. At the outset, I can indicate that Centre Alliance will be moving an amendment that omits stage 3 of the income tax cuts. I understand Labor will move an identical amendment. As an alternative to our amendment we will support theirs. Centre Alliance supports the stage 1 tax cuts. Stage 1 involves an end-of-year rebate for low-income earners and raises from $87,000 to $90,000 the income tax threshold to which the tax rate of 37 per cent applies. The combination of the two will return between $135 and $665 to low-income earners, depending on their income. It's our belief that stage 1 will provide much-needed relief for low-income earners.


Centre Alliance will also support the stage 2 tax cuts. These tax cuts are scheduled to commence from July 2022, with the threshold for the 32.5 per cent bracket being lifted from $37,000 to $41,000 and the threshold for the 37 per cent bracket to go from $90,000 to $120,000. This will give tax relief to low- and medium-income earners and to mum and dad professionals, who have worked hard all of their lives and have helped to generate the recent growth we have seen in the economy. They are entitled to enjoy the fruits of their inputs to our economy. Many of the people in this tax bracket are dealing with large mortgages, high electricity bills and a general rise in the cost of living.


As stated, our amendment knocks out stage 3 of the income tax cuts. Stage 3, which is scheduled to start in 2024, abolishes the 37 per cent tax bracket from the system, creating one middle tax bracket of 32½ per cent for workers who earn between $41,000 and $200,000 a year. We're not convinced that this is prudent at this point in time. We also note the distance in time between the passage of this bill into law and when the amendments come into effect. Whilst we are sympathetic to the idea that companies investing large sums of money on projects spanning multiple years, if not decades, may need to know tax rates into the out years, the same can't be said of individuals. So why commit to this law? Why not wait until there is clarity in the budget bottom line in 2022 or 2023 and then change the tax regime for high-income earners?


Having said that, we do reserve our position in regard to the third stage if our amendments are not successful or if an amended bill is rejected in the House, because we do think that low-income and medium-income earners deserve some tax relief.

"Bernardi, Sen Cory",AC,2018-06-20,"



Senator BERNARDI
 (South Australia) (11:16):  I won't delay the Senate unnecessarily, but I do want to get on the record that the Australian Conservatives wholeheartedly endorse and support the government's approach to making personal income tax simpler and fairer in this country. You won't be getting ducks and drakes from us. There'll be no mysterious, 'I'll consider how it's going to come out in the wash.' I entirely support the government's package, because not only is it putting forward tax relief for low-income earners but it maps a pathway of tax relief and some certainty and surety for all taxpayers in this country.


Quite simply, we pay too much tax. Government does not spend our money well enough to maintain the punitive rates of taxation that are impacting the lifestyles of everyday Australian families. It is absurd that our tax brackets are not indexed, that they are not flatter and that more cannot be done to reduce the need for people to pursue tax schemes which are disadvantageous to a great many. For those in this place who say that they want to see capital gains tax changes or changes to negative gearing, I would argue that, if you flatten the tax scales and reduce the need for people to pursue these schemes, the benefits of them to those that are taking advantage will also be reduced. So what we should be doing is looking to lower the tax thresholds across the board to simplify the accounting and taxation affairs for every single Australian.


I also want to make the point, for the class warriors on the other side of the chamber, that about 48 per cent of Australians don't pay any net tax. The burden of taxation in this country is falling disproportionately on those who pay the most tax. That is the simple fact. If you want to reduce the tax burden, we need to reduce it, necessarily, on those that are paying the bulk of it, and we should also be reducing the cost of living and the onerous requirements that government imposes on those who are less fortunate than many of us. You can do that by reducing or taking out the government rorts and attachments that are in our energy industry. You can make our energy more competitive. You can reduce the need for people to pursue negative gearing, as I've touched upon, which will help make housing more affordable. You can reduce the bureaucracy attached to people's employment so that small business is further empowered to employ people and to drive the growth in our economy. They are the simple measures.


We don't need more government. We don't need to give more money to government. We need to get government the heck out of people's lives and let them take some responsibility for themselves. This tax package goes some way to doing that. I endorse it. I wholeheartedly support it. I hope the Senate will do that as well. If they want to have an election based upon one side of parliament putting up taxes and the other side reducing them, I say bring it on, because you will then have a commitment from the Australian people that they endorse low taxes and they think government is not worthy of taking more of their own money.

"McKim, Sen Nicholas",AG,2018-06-20,"



Senator McKIM
 (Tasmania) (11:20):  Here we are engaged in a race to the bottom between the coalition and the Labor Party on personal tax cuts. Anyone would think there's an election in the air—oh wait; there is an election in the air. Within 12 months the Australian voters are going to be choosing who they want to represent them in this place, to be their government, and—surprise, surprise!—the Labor Party and the coalition are engaged in a race to the bottom on tax cuts. This debate at its heart is about what sort of country we want to be. I'm so proud that the Australian Greens senators are the only ones in this place standing up against this unholy race to the bottom on tax cuts and standing up instead for increasing the funding and quality of essential public services in this country: schools, hospitals and public transport; support for people with disabilities; funding for the environment, the fight against climate change, and threatened species; and funding for productive, long-term infrastructure for this country. The Australian Greens want both the Liberal Party and the Labor Party to properly fund those things, not this race to the bottom on tax cuts, which is designed solely to try to solicit votes at the upcoming election.


Over the last two decades in this country there has been a deliberate attempt by the Labor and Liberal parties to pull apart our society. Economic inequality has massively grown because of decisions made by both the Labor and Liberal parties. Taxes have been cut for the big corporate donors to the Labor and Liberal parties. Personal income tax has been slashed, especially for the wealthiest people, while Newstart, which is supporting the people doing it toughest financially, has not been raised for a generation—nearly 25 years. There has been a transfer of wealth from the less well-off to the most well-off, and now the Labor and Liberal parties are proposing to transfer yet more wealth, via these tax cuts, from people doing it tough to people who already have more than their fair share of our national wealth.


There's a stark choice facing the Australian people and this parliament at the moment. On one hand we can continue to run down our schools, hospitals and essential public services; on the other hand we can stand up for increasing the funding and quality of our essential public services. On one hand Labor and Liberal, neither of whom support raising Newstart, can continue to punish the poor to reward the rich; on the other hand the Australian Greens will stand up for people on Newstart. We want Newstart to be increased by $75 a week to give people a fair crack at rebuilding their lives and to help them avoid those impossible choices between putting food on the table, paying the school levies or paying the power bills. We can rebuild our Australian society in line with the values of looking after people doing it tough and of funding an increase in the quality of essential public services, or we can continue in a race to the bottom on tax cuts.


I want to say something to the people of Braddon, who are facing this choice in their upcoming by-election. The choice for the people of Braddon is clear. They could vote for a tax cut that redistributes wealth from those at the bottom to those who already have more than their fair share. Remember, stage 1 of this tax plan will give a tax cut to people who earn $120,000 a year. That means that, if you're in a household with two people lucky enough to be earning 120 grand a year—that is a household that earns in the region of a quarter of a million dollars a year—that household is going to get a tax cut, but the people of Braddon on Newstart are being offered nothing by the Labor and Liberal parties, so they've got a choice. Either they can vote for a candidate—Jarrod Edwards, an outstanding Greens candidate in Braddon—who knows what it's like to do it tough, who was raised in a family on welfare, who knows what it's like to live on Struggle Street, who's campaigning strongly for a legislated increase in the minimum wage and a legislated increase in Newstart, or they can vote for Labor or Liberal candidates who want to give a tax cut to people on $120,000 a year. That's the choice facing the people of Braddon. I urge them to support Jarrod Edwards, the Australian Greens candidate, as the only candidate taking a policy to this election to increase Newstart.


Of course, that would provide a significant economic benefit to Braddon, which sorely needs it. With an increase in Newstart and with an increase in the minimum wage, you would see cash starting to flow more freely through the economy of Braddon, which would help businesses in Braddon—everything from small businesses in the corner shops to small businesses in the manufacturing sector, to people on farms and right through the economy of the north-west coast of Tasmania. The choice for the people of Braddon is very clear. You can vote for Jarrod Edwards and the Australian Greens for an increase in the minimum wage and an increase in Newstart, or you can vote for your Labor or Liberal candidates and vote to give tax cuts to people on $120,000 a year.

Senator O'SULLIVAN
 (Queensland) (12:45):  I must comment to Minister Cormann that he demonstrated some better dance moves there than the member for Dawson—if that is even possible!


But now a change of pace, if I might. In the time I have I want to make two parts to my contribution to the chamber. The first is to place on the record, on behalf of, I suspect, all of us, our congratulations to the Royal Flying Doctor Service of Australia as they celebrated their 90th year of providing essential life-saving services to the people of Australia. I'll focus a little bit more in relation to my case as a senator for Queensland. Without the Royal Flying Doctor Service in Queensland, arguably over that period of time quite literally hundreds of thousands of people would have lost their lives. We have nearly 37,000 airlifts each year. When you're airlifted, for the most part it's because your injuries are very, very serious; indeed, in so many cases they are life-threatening. You're airlifted only because the most practical and essential thing to do for a patient is to take them to areas where there is a higher order of care. In my home state that's Cairns, Townsville, Rockhampton, Brisbane, Toowoomba and places like that. Think about that for a moment as we pay tribute to this organisation.


Almost 37,000 patients are transported by air every year. I ask colleagues in the chamber to contemplate communities in their states with a population of 40,000 people. Imagine, if you will, that every one of those people found themselves in need of critical or life-saving care and one organisation was able to service that entire community. It is an amazing achievement on the part of this wonderful organisation. It comes as no surprise to those of us who are big fans of the RFDS, and of course that view is not just my view. For seven years in a row, according to the charity reputation index of this country, they have been the most reputable charity.


On top of the airlifts that I spoke of, of course, there are almost 70,000 road transport movements of patients each year. This isn't someone across town. This isn't someone who is taken from one medical institution in Brisbane, Rockhampton, Cairns or Townsville to another; these are movements that are largely from remote places where, again, if so many hundreds of thousands of these patients were not moved by the Royal Flying Doctor to be taken to acute care, many of them would be in a lot of trouble.


There are 336,000 patient contacts a year across the country. This is where the Royal Flying Doctor Service provides clinics where they go into really inaccessible areas where the patients or people who are consulting them still might have to travel 300, 400 or 500 kilometres by dirt, making their way to these clinics and taking days out of their lives in many cases to be able to take advantage of the delivery of this service. I'm very proud to say this on the part of the government. I don't want to make a political point here, because I suspect that, even if it were a Labor government, they would quite properly pay attention to the proper funding of the RFDS.


The second part of my contribution here to the chamber will be about drought and particularly drought in my home state of Queensland and the impact it's having. With the drought has come a massive increase in the incidence of people needing mental health care. So, accordingly, the Royal Flying Doctor Service have established a new mental health outreach service, and they've been given an $84 million funding boost by the coalition government to do that. Again, I don't want to try to make any political point about the funding announcement—although, of course, supporting the Royal Flying Doctor Service and organisations like that which service provincial, rural and regional Australia comes very naturally to the coalition. We've had a long and very close association with those remote areas of Australia. I think it is fair to say, unless someone wants to contradict me, that from a political point of view they support our government as well. Very few of the larger electorates away from the metropolitan areas are not held by a member of the coalition or a fellow traveller. I want to spend time speaking about the impacts of the drought in my home state, but let me close the first part of my contribution by congratulating—and I hope I do so on behalf of the entire chamber—the Royal Flying Doctor Service for a wonderful delivery of service to our nation over the last 90 years.


On the drought, I'll concentrate on where I know best—my home state of Queensland. We've got 31 councils that are completely droughted and three councils that are partially droughted. This represents over 66 per cent of my home state. So two-thirds is under drought. Some of those areas have been under drought for almost seven years. I'm not going to repeat my arguments from before about how weakened these communities were as they went into the drought as a result of the issues that presented with the suspension of the live cattle trade into Indonesia in 2011. But in seasons that should have prepared them with more resilience to go into this dry period and drought they were denied that opportunity because of the impacts on the marketplace when quite literally millions of head of cattle came into the domestic market. That drove prices down to the lowest we had seen, in some instances, in 30 years.


But I want us to consider something again. I want to, for a moment, pretend that we're in the House of Representatives and that we represent an electorate out west and that electorate has 100,000 people. I did this with my colleagues in our joint party room, without disclosing our discussion, some time ago. Imagine that, wherever you live, a third of the school population has left. They've gone. They're just not attending school anymore. They've actually left the district. In western Queensland, which is that far western area west of the Great Dividing Range, the population has decreased by 20 per cent in the last six years due to the impacts of the drought. We've got projections that suggest that Queensland will have a population growth of 32 per cent between now and 2025, but in these areas the projections are minus three per cent. Our unemployment average was at about six per cent. We had periods in the west where our unemployment was down around five per cent. It is now, in some places, up as high as 27 per cent. So these are people who don't have a lot of choices. The value of their homes has collapsed, in many instances by up to one-third, because of the drought and because of the migration out of the west of people who don't have jobs or job prospects, so they're left with the property they bought three or four years ago and it's now worth a third less than it was at the point of their purchase.


I have so many more facts, and at my very next opportunity I'll finish with respect to my presentation on this point. This is critical. This is a natural phenomenon, if we accept all of the arguments, and it's a disaster. This is a natural disaster in the same way that cyclones, floods, fires and other catastrophes are. I urge all senators, at least for a part of their day, to turn their minds to the struggle that people of the west are having and reflect on it as they make decisions in this place.

Senator KIM CARR
 (Victoria) (16:45):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Jobs and Innovation (Senator Cash) to a question without notice asked by Senator Carr today relating to Telstra.


In doing so, I draw the Senate's attention to this extraordinary proposition where at quarter to five we get to discuss this matter. In 15 minutes, we'll have a first speech. We have yet to deal with some housekeeping matters. Then we will go back to the very, very brief, perfunctory discussion of the expenditure of $140 billion worth of expenditure on tax cuts! I want to say that in the context where some people have agreed, to ease their consciences for what they have done, that senators here, leaders of various parties, might get the chance to express their disappointment at what they have done and, as a consequence of that, rob themselves of the right to defend the people of this country from what is a shocking political abuse of the budgetary arrangements in this country whereby the very, very wealthy in this country, the most wealthy people in this country, get the benefit of a Liberal government seeking to distort the taxation system and undermine the progressive nature of our taxation system in this country to offer up a political bribe in the run-up to an imminent federal election. What is more, it is on the basis of a promise that might be kept two elections hence. That's the proposition that they have signed up to.


I am particularly disappointed by those senators from Centre Alliance, who, in many respects, have sought to come into this chamber and argue their case, particularly in defence of people in manufacturing areas and various others, on the basis they stand between the political parties. That is what they claim. Senator Xenophon used to say that all the time. He would not have agreed to a guillotine of this nature. He would certainly not have agreed to a guillotine of this nature while claiming to be the centre force without talking to both sides in this chamber. But what has happened is that an ambush has been inflicted upon this chamber, an ambush on the Labor Party and the Greens. Of course, Senator Storer has been excluded, locked out from even putting a point of view about the importance of protecting the revenue of this Commonwealth, $140 billion worth of revenue, in circumstances where the very wealthy in this country are getting a decided advantage from a very conservative government seeking to undermine the fundamental principles of a social democratic arrangement in regard to the provision of the funding of essential services in this country, such as education and health—the services that Centre Alliance say they're very interested in. Can you imagine if we talked about the shipbuilding industry and pulled a stunt like this, an ambush like this, without ever talking to the opposition? Can you imagine the consequences for the people of this country?


It is $140 billion worth of expenditure, over what are now going to be several election cycles, in which we'll see some people get a minimal tax arrangement whereby the very wealthy get a $7,000 tax benefit, which the government think is going to provide them with an electoral advantage, because of the circumstances of two elections hence. Frankly, I don't believe the people of this country are going to buy that argument. They're not going to buy it, because they know that this government is out of touch. They understand just how incredibly arrogant this government is. This is the merchant banker's view of politics. This is the view of Australian society from the foreshores of Sydney Harbour. This is not the view that protects the health services of this country, protects the schools of this country, protects the universities of this country, ensures that our pensioners have the necessary wherewithal to enjoy a decent standard of living. This is the sort of government that rends the social fabric of this country asunder. This is the sort of government we're seeing, which is actually driving deep hostility into the Australian people by making it clear to the Australian people that the politics and economics of this country do not work for ordinary people. They work for the very wealthy. They work for those with power and privilege. (Time expired)

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2018-06-20,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (16:51):  I just have to take a second to compose myself from my laughter at hearing that last speech. Senator Carr is lecturing the chamber and lecturing the crossbenchers about the time management of this very important piece of legislation. He and the Greens political party continue to express outrage at how they could be restricted in the debate they have on this bill. I've been in this chamber for a while and, regrettably, I sat through the Labor years, the six dark years of Labor in charge. Do you know, Madam Deputy President, in the Labor years we had 188 bills through this parliament guillotined with the support of the Greens political party—188 bills, most of them with not even one word spoken on them, not one word. We were required to vote in a sausage machine style on 188 bills the Labor Party put up in government, supported, I might say, by the Greens political party, who always are holier than thou.


I had to compose myself. Everybody knows that Labor lie—that's becoming an accepted norm in this chamber and, in fact, right across Australia—but we now know that the hypocrisy of the Labor Party and their mates in the Greens political party knows no bounds whatsoever. They lecture the crossbenchers—they think they're still at the CFMEU union—and think that by shouting at them, bullying them and standing over them, as they do in a CFMEU meeting, they can bully the crossbenchers into submission and into agreeing with them. But they don't like it when we remind them of not one bill—important though this one bill is on taxation—but 188. Half of them were fairly routine; I'll accept that. The other half were very important bills, and they were guillotined by the Labor Party without proper debate.



Senator McGrath interjecting—




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  There were 53, as my colleague Senator McGrath says, in one week—53 bills guillotined in one week, and many of them with not even a word. The Labor Party are complaining that, with this bill, we're going to allow the leaders of the parties to speak. That's a privilege that we never got in the Labor Party's administration. Not even was the then opposition leader allowed to speak.


If the Labor Party were serious about wanting to debate this bill, they would have done away with the last three hours of time absolutely wasted on having procedural motions on which they called for a division every time, every time losing about ten minutes that we could have used to actually have the debate that they're now complaining they're not going to have time for. The hypocrisy is absolutely breathtaking—188 bills guillotined, most of them without one word being spoken. We could have had two hours of debate by now.


We would have had to interrupt it for—and I hope you'll listen carefully—what will be a wonderful speech by my colleague from Queensland Senator Stoker. You may learn something. I hope you listen intently, because I know Senator Stoker's speech will be enlightening. If you take some notice of it, you'll be better senators on that side. I'm very much looking forward to Senator Stoker's speech.


But again can I point out—as I say, it is a struggle for me to compose myself—the rank hypocrisy of the Labor Party in complaining about a limited time for a debate when they've wasted three hours this afternoon—

 (Tasmania) (16:56):  Can I just say, Senator Macdonald, that I'd much rather be associated with the CFMEU than I would with the latest Liberal Party meeting, where you had thugs abusing and threatening older women. What a disgrace! Don't you guys come in here and tell us what thugs you think the union movement are. You can't even go to a Liberal Party meeting without being abused in Australia these days.


Can I just say: the debacle of the last two hours, where we've been denied the ability to do our job, is atrocious. Our job here is not to rubber stamp. We are not here—



An incident having occurred in the gallery—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Bilyk, please resume your seat. Could the person who took that photo please delete it. It's against the standing orders to take photos in the chamber unless you're a media person. You need to delete the photo. Thank you.




Senator Abetz:
  I'm sure it wasn't of Catryna!




Senator BILYK:
  Senator Abetz, you've just offended me there! Why would it not have been of me?


Can I say, though, that the last nearly two hours have proven, time and time again, that the government do not want to be held accountable. They do not want people to know what is in that tax package. They don't want people to understand. There is no rush, because it's a refund anyway. People have got until June or July 2019. There is no rush. For you guys to come in here all of a sudden and say it's a rush is just a joke.


Of course, we're here to take note of answers in question time. The answer we are to take note of is the answer from Minister Cash to the question from Senator Carr. Once again, what the government demonstrated in relation to the question about 8,000 Telstra workers losing their jobs was that it just doesn't care. The answer talked about causing the economy to 'prosper and grow', but under this out-of-touch government Australians are suffering. They're suffering from stagnant wages, rising insecurity in employment, soaring costs of living and cuts to penalty rates. The mechanism that the government's put into place time and time and time again is to ensure that wages are kept low and that workers lose conditions. Both Mr Turnbull and Mr Morrison are more concerned with ensuring tax cuts for millionaires than they are about doing anything to help workers, especially those 8,000 workers at Telstra. The government has made its feeling towards Telstra workers known, and, can I say, it is pretty disappointing.


When the Minister for Urban Infrastructure and Cities, Mr Paul Fletcher, was asked this morning about the 8,000 job losses, his response was, 'These things happen.' It's hard to imagine a more callous response to 8,000 job losses than a minister in the Turnbull government shrugging his shoulders and saying, 'Well, these things happen.' I'm pretty sure those 8,000 families don't consider that these things just happen. It's clear that the government's got no sympathy and no real understanding of what happens when thousands of families and the communities around those families need to deal with 8,000 job losses. I've seen what happens with job losses, and it's not happy, let me tell you. It's distressing. It causes great personal and economic toll. It's not pleasant to watch. It's certainly not pleasant to be part of. The government should be watching and helping, not just shrugging their shoulders. Perhaps, if Mr Fletcher and Mr Turnbull don't believe the government has any power to do any good when events like this happen, they shouldn't have the responsibility of being in government.


I'm not yet aware of the magnitude of the job losses for Tasmania, but back in 2015 Telstra announced 38 job losses in Tasmania as part of another round of 1,400 national job losses, so I expect that the 8,000 jobs that are going will have an impact in Tasmania. That will be a massive blow, of course, to the Tasmanian community, including to regional Tasmania, which you guys, especially the new Nationals senator, should be a bit concerned about. It's absolutely clear you guys don't care about regional Tasmania. Your policies are focused on the Sydney millionaires, Mr Turnbull's friends and neighbours, and you know that.


We've got a Prime Minister that told a 60-year-old aged-care worker from the north-west coast of Tasmania she could do better and she could get a better job. What a disgrace! What an absolute disgrace! What I want to know is: what is Mr Turnbull's measurement— (Time expired)



The PRESIDENT:  Order! Pursuant to order, business is interrupted to allow for the first speech of Senator Stoker. I ask senators to observe the traditional courtesies for a first speech.

"Fawcett, Sen David",LP,2018-06-20,"



Senator FAWCETT
 (South Australia—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (17:30):  After a speech like that, it's fantastic to come and talk about smaller government and lower, fairer and simpler taxes. The things we just heard from Senator Stoker are about the importance of individual responsibility and the importance of creating equal opportunity as opposed to equal outcomes, and one of the key things is reward for effort. If people take the risk of starting a small business, or if people take the opportunity before them to get educated and to move into employment, they deserve the reward that comes from that.


The criticisms from those opposite about this tax package go to the fact that they say it's not progressive, but can I repeat the figures that Senator Cormann, the finance minister, mentioned during his answers—and we are here, at the end of the day, to take note of answers. Under this package, for somebody earning $30,000, a tax cut is worth 8.3 per cent, whereas for someone on $200,000 it's 0.2 per cent. The top 20 per cent of taxpayers currently are paying 60 per cent of the income tax that is received by government. When this package is implemented in full, the top 20 per cent of Australian taxpayers will still be paying 60 per cent of the income tax that's received by the government. So, what we're doing, by implementing these three phases and by trying to address things like bracket creep, is to still keep Australia as a place that has a tax system that is fair but to make it simpler and to lower the level of tax.


One of the fallacies in this argument is that people love to talk about the tax rate that people are paying. But, by the time you look at what they pay for each level, what's excluded and then the various levels coming up, for the two examples that Senator Cormann used before, if you take the tax that is paid as a function of the income earned—as opposed to having all the steps but just as a function of income earned—for the $30,000 income, tax of $2,200 is around 7.3 per cent. For the person on $200,000, who's paying $67,000 of tax, that's 33.5 per cent of income. So, if you look at it in the overall picture and put the right context around it, you quickly understand why the top 20 per cent of taxpayers are paying 60-odd per cent of the income tax that Australia then relies on for things like schools, hospitals, education and funding our Defence Force. The fallacy that is put forward by those opposite is to take a percentage figure without applying the full context. When you look at those figures—the fact that somebody who is earning $200,000 is paying $67,000 of tax and that equates to 33.5 per cent in overall terms of the income that they have earned—what that shows is that they are paying substantially more in both percentage and dollar figure terms than someone on a lower income.


If you then also take into account that the majority of low-income earners in Australia pay no net tax because of the churn and the things that are handed back, what you see is that this system that the government is looking to put in place is, in fact, a tax package for lower, fairer and simpler taxes. Why is that important? It's important because that's at the heart of a strong economy. That's at the heart of an economy that means that government will have the money that it needs to pay for the services that we are here to provide for our community.


As Senator Stoker said, in an ideal world the government would do only what people are unable to do for themselves. But where we do need to provide services we need to be able to afford it, and under the policies of this government we have finally got back to the point where we are no longer borrowing to pay for those daily costs of government. Because of the debt run up by the Labor government under Prime Ministers Rudd and Gillard, for years now Australia has been borrowing money to pay its daily living costs. It's only the good financial management of the coalition government, under Prime Minister Turnbull and Treasurer Morrison, that has returned us to the point where we are no longer borrowing money. This package is for lower, fairer and simpler taxes to benefit Australia's future.

"Watt, Sen Murray",ALP,2018-06-20,"



Senator WATT
 (Queensland) (17:35):  Obviously, quite a few hours have now passed since question time, where we kicked off by asking questions about the very sad announcement by Telstra overnight that it would be cutting 8,000 jobs from its Australian workforce. This is yet another absolute tragedy of massive job losses that we're seeing in Australia under the stewardship of the Turnbull government. What's probably even more tragic is that, as the day has unfolded and various ministers have been asked about this in question time, in press conferences and elsewhere, consistently we've heard from Turnbull government ministers classic laissez faire, hands-off responses: 'This is a commercial decision,' or, 'It's a matter for Telstra,' or, most tragically of all, from Minister Paul Fletcher, 'Things happen.' As I say, it is another classic example of how this government approaches managing the economy and ensuring that Australians have good, secure, well-paid jobs.


None of us can forget the approach that the government took in the previous term in relation to the car industry, when not only were they quite happy to stand on the sidelines and watch the car industry in this country be closed down, at the cost of tens of thousands of jobs, but they actively cheered it on. They actively encouraged and dared some of the biggest car-makers in the world to shut down the industry, and—what do you know?—they did. We kissed goodbye to tens of thousands of good, well-paid, secure jobs that in many cases had been held in certain families for generations. And it's happening again today with the loss of these 8,000 jobs in Telstra.


It wasn't until this announcement was made that I found out that funding for the very thing these Telstra workers, and the car industry workers before them, need most from government—labour market support to assist them to find new work, retrain and move into new occupations—was actually cut in this year's federal budget. In this year's budget, the federal government, the Turnbull government, has taken money out of its labour market support programs, which are used as structural adjustment packages to assist workers in industries experiencing large numbers of retrenchments, just like these today. Not only do we have a government that's prepared to just wash its hands of any responsibility and say, 'This is just a commercial decision; things happen; nothing we can do,' just like it did with the car industry; it's actually making it harder for these workers to find new jobs by taking money out of its own labour market support programs. It's another classic example of this government's approach to jobs and the lack of concern it has for working people.


Telstra are now under an immediate obligation to start consulting with their workforce and unions about managing this change for as many employees as possible. We've seen this in other industries, and I'm thinking particularly of banking. Some of the big banks announced massive job losses recently, and what has become clear to me, particularly through a Senate inquiry I'm involved in, is that some of the banks are not consulting their workforces or unions at all about what other opportunities there might be within these large organisations to move people into different roles. I wouldn't be at all surprised if, at the same time as cutting these 8,000 jobs, Telstra were actually looking at creating other jobs in other parts of its business. It may well be that some of these 8,000 people can simply be retrained and redeployed into existing roles rather than being thrown out on the scrap heap, which is what Telstra seems to be planning to do.


The government spend a lot of time crowing about jobs growth, but they never want to own up and they never want to front up when big companies are doing the wrong thing by their workforce, like what we are seeing from Telstra today. The government never talk about the fact that there are well over a million people in Australia who are underemployed, who are not able to find the amount of work which they are looking for. They don't want to talk about the rising level of insecure work that is hurting so many Australians right around the country. They never want to acknowledge research from groups like the Centre for Future Work, which was able to show recently that, for the first time in Australian history, now we have less than half of Australians who are employed working in permanent, full-time positions with paid entitlements like sick leave and annual leave. The government constantly want to deny that we have a crisis of insecure work, when the facts show that more and more people are surviving on casual work and part-time work when they want more and are finding it difficult to feed their families. The government have to do more. (Time expired)

   (i) Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) encompasses a range of conditions that can occur in an individual with prenatal exposure to alcohol and is the largest cause of non-genetic, at birth brain damage in Australia,


   (ii) FASD can result in learning difficulties, anger management and behavioural issues, impaired speech and muscle coordination and physical abnormalities in the heart, lungs and other organs – the effects can range from mild impairment to serious disability,


   (iii) in 2012, the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs considered the issue in depth in its report FASD: The Hidden Harm (""the report""), which made 19 recommendations, many of which have not been implemented – including recommendations on alcohol health warning labels.


   (iv) the report stated, at paragraph 2.56, that '[w]hile frequency and quantity of consumption clearly increase the risks to the fetus, research suggests that alcohol at any time can endanger the development of the fetus',


   (v) according to the 2016 Australian Institute of Health and Welfare National Drug Strategy Household Survey, 44% of women consumed alcohol while pregnant,


   (vi) alcohol health warning labels are an important public health measure because they promote health messages at point of sale and at point of consumption,


   (vii) in 2010, the Australia and New Zealand Food Regulation Ministerial Council undertook a comprehensive review of food labelling – the 2011 review, titled 'Labelling Logic', recommended Australia adopt mandatory alcohol pregnancy warning labels,


   (viii) on 9 December 2011, the Forum on Food Regulation agreed to allow the alcohol industry two years to introduce voluntary pregnancy labels before 'regulating for this change' – in July 2014 this was extended for an additional two years,


   (ix) there has been no action taken to establish a labelling standard that details the size, location and wording of the warning label creating an inconsistency in labels being applied to alcohol products, and


   (x) on 19 April 2018, the Brewers Association of Australia called for 'pregnancy warning labels to be adopted across all alcohol products as a matter of urgency' and stated that, after six years of voluntary pregnancy labelling, too many producers 'have been too slow to do the right thing';

Senator McGRATH
 (Queensland—Assistant Minister to the Prime Minister) (18:22):  I seek leave to make a short statement.



The PRESIDENT:  Leave is granted for one minute.




Senator McGRATH:
  Thank you. The Ministerial Drug and Alcohol Forum is currently developing a national fetal alcohol spectrum disorder strategic action plan through the guidance of the national drug strategy committee. The plan is intended to provide a cohesive evidence based approach to strengthen Australia's efforts in preventing and diagnosing the disorder and better supporting those living with and affected by the disorder. It is expected that the plan will be finalised by the end of the year. The Australia and New Zealand Ministerial Forum on Food Regulation is currently considering implementing mandatory pregnancy warning labels on alcoholic beverages. Targeted consultation concluded on 14 June, and analysis of submissions is currently underway. A final decision on mandating pregnancy warning labels is likely to occur during an out-of-session meeting of the forum later in the year.


Question agreed to.

The PRESIDENT

 (18:37):  In accordance with the order agreed to earlier, it being past 6.30 pm, the debate is interrupted for consideration of the Treasury Laws Amendment (Personal Income Tax Plan) Bill 2018. The time allotted for consideration of this bill has expired and the questions will now be put. I will first put the outstanding questions that were before the committee prior to senators' statements. I will put the question on the amendments that were before the chair earlier today. I will then work through the questions on the other amendments circulated in respect of the bill. If any senator wishes to withdraw amendments they have circulated, they may do so by leave. Senator Collins?

"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2018-06-20,"



Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria—Acting Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate) (18:30):  Mr President, in terms of the process you just outlined, what were the questions that you indicated you would put up first? 



The PRESIDENT:  I'm about to read out the ones that were before the chair earlier today. I will now go through the amendments by sheet and by number as I put them to the chamber, starting with the ones that were already moved before the chair in the committee stage. The question is that amendment Nos (3) to (8), (10) and (12) to (15) on sheet 8441, moved by Senator Storer, be agreed to. Senator Collins?




Senator JACINTA COLLINS:
  Just so that we can be clear—and I understand there's no debate, discussion or the like on the actual amendments—I think it's important for senators, particularly in circumstances where we don't have a committee consideration, to understand what the question actually is before us. The point you made earlier was that you were proceeding with those questions that had already been moved in the limited debate that we had—



The PRESIDENT:  The ones that were before the chair.




Senator JACINTA COLLINS:
  So, looking at the running sheet and comparing that with the revised running sheet—and thank you to the clerks for providing it—Senator Storer's amendments, the ones that have already been moved, are (3) to (8), (10) and (12) to (15). Senator Storer's amendment (1) is not being moved at this stage; is that correct?



The PRESIDENT:  The amendments that you just read out, and that I just read out, are the ones that had been moved and were before the chair in the committee stage earlier today. They are the ones that will be put first, and then I will work through a sheet that has been provided with other amendments that were circulated but were not before the chair.




Senator JACINTA COLLINS:
  Mr President, for clarity purposes and also for Senator Storer, in order for us to understand which of his amendments are the ones he moved earlier, and for what purpose, it might be necessary for the clerks to actually read the amendments so we know what we're really dealing with.



The PRESIDENT:  I have just taken some advice from the Clerk, which confirms my past experience that, where amendments have been circulated in the chamber—and these were before the chair and well circulated—there is not a need to read them out. There is no doubt about what the matter we are dealing with is.




Senator JACINTA COLLINS:
  The difficulty I have with the difference here is that the Clerk's advised you on how matters would be dealt with under normal circumstances, which is not what we're dealing with here. We're dealing with an artificial distinction between amendments that have been previously moved and the ones that haven't yet been dealt with. In the case of Senator Storer, for instance, he has only now started to understand that, in terms of the batching of his issues—



The PRESIDENT:  Senator Collins, I was referring to my own experience of when the Senate has adopted this procedure that I am now bound by, which is to put these votes without debate or discussion. I've made a ruling in respect of there being no need to read the amendments out. I have allowed you to put your point. I've made my ruling. I'm now going to put the question, because that is what the Senate has directed me to do—to put these motions without debate or discussion. So the question is—and I'll read it again—that amendment Nos (3) to (8), (10) and (12) to (15) on sheet 8441, moved by Senator Storer, be agreed to.




Senator JACINTA COLLINS:
  Mr President, just further to that, can I then clarify in respect of Senator Storer's amendments, for example, when in this process he would be moving amendment (1).



The PRESIDENT:  We will go through the other amendments in an order that I have been provided with. They will all be voted on by the Senate. Even if they were not before the chair, all the amendments will be voted on by the Senate in an order starting now.




Senator JACINTA COLLINS:
  So, if they're on the running sheet they have been moved, but senators are able to withdraw if that's their want?



The PRESIDENT:  I will restate it and I'll make it very clear. The first set of amendments are the ones that were moved by Senator Storer earlier today and were before the chair at the time. Then we will proceed through other matters. But I'm going to put that question now. I'm not going to read them out four times every time. I'll do it again now. The question is that amendment numbers (3) to (8), (10) and (12) to (15) on sheet 8441, moved by Senator Storer, be agreed to.

Senator WONG
 (South Australia—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (18:56):  Could I just briefly make two points. I appreciate that you're giving me some leeway to do so, so I will be brief. The first is that these include the amendments which proposed Labor's bigger, better and fairer tax plan, so I just draw that to the attention of the chamber given that Senator Cormann made some inaccurate statements earlier today.


In light of that, what I'd also say to you, Mr President, is that there is a distinct possibility there may be senators who wish to vote differently on items (1) to (3), (5), (7), (9) and (10) on sheet 8450. These are items that fill a gap in the tax law as a result of the Senate's earlier decision to omit step 3 of the government's plan from the bill. They implement the step 2 tax rates for 2024-25 and later income years rather than leaving no rates in place, and they make associated consequential amendments. So I would invite you to consider putting those items that I've identified in that contribution separately.



The PRESIDENT:  If any senator requests that any item be put separately, I will put them separately, but they must vote differently on the item they requested to be put separately to other items. Are there any requests from any senators who wish to vote on items differently?

 (19:21):  We now come to the last part of this chain of events. The question now is that the remaining stages of this bill be agreed to.

  No, you skipped one.



The PRESIDENT:  That's an unnecessary stage. I've been speaking to the Clerk about this.



Senator Wong interjecting—



The PRESIDENT:  Senator Wong, I have just been dealing with the Clerk about this matter and I've been advised that that is not necessary.




Senator Wong:
  So you're going to truncate it even more and not even have a debate on whether or not the bill should be agreed to.



The PRESIDENT:  No. If I could complete the reading out of the motion: I've taken advice from the Clerk, Senator Wong, and the question now is that the remaining stages of this bill be agreed to and the bill be now passed with amendments. It is not necessary to have that particular motion in this chain of events—




Senator Jacinta Collins:
  This running sheet is what was circulated.




Senator Wong:
  We are already in an extraordinary procedure which has been following a document which has been circulated in the chamber. You are now seeking to amend that document, and I'd ask you not to. I'd ask you to simply proceed with the question. It may be a guide and you may know what you're doing, but—

Senator Wong:
  I am requesting 'that the bill, as amended, be agreed to' as a question.



The PRESIDENT:  And I am advised by the Clerk that that is an unnecessary stage in this chain of events and the final matter remaining to be dealt with is 'that the remaining stages of this bill be agreed to and this bill be now passed with amendments'. Senator Collins, are you raising a point of order?




Senator Jacinta Collins:
  Yes, I am. As a courtesy, given the clerks would have advised the construction of this document in the first instance and we've been given no notice of the change, I would ask as a courtesy that we continue to follow the program that we have had in front of us and we ask the next question.



The PRESIDENT:  That is a courtesy document.




Senator Jacinta Collins:
  It's unprecedented if you do that. You're politicising yourself.



The PRESIDENT:  Senator Collins, really? I'm taking advice from the Clerk. I've ruled on the point of order and I've granted opposition senators latitude in this particular part—




Senator Jacinta Collins:
  There's no latitude on this.

Senator Jacinta Collins:
  This is not courtesy. You should have told us of the changes.



The PRESIDENT:  Senator Collins, I was advised two minutes ago during the last division. Resume your seat while I finish ruling on your point of order. I have granted the opposition latitude during a part of the Senate where there was to be no debate or discussion. I am now putting this motion. The question is—




Senator Jacinta Collins:
  Mr President, I didn't raise a point of order. I sought a courtesy on the basis that you are referring to Clerk's advice that has not been before anyone else here. There was no notice of it. I asked that the courtesy of following the program that has been circulated be followed.

Senator DEAN SMITH
 (Western Australia—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (19:31):  I'd like to take a little time this evening on the adjournment to talk about an important issue, which is grandparent carers across the Australian community, specifically the progress that has been made since the Senate Community Affairs Committee inquiry into the matter. The Senate will recall that in December 2013 it established an inquiry into grandparents who take primary responsibility for raising their grandchildren. The Senate inquiry received 176 submissions from all over Australia, with 36 submissions from Western Australia. The committee held seven public hearings across the country and heard from 116 witnesses. The committee tabled its final report in October the following year.


In January 2016 the government responded to the report, supporting an increased focus on encouraging greater awareness and use of existing services and supports available to grandparent carers. As part of its response, the government agreed firstly to a trial expansion of the existing Grandparent Advisers program and expanded outreach activities conducted by all eight grandparent advisers. Secondly, increased support for grandparent and kinship carers by providing national information, resources and support. Thirdly, a national survey to better understand the demographics of non-parent carers and their needs so as to inform government policy and practices. I'm delighted that this very important, but often very invisible, issue continues to get the attention of the government.


In 2017, following the evaluation of an expansion of the existing Grandparent Advisers program, the program was expanded, and increased outreach activities have been implemented across Australia. Last year there were 319 Grandparent Adviser outreach activities conducted across Australia. In WA a total of 55 activities were undertaken, including 28 external outreach activities and 27 internal outreach activities.


Groups involved in the expansion included the WA Department for child protection, Centrecare, Wanslea Grandcare program, Escare and MercyCare childcare centres. We have also seen an increase in support for grandparent and kinship careers and their peer support groups. The Raising Children Network was engaged to provide national information, resources and support.


Five carer forums were held in March and April 2017 involving over 300 participants, including 200 grandparent carers and over 80 service providers. In WA the forum was held on 12 May 2017 and included 50 grandparent carers and 24 service providers. These forums achieved a number of outcomes, such as increased grandparent and kinship carer capacity to care for their grandchildren and an understanding of how to run effective peer support groups; improved awareness of support services and resources available for better access; increased awareness, understanding and recognition of the role and contribution of grandparent kinship carers in the community and strengthened service provider capacity to support grandparent and kinship carers.


To increase service provider capacity, and to assist peer support groups to function effectively, four service provider forums were held across Australia, including one in my home state of Western Australia. The development of national information and resources has also been completed. The new information, tools and resources include: new Parenting in Pictures resources that cater for audiences with low text literacy; a comprehensive list of major support services in each state and territory; a new landing page on raisingchildren.net.au for all translated content to assist carers from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds; and the completion of two electronic how-to guides to support and assist carers. Finally, the national survey was conducted in late 2016 by the Australian Institute of Family Studies with support from state and territory governments. The final report was submitted to the federal government in 2017 and was recently published in May 2018 on the Australian Institute of Family Studies' website.


Since the government's response, grandparent carers have gained a number of protections and positive financial changes following a number of reforms to social security and childcare legislation. I acknowledge Senator Claire Moore and Senator Carol Brown, who also participated on the Senate Community Affairs References Committee inquiry some years ago. Specifically, grandparent carers have been exempted under the family tax benefit part B changes. The family tax benefit part B continues to be available, as per the current rate structure, to grandparent and great-grandparent carers. Grandparent carers have been given access to a new subsidy under the coalition's new Childcare Assistance Package, which begins on 2 July 2018. This grandparent-specific top-up subsidy is available in addition to the standard childcare subsidy and will provide income support for those grandparents who are the primary carers of their grandchildren. We've also exempted grandparent carers from the childcare subsidy activity test. This means grandparent carers will be eligible to access up to 100 hours of approved child care fortnightly. I'm sure everyone in the Senate would agree that grandparent carers deserve our continued support and advocacy. While this is progress, there is always much more that can and should be done for these unsung heroes who live in our community.
