"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2006-08-10,"—I rise to speak on the Australian Technical Colleges (Flexibility in Achieving Australia’s Skills Needs) Amendment Bill 2006. This bill provides for the establishment and operation of 25 Australian technical colleges, which of course was the government’s election response to Australia’s skills crisis. The bill before the chamber amends the Australian Technical Colleges (Flexibility in Achieving Australia’s Skills Needs) Act 2005 to bring forward funding for the proposed 25 colleges from 2008-09 to 2006-07, within the same funding total for the quadrennium, and also to enable the Minister for Vocational and Technical Education to redistribute funds between particular years by regulation rather than by legislative amendment. The colleges are intended to provide high-quality tuition in both academic and vocational education for students in years 11 and 12. They are intended to be located in regions with skills needs, with a high youth population and that are supported by a significant industry base.
The government promised at the last election to build the 25 colleges to provide school based apprenticeship courses for 7,500 students. That is about 300 students to be enrolled in each college, and yet we are in the second half of 2006 and only five colleges are open for business—one of which is an existing school—enrolling a total of 350 students, which is hardly 300 in each college. One hundred and eighty-five of those students are at the existing school. The last of these schools, in northern Tasmania, commenced operations on 31 July 2006.
As I said, this is the government’s response to date to meeting the Prime Minister’s commitment during the election campaign, and I want to quote from the Prime Minister’s election campaign speech. He said that ATCs are ‘the centrepiece of our drive to tackle skills shortages and to revolutionise vocational education and training throughout Australia’. Some revolution! It is clear that this bill exemplifies the Howard government’s incompetence and its blind commitment to ideology over genuine educational need.
The opposition will not stand in the way of releasing urgently needed funding for students and for that reason we will support the bill. But, frankly, the government deserves to be condemned for its performance, and I foreshadow the second reading amendment that has been circulated in my name. The Howard government has been in office for 10 long years. Its legacy is a crisis in providing the skills the nation needs for ongoing productivity, low inflation and prosperity. The Howard government’s legacy is a failure to train Australians.
The Australian Industry Group estimates that Australia needs an extra 100,000 skilled workers. The five colleges that the Howard government has thus far produced and are now in operation will produce 350 additional tradespeople in four or five years at best. Almost two-thirds of employers surveyed by the AiG report that they have experienced difficulties in securing employees in the trades, compared with around 50 per cent of employers having difficulties in recruiting technicians, paraprofessionals and engineering professionals. Almost three-quarters of employers surveyed by the group report that an inability to secure skilled staff will be a barrier to their companies’ success. Eighty-five per cent of employers surveyed wanted help to reverse the skills shortage, yet hardly any will be helped by this bill and none will be helped until 2010 at the earliest. The government stands condemned for its failure to provide the training opportunities for Australians to get the skills they need and the skills our nation needs.
The Howard government also stands condemned for its refusal to give priority to funding vocational education and training. This year’s budget papers report that funding for vocational education in the budget for 2005-06 was $1.543 million. That is less than one per cent of total budget expenses—0.75 per cent. I will just put that in context: this is at a time when we have had numerous warnings by the Reserve Bank of capacity constraints in our economy, not only in infrastructure but in the lack of skilled workers, and when employers have continued to indicate their concerns about skilled labour supply. This government presides over a long-term decline in budget expenditure on vocational education. Commonwealth funding for vocational education is estimated to be $1.681 million by 2009-10. That is an increase on average of 2.2 per cent a year, which is well less than today’s inflation rate. In 2009-10 the proportion of the budget spent on vocational education will have declined to 0.67 per cent. This lack of investment reveals the government’s complacency and its indifference to skills training.
As I previously mentioned, in its election campaign the government promised 25 Australian technical colleges, enrolling 7,500 students. What do we have today instead? We have five colleges in operation, enrolling around 350 students in total; and, of these, 220 are enrolled in just one college in Port Macquarie, New South Wales—in the Deputy Prime Minister’s electorate. And this college already existed; it is St Joseph’s Vocational College, Port Macquarie. It is a highly successful school, providing education, training and employment opportunities for many young people in the area. The fact is that this college has been providing this training for many years now without being dubbed an Australian technical college. Consider for a moment the difference between what the government has actually delivered and what it said it would deliver. Twenty-five colleges enrolling 7,500 students was the promise; instead we have five colleges enrolling 350 students, of which the vast majority were enrolled in an already existing school.
We commend St Joseph’s and other schools that are involved in this, and we support St Joseph’s extension under this scheme. But the fact is that around 185 of the 220 currently enrolled students were already at the college last year; so more than two-thirds of the current enrolments in ATCs across the nation are in just one school in Port Macquarie. Not too far from Port Macquarie is a government high school in Ballina, New South Wales. This school is also a high-quality institution, working hard for its students and its community in the same way that St Joseph’s College has in Port Macquarie. Ballina High School won the 2004 national training award for VET in Schools. The school developed an application for funding under the ATC program to extend its services, analogous to what has occurred at St Joseph’s. It proposed to do this in partnership with local industry and with the Northern Institute of TAFE, which has also received national recognition for quality training; it won the 2004 national training provider of the year award.
So the school that wins the national training award for VET in Schools and the TAFE that wins the national training provider of the year award applied for Australian technical colleges funding. And what did the government do? The school was unsuccessful in its application. Why? Was it because the training was not good enough? No. Was it because the TAFE provider did not have a demonstrated record? No. Was it because there was a lack of industry support? No. The reason this school was denied funding is because it is unable to meet the Howard government’s industrial relations requirements.
The bill before the chamber does not mention these requirements. The guidelines for funding that underlie it, however, make the government’s intentions clear: Australian technical colleges must:
... offer the option of an Australian Workplace Agreement to all staff in accordance with the Workplace Relations Act 1996, which will provide rewards linked to excellent performance, including performance pay.
So the bill before the chamber is as much about industrial relations as it is about education, training or skills development. The outcome of this policy is that the bulk of Australian students in our public schools have been denied the opportunity to benefit from the ATC program.
The minister has announced 22 successful ATC proposals. Of these only two are stand-alone government schools, and one other is in a consortium with a Catholic school. Twenty of the 22 announced ATCs involve existing non-government schools or new independent schools. All of these colleges receive federal and state general recurrent funding for their ongoing operation. Some of the successful colleges have been flexible in meeting the industrial relations requirements. Some of them have been creative in meeting these requirements, and it is a pity that their creative energies have had to be directed to meeting these complex and onerous industrial relations requirements, rather than that effort being directed to developing education and training programs for their students. These schools will find they have to meet state curriculum and teacher registration requirements, including for non-vocational curriculum. They will need to charge their students fees, presumably at a reasonably high level, to provide the resources needed for a quality vocational and academic education at the expensive senior secondary level.
Setting up a new school, let alone a specialised vocational college, is not for the faint-hearted or for the inexperienced. We hope they can acquire these skills soon, for their students’ sake. What we do not want to see—and what appears to be fostered by the government—is a destructive competition for students, teachers and resources with other government and non-government schools. Some of the state governments have taken action to do something about the Howard government’s patent indifference to the students in their public schools. The New South Wales government has announced it will provide funding for a number of trades schools, including in some of the schools that the Howard government has refused to support. The Victorian government has announced that it plans to establish technical education centres to provide preapprenticeship and first-year apprenticeship training to students in years 10 to 12.
Minister Hardgrave, unfortunately, has not been backward in criticising these schools or in insulting the teachers and students in those schools. On 3 August the minister put out three media releases ‘announcing’ different aspects of the ATC program. First there was the announcement of a funding agreement for an ATC in Illawarra based at Wollongong but with shopfronts in Moss Vale and Nowra. This college will be established as a non-government school. Then there was the release about the starting of refurbishments at the North Brisbane ATC in Scarborough. This was more in the nature of a ‘re-announcement’, as the funding agreement was first announced in February this year. Again, this school will be a non-government school with the Scarborough campus located at the Southern Cross Catholic College. The final release on 3 August trumpeted that ATCs are ‘in a league of their own’, but all that could be announced was that ‘negotiations were in progress’ for colleges in Queanbeyan, Dubbo and Ballina. We could forgive a desperate minister for pushing a media story about negotiations, but we cannot forgive the disgraceful message to the students of the Queanbeyan trade school in New South Wales. The minister had the gall to describe the school as ‘second rate’ in his media release. What an extraordinary message for the minister responsible for training to send to the students and teachers at this school!
Queanbeyan High School will be the site of one of the 10 trade schools to be established by the New South Wales government. The Canberra Chronicle reported on 1 August:
The Queanbeyan Trade School will involve a partnership between Queanbeyan and Karabar high schools and Queanbeyan TAFE, and will specialise in metal and engineering and automotive trades. The new trade school will have a muti-purpose trade workshop, fitted with industry-standard equipment …
It goes on to report that the trade school will benefit from strong industry and community support, which will also link students with employers who will provide them with on-the-job experience. This is a school that should be supported, not subjected to statements from a minister of the Crown that the school is second rate.
Instead of national collaboration and the fostering of a shared responsibility for meeting the nation’s skills needs, we have a program that has promoted bickering, put-downs and a wasteful use of scarce resources. This is what the government’s technical colleges program has come to: a failure to plan properly, an inability to move away from an extreme industrial relations ideology and a putting-down of those who are not prepared to cooperate with a flawed policy agenda.
The minister is also very defensive about the lack of progress—as you would be when you look at the numbers compared to the election promise—and we have noticed through the Senate estimates a lack of clarity and helpfulness in providing information about that progress. I have been asking detailed questions at estimates hearings for over a year on how these colleges are operating. What we have met with from the government is stony silence on how the colleges are performing. For example, some of the questions asked by me and by other Labor senators were: how much funding is each college receiving; will this funding be adequate to provide high-quality senior secondary schooling and vocational training; what qualifications will the students graduate with; and how many of the expected enrolments will be additional to the current provision in existing schools? We have also been asking a range of questions about when we will see a number of these colleges opened. Unfortunately, many of the answers provided so far have focused much more on what the government hopes to achieve rather than what has actually been achieved.
As I said at the outset, the bill seeks to bring forward funding from 2008 and 2009. Funding for 2006 is increased by $62 million and for 2007 by $26 million. These increases are offset by the reduction in the allocations for the outer years—that is, after the next election—so that the funding for the quadrennium is unchanged at $343.6 million. The explanatory memorandum states that this change, or rephasing forward, of some of the funding reflects the ‘significant progress that has been made in establishing the colleges’. Frankly, if that is right, we are going to have to have a rush of activity in the months ahead.
The reality is that at the end of May this year $185 million had been committed to ATCs but only $18 million had been spent, out of a total budget of $343 million. If the money is not being spent that is usually a pretty good sign that the policy is not being delivered. Therefore, it is no wonder that the government is reluctant to provide information about the funding, operation and status of the proposed colleges. This country needs a systematic approach to promoting trades, science and technology education.
In stark contrast with the Howard government, Labor would work with states and territories to implement these changes in secondary schooling for the benefit of young Australians. Labor’s Skills and Schools Blueprint, released in September last year, outlines our program for improving the skills training in our schools. We will offer young people better choices by teaching trades, technology and science in first-class facilities. We will establish a Trades in Schools scheme to double the number of school based apprenticeships in areas of skills shortage and provide extra funding per place. We will establish specialist schools for the senior years of schooling in areas such as trades, technology and science and establish a ‘trades taster’ program so that years 9 and 10 students can experience a range of trade options which could also lead to pre-apprenticeship programs.
We will increase the number of young Australians completing apprenticeships, through incentives such as the $800 per year skills account which would abolish up-front TAFE fees. This money, which could be paid directly into a skills account for every traditional trade apprentice, could be spent on TAFE fees, textbooks or materials. We have also outlined a $2,000 trade completion bonus under which traditional apprentices would receive a $1,000 payment halfway through their training and a further $1,000 payment at the completion of their apprenticeship. These are practical and real reforms of the kind we need to develop Australian skills. The fact is that under this government, despite warnings not just from the Reserve Bank but also from industry and employers over many years, there has been a comprehensive lack of strategy, focus and priority given to training young Australians. Instead we have seen from this government an over-reliance on skilled migration. The legacy of this government is a failure to train Australians. We are experiencing a skills shortage now and all this government has to offer is an incompletely delivered and belated Australian technical college policy.
Nevertheless, given the lack of focus on technical and vocational training in this country, Labor will support the bill. We do want students to benefit from the program, despite our misgivings about the government’s ability to deliver this and its appalling record so far. However, this government should be held to account for its failure to train Australians. It should be held to account for presiding over a skills crisis in this country and it should be held to account for its failure to meet its responsibilities as the national government. I move Labor’s second reading amendment which has been circulated in my name:
At the end of the motion, add;
         “but the Senate condemns the Government for:
         (a)     creating a skills crisis during their 10-long years in office;
        (b)     its continued failure to provide the necessary opportunities for Australians to get the training they need to get a decent job and meet the skills needs of the economy;
         (c)     reducing the overall percentage of the Federal Budget spent on vocational education and training, and allowing this percentage of spending to further decline over the forward estimates period;
        (d)     its incompetent handling of the Australian Technical Colleges initiative as evidenced by only five out of twenty five colleges being open for business, enrolling fewer than 350 students;
         (e)     failing to be open and accountable about the operations of Australian Technical Colleges, including details of extra student enrolments, funding levels for the individual colleges, course structures and programs;
         (f)     denying local communities their promised Australian Technical College because of their ideological industrial relations requirements; and
        (g)     failing to provide enough extra skills training so that Australia can meet the expected shortfall of 100 000 skilled workers by 2010”.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN TECHNICAL COLLEGES (FLEXIBILITY IN ACHIEVING AUSTRALIA’S SKILLS NEEDS) AMENDMENT BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,10,1,speech
"Ronaldson, Sen Michael",LP,2006-08-10,"—It is an interesting notion when the Australian Labor Party come in here, represented by Senator Wong, and give the impression to those listening that they are actually doing the government a favour by supporting this bill, the Australian Technical Colleges (Flexibility in Achieving Australia’s Skills Needs) Amendment Bill 2006. The bottom line is that the Australian Labor Party, through their intransigence, actually held up the passage of the original Australian Technical Colleges (Flexibility in Achieving Australia’s Skills Needs) Act. Indeed, they are responsible for any delays there might have been in its implementation.
—You haven’t spent the money from the last budget.
—The fact that we came in here today to bring forward money is a clear indication of the success of this program.
—You are a joke.
 (Senator Ferguson)—Order, Senator Wong!
—Senator Wong can yell as much as she likes, but the Australian Labor Party were responsible for holding up the passage of this bill and were responsible for denying young Australians the opportunities for training. So do not come in here and bleat about skills training, Senator Wong, when you were responsible for holding up the passage of the original legislation and you and your colleagues—
—You haven’t spent the money you’ve got!
—Order! Senator Wong, you were heard in silence for almost 20 minutes and I would ask you to observe the same courtesy for Senator Ronaldson.
—You were the ones who held up the passage of the original bill. This bill is actually about bringing forward money—$343-odd million of training money—because the program has been such a success. With the way you have come in here today, you would think that you were doing the kids of Australia a favour by supporting this. The fact is that these Australian technical colleges—which are classic partnerships between young people, schools, industry and general business—have been and will be an outstanding success. The fact is that we are here today because the government and the minister have moved rock after rock, against the desires of the Australian Labor Party, to make sure that we get these ATCs up and running. That is a measure of this government’s commitment and it is a measure of the constant opposition of the Australian Labor Party to any attempt by this government at nation building through skills training. This has been opposed and delayed by the Australian Labor Party.
There were comments this morning about what needs to be done with the ATCs. The bottom line is that the government has identified a clear need to increase participation in traditional skills in this country. We have been forced again to take up the slack of state Labor governments, who have wiped their hands of any responsibility for this nation’s young people—totally wiped their hands of it. And then at the 11th hour, of course, Mr Bracks recently announced some convoluted process, only in response to this government’s initiatives.
Twenty-two of the 25 colleges have been announced. The $343 million of funding remains unchanged, appropriated until 2009. Five of those colleges will be operational this year, at least 20 colleges are expected to be operational in 2007 and, when fully operational, the 25 ATCs will have at least 7½ thousand students each year. That is a quite remarkable achievement. The fact that we are here today to bring forward funding is again a remarkable achievement, and not just of this government. The people who I want to pay credit to are the people in education, industry and business—community leaders who have worked hard to make sure that these colleges get up and running.
In my patron seat of Bendigo, the Bendigo ATC, which I will talk about further in due course, has been driven by a consortium of community leaders, across all industries and all sectors, who want to make this work. I am afraid that I really am staggered by the fact that the Australian Labor Party does not want to see this work. The Bendigo operation, which will be operational next year, was driven by Mr Don Erskine, who is well known to many in this chamber. He has a remarkable group of people who have worked very hard to make sure that the ATC will be up and running next year.
Mr Acting Deputy President, as you will be acutely aware, the issue of trade skills in regional areas, such as Bendigo, Ballarat and Geelong in my home state, is absolutely fundamental to the survival of those regions. Those from country areas will know full well that we cannot tell our young people to stay, live, work and raise their families in Bendigo. As parents and communities we cannot tell them that, but what we can do is give them the opportunity to remain in the regions in which they were raised. The best way of giving them a good reason to stay is to give them employment opportunities. The ATCs are pivotal in metropolitan areas, but they are both pivotal and fundamental to the survival of regional centres. That is why they have been taken up with such gusto by people across broad political spectrums and with broad community interests.
As I have said before, educators, people from industry and people from small business know full well that the survival of those regional centres can be guaranteed only if we are able to provide our young people with skills and the opportunity to work and live in their own areas, and with the ability for us to attract decentralised industry. Companies will only come to the Bendigos, the Ballarats and the Geelongs of this world if there is a skills base. They look at the skills base and make a decision about whether the local community can provide them with long-term, skilled employees that will sustain that business. The ATC in Bendigo will enable the community, whether it is the council or other organisations that are driving that great city forward, to sell to other industries the skills that we have, to attract them to Bendigo.
I think it is quite extraordinary that we have heard the Leader of the Opposition constantly talking in platitudes about skills training issues. One of his claims recently was that, with the Howard government, there had been 10 years of chronic skills shortage. It is interesting: when Mr Beazley was the minister there were 122,000 young people in apprenticeships or traineeships; there are now nearly 400,000 young Australians being given that opportunity for their future. Am I taking great credit on behalf of the government for that? Yes, I am, but what I am also saying is that good government provides good opportunities, and it is a bit rich for Mr Beazley, who did not provide those opportunities, to be attacking a government for doing what a government should be doing. Indeed, $10.8 billion over the next four years is going into vocational training and education—again, good government doing what good governments should be doing.
There was an interesting comment, again by Mr Beazley, about young Australians being turned away from TAFE. The federal government does not run or own any TAFEs, as you would be aware, Mr Acting Deputy President—not one of them. But his commentary was along the lines that the government has imported 270,000 extra skilled migrants. That is actually a blatant untruth, because the figures that Mr Beazley is talking about are the dependants of those primary skilled immigrants—they are dependants. Mr Beazley, to try and make a cheap political point, has rolled them all in together, but about 120,000 or 130,000-odd are actually skilled migrants and the rest are dependants. Mr Beazley’s shameful comment that 300,000 young Australians have been turned away from TAFE, at the same time that the government has imported 270,000 extra skilled migrants, is purely designed for domestic purposes: to say to the Australian community that the government has put skilled migrants ahead of its responsibility to train young Australians—a blatant lie, because they are not skilled migrants; they are dependants—
 (Senator Murray)—Order, Senator Ronaldson! You know you must not use unparliamentary language. Could you please rephrase and withdraw.
—I actually did not call Mr Beazley a liar; I said the comment was a lie, and the comment is a lie. But if there was any reflection taken—

Senator Kirk interjecting—


Senator Conroy interjecting—

—Would you let me finish? If there was any perceived reflection on Mr Beazley, I withdraw it, but the fact that there have been 270,000 extra skilled immigrants is a lie—a bold and bald lie.
—Senator Ronaldson, you are testing the chair.
—My apologies. As I say, I withdraw any reflection on Mr Beazley. I thought it would be worthwhile going through the people who are associated with the Bendigo ATC. As I said, we have got Mr Don Erskine, who is the chairperson; Mr Michael McKern, who is the managing director of McKern Building Products and chair of the regional Australian Industry Group; Mr Coulter, CEO, Flowserve Pump Division; Terry Hurford, director of Morey and Hurford Builders; Graeme Sloan, CEO and director of Perseverance Corporation, a mining company; Ron Poyser, managing director of Poyser Motors; John McLean, CEO of the City of Greater Bendigo; Dr Louise Harvey, director of the Bendigo Regional Institute of TAFE—the TAFE is a partner in this; Elsie L’Huillier, executive officer of the Goldfields Local Learning and Employment Network; John Lynch, general manager of the Central Victorian Group Training Company; Darren McGregor, principal of the Catholic College Bendigo; and Helen Wee Hee, training manager of the Bendigo Sports and Entertainment Group. This very broad cross-section of people in Bendigo is committed to supporting the ATC and the Bendigo district’s young people.
The college will establish its central campus and administration centre at a high-profile site in the youth precinct of the Bendigo CBD. The programs will be delivered across the region—Bendigo, Echuca, Castlemaine, Maryborough, Rochester, Kyabram, Wedderburn, Boort and Charlton—and through subcontracting arrangements with existing schools, TAFEs, RTOs and other appropriate institutions. The college proposes to negotiate with the BRIT to extend existing hospitality facilities to the Bendigo campus. It comes at a cost of about $725,000. The TAFE has agreed in principle to enter into these negotiations, and the finalisation of that arrangement will require agreement with the Victorian government. Let us hope that they are a lot quicker in reaching those agreements than the Australian Labor Party was in the Senate in enabling this initial legislation to get through.
The college will also negotiate with the Central Victorian Group Training Company to develop a training facility for plasterers at a cost of about $125,000. Up to $455,000 has been requested for a mobile classroom, a prime mover and a trailer to enable on-site teaching and learning resources in some trades and utilising state-of-the-art technologies.
There will be the establishment of 29 centres of excellence. MOUs will be developed with employers in two industries in each of the 10 trade areas located in Bendigo and the three in Echuca, Maryborough and Castlemaine. An amount of $1,000 per rural student per year has been included to offset the cost of travel for students in outlying areas to attend work and vocational training placements. An amount of $1,000 per rural student per year is included in the cost of outsourcing delivery of the academic curriculum to small rural schools, reflecting the additional cost and limited flexibility in those schools where extra classes may need to be conducted to fit in with the student school based New Apprenticeships commitments. That is nearly $11 million of hope in the future for these kids in Bendigo.
Those 25 ATCs are about making sure that as a nation we are prepared to back the undoubted ability of our kids and young people. It is not rocket science. Why would the opportunity be taken in this place to play cheap, domestic politics with such an important issue? Why would this nation’s young people be subjected to the Australian Labor Party’s view that anything is worth a crack at? It does not matter what it is; it will be opposed.
At the end of Senator Wong’s contribution, almost as a throwaway line, she said, ‘Oh well, we’re going to support it.’ Of course they have to support it, because it is bringing money forward from out years to enable these schools to be set up now. If she thinks she will get any credit for supporting something that is quite logical, then I think she is going to be unpleasantly surprised. She will not get any support for it. Why she will not get support is the fact that these schools could have been up and running even earlier if it had not been for the intransigence of the Labor Party about allowing this initial bill to go through.
This bill is exciting because it provides opportunities. It is in the very truest sense of the word one of those great Australian partnerships. It is a partnership with Australia’s young people, who want to carve out a career for themselves and who want to make a contribution to this great nation of ours. While they are pilloried in some quarters, we should be proud of these kids. We should be proud of their ambitions and we should be supporting them at every single turn. Part of our contribution to them is to make sure they have the very best skills to ensure that their contribution can be maximised. I commend this bill to the Senate. I commend what underpins this bill to the Senate, because a nation built on skills is a nation that, in my view, is making the single biggest contribution it can make—that is, to the future of our young people.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN TECHNICAL COLLEGES (FLEXIBILITY IN ACHIEVING AUSTRALIA’S SKILLS NEEDS) AMENDMENT BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,10,1,speech
"Webber, Sen Ruth",ALP,2006-08-10,"—This bill, the Australian Technical Colleges (Flexibility in Achieving Australia’s Skills Needs) Amendment Bill 2006, is yet another example of how this government talks big and delivers very little. The first thing, of course, that the government did was deny that there was a problem with skills shortages in the economy. In fact, the first thing they did when they came to office was slash the money devoted to training people in the skills we now desperately need. Next they claimed it was the responsibility of the states and territories, that the Commonwealth had absolutely nothing to do with this. Then they blamed the states and territories—something we hear all too often in this place. Finally, during the election campaign of 2004, they said that they had a solution—they finally had a solution—to the skills shortage.
Their solution was the Australian technical colleges and that they would create 24 in various locations around Australia. Two long years down the track and the government have managed to open only five colleges so far—Gladstone and the Gold Coast in Queensland, Port Macquarie in New South Wales, one in Melbourne and the latest in northern Tasmania on 31 July. All 24 colleges were meant to be up and running and offering 7,500 places by 2008. At this stage, the minister is even saying that three of the areas previously considered—namely, Ballina, Dubbo and Queanbeyan—may in fact lose their colleges because of perceived shortcomings in their applications. In two years, that is five colleges and maybe a total of 300 students!
This amendment bill is before this place because the government wants to bring forward the funding. The best defence of that that the likes of Senator Ronaldson can run in this place is that it is the Labor Party that is delaying the legislation. This is the place where everyone in the Australian community knows the government has the numbers; the other place is where everyone in the Australian community knows the government has the numbers. Therefore, it can act at will—and the last time I looked there was actually a Manager of Government Business who scheduled the passage of legislation in this place. If that is the best excuse, when you have the numbers and you cannot run this chamber, then you really need to rethink your whole approach.
The approach of the government to this issue is a perfect illustration of how this federal government operates. In the lead-up to the 2004 election the issue of skills shortages had finally started to gather some momentum, an issue that the Labor Party had been concerned about for quite some time. The Commonwealth government, after sitting on its collective hands for years, realised that it really had to do something about this. Its solution, first, was to blame everyone else for the problem and then to create a policy of building 24 Australian technical colleges to demonstrate that it had a solution. Two years on and we have five colleges. By the time of the next election, at this rate we could have seven, if we are lucky. It is little wonder, then, that the Prime Minister, as recently as 31 May this year, at the Minerals Council dinner, announced that the Australian technical college in the Pilbara had been approved. I do not believe that the Australian people would accept that delivering only 25 per cent of an election commitment from the 2004 election is at all satisfactory. That is because it is not.
The essential thrust of the policy announcement in 2004 was that the states and territories, through the TAFE system, a system that is well known to all Australians, had failed to provide sufficient training places—mainly, you would have to say, because the federal government cut funding to it, but that is obviously not of concern to those over there. So the government announced that the new Australian technical colleges would increase competition in the training sector and that business would have much greater input. It is passing strange, then, that the government could tie itself to a policy, supposedly as one of the measures to overcome the chronic skills shortages faced by our economy, by starting from the ground up at a cost in excess of $300 million to fund an alternative training college system that may deliver its first apprentice by the year 2010—a long way from the 2004 election commitment.
Consider that. We are facing a skills shortage and, rather than dealing with it by working with the states and territories, rather than expanding TAFE colleges that are already able to offer trades training, the Commonwealth embarks on a completely different stream of training that will not see a graduate perhaps until 2010—all those wasted years. Two years since the policy was announced and not one apprentice has been delivered. So much for the government’s concern about the skills shortage: two years and only five colleges. This is a wasted opportunity for Australian industry, for the Australian labour market and, most importantly, for young Australians wanting to undertake an apprenticeship. The government has wasted millions of dollars and two years creating an alternative training system to that which is already out there and delivering apprentices. Rather than trying to strengthen or improve the current system it has simply thrown the baby out with the bathwater and started from scratch.
I have to admit that, even at the time of the announcement in 2004, there were those of us who could see where this policy was heading. It was clear that simply announcing that 24 Australian technical colleges would be created was a dangerous fiction. The problem with policy announcements like this one is that there is an expectation created, an expectation that these colleges would be up and operating as quickly as possible and helping to overcome skills shortages. It was clear that any policy that aimed to create new technical colleges from the ground up was going to take time—and, so far, we have seen just that: two years for five colleges. At this rate it will take about 10 years to deliver all 24. You cannot simply wish for these colleges to exist: there is land to purchase or lease, buildings to construct or hire, staff to hire and train, procedures and guidelines to be developed, tendering proposals to be drafted and so on. There was always going to be a significant amount of time and effort consumed in the setting up of these colleges—an entirely new system. In that sense they could be seen to be a bit like that most efficient hospital in Britain, in the Yes, Prime Minister series on television. The most efficient hospital was the one that had no patients. So far, we have 24 colleges on paper, with very few students.

Senator Conroy interjecting—

—As I say, so too with the Australian technical colleges. The amount of effort and money that had to be expended to get going always meant that we were heading towards the situation we currently face: two years, five colleges and very few students. A policy announcement at election time is one thing. The implementation of that policy when you are in government is how you will be measured. It is clear that the government was far too optimistic about how Australian technical colleges would be implemented. There is now a huge deficit in this country when it comes to skills, a deficit that those of us on this side have been concerned about for quite some time.
The Australian technical colleges that were meant to be turning out 7,500 students each and every year are so far delivering fewer than 100. Even if all the colleges are up and running within the next two years—which, you would have to say, is a big ask considering it took two years to get five of them going—the Australian labour market will still be waiting three or more years before an appreciable number of trainees will be entering the labour market. That is simply not good enough. If the government were serious about overcoming skills shortages then they would have worked with the states and the territories to overcome the problems that they perceived with the TAFE system. If they were serious, they would have developed policies that would not require waiting years and years for a single graduate to appear. If they were serious, they would have opened more than five colleges within two years.
This is an election policy announcement that may have garnered support back in 2004 but so far has failed to deliver. It is clear that it was seen as one of the key policy announcements from the last election campaign and was mentioned by the Liberal Party director in his address to the National Press Club back in 2004 as one of the key policy initiatives of the Howard government. The director of the Liberal Party actually claimed that it was a well thought out policy that had been worked on for 12 months prior to the election. If that is the case, it is even more scandalous that, two years after the election, we are still waiting on the delivery.
I suspect, actually, that that work was all about where the 24 technical colleges would be sited for the greatest political advantage, rather than being constructive work on meeting the skills shortages needs in our economy. It is clear, to me at least, that sufficient time was spent on this aspect, but that they failed to do all the other work that was required. The reality is that the Australian people have been sold a three-legged horse; it looks like it will run until such a time as it actually has to. For all of the fanfare and the rhetoric, most of the colleges will not be operating until next year—all things being equal, that is. It is an interesting policy: it announced in one election year that most of the colleges would not start operating until the next election year and that no graduates would be delivered until the election year after that.
So the Australian people get a policy announcement in 2004 that, by 2007, most but not all of the technical colleges will be up and running, all things being equal; and, finally, by 2010, there will be some tradespeople. What a nonsensical implementation of what should be a straightforward approach to fixing a crisis in our economy! This was all brought about because the Commonwealth government had to go and set up their own system. Rather than working with the states and territories, the Commonwealth government thought they knew best. They would rather expend over $300 million to set up yet another system that, at its peak, will only deliver just over 7,500 students.
It is interesting to consider what the current shortfall of tradespeople in Australia is. Figures suggest that even at the present time we are short by something in the order of tens of thousands. At the rate that these technical colleges will be graduating people, we will never, ever address that shortfall. Little wonder then that there are over 40,000 holders of temporary work visas in Australia—there is an exercise in window-dressing going on. At most, when all 24 technical colleges are up and running, we will get, as I say, 7,500 students. We have over 40,000 skilled workers from overseas at the current time, not counting the 45,000 people who are overstaying their visas, of course—that is another issue. So we have a situation where, as a bare minimum, the Australian government know that the skills shortage amounts to something like 40,000 people as of this moment; their answer to that is to create these technical colleges that will train, at best, 7,500 students per year.
That is the same ridiculous situation that we have with doctors in this country. When the government came into office they slashed the number of training places. Years down the track we end up with—guess what?—shortages of doctors. The government’s solution was to increase the number of training places for doctors. The knock-on effect from that was reported to me during a discussion with the Perth and Hills Division of General Practice recently. The knock-on effect from the influx of students is that someone actually has to train them. So doctors, who are already in short supply, are now expected to spend valuable time training all those new medical students—yet another crisis we did not have to have.
All this demonstrates that it was the initial decision that was flawed—and so it is with the skills shortages in Australia. As I have said on numerous occasions, skills shortages do not appear without warning or lead indicators. The government’s decision back in the nineties to slash funding to TAFEs is a major contributor to the problems we now face. The solution of developing a new system from the ground up is not going to seriously address the shortages for years to come, if at all. Even blind Freddy knows that to create a completely new training system takes time—time that in the heat of an election campaign is not important but which in dealing with skills shortages is critical.
I know that the organisations that have tendered to operate the colleges will do an excellent job. My criticism of the Australian technical colleges is not a criticism of the organisations that will operate them. In fact, TAFE is involved in operating the one in the Pilbara—even though the government decided they did not want to fund the TAFE system, they are happy to work with it to establish the new technical college. Nor is my criticism of the students who will choose to enrol at the colleges. My criticism is directed fair and square at the Howard government.
This policy was always going to be difficult to implement. This policy was always going to be time consuming. It was never about delivering a real solution to the skills shortages that are being experienced in our economy. This policy was for an election campaign. It was to tell the Australian people that the government had a plan and was going to deliver. Well, the proof of the pudding is in the eating, as they say. Two years on and there are only five colleges open. Two years on and three locations are now being told that they may lose their technical colleges because the minister is not satisfied with the proposals that have been lodged. For the young people of Ballina, Queanbeyan and Dubbo the policy has so far absolutely failed to deliver. We can all hope that the remainder of the technical colleges are up and running as soon as possible and that they contribute to overcoming the skills shortages. However, based on progress to date, the Australian people are right to be concerned about this policy. Given that there is going to be an election next year, if the government comes out and announces the creation of additional technical colleges, at least the Australian people will then know what time it will take before the system is up and operating.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN TECHNICAL COLLEGES (FLEXIBILITY IN ACHIEVING AUSTRALIA’S SKILLS NEEDS) AMENDMENT BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,10,1,speech
"Stephens, Sen Ursula",ALP,2006-08-10,"—I rise to make a contribution to this debate on the Australian Technical Colleges (Flexibility in Achieving Australia’s Skills Needs) Amendment Bill 2006. Before commencing, I really should declare my interest, which is the fact that I spent 10 years in the TAFE system. So I do understand that TAFEs used to be resourced and had the capacity to very flexibly respond to industry needs. That is not the case any more. I have to say, I think the whole Australian technical colleges scheme is one of the great examples of the incompetence of this government because, despite the skills shortages that the country faces, we can see, as we saw in the May budget this year, that there is absolutely nothing to address the skills needs.
There was no money for TAFE—why were we surprised? There was an overall reduction in the percentage of the budget spent on vocational education and training. There was a $13.7 million cut from a program to encourage apprenticeships in rural and regional areas, and there was the abolition of the $38½ million program aimed at getting more women in non-traditional apprenticeships such as construction and automotive trades. There was no extra money allocated in the next four years for the National Skills Shortages Strategy. So why are we surprised? It beggars belief that this government can neglect Australia’s skills development during a time of such unprecedented prosperity. This government is so out of touch that it has no idea about the hurt that Australian families are feeling now.
Labor supported the original technical colleges bill last year, and we are supporting this amendment bill in order to allow the money to be spent more quickly. But it remains the case that establishing 25 Australian technical colleges is the only answer that the Howard government has to address the chronic skills crisis that Australia is experiencing. It is important that the government seriously addresses the problems that we face now, and will face in the future, in providing the required skilled workforce. Senator Webber focused a little in her remarks on the issues in Western Australia.
Unfortunately, the Howard government has taken a long-term and very problematic approach to the issue. The act proposed establishing 25 technical colleges that would cater for up to 7½ thousand year 11 and 12 students. The government nominated 25 regions across Australia where the colleges were to be placed. In my home state of New South Wales, they were to be located in Gosford, Dubbo, the Hunter, the Illawarra, Lismore, Ballina, Port Macquarie, Queanbeyan and Western Sydney.
Since I started my term in the Senate in 2002, I have observed the Howard government incompetently administer a number of programs, but this one takes the cake. This program has been a dog’s breakfast from the start, and once again we have seen a minister making policy on the run. If we look at progress to date, of those 25 proposed colleges, five have commenced operation. On 31 July, the fifth—the Northern Tasmania College—opened. But, as Senator Webber said, most of them are scheduled for 2007.
There is a difference between having these colleges opened and actually having students attending. During the budget estimates hearings, it was revealed that some of these technical colleges are not exactly enjoying full levels of enrolment. In fact, one—Gladstone Technical College in Queensland—has a grand enrolment total of two students. During Senate estimates, Senator Wong asked Ms Johnston: ‘How many students are currently enrolled at Gladstone?’ Ms Johnston replied: ‘There are only one or two I think at the moment.’ That reflects exactly what is going on in the technical colleges process. At the time of the last election campaign, the Prime Minister said:
The technical colleges are the centrepiece of our drive to tackle skills shortages and to revolutionise vocational education and training throughout Australia.
Heaven help a revolution that has two students enrolled at one of these colleges. The Prime Minister might be good at flowery rhetoric, but the reality of the technical colleges comes nowhere near matching that rhetoric.
The concept of Australian technical colleges is another step in the government’s assault on industrial relations and education. The Australian technical colleges further privatise our education system and potentially they will damage enrolments and available courses at nearby high schools. Individual contracts and performance pay appear to be the modus operandi of the colleges.
The government talks about the fact that local industry and communities will have a leadership role in the governance of the colleges. The colleges will teach the skills required by local business. There is a real danger that the courses will become enterprise rather than industry focused, resulting in young people gaining qualifications that cannot be transported across industries. The real ideological attack is on public education and the government’s underhanded attempt to deregulate the national training system. In abolishing the Australian National Training Authority, the government is increasing the already heavy influence of peak industry bodies such as the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the Business Council of Australia.
The prospect of AWAs being forcibly inflicted upon public sector agencies, enshrined in the agencies’ very existence, and upon more Australians betrays the government’s belief that the creeping advance of AWAs is a higher political priority than training our kids for work and providing the economy with the skilled workforce that it needs.
Australia needs a more systematic approach to promoting trades and science and technology education than the government’s 25 technical colleges. If this is the best this government can do, I have no doubt Australians will look to Labor’s plan. Labor will work collaboratively and constructively with the state and territory governments, not start a federal versus state slanging match—as we have seen—to tackle the problem. Labor will provide sound training opportunities to increase the take-up of such training that establishes long-term careers and benefits to industry.
The government should have been spending the last 18 months getting the technical colleges up and running. Instead it has wasted time. It has wasted the past 10 years standing idly by as the looming skills crisis brewed right before its eyes. I am sure it is no surprise to anyone on this side of the chamber to learn that Australia is the only developed country which has actually reduced public investment in TAFEs and universities—in fact, by eight per cent since 1995. The OECD average is an embarrassing 38 per cent increase, yet the best that this government can manage when it comes to investing in knowledge is an appalling eight per cent overall decline.
On budget night we saw yet another wasted opportunity. The Treasurer could have used his $17 billion surplus to invest in the skills of our workforce. Instead he did nothing. The budget was all about the Howard government giving up on increasing productivity by not acting on this skills crisis. It was the Howard government believing that an adequate response to the skills crisis is to have some technical colleges graduate a ridiculous 350 students in 2010. It was the Howard government saying that an eight per cent decrease in public investment in universities and TAFEs is an adequate response. And it was the Howard government saying that stripping the rights of workers through its extreme industrial relations regime is an adequate response.
The Howard government would know this if some of them lived in the real world and asked some real people about it. They should, for example, start by asking the 300,000 Australians they have turned away from university and TAFE whether it is an adequate response. Or they could ask all those workers around Australia who have been sacked and then rehired on less pay and worse conditions whether it is an adequate response. The answer is clearly no. It is not an adequate response; it is a pathetic response.
A real response would be to take up Labor’s proposals to promote skills training in our schools. Under Labor, trades technology and science would be taught in first-class facilities; a Trades in Schools scheme would double the number of school based apprenticeships and provide extra funding per place; specialist schools would be established to teach trades technology and science in senior schools; and a Trades Taster program would allow years 9 and 10 students to experience a range of trade options. We need to give our kids a go at trades in our schools. We need to get them involved early. Labor’s skills-in-schools plan would get them in and Labor’s plan to overhaul the New Apprenticeships scheme would keep them in.
Many senators would be aware that just such a scheme was announced in New South Wales recently. The New South Wales Premier, Morris Iemma, and education minister Carmel Tebbutt announced an initiative that will allow HSC students to complete school based apprenticeships one day a week. Under the plan, 10 stand-alone trade schools will be established over the next 12 months and will create hundreds of apprenticeships and traineeships and tackle local skills shortages. Students will be able to undertake industry standard training in subjects such as hospitality, health care, construction, automotive and engineering. In this way students will gain a trade qualification while completing their HSC.
The plan will see an expansion of vocational education and training programs in schools. Currently, at least 30 per cent of New South Wales HSC students choose at least one VET course for their HSC. Under Labor’s apprenticeships plan, a range of initiatives would be offered to increase the number of young Australians completing their training. These would include an $800 per year skills account, which would help to abolish up-front fees. They would also include a $2,000 trade completion bonus under which apprentices in traditional trades would receive a $1,000 payment halfway through their training and a further $1,000 payment at the completion of their apprenticeship. This scheme will aim to bolster the Howard government’s pathetic 40 per cent apprenticeship completion rate to at least 80 per cent. Labor is also committed to abolishing the Howard government’s skilled migration visa so that young Australians are given the opportunity to train first. Labor’s plan recognises that young Australians are crying out for opportunities and that Australian businesses are crying out for skilled workers, tradespeople, chefs and childcare workers.
This government has deliberately denigrated learning, particularly under the former Minister for Education, Science and Training and now Minister for Defence, Dr Nelson. He developed this technique of appealing to people who have not been to university, particularly less educated older people who grew up in a different era when very few people went to university, and sending out a message saying, ‘All you hardworking Aussies are paying for all these people in universities who don’t really contribute very much to the real world anyway.’ That message from Dr Nelson has been very overt. It has been supplemented by statements from the Prime Minister to the effect that leaving school after year 10 is perfectly reasonable.
In some cases, it is not unreasonable. Of course, in bygone times most people did. There is nothing wrong with that and there is nothing wrong with people who, 20 or 30 years ago, did leave school after year 10 and in many cases went on to develop skills on the job. But that is in the past. It certainly does not make us a productive country, and it is the wrong message to be putting out now to 15-year-olds. It is appalling that government ministers are sending out these powerful signals that are saying that learning does not matter and is really for those pointy-headed types who are not practical. As someone who recently completed a doctorate, I find that an appalling message and it is something that the Howard government will be condemned for.
If there is one thing that is going to ensure that Australia prospers and that we have a broadly based, diverse economy with a strong manufacturing sector and a strong services sector that will continue, it is going to be a profound national commitment to learning in all its forms: learning on the job, learning in TAFE colleges, learning through apprenticeships, learning in universities, learning in schools and learning in preschools. We need a national campaign to instil a much stronger commitment in our community to the values around learning.
As I have said, the Howard government in the most recent budget cut $13.7 million from an incentive program to encourage rural and regional businesses to take on apprentices. This is holding back our regions, where communities are struggling to retain trained people. Australians deserve better than this half-hearted attempt to fix our skills crisis. They deserve a coordinated effort. They deserve COAG—every state premier and the Prime Minister of this nation—getting together to fix the problem.
There is a clear choice before the electorate. There is a distinct point of difference between the do-nothing approach of the Howard government and the Labor Party’s commitment to improving young Australians’ access to and success within the workforce. It is clear this government cannot fix the skills shortage and it is obvious they have given up on it. We in the Labor Party want to see young Australians have access to affordable training, to incentives to work hard and complete their training, to employable skills and to a great future serving their own communities and taking pride in that work and the contribution they make.
That is not what we are seeing from the Howard government. We will only see it from a Labor government, and we have seen it from the New South Wales Labor government, which announced the new trade schools where each trade school will specialise in the trade skills shortages areas identified for the state. Students have the option of undertaking a school based apprenticeship, and apprentices continue their training beyond school for up to three years so they can work in licensed trades such as construction or automotive. Students will have access to specialist industry-standard facilities such as electronic calibrated lathes, commercial quality stoves and modified, safe, construction work sites. School based apprentices and school based trainees will be on the job for approximately one day each week. For the rest of the week, these students will be completing the off-the-job component of their training as well as completing their HSC subjects.
Students will get recognition for all the work they complete. A school based apprentice or trainee who undertakes part-time training in years 11 and 12 will get their qualification a year earlier. They will have access to new industry support services which will place them in jobs to complete their training. We can see that that is a practical approach that will allow industries and local economies to benefit from having more job-ready graduates to take on work in key skills shortage areas. That is not what the Australian technical colleges are going to deliver. They will deliver a paltry number of apprentices, perhaps by 2010, and that is a disgrace.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN TECHNICAL COLLEGES (FLEXIBILITY IN ACHIEVING AUSTRALIA’S SKILLS NEEDS) AMENDMENT BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,10,1,speech
"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,2006-08-10,"—The main purpose of the Australian Technical Colleges (Flexibility in Achieving Australia’s Skills Needs) Amendment Bill 2006 is to bring forward funding for the establishment and operation of the proposed 25 Australian technical colleges. Funding will be brought forward from the 2008-09 years to meet expenditure in 2006-07. This amendment also includes regulation-making power for situations where funding needs to be carried forward or moved to another calendar year, thereby removing the need for amendments such as this. The total amount of the funding committed to these colleges by this government will remain the same.
The government claim the need to bring forward funding is due to the significant progress made on setting up these colleges. One, of course, would question the use of the words ‘significant progress’ in this policy area. Of the 25 proposed colleges, successful applications or agreements have been completed on only 22. Even slower is the progress on actually having them open, with only five having actual students, making up a total of under 350 students. The government’s original proposal was for 300 students at each of the colleges, not in total. I said in my speech last year on the Australian technical colleges bill 2005 that I thought it would be difficult to find 300 students for each college—supposedly doing, as they would be, both trade and Higher School Certificate studies. It would seem likely the numbers will remain below the original estimates.
Remember these are the colleges which represent a part of the government’s answer to our long-term, growing and ever-increasing skills shortage. The other part is letting in thousands of skilled migrants, where minimal requirements for checking their qualifications are imposed. Only five colleges open with only 350 students seems somewhat less than significant progress.
The proposed Australian technical college in Darwin, in Solomon, in my own electorate, seems to have had not significant progress but significant problems in putting together a proposal and getting its act together. This has been put back and back, and it seems that business involvement in education may be a bit outside of their area of expertise or ability. I understand any progress made has been largely due to the involvement of Group Training NT. I am certainly aware that Minister Gary Hardgrave had to make a flying visit to Darwin some time in the last couple of months to urge them to get their act together—probably because he wanted to save face over this announcement.
Furthermore, according to information from officers at estimates, as at 30 May 2006 only $18 million had been spent—so why the need to bring forward funding? Little enough seems to have been spent to date. It is worth noting that any financial information was not easy to draw out at estimates. DEST refused to provide any information on individual colleges. Government departments seem to be getting much more adept at hiding information from scrutiny, with the backing, of course, of relevant government ministers. The Senate Employment, Workplace Relations and Education Legislation Committee opposition senators’ report into the provisions of this bill expresses concern at the lack of financial transparency surrounding these colleges. They comment that DEST have refused to give any funding details of the contracts actually signed to date but have provided only the overall, total figures.
So here we are with a government commitment to fund 25 colleges to turn out tradespeople to lessen our ever-growing skills shortage—a skills shortage which the Howard government knew about for years and did nothing about except complacently watch it grow and grow and get worse year by year. In fact, even worse, while they sat and watched and refused to increase funding, hundreds of thousands of young people were turned away due to a lack of TAFE places. They were told loud and long and warned about the skills shortage by industry groups and by TAFE Directors Australia and, just as now, with much legislation, they failed to listen. In their complacency or arrogance they said they knew better.
The government refused to provide any growth funding in the vocational education and training area for six of the past nine years. All they did was blame the states and territories or the workers—anyone but themselves. They are ever ready to claim any credit for any success but never, ever prepared to accept any blame for any failure in this policy area. They claimed to be having great success with traineeships and apprenticeships—unfortunately, not in the right places. Traineeships in retail trades were the main areas to get the numbers, along with hospitality, but many of these starters also failed to finish. The traditional trades languished with declining numbers over the years. This is a government that has steadfastly followed their rigid ideology of cutting funds to public education and/or attaching funding to extreme industrial relations requirements. These are then pushed through by nasty, bully-boy tactics.
We now see the results, with industry struggling to find skilled workers in the trades area. My latest information from my own city of Darwin is that the waterfront project desperately needs up to 50 more concreters and they are just not available. Again, the government reaction is not to greatly increase funds for education and training in order to upskill our population and value add to our primary production. No—what they want to do is simply import tens of thousands of overseas workers while at the same time ramming through workplace legislation that will see Aussie workers’ pay and conditions slide downhill. They think cheaper labour is the answer, not more skills and training.
We saw a recent OECD report for 2006 commenting on the low priority that the government put on training, but then this is not the first year that they have done so. For several years now the OECD has commented critically on Australia being the only developed nation to have continually reduced public spending on education and training. The Howard government’s record in spending on public education and training is, in fact, a disgrace. Public spending on higher education and TAFE has fallen in Australia by eight per cent since 1995 in real terms. The OECD average is an increase of 38 per cent.
We do not oppose the Australian technical colleges as such, as with such a mean-minded government any spending on education and training is an improvement—albeit far too little and far too late. Any additional resources going into trade training and skill development are welcome. Urgent action is needed to address our national skills shortage. However, the whole decision about the technical colleges appears to have been made initially on the run and with no consultation—another thought bubble from the Prime Minister. Ever since, it seems that neither the bureaucracy nor the stakeholders have been able to catch up in the implementation of the idea in any really organised or convincing way.
The implementation is just like most of the changes in Indigenous education funding: poorly thought out and poorly executed. Here we are, months down the track, with only five colleges open and 350 students enrolled nationally. These students are years away from a trade and being qualified, and then there will only be a handful compared to the need. These colleges are most definitely too little and too late. The first qualified tradespeople from these colleges will not be turned out until 2010. By then the demand for skilled workers will have grown still more, so these few hundred qualifying from these colleges will scarcely be more than a drop in the ocean.
This is certainly not a sign of a successful policy idea. Had the appropriation of $343.6 million been given to already existing state and territory training bodies we could be fairly certain that a lot more than 350 additional students would be enrolled already. But, as I have said, ideology has played a major part in this whole process—the ideology of privatisation, of keeping out unions and of workers being on AWAs. There should be no room for blinkered ideology in education, which is an investment in our national future. But unfortunately that has not been the way of this government, and all education funding has been tainted with their ideology, from schools right through to tertiary education. The result is the massive skills shortage that is a major threat to our economic growth and productivity.
Australia must invest in skills training, and Labor will do that. The government have already failed badly in this area. While Labor support this bill we do so only to help, in any small way, a seriously stricken aspect of our education system. We do so to at least enable a few more young Australians to get a sound training for the future. We can only condemn the Howard government for failing to acknowledge and act earlier on the skills crisis; for reducing expenditure on vocational education and training; for the incompetent implementation of these technical colleges; for the apparent secrecy about the funding and operations of these colleges to date; for their complete failure to provide enough extra skills training to meet the future demand; and for the forecasted shortfall of 100,000 skilled workers by 2010.
We believe that a far more cooperative approach with the states and territories is needed, and far more than these 25 colleges are needed. When the Labor government is elected we will work with the states and territories. Our blueprint outlines our proposals for getting skills into schools. A Labor government would bring trades into schools in a similar way that these technical colleges do, but into all schools and not just a handful of private colleges. Students would have the opportunity to experience a range of trades in years 9 and 10 before making any final decisions. We would have specialist schools for certain trades.
We would overhaul the struggling New Apprenticeships system, or Australian apprenticeship system, as I understand it is now called. At present at least 40 per cent of apprenticeship starters do not complete their courses. Imagine if we could get those young people to complete their training. Labor would turn that around by offering a $2,000 trade completion bonus so that we would give young people an incentive to finish their trade. We would pay the TAFE fees of traditional trade apprentices and childcare trainees to encourage them into trades and childcare work. Labor’s priority is all about training Australians first and training them now—not, by contrast, doing what this government is doing: going for a quick-fix approach and bringing in tradesmen or women from overseas with minimal checks on their actual qualifications. Unlike this government, Labor would give priority to education and training and see it as an investment in our future, not as an ideological plaything to be messed around with.
While we support this bill—it gives some crumbs of funding to vocational education and training—we condemn the government for a decade of failure in this area; for creating a skills crisis during its 10 long years in office; for its continued failure to provide the necessary opportunities for Australians to get the training they need to do a decent job and meet the skills needs of the economy; for reducing the overall percentage of the federal budget spent on vocational education and training, and allowing this percentage of spending to further decline over the forward estimates period; for its incompetent handling of the Australian technical colleges initiative as evidenced by only five out of the 25 colleges being open for business, and enrolling fewer than 350 students; for failing to be open and accountable about the operations of the Australian technical colleges, including details of extra student enrolments, funding levels for the individual colleges, course structures and programs; for denying local communities their promised Australian technical college because of their ideological industrial relations requirements; and for failing to provide enough extra skills training so that Australia can meet the expected shortfall of 100,000 skilled workers by 2010.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN TECHNICAL COLLEGES (FLEXIBILITY IN ACHIEVING AUSTRALIA’S SKILLS NEEDS) AMENDMENT BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,10,1,speech
"Sterle, Sen Glenn",ALP,2006-08-10,"—I rise to speak in favour of the Labor Party’s amendments to the Australian Technical Colleges (Flexibility in Achieving Australia’s Skills Needs) Amendment Bill 2006. For 10 long years the Howard government has failed to provide young Australians with the training they need to get a decent job. For 10 long years the Howard government has failed to invest in the skills Australia needs to raise productivity and sustain economic growth. For 10 long years the Howard government has continued to reduce the overall percentage of the federal budget spent on vocational education and training, and it stands condemned for the skills crisis it has created. Neglecting Australia’s skills development is an act of gross incompetence by the Howard government that will hurt the Australian economy and hurt it hard.
A more appropriate name for this bill would be the Australia Technical Colleges (Sorry, We Buggered up the Costings on the First Act) Amendment Bill 2006, because all it does is bring funding forward for the proposed Australian technical colleges from 2008-09 to 2006-07. This bill does not create one additional training place or apprenticeship or even increase the level of investment in Australia’s skills base over the forward estimates by one cent. All this bill does is allow the Howard government the opportunity to address the fact that it botched the costings in the original act. The skills shortage Australia faces is the biggest barrier to future economic growth and improved productivity, but the Howard government has botched its one and only policy response to this problem.
But do not take my word for it. In the Australian Industry Group’s overview of the Howard government’s last budget, Heather Ridout had this to say:
... it is disappointing that more progress has not been made on the big nation-building goals of skills and innovation.
                  …         …         …
... investments in skills, innovation and infrastructure are required to build the competitiveness of Australian business and to assist in rebalancing the economy as the current minerals boom begins to fade.
Everybody knows that Australia’s economic prosperity will not continue without investment in skills; everybody knows that we must invest in Australian skills through strong and effective education and training programs; and everybody knows that the Howard government’s record in addressing this vital public policy need is nothing short of a disgrace.
Under the Howard government, Australia is the only developed country in the world to reduce public investment in TAFEs and universities over the last decade. Public investment in our TAFEs and universities by the Howard government has fallen eight per cent since 1995. The average public investment in postsecondary education for the rest of the industrialised world over that time shared an increase of 38 per cent. We are the only country in the OECD where public expenditure on postsecondary education in universities and TAFEs has been falling. To think that government members and senators have the hide to come into this parliament and bang on about what a wonderful job the Howard government is doing! This is not just a disgrace for the Howard government; it is a tragedy for Australia and, unless we dedicate a greater effort and priority to learning, we will continue to fall behind the rest of the world.
But the focus and investment has to be genuine, constructive and engaging. It should not be about simply playing politics, which sadly is what the Howard government is guilty of with these technical colleges. It appears that the main reason for the Howard government establishing these colleges is to force workers into Australian workplace agreements. Because the Howard government is obsessed with smashing unions, it has created these greenfield sites to prevent collective bargaining. Why else is it that the only reference to an industrial instrument in the entire summary of employment arrangements for Australian technical colleges is the reference to individual contracts? The Howard government will set up these colleges and effectively force teachers to enter into Australian workplace agreements, whether or not they want to. So much for freedom of choice! At the Howard government’s insistence, all staff employed at an Australian technical college must be offered an individual contract. If a local college does not want to implement the government’s extreme industrial relations agenda then it will be cut off from the program.
The minister has failed to explain what enforcing an extreme industrial relations agenda has to do with training our future tradespeople. If it is not to ideologically pursue Australian workplace agreements, why not just provide the funding to institutions already in place, which are mainly TAFE colleges? It could be that, if the Howard government simply invested what it should in the TAFE system, it would not make for nearly as effective photo opportunities for marginal backbenchers.
When the Prime Minister announced the creation of the Australian technical colleges in his speech on 24 September 2004, he said that they would be ‘the centrepiece of our drive to tackle skills shortages and to revolutionise vocational education and training throughout Australia’. Let us examine this so-called revolutionary centrepiece against the numbers. At best, when all of these colleges are up and running at full capacity, which will not be until around 2010, they will produce approximately 7,500 tradespeople a year. If we put that figure into perspective, 7,500 students represent only two per cent of all Australian students in years 11 and 12. That is 20-odd colleges to cater for only two per cent of the relevant student population.
There is another figure we can compare this so-called revolutionary centrepiece to. According to the Howard government’s own Department of Education, Science and Training, 34,200 young Australians were turned away from TAFE in 2005 alone and 34,100 were turned away in 2004—the year of the Prime Minister’s policy speech—and yet the Howard government’s so-called revolutionary response to turning away 34,000 young Australians from TAFE in one year alone was to establish a parallel system of colleges that may produce 7,500 tradespeople by around 2010. To make matters worse, according to figures from the National Centre for Vocational Education Research, 33,500 new apprentices quit their courses in the September 2005 quarter while only 33,100 completed them. Far from being revolutionary, this is a totally inadequate response to a crisis which everyone acknowledges is imposing severe constraints on our future economic capacity.
It seems amazing to me that the government can find the funds to create a parallel system of TAFE colleges when we know that for years there has been a huge underspend in the technical and vocational education area, particularly on enabling our TAFE system to meet the unmet demand. Wouldn’t this money be better spent on projects that are already working on the ground instead of trying to establish an alternative, parallel TAFE system? After 10 long years, you would think the Howard government would have had the time to develop a more detailed plan than this to address Australia’s skills needs. It appears to me that it is making it up as it goes. This is policy on the run—just a paragraph in a campaign speech for the Prime Minister with no real planning for our future.
Australia deserves better than this. That is why the Australian Labor Party have already released a series of policy initiatives to give Australia’s skills base the investment it deserves. Last September Kim Beazley put out Labor’s skills blueprint. Labor have announced that we would overhaul the failed new apprentices scheme, and we will not import foreign apprentices while Aussie kids are being turned away from training. Labor have also announced that we will return fairness to IR laws and the shop floor.
Labor knows that action must be taken now to encourage people to complete their apprenticeships. That is why Labor will invest $170 million to abolish up-front TAFE fees and create a trade completion bonus of $2,000 per apprentice. This bonus will encourage more apprentices to complete their training in the traditional trades by paying them $1,000 halfway through their training and a further $1,000 at the completion of their apprenticeship. If this policy is successful in only halving the current drop-out rate, it will put an extra 10,000 qualified tradespeople into our workforce each and every year—far more than the Australian technical colleges will produce. Unfortunately, by contrast, we have a government that is incapable of implementing the one policy it has.
But Mr Stuart Henry, the member for Hasluck, does not seem to think so. In his speech in the second reading debate on this bill in the other place on 21 June 2006, he had this to say:
This bill is sheer good news. It does not affect the overall budget of $343.6 million for the program; it merely brings forward funding which had been allocated to the 2008-09 financial year so that it can be available in 2006-07.
So according to the member for Hasluck it is good news that the Howard government would introduce a bill into parliament about training that contains no additional funding—none at all! The member for Hasluck is easily pleased. The source of the member for Hasluck’s delight might better be found later in his speech when he said:
... in my own electorate the Australian technical college Perth South is set to commence in February 2007 and proposes to operate as a multicampus, non-government senior secondary college in Maddington and Armadale with a satellite campus based in Rockingham. My colleague the member for Canning and I were very pleased to be present for the signing of the Perth South ATC funding agreement by the Minister for Vocational and Technical Education, the Hon. Gary Hardgrave, at the ATC site in Maddington earlier this month—a great occasion for the local community.
I am sure I will see the photo of this event in his next newsletter. You would think from the member for Hasluck’s rapture that this college will be the only training centre in the region. It is not. The member for Hasluck’s photo opportunity buddy, the member for Canning, did make such claims in his second reading debate speech on this bill in the other place on 15 June. In that speech, the member for Canning claimed:
... the industrial strip in the Kwinana region is calling out for a technical college in that area ...
Mr Randall appears to be completely unaware that the Howard government’s Perth South Australian Technical College will overlap the area covered by Challenger TAFE.
Challenger TAFE has 11 industry training centres, including the WA Applied Engineering and Shipbuilding Training Centre and the WA Wool Technology Training Centre, with campuses and centres at Fremantle, Henderson, Murdoch, Peel, Rockingham, Heathcote Cultural Centre and Kwinana. The centres are closely aligned to the needs of industry. They are focused on targeting their training and employment services for the wider community, including for diverse and in many instances disadvantaged groups. Challenger TAFE’s Peel Campus is located on the site of Western Australia’s first co-located school, TAFE and university campus, in Mandurah. Challenger TAFE offers skills training in over 140 careers, ranging from aquaculture to welding. And yet the Howard government has decided that it needs to create a separate Australian technical college that duplicates some of the functions of Challenger TAFE and overlaps its geographic area.
I am baffled as to why the Howard government would want to set up an institution in competition to Challenger TAFE, which is an excellent institution. It must be that the Howard government has no respect for the good work that Challenger TAFE does. I am sure that if the Howard government provided the funding for the Perth South Australian Technical College to the Challenger TAFE it would not make for as good a photo opportunity. The headline would only read ‘Howard government provides long overdue investment to TAFE to meet unmet demand’, which does not make for nearly as good propaganda.
If we look at the comments made by Mr Don Randall, the member for Canning, in his speech in the second reading debate on this bill in the other place on 15 June, we can get an appreciation of the government’s logic in introducing this bill. In that speech Mr Randall made the bold claim:
The 24 Australian technical colleges will concentrate on skills, not alternative type arrangements such as we cop in the TAFEs now—aromatherapy, flower arranging and transcendental meditation courses.
Now, I searched through the Challenger TAFE website and I could not find a single reference to transcendental meditation courses. What I found were references to certificates courses in aluminium fabrication, electrotechnology and wool classing. To be fair to the member for Canning—and I must be fair—I did find a reference to flower arranging in Challenger TAFE’s certificate in floristry course. But if Mr Randall wants to denigrate the small business owners who struggle to make a living for their families as florists in his electorate—hardworking people like Barbara who runs Barbara for Flowers in the suburb of Byford in the heart of his electorate—then be it on his head. What a tool! Mr Randall further disgraced himself by claiming:
As a result of the states having dropped the ball on training in their TAFEs, the federal government has had to fill the vacuum. The 24 Australian technical colleges will fill this vacuum in training.
As I explained earlier, 34,200 does not go into 7,500. I have tried many times but I cannot make it go in. If the member for Canning honestly believes that the 7,500 tradespeople these colleges will produce in 2010 in any way makes up for the 34,200 young Australians that were turned away from TAFE last year alone, then I suggest that the only vacuum is the one inside the member for Canning’s head. But wait, there is more. The member for Canning finally stuffed his other foot into his mouth when he said:
… teachers in the local TAFEs in my area tell me that there are more teachers and more administrators in the TAFEs than there are students …
and, wait for it—
… they get paid exorbitant wages and generally end up with a car …
What an absolute drongo! If it is too many staff getting paid too much money that the member for Canning is worried about then I am sure the Howard government’s insistence on the use of AWAs will ensure that the few teachers in these new colleges will be paid very poor wages. The travesty is that pork chops like the member for Canning were ever allowed near a classroom. At least in the parliament he is not doing damage—
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. I think that Senator Sterle just used comments about the member for Canning which were unwise and, I suspect, outside standing orders. I know that you were speaking with the Clerk but I ask you to have a discussion with the people at the table and ask Senator Sterle to withdraw those remarks.
 (Senator Watson)—Yes, it is true, I was speaking to the Clerk, because I think the honourable senator is going very close to offending standing orders and I draw his attention to that.
—Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. I do not disagree that money should be brought forward in the budget to provide training for young people. However, I have to challenge the motives of the government and the lack of preparation and consideration of the needs of young Australians it has shown with this policy. If there has been a need to provide greater training, why has it taken 10 long years after the election of the Howard government to do anything about it? Australia will only continue to prosper on the basis of genuine skills, knowledge and capability. When governments consider the photo opportunity needs of marginal members over the needs of those who are marginalised in our society, democracy fails.
—We may have to review Hansard, because I think you referred to a member in the other place as a ‘pork chop’ or something, which is unfortunate and outside standing orders—
—Rude and crude and quite unnecessary!
Honourable senators interjecting—
—Order! I think the matter is such that I might have to refer it to the President.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN TECHNICAL COLLEGES (FLEXIBILITY IN ACHIEVING AUSTRALIA’S SKILLS NEEDS) AMENDMENT BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,10,1,speech
"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2006-08-10,"—Even for someone of Senator Sterle’s limited ability, that speech was really an embarrassment to all of us in this chamber. To use words like ‘drongo’ and ‘pork chop’ to advance his argument simply reflects more on the speaker than on the people he was accusing. Mr Randall, to whom he was referring, leaves Senator Sterle for dead when it comes to representing his constituents and doing a good job for the people of Western Australia. Senator Sterle’s speech was obviously written by the union to which he is beholden for his position here and he could not even say his jokes without reading them from the text prepared by the union. Totally in contravention of standing orders, Senator Sterle read every single word of his speech, even the jokes that one would have hoped anyone with a modicum of wit could have done spontaneously.
I do not want to spend my speech reflecting on the embarrassment of the speech before mine but I just highlight Senator Sterle’s argument against the Australian Technical Colleges (Flexibility in Achieving Australia’s Skills Needs) Amendment Bill 2006. Do you know what his argument is? It is that all the teachers that work there will be forced into AWAs. That is what Senator Sterle says this bill is about. It is to force teachers to take AWAs. There was nothing about the skills shortages in Australia which desperately need attending to. I am sorry that Senator Sterle is leaving, because if he were to stay and listen he might learn something about the bill and the skills shortages.
He might want to reflect on when this skills shortage started. It was in those 13 long years of Labor control of this country when unemployment rose and when it was made so difficult for employers to take on apprentices. That is when the skills shortage that we currently have started. It was never a big issue in Labor days because unemployment was so high that there were a lot of skilled people unemployed in those days. Labor simply could not get it right. Business was strangled by the unions, and inept government at federal level and the unemployment level meant that there was no shortage of skilled labour. You were very lucky if you could get a job, whether you were skilled or otherwise. That is Labor’s legacy when it comes to skills and workplace relations.
We are in a position now where, because of the great work of Peter Costello and John Howard, we almost have over full employment in this country. Business in all forms is booming and there is a definite employment shortage in most parts of Australia and certainly a huge skills shortage—and I want to highlight a couple of those later on. Senator Sterle’s commentary seemed to be an attempt to attack the Western Australian Liberal members of parliament in the House of Representatives. If that is the best that the Labor Party can do—to try to attack the great work that all of those Liberal MHRs from Western Australia are doing—then I feel for the Labor Party. Not only will they make no inroads against the sitting Liberal members, I predict, but my understanding is that there will be a couple of Labor seats in Western Australia that will fall to the Liberal Party again at the next election. When they put up people like Senator Sterle to try and run the battle we know they are running up the white flag.
This bill is a wonderful news bill. It is all about bringing forward the funding for the Australian technical colleges from the 2008-09 funding year to 2006-07. What a wonderful thing to have an amending bill for. The whole process has gone much more quickly and smoothly than was even anticipated by the promoters and those who initiated this wonderful program of the Howard government. We have to bring forward the funding because the technical colleges have progressed at such a great rate and we need the money earlier. To date, the Australian government has announced 21 successful technical college proposals. Four of them—in Gladstone, Eastern Melbourne, the Gold Coast and Port Macquarie—have already commenced operations. Another, in northern Tasmania—your state, Acting Deputy President Watson—will open this month. Most of the others are scheduled to open in 2007. Australian technical colleges will be up and running in North Brisbane, Adelaide South, Bendigo, Bairnsdale-Sale, Perth South and, I am delighted to add, North Queensland.
I am concerned, as are all others on this side, about the lack of skilled labour in Australia. As I said, the lack of skilled people really relates back to the Labor days, when they did nothing about this and discouraged apprenticeships and employment opportunities. Recently, my Liberal Party Senate colleagues from Queensland and I were in Charleville, in south-western Queensland—a little town with 3,000 or 4,000 people, right out in the west. If you go a bit further, you reach Cunnamulla and then Birdsville, so it is really right out there. Would you believe the big problem in that town is the lack of skilled people in the meat processing industry? That little town has two wonderful meat processing factories in operation. The first is operated by a group called Western Exports. They slaughter goats. They cannot keep up with the demand for goat meat around the world. They export all of their product to the USA. Exports to the USA are tariff free—another benefit of the free trade agreement with the USA.
Of the goats that are processed through that factory, 70 per cent are farmed and 30 per cent are feral. That processing plant suffers for only one reason: they cannot get labour to work in the factory. They have advertised everywhere. They currently employ 150 people; they need another 50. Of the 150 people currently working there, 10 families are from Vietnam. They are in Australia under section 457 visas. The meat processing plant management want more people. From memory, they have arranged for another 10 employees to come to their town. Regrettably, because of spoilt-brat unions’ operations, I think you would say—unions very closely scrutinise all of the section 457 invitees to Australia—the process in dealing with the ones who are desperately needed to keep this processing plant going has been very slow. I have spoken to the minister about it. She understands the need, and her department is working through the applications. It is a slow process because the checking has to be very careful.
All of the people coming in are skilled people, because we do not have skilled meat processing workers in Australia who are able to do the job. The section 457 visa holders are paid the standard wage that all of the, you might say, home-grown Australian processors, whom they work with side-by-side in this factory, are paid. They get something like $37,000 a year. It is a great industry, a great employment generator for south-west Queensland, a great Australian enterprise, and it is harmed because we cannot get people to actually work in the processing factory.
In my inspection of the plant not only did I see a few Vietnamese people—of course, there are mainly Australian born and bred workers—but I was delighted to see a significant number of Indigenous people working in the factory as skilled boners and slicers. Some of the product is slaughtered so that it is halal and can be used in Islamic communities in the United States, where the product goes. It is a great industry, suffering only because we cannot get the labour from within Australia to those places.
I congratulate the owner of Western Exports, Neil Duncan—a guy who had a vision, some enthusiasm and a bit of courage and took the step of building this new processing plant. I wish him all the best. I will certainly be doing what I can to help him get the additional labour that he needs. These Australian technical colleges may, in time to come, help with his problem. The ATCs are a good initiative of the government and will perhaps into the future help us with this skills shortage.
The good news story from Charleville does not stop there. Almost right next door to the Western Exporters processing plant is another processing plant, operated by United Game Processors and a Mr John Burey. They process kangaroos and wild pig—boars. Again, they cannot keep up with demand. They have orders mainly from Europe. Germany is their biggest customer in the wild pig area. A lot of the kangaroo meat goes to Europe. Would you believe, Mr Acting Deputy President, that Russia is Australia’s No. 1 kangaroo meat importer and they imported over $11 million worth of Australian kangaroo meat in 2004, making it, according to the Moscow Times, the largest recipient of Australia’s exports? I am told the majority of this meat was sold in eastern Russia for use in sausage processing.
Exporting kangaroo meat has been going on since 1959 in response to interest from the European game meat industry. Kangaroo skins and furs are exported in large numbers to markets in Europe, the United States and Asia. We export kangaroo meat to 21 countries around the world. I love kangaroo meat. It is very healthy. It is lean and, when cooked properly, it will surpass in my humble opinion any other meat product. My wife is one of those who always object to, as she says, eating the national coat of arms; she will not eat kangaroo or emu. But kangaroos are at times of the year in plague proportions. They are very carefully regulated by the Queensland environment authorities, supported by the Commonwealth environment authorities. It is a great industry. There is no problem with the sustainability of the kangaroo population. Not only does it provide a very healthy meat for Australians but it also employs a lot of people in western Queensland.
I have mentioned that there are 150 people employed in the processing plant in Charleville, but there are many more employed in other areas of the industry. I am sorry—150 in the goat factory and about 50 in the kangaroo and pig factory at the moment. But Mr Burey suffers, as does his neighbour, from the inability to get qualified, skilled people working for him. His constant problem in operating his business is how to say very nicely to people who want the product: ‘Sorry. I can’t supply you.’ It is a great problem to have, and his other problem is getting the skilled labour so he can supply the product that is needed from his area.
In addition to the people employed in those processing plants—the wild pig and kangaroo one and the next-door one processing goats—and the labour created in that small western town, there are any number of shooters, transport operators and other people involved in that business which creates employment in western Queensland. Because I think, as a nation, we need to help as much as we can those small country towns so they remain in existence, I totally support the work being done there. I congratulate both of the processors. I wish them all the very best for the future. They are great Australian enterprises that we need to support. I think this bill deserves support. It is a great bill to be supporting—one that has shown we made a mistake about when we would need the money. We have to bring forward the money that is needed, and I urge senators to support the bill.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN TECHNICAL COLLEGES (FLEXIBILITY IN ACHIEVING AUSTRALIA’S SKILLS NEEDS) AMENDMENT BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,10,1,speech
"Campbell, Sen George",ALP,2006-08-10,"—I also want to make a contribution in relation to the Australian Technical Colleges (Flexibility in Achieving Australia’s Skills Needs) Amendment Bill 2006 before the chamber. I must say it is not surprising to hear at least one of the senators on the other side of the chamber get up and make the accusation that the Hawke-Keating government is to blame for our skills crisis. After all, the government have made a feature out of blaming the Hawke and Keating governments for everything that has gone wrong while they have been in government, despite the fact they have been in government for 10 years. If something goes wrong it is still the fault of the Hawke-Keating government. I did not hear Senator Ian Macdonald go back to 1983 and tell us about the contribution the current Prime Minister made to unemployment in this country when he was the Treasurer—11½ per cent unemployed, and with a much smaller labour market than today.
I did not hear Senator Macdonald talk about the contribution the Hawke and Keating governments made in the eighties to structurally changing the nature of our economy and our workforces that made the workforces more productive, created greater flexibility, and provided the opportunity for our manufacturing sector to get into export markets and grow exports of elaborately transformed manufactures from something like about three per cent at the end of the eighties to some 18 per cent in 1996 when this government came to power. I did not hear Senator Macdonald tell us that those ETMs have now dropped back to about 3½ per cent under this government. All of the sacrifice the workforce made in the eighties and nineties to change the nature of the Australian economy has been sacrificed under this government. We have gone back virtually to where we were in the mid-eighties. He was very keen to blame the Hawke and Keating governments for the skills crisis. Anyone with any modicum of commonsense would know that that is absolute nonsense.
The reason we have a skills crisis in this country today is that when this government came to power in 1996 it introduced a series of what can only be described as mickey mouse responses in trying to deal with getting people into apprenticeships. We had traineeships. We had New Apprenticeships. They changed the rules every couple of years or every 18 months. They destroyed the stability of the apprenticeship system over that period of time. We know that you cut funding to TAFEs by some eight per cent and that 300,000 fewer people now are able to access our TAFE system than was the case in 1996. It was a deliberate strategy by the government to cut funding to TAFE when they came to office in 1996 which has resulted in TAFE not being able to accommodate those people.
The reality is that we know we are going to lose something like 150,000 tradespeople out of the industry over the next 10 years, and we know under this current government there will be around only 30,000 new tradespeople trained to replace them. Those are the facts of life. That is the crisis that has been bubbling away in our economy for a considerable period of time. This government sat around on its hands for three or four years knowing this situation was developing and it did nothing to address the issue. Belatedly at the last election we got this proposal for 25 technical colleges, of which I understand only five are up and running. We made the point at the time the announcement was made by the Prime Minister that, even if they got all the colleges up and running in the first year, no tradespeople would come out of them until 2010-11. Even in terms of the proposal before the Senate, the impact on our economy and on the skills shortages will be minimal in the short term.
I understand this bill is to bring forward the funding, to get these colleges up and running much quicker, and the Labor Party has indicated it will support it. In terms of the contribution that these technical colleges are going to make to dealing with our skills crisis, no-one in the Australian economy should hold their breath waiting for it to happen quickly, because it will not. There are plenty of examples around of other facilities that could have been utilised that would have got skills training up and running much more quickly than this proposition that was put before the people by the current Prime Minister.
The reality is we have a skills crisis in this country today which can be sheeted home to this government for its neglect of a critical issue and the deliberate cut to the funding of the TAFE system, which was the best placed of all to deal with the rapid training and skilling-up of young Australians. What have we seen emerging as a result of this? The advent of section 457 visas, supposedly to bring skilled migrants into the country to try and deal with the skills crisis. On this side of the chamber, we have raised numerous issues with the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Senator Vanstone, about the fact that many of these migrants are not skilled. They are not being brought in to deal with skills shortages. They are being used as an additional labour force. Many of them are being employed in low-skill jobs and unskilled jobs, despite the fact that we are being told they are here to deal with the skills crisis.
I would be the last one to stand up in this place and oppose migrants coming to this country. I was a migrant myself back in 1965. With the goodwill of the government, they paid the £10 to get me here, so I cannot complain at all. I think they got a reasonable return on their investment over the years! I have nothing against migrants coming in. It is a question about the rules under which they come into the country and how they are processed, and whether they are being used in order to build our society or whether they are being used to supplant people in this country getting access to training, picking up skills and being able to fill those jobs. I suspect it is the latter.
We have already seen the scramble that the minister for immigration is in at the moment over the section 457 visas. They are trying to make policy on the run to deal with the myriad issues that have been raised in relation to the way in which those visas are being exploited by unscrupulous labour hire companies to get cheap labour into this country and to exploit labour from other countries to deal with our skills crisis. That is also denying young Australians the opportunity to get training in the skills area, to get apprenticeships and to get themselves onto a career path that will sustain them in the longer term.
There has been very little or nothing done about developing policies and strategies that will substantially increase the pick-up of young people—and I am talking about young people in the 16- to 20-year age group—into the apprenticeship system and skill them up for jobs in sustainable industries. All the focus again, as is always the case with this government, has been on short-termism. These technical colleges, in my view, will not radically alter those sets of circumstances. And we will again condemn a whole generation of young people to having to operate at the bottom end of the labour market, when they could have had the opportunity of being trained in skills that would have equipped them for much more rewarding, satisfying and higher paying jobs.
The issue of skills is a critical one for our economy. But this government could not even introduce the technical colleges proposal, albeit with the deficiencies it has, without playing politics with it. They had to tag on industrial relations requirements for the staff of those colleges as part of the deal. They had to use the introduction of the colleges to get out there and force their ideological agenda on industrial relations on the poor unfortunates that are going to be employed in those colleges training young people. They could not resist the opportunity to do that. They had to take the opportunity to whack the potential employees of those colleges, in order to try and promote the take-up of their industrial relations system, and turned them into a battleground. Instead of giving primary focus to getting people employed in those colleges, to getting the colleges up and running and to getting our young people trained, the government had to go back and use the process of introducing them as part of the elements driving their industrial relations agenda. That is unfortunate because I think it has, in a number of areas, retarded the ability to get some of those colleges up and running faster than they otherwise would have been.
As I said, the Labor Party have indicated that we will be supporting this bill. But I want to make a number of points about what Labor have said we will do in this area—because we actually have some credibility in the area of training and development of skills. We are committed to creating a modern TAFE system. We are committed to making the TAFE system work and ensuring the system works in the best interests of all those people in our community who need access to that training. Labor’s blueprint will offer some real solutions. We will be offering young people more choice by teaching trades, technology and science in first-class facilities rather than in Dickensian workshop environments. We will be establishing a Trades in Schools scheme to double school based apprenticeships in skills shortage areas. We will be establishing specialist schools for senior years in trades, technology and science. We will be establishing a Trades Taster program for year 9 and 10 students to experience a range of trade options. We will be introducing a trade skills completion bonus to ensure that young people are encouraged not just to enter into the trades but to complete them and to walk away with their papers. And we will be opening up a skills account for them to assist them with their fees, their books and their equipment for the traditional trades.
Labor actually does have policy solutions in hand that will address the skills crisis. Unfortunately, the problem has been allowed to wander on so long that it is not capable of being addressed overnight; it is not capable of being addressed in the short term. It is going to take a considerable amount of resources and energy being put into this sector—first to reverse the trend and then to see the development and growth of skilled workers coming out of that process. This government’s agenda, through the technical colleges, will not go anywhere near addressing those issues. Labor’s program will reverse the trend that is occurring now, will start the process of seeing growth in the development of skilled workers and will eventually resolve the skills crisis that currently faces this country.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN TECHNICAL COLLEGES (FLEXIBILITY IN ACHIEVING AUSTRALIA’S SKILLS NEEDS) AMENDMENT BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,10,1,speech
"Colbeck, Sen Richard",LP,2006-08-10,"—It is normally my practice to thank senators who have made a contribution to the debate. But I think today, given some of those contributions, I can merely acknowledge them—particularly the contribution of Senator Sterle, which would be one of the most embarrassing presentations that I have seen in my time in this place. It was on a particularly embarrassing day for the Labor Party, when their leader does not have the self-discipline and strength to ignore a jibe from a government backbencher. It shows poor leadership, and that was followed by Senator Sterle today.
The presentations by opposition senators here today really demonstrate that they just do not understand what the Australian technical colleges are all about. The opposition are more about the process of the system than they are about the students within the system. One of the reasons that I am so enthusiastic about an Australian technical college is the opportunities that it will provide for students who go through that system into the future. I am one of those who completed an apprenticeship in the 1970s. I went through trade training, through the traditional TAFE process, with people who had generally left school at grade 10. A lot of those people never had the opportunity to complete grade 12 to get that additional qualification that would give them access to tertiary or higher education into the future. They would have to go back and do that subsequent to their trades.
It really is a new innovation in education. And for Labor in particular to be so steadfastly stuck in the past in relation to traditional trade training—and trade training is what this is all about—is quite a significant thing. The Labor Party wants to stick with the old way of doing things through TAFE. It is interesting to note that in most states TAFE is in fact a significant partner of the Australian technical colleges. The Australian technical colleges are buying services from the TAFE system. What this is about is a new way of doing things. It is about providing the training that industry wants and also providing opportunities for students into the future so that once they have completed their trade training, once they have moved into their trade, they have the opportunity to move on to further education. It is about real opportunities for students, not just about the system.
It is also a pity that Labor are not prepared to accept—and I can understand them not being prepared to accept—the role that the Keating government played in the current skills shortage. They cannot deny that that is the case. The ‘recession that we had to have’ put a lot of people out of work and took a lot of work and business away from industry and businesses around the country. Once the economy started to turn up, the demand for labour started to increase and, of course, the demand for trainees and training then started to increase.
I can give a very good example of that. The construction industry in Tasmania was decimated through the nineties, partly through the actions of the Field Labor government, which cut the government construction budget significantly; it took $40 million out of that budget when it came to government in the early 1990s. But, to give it credit, the Field Labor government was looking at dealing with a significant budget problem. The ‘recession that we had to have’ absolutely knocked the life out of the construction industry in Tasmania. It was not until late 2002 or early 2003 that the construction industry in Tasmania started to revive, on the back of the economic growth of the country and the decision to purchase some new ships to ply the Bass Strait trade which was supported by the Australian government with the Bass Strait Passenger Vehicle Equalisation Scheme. The impact of that growth in demand is clearly demonstrated by apprentice numbers in the carpentry and joinery trade in Tasmania. In 2002, there were 150 apprentices being trained in carpentry and joinery in Tasmania. Last year there were 700. That is a 450 per cent increase in the number of apprentice carpenters and joiners. The demand that came out of the industry has driven the growth in demand and training for apprentices. Carpentry and joinery is one of the trades that will be part of the Australian technical college based in northern Tasmania.
At this point, I will pay tribute to the efforts of Michael Ferguson and Mark Baker, who did enormous work in supporting the introduction of an Australian technical college in northern Tasmania. In fact, without the work of Mark Baker the likelihood is that there would not be a campus of the Australian technical college on the north-west coast in Burnie. That is a significant achievement by one member of the government in grasping the nettle. As a trained apprentice carpenter himself, Mr Baker understood the need, he understood the process and he grasped the opportunity. He went out and created for the north-west coast of Tasmania a campus for an Australian technical college. Mr Baker deserves the credit, and the congratulations of his constituents, for doing that.
Given what the opposition speakers have said, one might have thought that nothing was happening as far as the Australian technical colleges go. The reality is that this is all about bringing forward the funding for the legislation—

Senator Wong interjecting—

—Yes, Senator Wong, I am watching the time. There are a few points I have to make yet; I am sure you understand. This is about bringing the funding forward for the Australian technical colleges. I think that needs to be recognised. As I said, this is not a duplication of existing arrangements. It is about providing opportunities—except, might I say, in New South Wales, since the New South Wales government has actively refused to be involved in the Australian technical colleges. That refusal is reflected in the trade training in Australian school based apprenticeships in New South Wales: since 1996, there has not been one Australian based apprenticeship commencement in New South Wales.
The Labor Party talk about politics, but they might also talk to their state colleagues who have been actively working against the introduction of the Australian technical colleges. Then, when the Labor Party start talking about the rate at which the colleges are being rolled out, they might understand that there is a real opportunity for the Labor state governments to come on board and assist the rollout of the technical colleges, which will make a difference not only to trade training but also to the opportunities for students who go through the system in the future. I think that is probably one of the most important elements of this whole process. This bill is a reflection of the government’s commitment to providing opportunities for young Australians choosing to take up a traditional trade and a long-term response to the needs of industries and regional communities. I commend the bill to the Senate.
 (Senator Watson)—The question is that Senator Wong’s amendment be agreed to.

"Stephens, Sen Ursula",ALP,2006-08-10,"—The Trade Practices Amendment (National Access Regime) Bill 2006 changes the regime under which a service provider can obtain access to an infrastructure facility. The purpose of the bill is to seek to ensure access to infrastructure where elements of natural monopoly exist to enhance competition and restrain monopoly behaviour while encouraging investment in infrastructure. The Productivity Commission reviewed the regime some four years ago and this bill is the government’s second response to the Productivity Commission’s recommendations. I say second response because the government has already indicated its support for the Productivity Commission’s recommendations. However, we have learnt from this government that ‘there’s many a slip ’twixt the cup and the lip’, to quote Shakespeare, and this is exactly what has happened in the most significant element of the bill—the pricing principles for evaluating a declaration of access under part IIIA.
However, before looking at this question and other aspects of the bill, I want to outline Labor’s vision for reform of this crucial section of the Trade Practices Act. The perennial dilemma for a nation governed by a federal system is that there are competing interests between different spheres of government. The horns of the Australian dilemma are that on one hand the economy is truly national in structure and targeted at international competitiveness, but on the other the core business of the states is in regulated sectors of the economy. The result is that, while the un-derlying economic reality favours a national regulatory system for all but intrastate commerce and trade, the political economy of the federation tends to encourage the states to set up their own regulatory structures.
The obvious success of the Hilmer reforms is that they gave birth to the idea of a truly national competition policy. The less obvious failure is that in practice this goal has proved to be elusive. Rather than creating a unified regulatory structure, the Hilmer reforms have spawned a legion of 22 regulators at different levels of government and in different sectors. Market access regulation has become an entangled web held hostage not just to federal-state tensions but to internal disputes at state level over ministerial responsibility. This was seen most clearly in the creation of the national energy regulator, which was created as a compromise to ensure that state energy ministers might not be held hostage to the decisions of state treasurers. The original Hilmer vision was that state price market and access regulators for nationally significant natural monopoly infrastructure would evolve into a national regulatory regime.
The national access regime has three components under part IIIA of the Trade Practices Act. Under the current regime, the Treasurer, any responsible state or territory minister or any other party can apply to the National Competition Council to have a monopoly facility declared essential. The National Competition Council then makes a recommendation to the responsible minister, and the applicant has a right to appeal the minister’s decision in the Australian Competition Tribunal. Once declared, access arrangements, including price, can be negotiated between the facility owner and those seeking access, and the arrangement is registered with the ACCC. If the parties cannot agree, the ACCC arbitrates. The result of the arbitration can be reviewed by the tribunal, and the tribunal’s decision can be appealed in the Federal Court. Alternatively, the owner of a monopoly facility may set out the terms of access for any party wishing to gain access. This undertaking is then registered with the ACCC.
A major, outstanding issue relates to clause 6 of the competition principles agreement. Clause 6 states that the Commonwealth’s access regime is not intended to apply to essential facilities in a state or territory where a conforming state access regime is in place unless the National Competition Council determines the scheme is ineffective. The state regimes were expected to eventually make themselves subject to the declaration regime in part IIIA. This has happened very rarely. Certification of state market arrangements has also rarely been used because these regimes do not meet the minimum standards of the TPA. What has happened is that the states have set up their own regimes that often entrench the natural monopolies. I note that some state regulators fiercely contest this, and it is true that some regimes are reasonable.
Still, the result is clear—the original dream of a national market access regime has failed miserably. Prospective market entrants simply are not prepared to take on the legal power of state governments. The current arrangements are a mere formal compliance with the Hilmer vision enshrined in the competition principles agreement under COAG that Labor Prime Minister Paul Keating created. The spirit of the Hilmer program remains a distant dream.
This story remains largely untold. There is a lack of appreciation in the policy community that proponents or financiers of major infrastructure projects have to deal with a number of regulators and regulatory regimes. The national access regime is a case in point. There are state regulators, industry regulators, the National Competition Council and potentially also the ACCC to deal with. It is not just an issue of unnecessary compliance burden through regulatory duplication; there is also the issue of inconsistent regulatory frameworks and the concomitant disincentive to invest in the face of heightened risk of regulatory failure.
This has occurred under the Howard government. It accords with a generic theme of the Howard government being a high-cost government for business. It is open to Labor to highlight that the government has, albeit unintentionally, presided over a rather frightening increase in the compliance burden on business. This has become a central tenet of the Business Council of Australia’s approach.
The key focus should be unifying the competition policy architecture. In this regard there are two important issues. The first relates to the diffuse roles of the national regulators—the ACCC, the Australian Competition Tribunal and the National Competition Council. The second relates to the state based price and access regulators, including sectoral specific arrangements. In relation to both areas the fundamental question to be asked is: ‘What scope exists to both harmonise and rationalise the regulatory framework?’ The primary policy goal is simple: to reduce the compliance burden. But there is also the ostensibly subsidiary but philosophically significant goal of seeking to ensure that all these arrangements are structured to combat social exclusion in a coordinated way. This bill fails to capture the true vision, Labor’s vision, of a unified competition policy infrastructure.
The bill changes the existing regime in the following ways: it includes a new objects clause that decision makers will need to have regard to; pricing principles embodied in part IIIA of the Trade Practices Act are to be determined by the Commonwealth minister; the threshold for the application of the regime is raised to include only projects of national significance; new arbitration arrangements and appeal procedures are provided for; it restricts access to the federal legislative regime to where no effective state access regime exists; it provides immunity from the regime where a government service is provided by competitive tendering; and it includes new target time limits, procedures for consultation and reporting of decisions.
A new objects clause is inserted into part IIIA to provide for greater certainty for infrastructure owners, access seekers, investors and other interested parties. The bill also requires decision makers under part IIIA to have regard to the objects clause when making their respective decisions. This is intended to promote consistency and provide guidance in relation to each decision maker’s approach, thereby enhancing regulatory accountability. This is a positive development that Labor supports. But the objects clause could hardly be described as bringing a hard edge to the legislation. This interpretive provision could have included much stronger pro-competitive language. There is no mention of restraint on monopoly behaviour, for example. I will return to a discussion of the pricing principles after dealing with other elements of the bill.
Firstly, the threshold for the application of the regime is raised to include only projects of national significance. The government has agreed to amend the ‘promote competition’ declaration criteria contained in section 44G(2)(a) to ensure that access declarations are only granted when the expected increase in competition in an upstream or downstream market is not trivial. Labor supports this. Secondly, regarding the new arbitration arrangements and appeal procedures, the bill provides that the commission will be given the discretion to conduct multilateral hearings in arbitrations following notification to the parties to the dispute and, consistent with the provisions of the telecommunications access regime in part XIC of the Trade Practices Act, the commission will also be given the discretion to grant interim arbitration determinations.
The arbitration provisions will be amended to make it explicit that, when arbitrating a dispute, the commission can require a service provider to permit interconnection to its facility by an access seeker. Consistent with the appeal rights applicable to other access routes provided under part IIIA, this bill establishes rights to merit review by the Australian Competition Tribunal in relation to decisions made by the commission about access undertakings and access codes.
The Productivity Commission also recommended that the arbitration provisions of part IIIA should be amended to provide for two-sided information disclosure requirements involving both the access provider and the access seeker. The access seeker should be required to provide sufficient information, including technical and commercial requirements, to enable the access provider to respond to the request for access. The provider of the declared service should be required to provide sufficient information to an access seeker to facilitate effective negotiation on the terms and conditions of access. This should include information on the availability of the service, including any reasons why the service is not available on the conditions sought by the access seeker; an offer of the terms and conditions of access to the service; and sufficient information, such as the costs of operating the facility and providing the service, to enable the access seeker to make a reasonable judgement on the basis of which the terms and conditions of access were determined. This information should be provided within 28 days of the access seeker submitting its request for access to the service provider.
This was not accepted by the government, which deemed that such information requirements were impractical. Rather than applying a generic regime, they preferred an industry-specific regime. The government’s rejection of this key Productivity Commission finding, recommendation 8.1, is highly questionable. Prima facie, the Productivity Commission’s recommendation is pro-competitive and feasible. Labor calls on the government to reconsider this aspect of the bill.
The bill amends the Trade Practices Act to explicitly prevent the commission from accepting an access undertaking or access code where a decision is in force that a state or territory access regime is an effective access regime. This removes the incentive for industry gaming through forum shopping, and Labor supports this. The bill introduces a mechanism to enable the commission to grant immunity from declaration for services to be delivered by government-sponsored infrastructure where the construction and the operation of the facility is to be awarded through a competitive tendering process. Again, Labor supports this.
The bill applies a number of non-binding target time limits to various decisions under part IIIA and introduces legislative provisions for public input on declaration and certification applications, and proposed access undertakings. The bill places additional obligations on ministers, the council and the commission to publish reasons for their decisions or recommendations. As the government’s key adviser on the regime, the council will be required to report annually on the operation and effects of the regime, including on specific matters identified in the bill.
Then we come to the vexed question of pricing principles. In its formal response to the Productivity Commission report Review of the national access regime, the government agreed that statutory pricing principles should be established in relation to part IIIA in order to provide guidance for pricing decisions and to contribute to consistent and transparent regulatory outcomes over time, as well as certainty for investors and access seekers. However, the bill did not enshrine the principles in legislation. It is proposed that these pricing principles are to be determined by the Treasurer and specified in regulation. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission will be required to take into account these principles when making a final determination on an access dispute and when assessing a proposed new or varied access undertaking or access code.
Relegating the pricing principles to a regulation is a significant watering down of the previous position taken by the government. According to industry sources, Treasury appears to be seeking greater flexibility on the setting of the principles. Labor sought to have this bill and the issue of the pricing principles considered by the Senate committee, which has now reported. The outcome of the inquiry was unanimous support of organisations making submissions for the pricing principles to be in the legislation. This is a major development. The infrastructure sector has told the government its preferred model, as enshrined in the bill, is deficient. So strong was the argument by the sector that all senators on the committee—government, opposition and minor parties—agreed and recommended that the pricing principles be in the act. The government has been criticised by the infrastructure sector and its own senators, which is a highly embarrassing setback for the government.
The decision to not include the pricing principles in part IIIA would involve consequences. Firstly, it greatly diminishes the principle of certainty that the industry has been seeking for both existing and future infrastructure investment. Secondly, because part IIIA effectively acts as a model access regime for industry-specific access regimes, removing the pricing principles from part IIIA permits greater divergence across industry-specific access regimes, rather than a consistent approach. Making the pricing principles a matter for ministerial discretion is poor policy. It does not foster regulatory transparency and opens the government to the possibility of capture by the sector. It is open for Labor to consider amending the bill in the Senate to include the pricing principles, so it is pleasing that the government has seen the merit in Labor’s proposals to put in the pricing principles. The government should have first sided with Labor and the Productivity Commission, but in the end reason prevailed.
Labor had its own form of pricing principles that was moved in the House of Representatives. This involved the notion that regulatory risk was seen as an element of commercial risk rather than as a separate category. Labor still holds this position but will not seek to delay the passage of the bill by insisting on its amendment. After all this, government took four years to respond to the Productivity Commission recommendations and it has taken 14 months for the bill to get to this point in the parliamentary process, which is hardly a strong sign of commitment by the government to trade practices reform. But it is not surprising. This government’s record on trade practices reform is a bit of a blank page. Where is the bill for criminal sanctions for cartels, which is so urgently needed? Where are the promised changes to section 46 of the Trade Practices Act? Then there is the government’s flawed Dawson bill, which still hangs in abeyance. While not declining to give the bill a second reading, I move the second reading amendment standing in my name:
At the end of the motion, add “but the Senate condemns the Government for:
           (a)   delaying the introduction of this bill for almost 3 years since the Productivity Commission report was released;
           (b)   failing to amend Part IIIA of the Trade Practices Act 1974 to include the pricing principles in the bill;
           (c)   failing to produce a single, clear and pro-competitive legislative framework for infrastructure regulation; and
           (d)   failing to advance meaningful reform of the Trade Practices Act 1974”.",SENATE,<title>TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT (NATIONAL ACCESS REGIME) BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,12,1,speech

"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2006-08-10,"—The incorporated speech read as follows—

Although the Australian Democrats support the Trade Practices Amendment (National Access Regime) Bill 2006, there are still aspects concerning the national infrastructure access regime we have serious concerns about, and which still need to be addressed by the Government, particularly in light of recent actions by the Treasurer.
The Trade Practices Act is increasingly being seen as the enemy of small companies or new entrants to markets, and that is not the effect it was supposed to have when it was first passed.
These amendments address issues of timeliness in decision making and set out the criteria to be taken into account in those decisions. However, it is increasingly clear that there are further matters to be addressed by this Government and the State governments, in relation to competition regulation in particular in relation to large infrastructure.
In a perfect world all strategic infrastructure would be provided by the Government at either a State or Federal level, but this has not been the case for a long time. I accept that there are times when a public/private arrangement has merit. I also accept privately funded infrastructure which is well-regulated can provide a good outcome for the public and users.
The regulation of competition in Australia is through a system of certification and declaration and it has, in some respects, worked well. The companies themselves can apply for certification of infrastructure, two companies can negotiate a contract for use of certain infrastructure at a commercial rate, and if these two avenues fail then the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission and the National Competition Council can ‘declare’ the infrastructure.
And if one party does not like the declaration they can apply to the Minister for a decision. But more on that later. And if all these avenues are exhausted then they can resort to the Federal Court.
In a recent battle over rail lines in the northwest of Western Australia, the smaller mining company Fortescue Metals Group Ltd or FMG applied for access to the larger BHP Billiton’s rail line to transport ore from a proposed mine site in the area. FMG has not yet exploited the site because it took the sensible approach that a guarantee to transport access was essential prior to exploiting the area. The National Competition Council found that FMG should have access to the rail line.
The NCC’s decision was appealed to the Treasurer and it sat on his desk for 90 days, and lapsed because he did not make a decision. Nobody knows his reasons for not making a decision (he doesn’t have to provide any if he doesn’t actually decide anything) and now FMG must pursue its rights through the courts, at great expense and delay.
During the recent Estimates session, Mr Feil, Executive Director of the NCC pointed out the complexity of competition regulation in Australia, and highlighted for the Committee the fact that there are different avenues at Federal and State level that companies can utilise in relation to access to infrastructure. These different avenues mean that forum shopping between the state and federal systems, and forum shopping between different competition regulators is available, all of which slows down and confuses the decision making process.
In light of these complexities the Australian Democrats are pleased that the Treasurer is considering the creation of a national regulatory regime for infrastructure.
We note that in the OECD Economic Survey of Australia released recently, that it said
The time taken for regulatory decisions should be closely monitored especially where it is likely to impinge on export performance.
This advice needs to be taken seriously, especially in light of the Treasurer’s failure to make a decision for 90 days in relation to the FMG matter—that is 3 months, which is half the time recommended by the recent COAG agreement that an appropriate timeframe for such decisions should be 6 months.
However, this bill does not address such a streamlining, but I was heartened by Senator Minchin’s comments at Estimates that there could be a COAG consideration of the problem to try and bring about streamlining competition regulation nationally.
At the same Estimates hearing, Mr Feil pointed out that Part IIIA of the TPA applies to both interstate and intrastate state-owned and privately owned assets. He said that there are 3 routes open to companies in relation to competition questions. One is the State specific route, the other two are national and it is the choice of the asset owners, applicants and governments which they choose.
This also leads to forum shopping which I do not agree with, and which I see as an impediment to the speedy and cost-effective resolution of competition questions. It ensures that those with the deepest pockets will win the competition battle; that new players can effectively be excluded and in the long run, they can be bought up by the big players, when their patience and their pockets are exhausted.
I was disappointed to hear at Estimates that the fact that even though the Western Australian government facilitated the building of the BHP rail line which is now ‘privately owned’ by BHP, the taxpayers contribution to this private asset was not a matter which the NCC took into account when making its decision.
In his own words Mr Feil said
The contribution the state made some time ago in facilitating the construction and planning of the railway line was reflected to a degree in the state access regime, so the quid pro quo was some conditions for third party access and a number of other things including royalties. As it turns out, the state access regime does not appear to have provided the degree of access that perhaps at the time parties thought might have occurred but it is very hard to read exactly what the trade-offs were. So we treat this as a fresh application for an asset that is essentially privately owned.....
He went on to say
I do not think it is necessary or appropriate to consider how much the state government or the people of WA might have contributed some time in the past.
From that one can gather that if you are large enough, even if you gained concessions from the Government at either a state or federal level at public cost a long time ago, those are not matters which are considered relevant to the decision making of a competition regulator.
That simply seems wrongheaded to me.
Let me again put my views on the record. I do not agree with infrastructure monopolies in private hands. I do agree with private owners getting a full commercial return. I do agree that the new entrant must fund or help fund additions to the infrastructure if that is required.
If a rail line was built because the public let it be built, through taxpayer provided easements, facilitation, and concessions, it was built in the public interest not the private interest, and should be shared.
If taxpayers have helped facilitate or fund a piece of infrastructure which is now in private hands, then shouldn’t the company have to repay in dollars the actual competitive advantage it now enjoys? And at the very least, provide access, at a commercial rate, to competitors?
It is clear from the evidence of the NCC at Estimates and in light of FMG’s ongoing application for access to rail lines, that a workable national competition policy which inhibits forum shopping and promotes real competition must be hammered out between the States and Federal government sooner rather than later.
The proposed amendments to the Objects clause provide guidance to the ACCC/NCC in making determinations in relation to infrastructure ensuring ‘economically efficient operation of, use of and investment in the infrastructure’ and to provide for a ‘consistent approach to access regulation’.
The Democrats note that the Objects clause proposed in this bill takes into account economic efficiency but does not address one of the Democrats key concerns in National Competition Policy, that is, the need for an objects clause which addresses market conditions or behaviours that may impede the emergence of ecologically sustainable industries, business and business processes.
The Democrats support the aspect of the Objects clause which provides a framework to encourage a consistent approach to access regulation in each industry.
This amendment addresses a key concern of the Democrats with regard to the methodology and ideology that is applied to the decision making by the regulator. It is also obvious, that given the limited amount of jurisprudence in the area, such matters need to be spelt out in the Act.
The objects clause is intended to promote consistency and provide guidance in the decision making process, which the Democrats hope will enhance regulatory accountability.
Some of the submissions to the Economics Legislation Committee were concerned that these objects were adding a further layer for consideration, and in fact would not provide clarity. The argument was that it would mean juggling a number of considerations without any firm idea of which consideration should take precedence.
That is a pessimistic view of the matter and the inclusion of considerations of economically efficient operation and investment in infrastructure are important guides for the competition regulator.
In relation to the ‘declaration’ of certain infrastructure there is a further criteria of determining whether the service would ‘promote a material increase in competition in at least one market whether or not in Australia’. This amendment enshrines in legislation the way in which the regulator currently interprets the requirement.
My difficulty with this amendment is not that it changes the way in which the regulator works, but it brings me to my ongoing difficulty with declarations. The Australian Democrats do not believe there is a role for the Treasurer, who is the Minister in competition regulation matters. This has been borne out by his recent behaviour in relation to FMG and BHP Billiton.
If the regulator is making the decision against certain criteria, which are the same criteria that the Minister will apply in making his decision (if he bothers to make a decision), then how can the outcome be different?
It can be different if the Minister is lobbied so extensively that he changes the outcome of the declaration. It makes a mockery of the role of the regulator and it is a waste of taxpayers’ money. It also creates further delays, which impede the effectiveness of other provisions of this bill which provide for time lines within which the regulators must make decisions.
And what about the Ministerial decision-making process being private not public? That is contrary to good due process.
If large transnational companies do not like a declaration from the regulator, then they know that they can go to the Minister and with the various carrots and sticks available to them, possibly get him to change an outcome.
Given the number of politicians (of all political persuasions) who have jumped from various Parliaments into the arms of large infrastructure providers, investment banks and other corporations I do not think that I am being unduly cynical when I am wary of the role of Ministers in these matters.
Either you have faith in your regulator and the frameworks you are setting in place by legislation, or you need to work harder on your legislative drafting.
Just as the Health Minister no longer has a final say in determining which drugs are available in Australia, then I think the Minister should not have a role in this. If the companies do not like the decision of the regulator then, as in other matters, appeals to the Federal Court should sort out the matter.
Many of the amendments proposed in this bill increase the transparency of decision making, provide time lines for decision makers and increase accountability through publication of reasons.
These are all matters on which the Australian Democrats have campaigned long and hard in the past, so the Senate will not be surprised that we support these amendments.
It ensures that those applying for access to infrastructure are able to identify, with some certainty we hope, the amount of time it will take for the decision to be made. This increases certainty for investments and forward planning for businesses.
The bill also proposes that the regulator can seek public comment on a recommendation regarding a declaration. The Democrats have always advocated a public interest test—one that takes into account the social and environmental impacts along with the economic impact of certain behaviours.
Previously the public interest test has been construed very narrowly and has been under-utilised. This amendment appears to mean that public interest is of some concern to the Coalition. Public interest is an all encompassing term. The Democrats are cautiously optimistic that this provision will go some way to providing the possibility for a better assessment of all the relevant facts.
This bill also provides for the publishing of reasons by the NCC, the ACCC and the Minister. However this amendment has serious limitations which have become clear since the Treasurer failed to make a decision in relation to FMG and BHP. In that case he made no decision, he let the application lapse, so in that circumstance there was no requirement to provide reasons because there was no decision. That was technically within the letter of the law, but few would suggest that it was the way in which people envisaged the Trade Practices Act working.
The Australian Democrats support these amendments to the TPA but looks forward to the Coalition addressing obvious shortcomings in the national competition policy as soon as possible.",SENATE,<title>TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT (NATIONAL ACCESS REGIME) BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,12,1,speech
"Webber, Sen Ruth",ALP,2006-08-10,"—Twelve months ago tomorrow, on Thursday, 11 August 2005, the Senate Economics Legislation Committee held its hearings into the Trade Practices Amendment (National Access Regime) Bill 2006, so it has taken 12 long months for us to finally debate this legislation and for Senator Stephens and me to have the opportunity to make our contributions. Initially, I want to place on record my thanks to the people who appeared before the committee and particularly to the committee chair, Senator Brandis. As has been alluded to, our hearing on this piece of legislation was probably an example of what Senate committees do well. Industry came to the committee and pointed out some concerns that they had with this piece of legislation. Some suggested improvements. There was no partisan view about how those improvements should be made, and there was good, old-fashioned, bipartisan discussion—in fact, tripartisan discussion, because Senator Murray from the Australia Democrats was there as well—and sensible public policy was recommended.
—Commonsense.
—As Senator Stephens has just said, commonsense prevailed. That sensible public policy was around the issue of pricing principles. Part of the significant evidence that the committee heard at the time was from AusCID, the Australian Council for Infrastructure Development. They gave us probably the most persuasive evidence about the need to insert pricing principles. In evidence, one of their representatives, Dr Mundy, informed the committee of their view. He said:
... as far as general pricing principles are concerned, economic regulators such as the ERA—
from my home state of Western Australia—
the essential services commissions of Victoria and South Australia, IPART, the Queensland Competition Authority and the ACCC have been undertaking pricing decisions of one type or another for a long time, and there is significant academic literature on this.
In other words, the way of dealing with pricing principles was well known to regulators and there was significant literature that we could look at on how those principles would be interpreted. There was discussion, therefore, about the best way of inserting those principles—whether it should be, as the Productivity Commission recommended, which Senator Stephens has mentioned, within the legislation itself or whether it should be done by regulation.
AusCID went on to point out that it may well be the government’s reasoning that it is much easier to draft a regulation and easier to get it before the parliament; although, having said that, with the government having the numbers in both chambers, legislation being introduced could hardly be seen to be difficult these days. AusCID conceded that the government may have chosen this path for ease. However, their real point was the need for certainty. Dr Mundy went on to say:
The real point is certainty, and it needs to be understood that the investments we are talking about for which certainty is required have asset lives best understood in decades. People are investing today—
that was 12 months ago—
in assets that may last 50 or 100 years, so they need to understand very much what the policy principles are that are going to govern activities. Regulators are always going to have to make decisions, no matter how these words are set out or where they are set out. In regard to the issue about where they sit, in our view it is preferable that they are contained within the primary statute.
It seemed to be the view of industry, no matter which sector we heard from, that the best way of providing that certainty was for the pricing principles to be in the primary statute.
Sometime after the committee conducted its hearings, there was a meeting of the Council of Australian Governments where they also discussed the issue of pricing principles. All Australian governments agreed that pricing principles needed to be a priority and they agreed on the framework where they should be contained. So, for the life of me, I cannot understand (a) the delay in bringing this legislation to this place and (b) the reluctance to address the issue of inserting pricing principles within the legislation at the time.
When the committee heard from officers from the various departments, the only real reason we were given for the lack of willingness to insert the principles within the primary statute was the need—as the chair, Senator Brandis, put it at the time—to balance certainty and flexibility. However, it seems to me that when every industry representative involved in this discussion appears before a committee chaired by a member of a government that likes to boast of its links and responsiveness to industry and says that doing these things by regulation does not provide sufficient certainty to enable the significant investment this country needs to meet its infrastructure needs in the future then a responsive, responsible government would do what industry needs and what COAG has recommended—that is, to insert the principles in the primary statute.",SENATE,<title>TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT (NATIONAL ACCESS REGIME) BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,12,1,speech
"Macdonald, Sen Sandy",NATS,2006-08-10,"—The government would like to thank those honourable senators who participated in the debate on the Trade Practices Amendment (National Access Regime) Bill 2006. This bill implements the government’s response to the Productivity Commission’s review of the national access regime. The regime provides an avenue by which firms can seek access to services provided through infrastructure facilities owned and operated by others. Importantly, the regime seeks to enhance the competitiveness of the Australian economy by promoting the efficient investment in and the use of infrastructure facilities of national significance. At the request of the government, the Productivity Commission conducted an inquiry into the operation of the national access regime. The commission supported retention of the regime and recommended a number of enhancements. The government accepted the majority of the recommendations, agreeing that scope exists for improvements to the regime including to clarify its objectives, promote more efficient investment in and operation of infrastructure, establish more timely and less costly regulatory procedures, and enhance the transparency and accountancy of decision-making processes under the regime.
The changes contained in this bill result from a robust consultation process that we have heard about. The changes are also consistent with the proposals of the export infrastructure task force report, released by the Prime Minister in June of last year. The task force examined the number and complexity of access regimes across Australia and made recommendations aimed at streamlining processes where appropriate. Significantly, this bill takes steps in the same direction. I also note that this bill is consistent with the underlying principles governing infrastructure regulation that were agreed to by the Council of Australia Governments in February this year as part of the new national reform agenda.
The government is committed to effective and efficient regulation and targeted laws. The bill we have before the Senate has been the subject of extensive consultation with industry and stakeholders consistent with our red tape commitments. There is a very high level of support for this bill by those stakeholders. The amendments that the ALP suggests need to be made—inserting the pricing principles into the Trade Practices Act 1974—have been effected in the other place and in this bill before the Senate. The Australian government has always recognised the need for effective infrastructure regulation and certainty in respect of the same. This is what this bill helps to achieve: a positive development that, I am pleased to say, is supported by the ALP. I note the leadership of this government in talking at COAG to continue moving forward with simpler and more consistent national regulation for significant infrastructure.
Finally, I was pleased to see that submissions provided by a wide range of industry stakeholders to the Senate Economics Legislation Committee during this inquiry were, as we have heard from Senator Webber, highly supportive of the bill, as was the committee itself. I note also the positive responses to this bill reported in the media following its introduction into parliament. In conclusion, this bill forms a key part of the government’s Trade Practices Act reform agenda, announced during the previous term, to benefit Australian consumers and businesses. This agenda also includes implementation of the government’s response to the Dawson committee’s review of the competition provisions of the Trade Practices Act, development of measures to afford additional protection to small business under the Trade Practices Act and to further clarify the misuse of market power provisions, and the development of proposals to introduce criminal penalties for serious cartel conduct.
I welcome the proposed improvements to the national access regime as contained in this bill, including the minor amendments moved by the government in the House of Representatives. I am hopeful the government will receive the support it needs to implement these important improvements to the regime. I commend the bill to the Senate.

"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,2006-08-10,"—After that, you would think it was the comedy hour. I have a question for Senator Coonan, the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts. I refer the minister to the collapse of Telstra’s discussions with the ACCC on the rollout of the fibre broadband infrastructure. Is the minister aware of the comments of Liberal MP Peter Lindsay, who stated this week that Telstra’s decision to abandon its fibre plans was a disaster? He stated:
As much as others argue that broadband can be provided without fibre-to-the-node, true broadband cannot be provided without it.
He went on to say:
Australians deserve top shelf broadband and that can only be delivered by fibre optic cable. Without it we will be held back.
As the minister responsible for this mess, has the minister informed Mr Lindsay that she has no plan to bring fibre broadband infrastructure to Australia? When will the minister stop making excuses and show some leadership on this important issue?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Telstra</title>,Questions Without Notice,14,1,question
"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,2006-08-10,"—Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. I suppose as long as it goes to Townsville and does not get to Darwin, things are okay. Is the minister aware of yesterday’s editorial in the Herald Sun that said, ‘The Telstra mess is a national disgrace’ and ‘The government must demonstrate leadership’ because ‘too much is at stake to allow this unproductive farce to drag on’? Isn’t the Herald Sun right to say that the minister has failed to show any leadership whatsoever on this matter?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Telstra</title>,Questions Without Notice,14,1,question
"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2006-08-10,"—I thank Senator Crossin. At least you have to give her some marks for trying. The government is very disappointed with Telstra for pulling out of talks with the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission about the proposal for a fibre-to-the-node network. But, of course, it had proposed to roll out fibre only in populous metropolitan areas—not even in Senator Crossin’s home city of Darwin. Had they done it in the places they had nominated, which were five of the major capital cities, it would have been welcome. For Telstra to pull out at the last minute when discussions were almost complete is, of course, counterproductive. Telstra had been saying that there were very few issues left to be resolved and that they were 98 per cent of the way there. Yet on Monday they completely reversed their position and outlook on the progress and have apparently decided not to proceed, although I understand that is not entirely certain either.
The reasons provided by Telstra for doing so certainly do not stack up. Telstra cited the ACCC’s alleged unwillingness to recognise actual costs. But in fact they have to set access prices. The ACCC is required by law to take into account the costs of the investment and the legitimate commercial interests of anyone who is going to make that kind of investment.
The important thing is that Australians are not entirely dependent on fibre; there are alternatives. Consumers in metropolitan areas and large regional centres should shop around with Telstra’s competitors, nine of whom are already offering ADSL2+ high-speed broadband. It is an option that many consumers are unaware of, and they should actually go and see whether or not anyone is offering an alternative to Telstra. If Telstra ultimately refuses to move to high-speed broadband, then those looking for such services should consider those alternatives.
As well as ADSL2+ broadband, many metropolitan consumers can consider cable broadband and wireless broadband options. Pay TV cable networks pass 3.7 million premises in the cities, offering high broadband speeds. Wireless broadband is also available in all capital cities and offers speeds of up to two megabits, expected to rise to 12 in the coming years. Telstra announced today that its 3G rollout is ahead of schedule, and that will provide very fast speeds.
The competitive rollout of high-speed broadband infrastructure which is taking place will be complemented by a $1.1 billion investment in the Connect Australia package, together with a $2 billion Communications Fund—which, I note, Labor was prepared to rifle for some ill-founded plan of their own.
I have had a conversation with Mr Lindsay. I think you will find that he has revised his view, because he did not realise that the fibre proposal was going to go only to populous parts of major capital cities. On that basis, he has revised his view.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Telstra</title>,Questions Without Notice,14,1,answer
"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2006-08-10,"—I can understand that it is very difficult to understand all of the implications of broadband policy, and it may be difficult for editors of the Herald Sun to quite understand the intricacies of competition and the rollout of broadband; but Senator Crossin should know a bit better. The Labor Party proposal for broadband is now in a total shambles. It was predicated on Telstra rolling out a fibre network and pinching $2 billion from the Communications Fund, putting it all, once again, on the Treasury credit card.

Does the minister recall her media release attempting to defend her claim that no-one is complaining about metropolitan broadband speed in Australia? Why did the minister claim that the number of Australians with access to ADSL broadband is ‘growing exponentially’ as carriers enable more and more exchanges under the Metropolitan Broadband Connect program? Can the minister confirm that this program was announced in the 2005 budget? Is it not true that, 18 months after it was announced, the program has been found to be an abject failure, with barely any of the $50 million allocated to it having actually been spent?

While the minister continues to live in denial, perhaps she could tell the Senate if she is aware of the recent comments of prominent metropolitan Australian and PBL chairman, James Packer, that Australia’s broadband performance is ‘embarrassing’? In light of this comment, does the minister stand by her claim that no-one in metropolitan Australia is complaining about broadband speeds? In other words, should Mr Packer and all the others just shut up and stop complaining?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Broadband Services</title>,Questions Without Notice,16,1,question
"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2006-08-10,"—I thank Senator Lundy for the question. As you would expect, the only card that the Labor Party has to play in this broadband debate is to misrepresent what I have said. I have clearly said that, even in the absence of any metropolitan fibre network proposal by Telstra, Australians living in inner metropolitan areas can already access—
—Oh, it’s ‘inner’ now? When did it become ‘inner’?
—faster broadband speeds of between 12 and 18 megabits per second if they can access the ADSL2+ platform or the cable networks which run past around 3.7 million Australian homes.
Opposition senators interjecting—
—I did say that. These are the same people who would have benefited from Telstra’s fibre-to-the-node network—which was what the conversation was all about—which, it is important to remember, would have been rolled out to the most populous parts of five capital cities, Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth and Adelaide, within five years from the date of commencement. The government’s longstanding policy of encouraging competition in telecommunications has delivered metropolitan consumers a choice of broadband provider and a choice of speeds. At least nine service providers already offer ADSL2+ in over 400 exchanges across metropolitan and some regional areas, and there are plans to extend these services with the installation of another 500 exchanges as competitors see an advantage with Telstra not proceeding with their fibre opportunity.
For the information of the Senate and those listening, service providers offering ADSL2+ include Adam Internet, Amcom, iiNET, Internode, OnTheNet, People Telecom, RIA, TPG and TSN. ADSL2+ and cable networks enable service providers to deliver a rich mix of data services to users, including high-quality video, audio, voice and text. In fact, ADSL2+ is the very technology that Telstra’s fibre network would have delivered to homes in some parts of the five capital cities. But even without a fibre network, the number of Australians with access to ADSL2+ technology could massively increase—and I have heard Senator Lundy say this in estimates—if only Telstra would flick the switch on its equipment and stop capping the speeds of its broadband services. However, as I have said previously, Australians do not necessarily have to wait for Telstra to resolve this matter. Painting a bleak picture of internet speeds is positively misleading. Around four million Australians have already connected to broadband, which is hardly an indictment of the broadband landscape.
That the Labor Party have the gall to attack this government on the provision of telecommunication services in this country is simply astonishing. These are the people who backed a plan just a few years ago to get the Australian taxpayer to pay $5 billion for dial-up internet. Having everybody stuck on very low speeds of dial-up internet would have been nice, wouldn’t it? Their latest fling is to pinch the $2 billion in the Communications Fund.

"Fielding, Sen Steve",FFP,2006-08-10,"—Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. Given that there were concerns last year, when the income tax cuts were given, about raising inflationary pressures, wouldn’t it have been more advisable to look at providing income tax cuts as well as petrol tax cuts, especially when you were looking at tax cuts—to take the inflationary pressures off interest rates?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Fuel Prices</title>,Questions Without Notice,18,1,question
"Minchin, Sen Nick",LP,2006-08-10,"—In a word, no. We do not agree with that, Senator Fielding. I think if you read the full Reserve Bank statement on monetary policy, you will see that its decision on interest rates was very much one that took account of the underlying inflationary pressures that exist not only in this economy but in most of the world’s economies. That is why most central banks have been tightening monetary policy. It is certainly true that the significant rise in the world price of oil—which affects every single country—is going to have some inflationary impact. No doubt, the sorts of dramatic increases in oil prices that have occurred are going to flow through to the prices that we pay.
Fortunately, there is a paradox in that the extraordinary demand for oil in the booming economy of China—and, to a lesser extent, India—has of course had a big impact on the prevailing price of oil. It is taking some time for the oil industry to respond to that significant demand, and that is why you are seeing prices as they are. But for many years China has been exporting deflation to the world because of the dramatic impact it is having on prices for manufactured products. So there are two impacts: from the boom in the Chinese economy and from its capacity to supply the world with very cost-effective manufactured products. On one hand, we suffer; on the other, we benefit.
I note that Senator Fielding is putting forward the proposition that the federal government should simply cut the excise by 10c. I do respect Senator Fielding’s genuine concern for Australian families and we share his concern for the impact on family budgets of the price of petrol. But it is our very strong view that the price of petrol is a function of world oil prices and that, in our response to this phenomenon, we must avoid knee-jerk populist responses. I would not necessarily accuse Senator Fielding of advocating a knee-jerk populist response, but we do regard fiddling with excise at a time like this as a knee-jerk populist response. Indeed, I believe in giving credit where it is due, and I do give credit to Mr Beazley and the opposition for not pursuing that path. I commend them for not falling for the two-card trick of advocating cuts in excise.
I remind Senator Fielding of our record on this matter. We did cut the excise, of course. Back at the time that we introduced the GST, the excise was cut by some 6.7c. Then, in the following year, we ended Labor’s indexation of excise and further cut the excise by 1½c. The fact is that excise is being reduced in real terms every year because of the end of that indexation—as a result of our decision to the end the indexation. The government are obviously having a look at what responsible and sensible measures we can take in response to the pressure on Australian families. We have eliminated as an option a reduction in the excise. You would have to cut the excise by some 10c for it to make any difference. Senator Fielding and the opposition know full well that would be at a cost to revenue of somewhere between $3 billion and $4 billion a year. The measures we have already taken have reduced excise revenue by some $2.3 billion a year. (Time expired)

"Minchin, Sen Nick",LP,2006-08-10,"—That of course would have been an option, Senator Fielding, through you, Mr President. But we believed that in the interests of the overall economy and the welfare of Australian families, in the interests of ensuring that Australians get fair reward for the work that they do and to ensure that our tax system remains internationally competitive, our effort—to the extent possible—should be put into reducing income taxation and increasing family payments. I think you would agree that they were sensible and important reforms. We do think that fiddling with the excise rate in response to fluctuations in world oil prices is the wrong thing to do. Ipso facto, you are suggesting that when world oil prices decline, you should be increasing excise. That would be a silly approach to policy. We think the right thing to do was to reduce the tax burden on Australian families. That has, of course, made it easier for them to pay for the higher petrol prices which we now experience.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Fuel Prices</title>,Questions Without Notice,18,1,answer

That the Senate take note of the answers given by ministers to questions without notice asked today.
Yet again we have seen the sheer incompetence and arrogance of this government in action in the chamber today. On serious issues to do with public safety, they say: ‘Just write a letter to Telstra. I’ve turned it away from my office.’ On major issues of administration, this minister does not even know what is going on in her own portfolio. In her answers she said, ‘Telstra are working with us on the metropolitan broadband black spots.’ Yet, if you go to the minister’s own website, under registered Metro Broadband Connect service providers, there is one company only, Allegro, producing wireless on the Gold Coast. Go to the minister’s website to look for registered Metro Broadband Connect infrastructure providers. Guess how many companies are registered infrastructure providers under the program the minister is claiming is saving Australia from broadband black spots? Zero registered providers. Yet the minister stands up in this chamber, misleads the Australian public and misleads this chamber by saying Telstra are registered. Not according to her own website.
The minister appeared, famously, in a Kempish—the word made famous by that senator and good friend Senator Rod Kemp—style performance on The 7.30 Report. When Kerry O’Brien asked a couple of straightforward questions the minister came out with one of the doozies of all lines. She said Australians in metropolitan areas ‘should be reasonably happy with their speed of broadband’. My emails have gone into meltdown. The ABC have a poll going and their emails are going into meltdown. Channel 7 have asked: ‘Are you happy with your broadband speeds?’ They are going into meltdown with the size of the response, with, overwhelmingly, 70 to 80 per cent of Australians saying, ‘We are not happy with the speed of our broadband in Melbourne inner suburbs, in metropolitan and outer suburbs and in regional and rural Australia.’
So what does the minister do? She issues a quiet little press release yesterday afternoon to try and cover up for the fact that she is so out of touch and so arrogant. She just slipped it out and did not circulate it to many people. It is entitled ‘Conroy misses the point on broadband in Australia’. It says:
Senator Conroy has completely misrepresented comments I made yesterday in relation to broadband services in Australia.
I was not even on the 7.30 Report. I have just read to you from the transcript: ‘Australians should be happy’. The minister goes on to say:
My comments were in relation to broadband speeds available in inner metropolitan areas of many of Australia’s capital cities.
That is right—if you can get a latte you can get fast broadband in this country, and if you can’t that’s just tough.
Senator Coonan needs to get a grip on the technological issues in her portfolio, the administration of her portfolio and, heaven forbid, she gets some vision in her portfolio to deliver Australia into the 21st century of infrastructure in broadband. It is not just the Labor Party saying, ‘Get on board Labor’s plan to take Australia into the 21st century.’ The Herald-Sun editorial says:
The Telstra mess is a national disgrace ... Yesterday, with some justification, the Government was accused of simply tinkering around the edges to satisfy its rural electorate rather than showing leadership.
That’s right—this government’s telco policy has always been ‘pork-barrel the National Party and don’t worry about the rest’. The Herald-Sun goes on to say:
This is not good enough. The Government must demonstrate leadership and decide if it can achieve its aims by working with the existing Telstra management. Too much is at stake to allow this unproductive farce to drag on.
Hear, hear to the Herald-Sun. It is not just the Herald-Sun; it is the Age as well. It says:
For all the complexities of costings and philosophical differences over policy, responsibility for this critical national infrastructure begins and ends with the Government.
The government found $3.1 billion for a trust to look after rural communication users, read pork-barrelling for National Party electorates courtesy of Senator Joyce, who proudly says that is exactly what it is for. The Age goes on to say:
It must not neglect the main game, which is the fibre network that a Government taskforce found would create benefits worth up to $30 billion. The big question now is what is the Government’s plan to ensure this vital investment in Australia’s prosperity is made?
The answer is nothing. (Time expired)

"Adams, Sen Judith",LP,2006-08-10,"—As far as Senator Conroy goes with his fibre to the node, he is fully aware that it was only ever going to be in the large metropolitan areas. It was not suitable to go out into regional and rural Australia. It is important that Senator Conroy realises that the government will be working in partnership with industry and other key stakeholders to use the $1.1 billion Connect Australia package to develop sustainable and strategic communications infrastructure throughout Australia. It may well be that the best way to address these issues is by using a substantial part of the Broadband Connect funding to stimulate the development of significant new broadband infrastructure. Importantly, any network that the government makes a significant investment in will have appropriate access arrangements to ensure that sustainable broadband competition is able to continue to develop in regional areas.
Labor used to preside over a cosy duopoly in telecommunications but, under the competitive regime that this government has fostered, consumers have been the winners. Prices have fallen by around 20 per cent and there are now around 100 telecommunications companies to choose from. With the expression of interest process for Connect Australia as a first step, the government has completed an expression of interest process to test the feasibility of an infrastructure based approach and to inform the design of any subsequent program. There were more than 70 expressions of interest received and the government is currently evaluating the results of this process. I can assure you that I have strongly supported one expression of interest from the area I come from in Western Australia.
The government is also confident that we will see some very exciting infrastructure projects grow out of this funding to leverage projects worth much more than the contribution being put forward by the taxpayer. There could be a mix of fibre, copper, satellite and wireless solutions to deliver quality, high-speed internet services to areas where the competitive market simply will not go. Importantly, these projects will be developed on top of the significant infrastructure based competition already occurring in competitive metropolitan and major regional markets. 
I will also comment on the payphone issue that was raised by those members opposite. Telstra’s plans to remove up to 5,000 payphones were first revealed earlier this year, and I made a speech about them. Telstra is already a quarter of the way through this rationalisation program, but it has become apparent that in most cases the removals are where there are already multiple payphones at one site. It is important to note that there are more than 60,000 payphones in Australia and, given the significant growth of mobile phone use, it is not surprising that the use of payphones has dropped. However, payphones continue to be an important community service for many people, and that is why the government regulates Telstra to ensure that payphones are reasonably accessible to everyone in Australia.
Telstra cannot just remove payphones where it feels like it. There are at least 7,500 unprofitable payphones and two of those are being removed from my community. As far as we are concerned they are not used, so why should they stay there and be maintained? Telstra cannot remove these other phones because of the universal service obligation. On top of this there are tens of thousands of profitable payphones which will remain in operation. Obviously there are surplus payphones in Australia that are not necessary for Telstra to meet its community service obligations, especially where there are multiple payphones at one site. But the government will not allow Telstra to leave communities completely stranded without payphones, and Telstra cannot do this under the law.
We are committed to maintaining the USO and it will not be watered down. In fact, in June this year the government actually increased Telstra’s obligations in relation to the removal of payphones, and it also increased the responsibilities of the regulator, ACMA, in monitoring Telstra’s obligations. Telstra is now required to undertake stricter consultation processes, identify all of its USO payphones in regional and rural areas, and rewrite its USO standard marketing plan for payphones. Considerable progress has already been made with these initiatives.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Answers to Questions</title>,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS,19,1,speech
"Stephens, Sen Ursula",ALP,2006-08-10,"—I too would like to take note of answers to questions asked of Senator Coonan today. I believe that those people in voter land who watched question time and heard the responses of the minister to the questions put to her will be desperately disappointed and quite worried that the future of telecommunications infrastructure and the decisions about how things are to be pursued are in her hands. It seems that Australia is missing the boat. While countries all around the world are recognising that their national telecommunications infrastructure is vital to their national interests, both social and economic, the government here has completely lost the plot.
We saw Senator Coonan the other evening on The 7.30 Report making the ludicrous claim that no Australian is unhappy with broadband access in Australia. I looked at the Yahoo!7 website before I came to question time today and, at that stage, there were over 2,700 responses to a poll and 67 per cent of voters said that they were not happy with available broadband internet speeds, and I can understand why. My experience of living an hour down the road is of a ludicrous internet service, and I have spoken about it here on many occasions. The fact is that if you are just a little outside of a main centre you cannot access a broadband service at all.
Australia needs something that is much more reliable and much more appropriate to the 21st century. We need a fibre-to-the-node network if we are to ensure our future prosperity, but the Prime Minister and Senator Coonan mistakenly believe that copper is the answer for Australia. We are up the creek without a paddle at this stage, and we are being outdone all around the world. Our competitors like Korea, Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore, Canada and the US have moved towards fibre optics, but what has happened in downtown Australia? Nothing. A significant section of the existing copper based infrastructure in Australia resides in areas where it will not be economically viable to upgrade to a fibre based information highway. There is only the government to take leadership on this issue, and that is what we are not seeing from the minister or from the Howard government. Once again, they are failing Australians everywhere, especially in regional Australia.
What are the messages that are coming from the market? First of all, Telstra today reported its worst annual result since the government sold out Australia and sold off Telstra nine years ago. Today we heard that Telstra’s annual net profit fell 26 per cent from $4.3 billion to $3.18 billion. It fell by $1 billion. Yesterday Telstra announced that it was pulling out of its $4 billion fibre network rollout. What is the result of all of this incompetence from the Howard government? Today we hear that members of the government themselves are calling for Telstra’s CEO, Sol Trujillo, to be sacked because he does not have the right attitude to the government, or, to put it another way, he will not do the government’s bidding. It is a very depressing state of affairs.
I asked Senator Coonan about the Telstra payphone at the Wollongong TAFE college. I understand that perhaps Senator Coonan has not actually been to the Wollongong TAFE campus. It is a very sprawling campus. It is very dark at night and there are very serious issues about people having access to payphones, and that same issue translates to universities, school campuses and other tourist places, which are the places that Telstra has targeted its removal of payphones. The real reason is, as Telstra itself says, that its payphone business now loses about $30 million a year—that is, about 55 per cent of the telco’s 30,000 payphones lose money. That is what it is about; it is about Telstra saving money, and the universal service obligation can be damned.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Answers to Questions</title>,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS,19,1,speech
"Trood, Sen Russell",LP,2006-08-10,"—What a complete embarrassment! This debate on taking note of answers was opened by Senator Conroy, a man who is reported in The Latham Diaries as having said, when offered the shadow ministry for telecommunications: ‘I don’t know anything about communications and I couldn’t care less.’ Isn’t that entirely typical of the way in which the Labor Party have approached this matter of communications? They have done it on the basis of putting someone in the shadow portfolio who knows nothing about it and cares less, and isn’t that apparent in the development of the Australian Labor Party’s policy towards communications?
For the 13 years that the Labor Party was in government, there was an abject failure to address the issues that Australians needed addressing in relation to telecommunications. We had a quiet and comfortable telecommunications duopoly between Telstra and Optus, about which the Labor government of the time failed to do anything at all. Labor did nothing to plan for the introduction of digital television and radio to Australia. It did nothing to fix failures in relation to services in country areas. It did nothing about the development of pay television. Australia was one of the last industrialised countries to acquire pay television. The Labor government prevented people in regional and rural areas from getting access to increased radio services in various ways. There was about as much development of telecommunications policy during 13 years of Labor as there was development in the science of astronomy during the early Middle Ages, and that is precisely where Labor remains at the moment.
Senator Stephens happily drew attention to the alleged failure of this government to do anything about the development of telecommunications services and alleged that we had actually ‘lost the plot’. Perhaps the other countries would not be as far advanced as she alleges they are if it were not for the fact that we lost so much time in the development of telecommunications in this country as a consequence of the Labor Party failing to deal with the issues that should have been dealt with in 13 years of government. We have been left with a situation where we have to play catch-up.
The government since 1996 has done a remarkable job in trying to redress the failures of that early period. It has tried to introduce a telecommunications regime for Australia that brings us to a position where we are getting closer than we have ever been to the standards that apply elsewhere in the world. The Labor Party fails continually and is yet to provide us with a credible policy that will see the continuation of that policy when and if it ever returns to government—one hopes that is never. By contrast, in the period we have been in government I think we have made remarkable progress in developing a significant telecommunications regime in this country. We now have nine or so competitors in the marketplace, all seeking to provide services to Australians. They have provided infrastructure—ADSL 2, for example—with speeds of up to 19 megabits per second. Four hundred data service lines have been installed, with a promise of 500 new data service lines in the future. High-speed cable networks are being developed.
My colleague Senator Adams made reference to criticism that the Telstra network would only serve the capital cities, raising the question of what would happen to the rest of Australia—that is, the provincial, rural and country areas—and suggesting that it was going to be left out in Telstra’s proposal. We have a regime now that promises in the not too distant future to address these failings and provide the services that Australians desperately need and are anxious to use for business and personal purposes. In addition to that we have a much more effective competition regime. We have a much more deregulatory regime; this is essential to telecommunications, where the technology is changing rapidly, where there is necessary oversight from a regulator and where there is a need to sometimes address the bottlenecks.

"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2006-08-10,"—I would like to respond to Senator Vanstone’s tirade, attacking workers, unions and me. I believe it is misguided. Senator Vanstone ought to be thanking Labor and the unions for pointing out how the 457 visa scheme was being rorted and how the Office of Workplace Services was allowing it to happen. But I suppose it is politically difficult for Senator Vanstone to attack the Office of Workplace Services and the extreme Work Choices legislation, so the next best thing was to come in here and personally attack me. The fact is that the department of workplace relations and the Office of Workplace Services were responsible for sitting on the complaints brought to them by these workers. They did absolutely nothing; there was no sign of any activity from the minister. In fact there was dead silence. Rather than gracefully conceding that intervention through parliament actually got the thing moving, Senator Vanstone has managed to score the biggest political own goal that I have ever seen her score by saying that it was not just skilled migrants who were being ripped off but 164 other restaurant workers as well. This proves the whole point to me: if the issues were not raised in parliament and the Office of Workplace Services was not embarrassed into conducting these investigations then nothing would have happened. I believe there would never have been an investigation, and I do not believe that the investigation would have been broadened to cover other restaurants as well. I thank Senator Vanstone for making this point so clearly on our behalf.
I suggest that Senator Vanstone is trying to distract us from her embarrassment and the Howard government’s embarrassment that exploitation of hospitality workers is far more widespread in restaurants—as she conceded today—than has been previously estimated. I think her disgusting personal attack on me was completely unwarranted, and I ask her to apologise. She should come down to the chamber now and do so. This government’s poor management of the 457 skilled migrant visa scheme and the incompetence of the Office of Workplace Services has been completely exposed through this. While the minister is not responsible for DEWR and the Office of Workplace Services—and I can understand her frustration with them—she is responsible for ensuring that standards for workers here under the 457 visa are maintained.
I note the government has acted in the bill before this place, where greater sanctions are applied to employers if the conditions of a visa are knowingly and recklessly breached. This is a response to the problems that were being experienced. Previously, employers doing the wrong thing under the 457 skilled migrant visa scheme could only be sanctioned by not being allowed to sponsor those migrant workers ever again. So that in itself, through the minister’s own legislation, is proof that the government knows it has a big problem here. It would not have known the extent of this problem if this issue had not been raised in parliament. So I am shocked at the sheer front of a minister who is clearly exposed and embarrassed by the extent of exploitation that I presume either the minister for industrial relations or OWS would have had to make public eventually. If they had not, we would have extracted the fact that there were 164 workers underpaid or 48 in breach of the award conditions in Senate estimates come November. Instead she has tried to shield herself and her government’s embarrassment by launching this pathetic, personal attack.
Workers do need to be brave. They do need to step forward and make complaints. They do need to join unions. But I find the hypocrisy disgusting. It is hypocritical for Senator Vanstone to suggest that unions ought to do more, when it is this government that has passed extreme industrial relations legislation designed specifically to remove the capacity of unions to go into these workplaces in the first place and to remove the awards—the minimum conditions—that these hospitality workers rely on and upon which the findings of these underpayments were based. Without these awards we would not be able to stamp out this exploitation, and that is the system of industrial relations that the Howard government stands for. It is extreme and it will deny the protections that we have been able to enforce by raising these issues in parliament and by embarrassing the government. (Time expired)

"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2006-08-10,"—I rise to take note of the answer Senator Lundy just spoke about—the answer Senator Vanstone gave to a question asked by Senator Fierravanti-Wells. She was addressing the issue of migrants in her answer and, towards the end of her answer, referring to the Labor Party, she said, ‘You let them in to sit on welfare queues.’ She is the minister for multiculturalism. I was astounded to hear the minister make that comment in question time today. The minister should be retracting that comment and apologising to the migrant community of Australia, who hold high positions, who have contributed so much to our community and who have made us the wealthy, diverse country that we are so that we can celebrate our multiculturalism. To have the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs making that comment was absolutely astounding to me.
Just this week I have had representations—as I know many other members of parliament have—from the Australians for Lebanon group. These Lebanese migrants who have come to Australia are doctors, lawyers and members of parliament, and they have contributed so much to our community. I was absolutely astounded to hear the minister who is responsible for multicultural affairs making these kinds of comments. I call on the minister to retract the comment she made in question time today and to apologise to the migrant community.

"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2006-08-10,"—I rise to speak on a matter of public importance: Australia’s status as a broadband backwater and the refusal of the minister to even acknowledge the existence of the problem. In a week in which Australia’s antiquated broadband infrastructure was on the front pages of every newspaper in Australia, the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts was staunchly insisting that there was really no problem. Senator Coonan stated that Australians in metropolitan areas—and she named them; she said, ‘Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide and Perth’—should be reasonably happy with their speed of broadband. She then stated that painting a bleak picture of internet speeds in Australia is misleading and that around four million Australians already have been connected to broadband, which she said was hardly an indictment on the state of broadband in Australia. That is Senator Coonan’s view of what is going on in her own portfolio.
It is difficult to know what the minister was more out of touch with—the voting public or the reality on the ground for Australia’s broadband infrastructure. The voting public was certainly none too impressed with the minister’s comments. In fact, her comments were jarring enough for the Age newspaper to ask its readers what they thought of the minister’s comments on a forum on its website. The torrent of complaints that reached this site in the next 24 hours was extraordinary and at times quite amusing. More than 100 readers wrote in to express their disgust at the minister’s statement. The readers were furious. It is instructive to read directly from a few of them just to demonstrate the arrogance of this government and this minister and how they have lost touch with ordinary Australians. Here are some of the quotes:
Coonan obviously lives inside a perspex bubble, tucked in the back of a cave, hidden under a large rock.
Another stated:
Helen Coonan is completely out of touch. I vehemently disagree with what she said.
Another said:
EVERYBODY is complaining about our laughably poor broadband: the IT industry, academia, the business sector, and these obscure people known as “the Australian public” to whom the Howard government never listens.
Another stated:
We’re complaining. Coonans not listening!!! Governments not acting!!!
Another simply said:
I. AM. COMPLAINING.
The message for the minister on this bulletin board was clear: it is time to start listening to the IT users of Australia and to provide some leadership to remedy Australia’s status as a broadband backwater. These complaints were not merely out of self-interest. These voters did not just want faster broadband to help them play video games or download movies. Instead, these voters understood the national significance of Australia’s backwards position on broadband. One reader made an astute comment on the broader national implications of the minister’s comments:
How are we as a country planning to remain competitive if we are chained to outdated technology? Helen Coonan can try to convince the public that all is well but in reality we are going to be left far far behind the rest of the world if a high-speed broadband system is not built. And it must be soon.
This reader is exactly right. That is what this debate is about. Australia will be left behind the rest of the world, unless the country receives a significant new investment in broadband infrastructure. If we do not receive this investment, the Australian economy will be the loser. This is not a dramatisation of the issue. Broadband is important. Broadband is a critical enabling technology that is currently driving substantial productivity gains around the world. True broadband will not only make Australian businesses more efficient than they already are but also open up completely new ways of operating—through things like VoIP, IPTV and virtual private networks. True broadband is also a crucial tool for the commercialisation of Australian intellectual property and content. True broadband will be the highway that Australian ICT and digital content companies use to deliver their products to the international marketplace. How many times in Australia have we heard the cry from all sides of politics, ‘If only we could commercialise our brilliant IP; if only it did not always have to go offshore to be developed’? Here is the first step in making sure that we can end that cry.
True broadband gives Australian knowledge economy companies the chance to break down the tyranny of distance and to connect with the global economy on an equal footing. True broadband is the infrastructure we need to stimulate the development of high-end digital content and other knowledge economy businesses in Australia. The federal government’s own broadband advisory group has stated that next generation broadband could produce economic benefits of up to $30 billion per annum to Australia. However, while Australia remains a broadband backwater, these benefits will remain unrealised. Unless the government recognises that Australia has a problem and then develops a plan for remedying this situation, these potential benefits will remain a dream. The minister is so out of touch, not just with the voters but also with the reality of Australia’s broadband performance, that she is continuing to ignore the problem. If the minister cared to look, she would see that the reality on the ground for the state of Australia’s broadband infrastructure is grim indeed.
Contrary to the minister’s comments, the situation is bleak. Do not take my word for it; listen to the chorus of international surveys deriding Australia’s broadband performance. The OECD ranks Australia 17th out of 30 countries for the take-up of 256K broadband. Despite growth off a low base, Australia’s relative position did not change from the previous year. The World Economic Forum ranks Australia 25th in the world in terms of available internet bandwidth; in addition, it ranks Australia’s network readiness at 15th and falling. A recent World Bank study confirms that Australia’s average ADSL speed, barely one megabit, is one of the slowest in the world and is behind countries like Britain, at 13 megabits; France, at 8.4 megabits; Germany, at 6.8 megabits; Canada, at 6.8 megabits; and the United States, at 3.3 megabits. That is right; we are struggling along at the bottom of the pack with, at best, a one-megabit average.
Prominent Australians who are suffering as a result of this situation have also expressed their concern. James Packer, Executive Chairman of Publishing and Broadcasting Ltd, recently described Australia’s broadband position as ‘embarrassing’. He further stated that there is a huge consumer demand for online video that is being held back by Australia’s antiquated broadband. Fairfax—publisher of the Age, the Sydney Morning Herald and the Financial Review and who has a very good website—in its submission to Senator Coonan’s media reform discussion paper, states that the encouragement of broadband is a critical element in Australia’s overall media policy. The submission goes on to state:
... internet speeds are slower and internet pricing is more expensive, than many other developed countries.
So, even if the minister will not admit there is a problem, plenty of other people, both in Australia and overseas, are willing to tell it like it is.
To remedy this situation and to bring Australia back into line with our international peers, Australia needs a massive investment in broadband infrastructure; Australia needs a national fibre-to-the-node network. Despite the minister’s furious spin, Telstra’s antiquated copper network will not be able to deliver the type of bandwidth that Australian businesses and consumers will need in a knowledge economy. This fact was rammed home in a recent report prepared by Tim Smeallie for Citigroup. This report evaluated the fallout of the collapse of the Telstra-ACCC FTN discussions. The report was clear about the technological limitations of Telstra’s existing copper network and ‘misguided reliance on ADSL2+ as a technology substitute for fibre’. That quote does not just blow a hole in but completely sinks the minister’s vision for a copper based future for Australian broadband. The report states:
It is physically impossible for ADSL2+ to deliver 24Mb/s on a mass market basis. Our analysis suggests a realistic average speed of approximately 3Mb/s assuming an average copper loop length of 2km.
A three-megabit solution for Australia’s broadband infrastructure needs is what Senator Helen Coonan, Prime Minister John Howard and the federal coalition government have on offer for Australia. When our international peers are moving to 20-, 30-, 50- and 100-megabit broadband infrastructure, the mob on the other side of the chamber want to tie our hands and feet together at three megabits. The Internet Industry Association noted recently that 80 per cent of Australians would need to have access to at least 10-megabit broadband by 2010—that is, 80 per cent of Australians will need to have access to at least 10-megabit broadband in four years time—in order to keep Australia competitive with our overseas rivals, and the minister is trying to tell us that Australia only needs three-megabit ADSL2+. Clearly, Telstra’s antiquated copper network is not up to the task. The reason that Telstra’s copper network is not up to the task is well identified and described by Citigroup’s technical experts. Citigroup finds:
... distance from the exchange, cross talk, home set-up [reduces speeds by up to 50%], and sub-sea backhaul.
The implications of forcing Australia to rely on ADSL2+ are clear:
Speeds <5Mb/s are insufficient to deliver high quality video products such as IPTV, Video on Demand and Replay TV.
These are the things that people want—the things that people in this country are crying out for—but we have a government that is saying: ‘You don’t really want that. You don’t really need true broadband. You don’t really need to be able to do fast downloads and videos or IPTV. You don’t need video on demand or replay TV.’ That is the government’s position. Citigroup concludes by saying, ‘We will have to wait until 2012 for true broadband, given delays on regulation and build, unless the government decides to intervene.’ That is right—Citibank, that doyen of socialism in the world, the largest investment bank in the world, says what is blindingly obvious to everybody in Australia except the government: government needs to step in and fix this mess.
While this out-of-touch minister is complacently advocating a do-nothing copper future for Australian telecommunications, our international competitors are rapidly moving to an optical fibre world. Countries like Korea, Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore, Canada, the United States and Germany are all currently rolling out optical fibre based networks that are even faster than Telstra’s proposal. Our international competitors understand that fibre is the future. Fibre based technology is taking off around the world, with 52.4 per cent growth in fibre connections in Korea last year. Japan already has 4.6 million fibre-to-the-home broadband subscribers. The case for a fibre future for Australia is clear.
There is one lonely voice on the government side from a member who understands, and that is the Liberal MP Mr Peter Lindsay. In comments reported by the media yesterday, Mr Lindsay stated that Telstra’s decision to abandon its fibre-to-the-node plans as a result of government policy was a ‘disaster’. Mr Lindsay, the lone person in the coalition who understands this debate—do not worry about the minister—went on to state:
As much as others argue that broadband can be provided without fibre-to-the-node, true broadband cannot be provided without it. Australians deserve top shelf broadband and that can only be delivered by fibre optic cable. Without it we will be held back.
I have to say that Mr Lindsay is 100 per cent right. But, as the minister indicated in question time today, she has had Mr Lindsay brought in and she has corrected his views. Poor Mr Lindsay. It is a horrible thought.
Australia does need top-shelf broadband, and this can only be delivered by fibre optic cable. Australian broadband users can only hope that Mr Lindsay is sending this message to Helen Coonan in the coalition party room. Maybe even a senator as smart as Senator Michael Ronaldson, who is speaking next, knows deep down, in his gut, that Australia needs fibre—that is, ADSL2+, if you are relying on Telstra. Are you relying on Telstra, one of your favourite companies, Senator Ronaldson? Do you want to sign up your life to Telstra’s ADSL2+, Senator Ronaldson? I think not. As I said, hopefully a few more courageous Liberals will be explaining the facts of life to Senator Coonan regarding what is going on in their electorates. The problem is not going to fix itself. In order to deliver this massive infrastructure investment, government leadership is required. Australia’s position in broadband is so dire that the government must take the lead to bring Australia back into line with our international competitors. The Internet Industry Association has correctly identified that the only way Australia can remain competitive with our international peers in broadband is through ‘significant and meaningful changes in attitude and leadership from the government and policy makers’. That is you, Senator Ronaldson.
This is the nub of the issue. Senator Helen Coonan is the minister for communications. Ensuring that Australia has access to world-class telecommunications infrastructure is her responsibility, but, like John Howard, she has no plan for Australia’s future. With the collapse of Telstra’s fibre-to-the-node plans, the minister has no plan to transition Australia to a fibre world. She has no plan for the future. After 10 years of pork-barrelling in rural and regional Australia, the Howard government does not know how to provide infrastructure leadership anymore. Instead of recognising the problem and trying to address it, the minister is in denial. As Kim Beazley, leader of the Labor Party, said this week, she is shepherding Australia down an IT goat track. She is shepherding the Australian economy onto an IT goat track while the rest of the world is building five-lane superhighways.
Three months ago, the minister was taking credit for Telstra’s fibre-to-the-node plans in her address to the World Congress on Information Technology. She went overseas and spruiked it. She told everybody in the world what a fantastic thing was going to happen—that is, that Telstra was going to roll out a fibre network. They were all her own words in a speech given in the United States. But, now that the plans have fallen apart, she is trying to convince Australians that we do not need this cutting edge technology, that we can get by.
Labor believes that government leadership to deliver 21st century infrastructure of this kind is necessary to sustain Australia’s economic prosperity for our children. Labor wants to give Australian businesses and families the best infrastructure available. In contrast to the minister’s inaction, Labor has been playing a leading role in the Australian telecommunications infrastructure debate. Late last year, Kim Beazley released Labor’s infrastructure blueprint. This blueprint set out a series of policies for remedying Australia’s current infrastructure shortcomings. This blueprint gave broadband infrastructure equal footing with roads, water and electricity infrastructure. So let us be clear: when Labor talks infrastructure, it is not just talking roads, it is not just talking ports and it is not just talking water or electricity—it is talking broadband, because this is the technology of the future.
Labor also posed a series of practical policies designed to improve Australia’s broadband performance. The blueprint committed Labor to setting targets for Australia’s utilisation of broadband in the areas of price, speed and accessibility and to providing the leadership to achieve these targets. It also committed Labor to conducting an audit of Australia’s existing optical fibre infrastructure, including unutilised ‘dark fibre’. Labor produced a plan—Labor’s Broadband Plan. The belief that government has a leadership role to play in the delivery of telecommunications infrastructure in Australia is the foundation of Labor’s Broadband Plan. Labor’s plan delivers this by committing to a series of regulatory reforms and public funding. Labor’s plan called for the creation of a joint venture company that would own and operate a national open access fibre-to-the-node network. The joint venture infrastructure owner would be separated from retailers to ensure competition.
In this regard, Labor’s plan has much in common with the subsequently released Optus-led G9 proposal. Investment certainty would be delivered. Labor’s plan also involves nation-building public investment to lift Australia out of the communications dark ages. Labor’s plan made available up to $2.7 billion in public funding to extend the reach of this fibre network to as many people as possible and to ensure 98 per cent of Australians have access to a minimum of six megabits per second broadband.

"Ronaldson, Sen Michael",LP,2006-08-10,"—I was unaware until Senator Trood brought it to the attention of the Senate today that Mark Latham in his book apparently indicated that when Senator Conroy was offered this shadow portfolio he was not too keen at all. It was a bad week when it was offered. If that was a bad week, this has been worse, because, unfortunately for Senator Conroy and Mr Beazley in the other place, they had nailed their colours to the fibre-to-the-node mast. I am afraid that a very large gale blew up and ripped those colours to shreds. Unfortunately for Senator Conroy and for Mr Beazley, they had effectively plucked out Telstra’s fibre-to-the-node proposal, deemed it to be their own and when it fell apart at the seams on Tuesday were effectively left in a policy vacuum.
I will give the Senate some quotes. I only have 10 minutes and not the 15 minutes I thought I had, so I will make this very brief. Senator Conroy quoted the Age. I will quote the Age as well. Alan Kohler in the Age headed his article ‘Telstra spits the dummy, but node news is not so bad news after all’. He wrote:
SO, TELSTRA has spat the dummy on fibre to the node (FTTN). Good. Now we can get back to the more interesting and important business of entrenching competition in the broadband we have—ADSL.
Telstra was obviously trying to use fibre to re-established its fixed-line monopoly, because ADSL competition has been starting to get out of control.
Optus, Primus, AAPT and iiNet have accelerated the installation of digital multiplexers in Telstra’s exchanges and have been planning a big competitive assault on Telstra’s broadband market share when the ACCC cuts copper access prices, which it is about to do.
There were other quotes, but time does not allow me to go through them. Telstra’s behaviour in relation to fibre to the node is quite disgraceful. It flows on from their quite disgraceful behaviour in relation to programs such as New Ground, which made available broadband to an extra 200,000 outer metropolitan Australians—which they could have done 12 or 18 months ago but refused to do—and their XTel program, which would have given about 14,000 regional and rural subscribers broadband. They have the equipment there. There are 200 pieces of equipment sitting there not being used. For Telstra to say that the ACCC’s unwillingness to recognise the actual cost of Telstra’s FTTN investment is the reason for the breakdown is absolute, patent nonsense. In fact, when setting access prices, the ACCC is required by law to take into account the cost of investment and the legitimate commercial interest of the infrastructure owner, including the investment risk faced by the owner and the need to provide incentives for investment.
The government’s telecommunications regulatory framework has created a competitive environment that has brought more choice, innovative new services and lower prices for Australian consumers and businesses. There are many companies, as I said before—iiNet, Internode, Primus, Optus and Austar, to name a few—who are already making substantial investments in next generation broadband services. On top of that, the government itself has invested a huge amount of taxpayers’ dollars in this area: the Broadband Connect funding of some $878 million, a competitive program which is delivering enormous benefits, and the $50 million Metropolitan Broadband Connect program. No government in this country’s history has put more money into this area. In fact, it was this government that broke Labor’s cosy duopoly, which held back telecommunications in this country for the 13 years they were in power.
I will briefly now go to Labor’s broadband policy. Senator Conroy was talking about a $2.7 billion investment from the Labor Party. The trouble is that Senator Conroy has no idea what the cost is; he has no idea at all. About a week after their policy launch, when they nailed their colours to the FTTN mast, Senator Conroy was asked what the cost of the rollout would be. He said, ‘Well, we’ll have to sit down and work it out.’ He has this magnificent, marvellous policy and he has to sit down and work out what the cost is! The only person who will pay the end result of that cost is the Australian taxpayer. Senator Conroy has been totally confused about broadband from the beginning, which probably reflects his reluctance to take up the portfolio in the first place. Firstly, he labelled broadband under 10 megabits per second as ‘fraudband’. Then his leader, Mr Beazley, came up with a plan for six megabits per second and suddenly Senator Conroy changed his mind. When it became clear that 12 megabits per second was widely available in metropolitan areas, the exact same areas where Telstra would have installed fibre to the node, Senator Conroy started talking about 100 megabits per second.
In this MPI, reference was made to OECD reports, and there was very selective quoting from Senator Conroy today. I know the Labor Party only mutter the word OECD under their breath now, because they are acutely aware of the rankings the OECD gives this country and the enormous credit it pays us for the structural reform and the robust macroeconomic framework we have introduced. Our living standards now surpass all the G7 countries except the United States. Today’s extraordinary employment figures are further proof of this government’s credentials.
In relation to broadband, Senator Conroy said we are at the bottom of the heap. Nothing could be further from the truth. I will quickly go through three of the points that he raised. The first point was about take-up. The reality is that Australia’s broadband take-up is growing at the fifth fastest rate in the world. We are growing faster than the US, the UK, Japan, Korea, Canada, France and Germany. It is hardly the backwater he refers to. We are surging ahead. The second point was in relation to penetration. Senator Conroy has made a number of claims. Yes, it is true we can improve—and that is what the government are doing; that is why we are spending hundreds of millions of taxpayers’ dollars—but we are improving rapidly. In the latest broadband penetration figures, which are behind what is currently happening, Australia is ahead of Germany, Italy, Ireland, Spain, Portugal, Greece and many others, and we are within just a few percentage points of Japan, the US and the UK. Indeed, the Economist Intelligence Unit, talking about e-ratings and other things, has said that Australia is among the big gainers in 2006 rankings. It says:
... Australia, Canada, the US and Western Europe have over the last two years made considerable leaps in broadband penetration and have effectively “caught up” with South Korea and Japan.
Those are the countries that have been painted by Senator Conroy as the world leaders. I repeat:
... made considerable leaps in broadband penetration and have effectively “caught up” with South Korea and Japan.
The third point that Senator Conroy refers to is the question of speed. He said we have the slowest broadband in the world. That is simply not true. I assume that Senator Conroy is being very cute with this and that he must be referring to the OECD ranking of speeds offered by incumbent telcos. Yes, Telstra’s ranking is about 25th, but Senator Conroy neglects to acknowledge that we are not living under Labor’s cosy telco duopoly and that we do not have to rely on the incumbent. Indeed, people are voting with their feet and are no longer relying on the incumbent. There are many competitors offering broadband speeds many times faster than the 1.5 megabit speeds offered by Telstra. The Labor Party have been in an absolute shambles over this matter since the fibre-to-the-node network approach to the ACCC failed. It is complete and utter chaos for them, for which they have no answers. (Time expired)

"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2006-08-10,"—It is not an overstatement to say that telecommunications is vital for the national security and economic and social development of Australia. Australians now rely on e-commerce, e-health, e-education and e-banking. E-communications now dominate the lives of people everywhere, particularly in this place. The way we communicate with one another and the outside world now compared to five years ago is dramatically different. For many businesses, especially small businesses, efficient and effective communication systems are absolutely critical. High-speed internet is a prerequisite for engagement with the modern economy and society. A cost-effective, reliable communications system is critical for Australians living in rural and regional areas and particularly in remote areas. In fact, their only chance of overcoming the tyranny of distance, of isolation and of lack of services, particularly transport, comes down to the internet. The Australian Industry Group told the 2004 Senate broadband inquiry:
Broadband technologies will be the roads and railways of the 21st century, generating the next wave of economic expansion. Just as transport opened up new economic horizons in the last century, advanced communication networks will pave the way for productivity gains across global economies …
The Institution of Engineers told the same committee:
Assuming that broadband is adopted as universally as the telephone over the next 25 years, it has been estimated that broadband technology could produce economic benefits of $12 billion per annum to Australia.
And yet Australia still lags behind the OECD average for broadband penetration. According to the 2005 OECD communications outlook, Australian broadband subscribers jumped 41 per cent, with an average of 10.9 broadband subscribers for every 100 people—up from 7.7 last December. However, that is still well below the OECD average of 11.8 subscribers per 100 people. The increase did lift Australia’s ranking for broadband penetration among 30 OECD countries by four slots, to 17th position. But topping the league table was Korea, with 25.5 subscribers per 100 people, followed by the Netherlands, with 22.5; Denmark, with 21.8; Iceland, with 21.7; and Switzerland, with 20.3. Some would argue that this is all because of our large land mass. However, when you look at countries like Canada and the United States, they are well above our level. International Telecommunications Union statistics from 1 January this year only rank the top 15, and Australia is not in there, so very little has changed in the year since the OECD report. The Senate committee tabled its report in August 2004. This report said:
… many parts of the country, particularly in rural and regional areas but also in some suburban areas on the fringes of the major urban centres, do not have access to broadband Internet services …
Little has changed since that time. While some metropolitan customers are accessing broadband speeds of 1.5 megabits per second, as provided by Telstra ADSL, to 24 megabits per second, as claimed by those offering ADSL2+, plenty living five or six kilometres beyond the exchange and in regional areas cannot access these speeds.
While competition has improved in the telecommunications markets over the years—particularly in mobile phones—Telstra, with its ownership of the copper network and the HFC cable, is still the dominant player in most other telecommunications markets. As a result of the ownership of both the copper wire and the HFC cable, plus the lack of competition and Telstra’s strategy to maximise shareholders’ value, there has been no incentive for Telstra to invest in its infrastructure, including in high-speed broadband. Evidence shows that since privatisation began there has been a steady decline in infrastructure spending as a percentage of Telstra’s sales revenue. As a result of the government’s obsession with privatising Telstra and hence the infrastructure, the government has been forced to spend billions of dollars on encouraging competitors to invest in broadband infrastructure. However, those initiatives, such as Networking the Nation, were considered by many to be very poorly targeted, poorly implemented and largely a waste of resources.
The Democrats believe the major problem, and the reason why Australia is so far behind on broadband uptake, is the government’s light touch regulation and its failure to control Telstra. This government failure has resulted in one of Australia’s largest companies continuously putting up barriers to competition and reducing its investment in infrastructure. So it is a very sad and pathetic story, I am afraid.
Telstra’s pulling out of negotiations on fibre to the node was disappointing but not critical. In fact, Telstra’s fibre-to-the-node proposal, as you would expect, lets them keep their monopoly on the unbundled local loop. But, in the context of a long line of failures, like dragging their feet on ADSL 2 access and installation, stalling ACCC negotiations on the unbundled local loop, putting up barriers to competitor access to that loop and undercutting retail broadband price, we have a problem—a very big problem—in this country. Self-operational separation and self-regulation have monumentally failed. The government has been too weak and too ideologically driven to intervene, despite being a major shareholder. Now it is going to have to take some action. The Democrats have argued for the last five years that, if the government was going to sell Telstra, at the very minimum Telstra should be required to divest its ownership of the HFC cable. This has to happen to open up more competition in the market. The ACCC argued that, in protecting the revenue of both the copper wire and the HFC networks, investment will not be made, or will be delayed, in services that would cannibalise the revenue of the other network.
As predicted, the operational separation of Telstra is not working and is unlikely to. There is support in the industry for the aims of operational separation—there is no doubt about that—but not for the wishy-washy model that the government insisted on last year. The ACCC complained; the industry said it would be useless and, indeed, it was. Then Telstra is allowed to develop the plan itself. The minister and not the ACCC will oversee the development and implementation of the plan; the operational separation plan is not a licence condition; enforcement of a breach of operational separation by the ACCC is not available until after a rectification plan has been developed; there is no requirement that the ACCC be involved in the development of the draft plan, nor that the minister take advice from the ACCC with respect to that plan; the legislation does not allow the minister to designate new services; and the absence of a formal advisory role for the ACCC in the internal wholesale pricing and pricing equivalence regime, and the possible length of time involved in setting prices—these are just some of the criticisms that were levelled at the government at the time. And they have turned out to be appropriate.
The Democrats moved a raft of amendments to address those concerns but they were, of course, not supported by this government. We say that, if we want fair and transparent competition in the Australian telecommunications system, the government has to move down the path of structural separation—that is, it must separate the wholesale from the retail. The government has continually argued that the cost of structural separation would outweigh the benefits, but there is no real evidence for that and the government has not investigated whether or not this is the case—or, if it has, it has not told us.
The OECD recommended that its members consider structural separation as a means of promoting competition in utilities as an alternative to regulation. This was also supported by the National Competition Council. The Democrats do not always agree with everything that those bodies say but, on this issue, they are right. Another important reason why the government should, at a minimum, own the infrastructure is to guarantee fair access and some sort of parity for regional users. It is time, we say, for the government to bite the bullet, to structurally separate Telstra, to keep the infrastructure in government hands, to divest the HFC cable and to use the funds to roll out fibre.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Telecommunications</title>,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,20,1,speech
"Wortley, Sen Dana",ALP,2006-08-10,"—I rise to contribute to this debate on a matter of public importance, one that affects all Australians: the government’s lack of a plan to deliver a high-speed broadband communications network for Australia. A fibre-to-the-node network would be a significant step forward for our antiquated telecommunications infrastructure. It would be a great improvement. But if the people of Australia think it is on the horizon of this government today then they are going to be greatly disappointed, because the Howard government is not delivering. It does not have any idea of how to deliver world-class broadband infrastructure to Australia.
While the minister is prepared to marginally improve access to entry-level broadband in rural Australia, the Howard government has no plan whatsoever for delivering world-class broadband infrastructure to Australia’s cities and suburban areas. In fact, the Howard government is AWOL when it comes to telecommunications infrastructure. And it is time the minister stepped forward and took responsibility for Australia’s floundering position among the developed countries of the world. We are ranked 17th out of 30 countries surveyed by the OECD for take-up of 256 kilobits per second broadband.
The confirmation on Monday of this week that Telstra and the competitive watchdog, the ACCC, have fallen out over the rollout of fibre broadband infrastructure has left the government without any idea of how to bring internet speeds in Australia up to world class. Today, Korea, Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore, the United States, France, Germany and Italy all have broadband speeds of over 20 kilobits per second while Australia lags far behind. The irony is that broadband is all about increased speed and productivity, and here we have the minister applying the brakes on Australia’s ability to access new technology. Either that, or there is a problem finding the accelerator.
The decision made in this place on Australia’s IT capabilities over the next decade will be absolutely critical to our economic prosperity. Yet we on this side have serious and justifiable doubts about this government’s ability to make up where they failed in the past 10 years, and we do not stand alone with our concerns. In yesterday’s Sydney Morning Herald the director of the Technology and Innovation Management Centre at Queensland university and a world-recognised expert on innovation, Professor Mark Dodgson, said:
The impasse between Telstra and the ACCC and the Government is just a complete mess and it needs to be resolved …
                  …         …         …
The Government has to step up, if Telstra won’t. Broadband is the basic infrastructure that the economy needs, it’s just essential, like roads or railways. It is entry-level stuff.
And a telecommunications analyst, Paul Budde, is quoted as saying:
 … Australia was “running three years behind [comparable nations] and it’s going to take five years to catch up.”
And the gap is, at this stage, still growing. The article also reports that analysts warned that, the longer Australia waited, the wider the gap between Australian businesses and overseas competitors would become. It also highlighted the plight of Simon Grover, who runs an internet business. Mr Grover says he is ‘frustrated by having to use simpler technology’ to allow clients from around the country, many of whom do not have broadband, to use the service. He said:
With a business like this, it obviously makes it a lot slower and harder ... We have plans to increase our online range, but slow broadband take-up rates just make the process more difficult.
He also said:
If more people had broadband it would be a different story …
With Labor it will be a different story because Labor do have a plan. While John Howard and Minister Coonan sit on the side of the road trying to make sense of the map that might lead them onto the information superhighway, Labor are lapping them at a steady speed. We do have a plan for delivering world-class telecommunications infrastructure for Australia and, while we have made clear our position on the regulatory changes necessary to facilitate a rollout of a fibre-to-the-node network, the Howard government’s position is to retain the status quo and leave Australia trailing behind the rest of the world.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Telecommunications</title>,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,20,1,speech
"Fierravanti-Wells, Sen Concetta",LP,2006-08-10,"—I rise to speak on this matter of public importance in relation to the Telstra decision on fibre to the node. The fibre-to-the-node proposal relates to adding nodes to the broadband network to deliver ADSL2+ broadband in five capital cities, thereby excluding major regional areas like the Illawarra, where my electorate office is located. Telstra pulled out of their talks with the ACCC on a fibre-to-the-node network, even though they had been saying publicly that there were very few issues left to be resolved. It is puzzling why they would discontinue the talks when they seemed so close to a resolution.
Telstra cited the ACCC’s alleged unwillingness to recognise the actual costs of Telstra’s fibre-to-the-node investment as a reason for the breakdown. In fact, when setting access prices the ACCC is required by law to take into account the costs of the investment and the legitimate commercial interests of the infrastructure owner, including the investment risks faced by the owner and the need to provide incentives for investment. The ACCC has assured the government that it has always been prepared to consider fair and reasonable access terms, as indeed it is legally obliged to do. The government reviewed telecommunications regulatory arrangements only last year and specifically made legislative changes to further encourage investment and ensure investors’ risks were taken into account in regulatory decision making. There have been no substantive changes to the market since the 2005 review and Telstra remains in a strong position in many markets. However, at the end of the day, this is a commercial decision for Telstra.
The government’s telecommunications regulatory framework has created a competitive environment that has brought more choice, innovative new services and lower prices for Australian consumers and businesses. There are many companies—iiNet, Internode, Primus, Optus and Austar, to name a few—already making investments in next generation broadband services. Industry commentators estimate that as a result of these competitive investments very high speed broadband is already available to more than 50 per cent of customers.
In fact, Telstra also has other means of providing high-speed broadband apart from fibre to the node. At any time it chose to, Telstra could start using its longstanding investment in ADSL2+ equipment, which can deliver very fast broadband, in its exchanges. Indeed, I would urge them to do so. Telstra’s fibre proposal was only ever intended to target the five major capital cities of Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide and Perth where there are already significant broadband speeds and ample competition. For instance, in the five capital cities where Telstra’s fibre network was to be deployed, multi-megabit broadband speeds are already available to most consumers via alternative platforms including ADSL2+, cable and wireless. When Telstra switches on its ADSL2+ network, which we hope is imminent, this number will rise exponentially.
At least nine service providers already offer ADSL2+ in the capital cities and major regional centres at very fast speeds. The competitive rollout of high-speed broadband infrastructure which is taking place will be complemented by the $1.1 billion Connect Australia package and the $2 billion communications fund established by the government. These programs will ensure people living in rural and regional Australia can access world-class telecommunications services both now and into the future. So any suggestion that Telstra’s decision to discontinue the talks with the ACCC somehow spells an end to the rollout of fast broadband infrastructure is misplaced.
Telstra’s decision has left Labor’s broadband policy in an absolute shambles. Only two years ago the Labor recommendations in a Senate inquiry report were that we should spend billions on guaranteeing dial-up internet speeds of 40 kilobits per second—up to 300 times slower than the speeds available on ADSL 2 enabled exchanges available in many parts of Australia. Mr Beazley pinched a publicly announced plan by Telstra as his only policy, and the whole house of cards was built on Telstra funding a fibre network in five capital cities. Without it, Labor’s policy falls down into a big hole.
Labor has been confused about broadband since the very beginning. First, Senator Conroy labelled any broadband under 10 megabits per second as ‘fraudband’. Then his leader came out with a plan for six megabits per second, and Senator Conroy suddenly changed his mind. And when it became clear that 12 megabits per second was widely available in metropolitan areas—the exact areas where Telstra would have installed fibre to the node—Senator Conroy started talking about 100 megabits per second. The ALP needs to make a decision and stick to it. The only card the opposition has got to play in the broadband debate is to misrepresent what the government says.
The minister has clearly said that, even in the absence of any metropolitan fibre network, Australians living in inner metropolitan areas can access faster broadband speeds of between 12 and 18 megabits per second if they can access ADSL2+ or, indeed, cable networks. The government’s longstanding policy of encouraging competition in telecommunications has delivered to metropolitan consumers a choice of broadband providers and speeds. Clearly, different people have different needs when it comes to broadband speeds, but for most people a connection of 1.5 megabits per second is currently adequate to deliver the services and downloads they want. Others may want faster connections, and these are currently largely available in the metropolitan areas that would have benefited from fibre. For instance, ADSL2+ and cable networks enable service providers to deliver a rich mix of data services to users, including high-quality video, audio, voice and text.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Telecommunications</title>,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,20,1,speech
"Joyce, Sen Barnaby",NATS,2006-08-10,"—It is interesting to be here today and hear the Labor Party put forward a matter of public importance about telecommunications. It was actually fascinating to read it. I thought I would pull it apart and look at it. I will start with (c), where Senator Conroy’s MPI says:
the collapse of Telstra’s plans to construct a fibre to the node network leaving Australia without a pathway to a fibre based upgrade of Australia’s broadband infrastructure.
That just about sets down how the Labor Party see Australia. You see, the fibre-to-the-node network was going to connect Sydney to Sydney, Brisbane to Brisbane, and Melbourne to Melbourne. It did not actually connect Australia. It did not actually get to Newcastle or Wollongong. But this was the package that Senator Conroy thinks is a matter of public importance. Well, it is. It was so bereft of any moral function for what this nation needs that it is a matter of public importance.
It would be an absolute disgrace if the minister had allowed that to go through. I think it is actually an endorsement of the support of the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts for regional Australia. This clearly points out the sort of myopic, narrow view that the Labor Party has of Australia. It is the Australia of the people who have telecommunications, with no thought of the people who do not have it. It is a clear political ploy. It is a pitch to the voters, a pitch to the inner suburbs of Sydney—and good luck to you—but it is not a pitch to Australia. It is nothing about our nation.
It is interesting that they talk about a plan. They are big on plans in the Labor Party. Morris Iemma has a plan: he has a plan about how he is going to have a plan to make a plan. There are lots of plans, but we never actually see their plans; we never actually hear about them; we never actually see their acumen and have them lay out an argument, like the National Party did when it negotiated the $3.1 billion package. That is a plan—that is where the hard work is. We actually have that. We have put in the work.
We know what the Labor Party are going to do: they are going to snaffle up that money, grab it up—Gobbleguts is going to grab it up—and put it towards some nefarious outcome, which they obviously agree is going to be a fibre-to-the-node type plan. They would connect the capital cities. They would use the money that has been extracted to give some parity, some fairness, to the Australian people, to provide equality across the Australian continent, and say to people in Tamworth, Brewarrina, Longreach, Darwin, Tennant Creek and all those sorts of towns: ‘No, we don’t think you’re part of the Labor Party’s Australia. The Labor Party’s Australia exists in Sydney, the middle of Melbourne or the middle of Brisbane, but it doesn’t exist anywhere else. It doesn’t exist in Newcastle or Wollongong. In fact, we’re going to make it a matter of public importance to say that we’re disgusted that you would consider connecting the good workers of Wollongong. We’d make it a matter of public importance that the Labor Party thinks it’s disgusting that you would want to connect Newcastle. How dare the conservative side of politics want to connect Newcastle! How could they possibly consider that? Connect Tamworth? No, we could never have that!’ So it is no wonder that Minister Coonan would say, ‘No, fellas—go back.’
It is also interesting that, right at the beginning of the MPI, Senator Conroy talked about ‘the Australian government’s complacency on the rollout of broadband’. Maybe he does not want the Australian government to be involved in that telecommunications company anymore. Maybe that is the truth. Maybe the enabling legislation was a whole charade. The truth was that you were going to sell Telstra anyhow, weren’t you? That was always on the cards.
In fact, I would like to see someone walk into the chamber and say, ‘Should I ever get elected, I will make a commitment over my mother’s grave that I will put Telstra back into private hands,’ because I never hear that commitment. They dodge that issue and they are dodging that issue more and more, especially now they realise that 51.8 per cent of Telstra is still owned by the Commonwealth. But they have dropped that out of the conversation. They want to take Australia down a path. They want to have a bet each way.

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2006-08-10,"—I speak about document No. 2 in the Notice Paper list, the DIMIA 2004-05 annual report—all 528 pages of it. I want to talk about just a few things that you will not find, as well as some that you will find, in this annual report. This report does not tell you anything more about the outrageous scandal of a mentally ill Australian resident, Cornelia Rau, who was locked up in detention, except that it was the cause of a little scrutiny in the department. It takes the same scanty approach to the deportation of Vivian Alvarez Solon. It draws a veil over a pregnant New Zealand woman detained in a Brisbane prison for 23 days by immigration officials before being released. And it draws a veil over Ian and Jamie Hwang—11 and five years old at the time—who were forcibly removed from Stanmore Public School and wrongly detained for more than five months, even though they were legally in Australia on valid bridging visas.
You will not read about Peter Qasim, who had seven years in detention. He declared he was from Kashmir and the government claimed they were unable to confirm his background, despite three language experts brought in by the government stating he was likely to be from Kashmir. What about the late Harry Seidler’s citizenship and passport fiasco? You will not see that. You will not see the Hamberger report. A damning, independent inquiry found that five unnamed detainees were manhandled by GSL officers, subjected to sensory deprivation and denied access to food, water and toilet facilities during a 6½-hour journey in a small van—and the department misled the media about it.
You will not read the case of Mr X, a stateless man from Bangladesh and an insulin-dependent diabetic. The immigration department was planning to deport him even though he would have most certainly died within weeks of leaving Australia. You will not read the case of Mr T, a mentally ill Australian citizen who was detained in 1999, correctly identified after five days and released, only to be redetained in the same facility for 242 consecutive days. You will not see any reference in this annual report to the promotion of the departmental secretary of DIMIA who had oversight of all of this, Mr Bill Farmer, to Australian Ambassador to Indonesia.
We know this department was a shambles between 2004 and 2005. This department represents one of the greatest public administration fiascos in the history of the Commonwealth of Australia—a department so tainted by the Howard government’s politics that it has developed an obsession with detention and deportation. If you read this annual report, you will not know any of that. You will not know that Minister Vanstone and her discredited predecessor, Mr Ruddock, have overseen bungle after bungle and disaster after disaster, and that the department has been in chaos. But we know what is not in the annual report. We know the mistakes, the wrongful detentions and the wrongful deportations, and we wait to see what other disasters and incompetence will be revealed as time goes on. You can be sure you will not see them in this annual report of 528 pages, so I thought someone at least should today, in the Senate, put on the record the department’s real performance—put the real record on the record.
Before I conclude my remarks, I just wanted to take this opportunity to congratulate my leader, Mr Beazley, for accurately describing Mr Wilson Tuckey on these immigration issues as ‘weak and worthless’. You are absolutely right, Mr Beazley. Mr Wilson Tuckey was out there defending the indefensible. He was out there defending this department—this turnstile of incompetence. He was supporting Senator Vanstone, the most accident-prone minister that we have in the Howard government. (Time expired)

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2006-08-10,"—I also want to take a couple of minutes of the Senate’s time to congratulate the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs for the work she and her department have been doing in a very difficult area over many years, even going back to 2004-05—when I do not think Senator Vanstone was then the minister, but whoever the minister was at the time—
—Ruddock.
—Someone tells me it was Mr Ruddock, so why did Senator Faulkner just spend 20 seconds talking about Senator Vanstone? He is not even aware of the right report.
—Because it’s this year’s report, you goose!
—He’s not even aware of the right report! It is from 2004-05. But this department does operate in very difficult circumstances. What I think the department does is very sensitively deal with a lot of issues. Thousands and thousands of people go through the hands of the department in any one year. You hear about two or three of them; there are mistakes made. Those mistakes are corrected as quickly as can happen.
Not quite on the report: I am glad Senator Faulkner drew attention to the loutish behaviour of the leader of the Labor Party, Mr Beazley, in fronting up to Mr Tuckey. Mr Tuckey certainly does not need me to defend him, I have to say, but there is a man of strength, courage and commitment, who has done a marvellous job for Western Australia, particularly his electorate, over a long period of time.
Opposition senators interjecting—
—He has been here for much longer than any of those shouting from the other side will ever be. His contribution to Australia in the time he has been here will surpass the contribution of all those on the other side put together. It is a disgrace that the Labor Party have now perhaps sunk even lower than when Mr Latham was the leader. One would think that they could not have gone lower than Mr Latham. These people all supported him, of course, but the general public saw through Mr Latham. It is of interest that it now seems that the current leader is determined to lower the standards even further. That sort of loutish behaviour, where you confront in a physical way members of parliament who are out there making their points of view known, expressing their views as we love to do and are entitled to do in this country, does not suit Mr Beazley. He did not want to answer the questions that Mr Tuckey was suggesting should be put to him. Mr Tuckey quite rightly said: ‘Don’t talk about the so-called Liberal rebels; ask what the Labor Party is doing. Ask why the Labor Party is so weak on border protection, so weak on these sorts of issues that they oppose the government.’

Honourable senators will recall that on 14 June this year I asked Senator Vanstone whether there was anything in the relevant regulations to prevent employers from forcing section 457 visa guest workers from working unreasonable hours in order to earn the required minimum salary of $41,850. I was concerned that, if the section 457 guest workers were paid the minimum wage, they would need to work more than 60 hours a week in order to earn the salary required under the regulations. In Senator Vanstone’s reply to my question she said:
We would be happy to make any investigation in relation to any claims that you bring forward.
Senator Vanstone also said, when asked a question on that same subject the following day by Senator George Campbell—
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. It is not the point of order about Senator Sterle reading his speech yet again—I won’t raise that. It has just been clearly pointed out by the opposition that this report that we are discussing, the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs annual report for 2004-05, covers a time when Senator Vanstone was not the relevant minister. What is the point of discussing this particular report? Senator Sterle seems to be discussing Senator Vanstone, who had nothing to do with the department at that particular time.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, on the point of order: I find it interesting that Senator Macdonald, who wants to talk about the opposition leader in his—
 (Senator Ferguson)—What is your point of order, Senator Wong?
—I raise a point of relevance. There are two issues. First, the minister is the minister who has tabled the document—it is her department. Second, my recollection—I am happy to be corrected—is that Senator Vanstone was in fact the appointed minister during that period after the 2004 election.
—Order! Both speakers have made very good debating points but I think Senator Sterle is in order.
—I will quickly reiterate that, when Senator Vanstone was asked a question by Senator George Campbell on the same subject, the response was:
... if the company is doing the wrong thing they will be dealt with ...
I have done some research into what exactly Senator Vanstone means when she says that companies that do the wrong thing will be investigated and ‘dealt with’ in my home state. I learnt that, far from making investigations into allegations of exploitation, the immigration department merely refers such matters to the Western Australian Department of Consumer and Employment Protection for them to investigate at Western Australian taxpayers’ expense. Under the terms of the memorandum of understanding between DIMA and DOCEP it is open to the employer to identify breaches and therefore avoid prosecution. How charitable!
I learnt that in 2004-05 the Western Australian Department of Consumer and Employment Protection conducted 36 investigations at the immigration department’s request into alleged breaches by bosses of their legal obligations to the section 457 guest workers. I also learnt that 28 of the 36 bosses investigated were found to be in breach of one or more matters, including failure to pay appropriate rates of pay, failure to pay penalty and overtime rates of pay, failure to meet annual leave and public holiday entitlements and failure to maintain appropriate time and wages records. The total value of identified underpayments for these 28 breaches was $203,000, with underpayments to individual workers of up to $30,000. One worker was even being forced to work 84 hours per week. But the Howard government has ensured that, if these dodgy bosses quietly fix up the pay, they will avoid prosecution for their crooked actions. So much for being ‘dealt with’. Despite the documented widespread and disgraceful rorting of these vulnerable section 457 guest workers, the Howard government can rightly say:
After thorough investigations of allegations there has not been one single prosecution of an employer in Western Australia for exploiting 457 guest workers.
All of these matters were quietly settled and swept under the carpet so that there is no record of prosecution for any of these 28 crooked actions in Western Australia.
I invite senators to compare the loving and forgiving treatment the Howard government shows to employers who rip off vulnerable 457 guest workers with that given to Mr Mal Peters, from my home state of WA, and his family. Mal Peters acted in defence of a delegate after that delegate in his workplace was sacked. Mr Peters is facing fines of up to $28,000 and stands to lose his family home or even face jail. There is no second chance for Mal Peters and his family. There is no opportunity to quietly fix up matters in order to avoid prosecution. Mal Peters is being dragged through the court by this government, not because he exploited anyone, not because he stole from the pay packets of workers but because he dared to act in defence of his delegate. We see it time and again with this government: the velvet glove for dodgy bosses, and jackboots for the workers. If senators still need evidence of the pig-headed hatred this government has for working people they need only compare the treatment dished out to Mal Peters with the second chances given to crooked employers who exploit 457 guest workers in my state.",SENATE,<title>DOCUMENTS</title>,<title>Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs</title>,DOCUMENTS,24,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2006-08-10,"—I want to go to some matters in the report before the Senate at the moment, which is the 2004-05 annual report of the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, as it was then. I want to emphasise some of the very valuable information in the report. I take Senator Faulkner’s point about what is not in it and I have spoken on that many times before. There is some valuable information in the report and it is worth mentioning, with all the public focus at the moment on immigration legislation dealing with unauthorised arrivals. If you consider all the fuss, the public debate and the political and policy focus around that group of people and then look at the figures in this report of the numbers of people coming in under a whole range of different visas, I think it has escaped the attention of many in the Australian public how high the migration intake is. That is something I support, I might say, but it is something we need to be more aware of and manage more effectively.
The number of permanent residents under the economic migration stream in the last financial year was nearly 78,000. The number in the family stream coming in as permanent residents was nearly 42,000, of which 33,000 were partners and only 4½ thousand were parents. It is a real problem that there is a continual restriction on the number of people allowed parent visas. For a government that talks about the value of the family, I think that restriction is a very antifamily measure. It also ignores the strong value of having parents around, which can enable migrant families to settle more effectively. It also helps, I might say, to make multiculturalism work more effectively.
In addition, we had 93½ thousand people coming in on temporary residency visas, which can be for as long as four years—57,000 of those in the temporary skilled area and many of which went to what I think Senator Sterle was talking about. We had 175,000 student visas granted in that financial year; nearly 212,000 people on student visas present at one stage during the financial year. The working holiday visa numbers have gone up to the record level of 104,600. If you look at all of those figures, all of which are residents, temporary or permanent, of various sorts—economic entry 78,000: family stream, nearly 42,000; other temporary residents, 94,000; student visas, 175,000; and working holiday visas, 105,000—we are getting close to the half-million mark, and that is before you count all the other visitors.
The total number of other visitor visas—tourists, short-stay business, family visitation, hospital and medical—in addition to all those I have talked about, was 3,588,947. So we have got about four million people coming in. Most of them are short-stay visitors, but around half a million of them are seeking various forms of longer stay or permanent residency. Yet we have this massive focus on and moral panic about a tiny number of people who come in an unauthorised way—people who when seeking asylum immediately seek to be identified, found and assessed. It shows how distorted our debate about immigration issues has been.
I have left out the humanitarian program: in this financial year, we had 13,178 come in under the offshore humanitarian program—only 5½ thousand are actually refugees; the other 7½ thousand are humanitarian—and 4,601 under onshore protection visas. So we have got a very small proportion that are refugees and an even smaller proportion that are asylum seekers. The problem with the massive and distorted focus on asylum seekers and the xenophobic approach to them is that it takes attention away from the much bigger need to properly manage the large numbers that are coming. We need to do better with settlement assistance than we have done, and it needs to be available more widely than it has been in the past, in my view. Such large numbers of people coming in from every corner of the globe reinforces the need to more strongly promote multiculturalism as an essential component of making that mix of people work together better.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2006-08-10,"—I will only speak briefly on this. I had the good fortune to be part of a very brief but very informative delegation to Aceh and Jakarta around 12 months ago. It was six months after the tsunami first hit. We only spent a day in Aceh, but it was very informative.
—It was indeed.
—Senator Webber was there being informed along with me. In some of the debate and some of the coverage in the mainstream media since that time there has been a lot of criticism of the response to the tsunami and the progress of the relief efforts. I can understand that. It seems a long time ago—it is a long time ago now; it is over 18 months—and progress is slow in some areas. That is very frustrating for a lot of people. It is understandable why people would be annoyed. In some cases there are grounds for that. However, I recommend that people who want to become more informed about the specifics of the issue read this report, because it goes into the practicalities.
In my home state of Queensland, around Innisfail and elsewhere, people’s homes were badly damaged by Cyclone Larry. There was some coverage a week or two ago in Queensland papers about how there are still people in that area living under tarpaulins and unable to go back to their homes because they have not been repaired. This is in an extremely wealthy country with materials available, where it is a matter of simply rebuilding and repairing housing, and we have not managed to do it after four months or so. Compare that to Aceh. Not only were houses damaged; houses were completely gone. In some cases, the land has gone and all of the owners of the land have gone as well. It makes it incredibly difficult to even establish ownership—whose land was on which spot, where the people are that owned it—and whether they are able to rebuild on some of the land. Some of it, as I said, is just gone. In some areas it is simply not suitable for rebuilding on.
The logistical exercise of doing all of that in that area is extremely difficult. Whilst there is, in effect, enough money to do what is needed, you do need to take your time in doing it. And you have to work with the community. You cannot just rush in, slap up a whole bunch of houses, rebuild a bridge or two and then expect everybody to just get on with it. If you want to have the rebuilding work effectively and to get maximum value for that money, you do sometimes have to take time. You have to work with the community, inform the community and take opinions from the community, and that takes time as well. So, whilst in some respects the speed of response has been unsatisfactory, I do think we need to be realistic about the size of the challenge and how long it can take to rebuild after something as enormous as this.
I take this opportunity to acknowledge the very positive contribution that the Australian government has made with respect to that. It is a very valuable one. It is one that will bear fruit for a long time to come. We need to keep monitoring it. The work that the committee did in examining Australia’s response is valuable and this report is valuable for doing that. But it will take a long time. Of course, many people will literally never recover. There has been loss of complete families, in some cases. The loss of loved ones will leave a lifelong scar for many people. Obviously we still need to try and rebuild areas as much as possible. We need to make that as prompt as possible and we also need to make it as effective as possible. I think we need to be realistic about what is achievable whilst continuing the pressure to make it happen as promptly as we can.

"Stephens, Sen Ursula",ALP,2006-08-10,"—This is a very interesting report undertaken to form an opinion of the Australian Research Council’s management of research grants and, given the substantial amount of money that the Australian Research Council manages—the ARC’s budget in 2005-06 was $571 million and the grants funding under the ARC’s National Competitive Grants Program was $81.4 million—it deserves scrutiny. The report presents some very interesting findings and additional recommendations from the Audit Office which are worthy of consideration.
Central to the ARC’s structure are the executive directors who have key responsibility for overseeing the peer review and grant selection processes in the ARC’s six discipline areas. The Audit Office found that, while the ARC appointed the executive directors for three-year terms, it needed to be very careful to ensure that the ARC’s business continuity was protected, given the likely loss of knowledge with the end of their terms of appointment. While the ARC staggers the appointment of executive directors, the Audit Office found the risks associated with their turnover such as loss of corporate knowledge were not identified in the ARC’s risk management plan. They recommend that better documentation of administrative processes would also assist the ARC to maintain business continuity and a sound knowledge of grant processes among the ARC staff.
The ANAO audit also found that, while the ARC is part of the Education, Science and Training portfolio, there is little documentation describing the arrangements between the Department of Education, Science and Training and the ARC for key administrative processes such as clearing key documents or exchanging information and data. The ANAO noted that the then minister intended to ‘retire’—that is a euphemism, if ever I have heard one—the ARC’s board in 2006, which was duly done through the abolition of the board in the bill that we debated earlier this year. The Secretary of the Department of Education, Science and Training would therefore no longer provide links between the two agencies through her board membership, so the ANAO considered that there would be a benefit in the ARC and the Department of Education, Science and Training agreeing on their consultative and reporting activities, in a memorandum of understanding, to ensure regular and ongoing information exchanges on key policy and administrative matters, and that this step would be consistent with the Uhrig review.
The ARC operates in an environment where any perceived conflict of interest could easily undermine its reputation. The ANAO found that the ARC had developed conflict of interest guidelines and was making a concerted effort to implement these across various committees; the Audit Office identified areas that could be strengthened notwithstanding. To demonstrate sound practice and improve visibility, the ARC should strengthen its processes for managing conflicts of interest, improving particularly the request not to assess process, which is an intriguing process. I can see that the 2006 changes may make this even more difficult.
I will just focus on that for one moment. The request not to assess process and associated documentation provides for applicants making requests not to assess to identify particular assessors and ask for them to be excluded from assessing the application. The problem that we have with the process in place at the moment is that the ARC did not provide applicants with guidelines outlining acceptable or unacceptable grounds for lodging requests not to assess; many request not to assess letters contained in-confidence, sensitive or potentially defamatory information. Therefore the ARC needed to maintain appropriate security and systems for the information, but that was not necessarily the case. The process was not well documented, with no criteria or rules to assist the ARC staff in assessing the letters. That resulted in the ARC making inconsistent decisions in assessing the requests not to assess.
Furthermore, the ARC’s records did not always show the ARC’s decisions accepting or denying the applicants requests not to assess, or the reasons for the decisions at all. The ARC did not routinely inform applicants about whether or not their requests were accepted or denied. The ANAO report concluded that, while the request not to assess process did not affect a large number of applications, it was an important process because it involved potential conflict of interest issues which, if not appropriately addressed, could impact on the integrity of the grant selection process. Therefore, it recommends that the ARC have well-established and documented processes to manage that aspect of grants administration; and, certainly, it suggests that a clearer methodology for managing requests not to assess would help the ARC to avoid possible conflicts of interest and making inconsistent or unfair decisions. The report also suggested that the ARC revise its guidelines in line with better practice, review conflict of interest declarations annually as a way of maintaining compliance with conflict of interest principles, and establish a register of interests.
The ANAO also found that the ARC did not produce an external annual grants calendar. This seems a very straightforward issue but, in fact, it causes quite a lot of angst with higher education institutions. Preparing an ARC grant application can be very lengthy and very complex. The ANAO recommends that, to assist researchers in planning and preparing their grant applications, the ARC publish on a trial basis an annual calendar which includes standard or indicative dates for release-of-funding rules and submission of applications. Providing stakeholders with timely information on scheduling of key activities and time lines would seem to me to be a very sensible way to go if you are managing such a complex grants program. The ANAO considers that the publication of an annual calendar would strengthen the ARC’s business planning and enhance the visibility of the various National Competitive Grants Program schemes, providing ARC staff and stakeholders with the information that they require. It would certainly assist stakeholders to plan their activities and resources to meet the ARC’s time lines and requirements.
The final recommendation, which I want to mention just briefly, concerns the post-award grants management. The report recommends that the ARC strengthen their capability in the area of post-award management and monitoring. Interestingly, the ANAO researched, through surveys and interviews, several universities across Australia. The ANAO received information such as advice that, when partial funding of grants occurred—successful grants with reduced funding—there was no meaningful feedback, even on such crucial issues as which items on the budget were not regarded as necessary or appropriate and the fact that the conditions imposed were often unworkable; for example, a postdoctoral fellowship salary was provided but no project-operating funding was approved. I note that the ARC acknowledged that that is something they need to strengthen in their processes and that they have accepted the recommendations of the ANAO on all of the issues raised. I look forward to observing the results of the planned implementation of the systems redevelopment project aimed at integrating all aspects of grants management, which is due to be completed in 2007.

"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2006-08-10,"—It is not very often that I rise in this place to express my very strong agreement with the views of the Australian Labor Party. Tonight, however, in a spirit of bipartisanship, I want to express a view I know is shared by not only the Labor Party but also the Liberal and National parties. It concerns the naming of the new electoral division proposed for Queensland. The creation of the new electorate follows a determination by the Commonwealth Electoral Commissioner last year that the representation of the state of Queensland in the House of Representatives should be increased to 29 seats.
In a report published on 23 June 2006, a redistribution committee established in accordance with section 68 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act proposed that the new electorate be located in Central Queensland, bordered in the east by the coast between Gladstone and Bundaberg and stretching west as far as Winton. The largest population centre of the proposed new electorate is Gladstone, a thriving city whose prosperity is built principally on mineral processing. To the north and west, the electorate is to include many of the coalfields of the Bowen Basin, including Blackwater, Curragh and Ensham.
The decision to locate the new electorate in Central Queensland has been criticised by many commentators who believe that the more obvious place for the new seat would be in the south-east. An objection on those grounds has been lodged by the Liberal Party, among others. Whilst not disagreeing with that point of view, it is not the location of the new seat which I rise to object to tonight but its proposed name. The AEC proposes to call the new seat ‘Wright’, in honour of the poet Judith Wright. However, the name ‘Wright’ has very unfortunate political associations in Central Queensland, and this has caused a great many of my constituents from that region to contact me to express their outrage and distress at this recommendation.
The reason for their distress is that the proposed name evokes not the honoured memory of Judith Wright but the despised memory of Keith Wright, the member for Capricornia between 1984 and 1993. In fact, very many people in Central Queensland—everyday citizens who do not read the reports of redistribution committees or even follow politics particularly closely—have assumed that the new seat is to be named after Keith Wright. It is not difficult to understand their error. Federal electorates are commonly named after leading politicians, and Keith Wright was one of the best-known politicians from Central Queensland of recent times, having represented Rockhampton in the state parliament for 15 years before representing Capricornia in the House of Representatives for a further nine years, and having served as leader of the state opposition.
The proposed seat will include some 17,000 electors from Wright’s old seat of Capricornia. I know that the current member for Capricornia, Ms Kirsten Livermore, strongly shares my views on the inappropriateness of naming the new seat ‘Wright’. Keith Wright ended his public life in disgrace. In 1993, he was convicted on six charges of child sexual abuse, including one count of rape, and he was sentenced to eight years imprisonment. The following year, he was convicted on a further three counts of indecent dealing with a girl under the age of 14 years and sentenced to a further 12 months imprisonment. He is a person whom those from both sides of politics would prefer to forget. Yet the Australian Electoral Commission, displaying a quite spectacular lack of judgement and tact, has suggested that the new electorate in Central Queensland be given the name ‘Wright’. The fact that it is intended to honour a different person is not the point; the very use of the same name, in a political context, in that part of Queensland, will inevitably evoke the memory of Keith Wright. It is a ghastly mistake and one which the AEC should correct at once, without a second’s hesitation.
I have no objection to a Queensland electorate being named in honour of Judith Wright—but not in the former stamping ground of Keith Wright. Judith Wright had no special association with Central Queensland. She never lived or worked there. The place with which she is most closely associated is Mount Tamborine, behind the Gold Coast and to the south of Brisbane, where she lived for 20 years and composed much of her best-loved verse. Given the very rapid growth of population in that part of Queensland, no doubt it will not be long before yet another new federal electorate is created in that vicinity, where she could be more appropriately commemorated and where her surname is not the subject of any unpleasant local associations. Be that as it may, the idea of using that surname for an electorate in Central Queensland is inappropriate—indeed repugnant.
Other names were suggested for the new seat. I know that the Liberal Party suggested that it be named in honour of Sir Gordon Chalk, the distinguished Liberal Deputy Premier of Queensland in the 1960s and 1970s who served briefly as Premier in 1968. But it is not common for federal electorates to be named after state politicians, and Sir Gordon did not have strong local associations with that part of Queensland either. I wish to propose an alternative name for the new electorate which would recognise the long and significant association with that area of Queensland of Sir Leslie Thiess. Sir Leslie Thiess, who died in 1992, was, I believe, the greatest industrialist Queensland ever produced. He, more than anyone else, was the person responsible for opening up the coalfields of the Bowen Basin and, in the years after the Second World War, developing the Queensland coal industry from a relatively modest condition to one of Australia’s greatest exporting industries. He was the state’s greatest mining magnate and entrepreneur—the Queensland equivalent of Lang Hancock. He also founded the great construction company which still bears his name, which built many of our nation’s great highways, dams and bridges.
I know Sir Leslie Thiess had a long and on occasion controversial association with the late Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen—a politician I have never admired. He was a great champion of the National Party and, just as I am not in the habit of giving speeches expressing agreement with the Australian Labor Party, nor am I particularly in the habit of immortalising Queensland National Party icons. But, taking political considerations out of the question, there is just no doubt at all that Thiess was the man who, beyond anyone else, built the Queensland coal industry. He was the uncrowned king of that part of my state in which the proposed new electorate will be located, and he was a great Queenslander and a great Australian.
I also propose Sir Leslie Thiess’s name to make a broader point. We in Australia have never, I believe, sufficiently appreciated our great industrialists. Only very few writers—CD Kemp was one of them; Geoffrey Blainey is another—have told their stories. We tell the tales of our explorers, we celebrate our sportsmen, we honour our soldiers, we respect our scientists and we take pride in our performing artists. And yet we barely notice our businessmen. Perhaps this is a hangover from the once powerful prejudice of Australian historians which romanticised trade unionism and was content to treat industrialists as if they were all robber barons. No doubt a few of them were. But the great business leaders, industrialists, pastoralists and miners have never, in my view, been given their proper place in our nation’s story.
Of the 150 federal electorates, only two, Macarthur and Farrer—named after the pioneers of the pastoral and wheat industries—bear the names of those who built the economy upon which our prosperity is founded. Not a single industrial leader of the last century has been so honoured. We must redress that deficiency. To that end, it would be a seemly gesture for the new federal electorate in Central Queensland to be named in honour of the man who built there one of our greatest industries and, more than anyone else, made that part of Australia what it is today.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>New Queensland Electorate</title>,ADJOURNMENT,27,1,speech

See (3).
Telstra can provide details for individual payphone sites that have been identified for removal upon request.
In regard to average usage in dollars Telstra noted that even without including any costs of usage and servicing, each payphone and booth incurs fixed costs to both provide and maintain in operation. These costs may include depreciation, electricity supply and usage, cleaning and sometimes site fees. In addition there are also the variable costs for coin collection, repairs to damage and maintenance visits. Each payphone will have a different break even point where the usage and revenue does not cover the costs of supply and operation.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title>,<title>Telstra: Payphones</title>,Answers to Questions on Notice,29,1,answer
