—Leave is granted for two minutes.
—I anticipate that Senator Brown may also wish to make a  short statement as well. In respect of this  motion, the Remuneration Tribunal made a determination in 2009/11 Members of parliament travelling allowance on 6 August 2009. On that same day, the tribunal also made determination 2009/10 Official travel by office holders. The determination sets the rates of travelling allowance for parliamentarians and public office holders respectively. The determination establishes rates applicable for travel to individual towns  and cities. The rates in each determination for each travel tier and common location are the same. The reason I mention that is to give context in relation to the motion before the Senate which suggests that the ribunal has not advanced any financial or economic justification for the proposed increase in travelling allowance. This is not correct.
I refer the Senate to the tribunal’s statement of 19 August 2009, which is available from the tribunal’s website. It sets out details of how the decision in relation to the determination was made. I think it would be helpful for the Senate if I table that statement. In light of the publicly available statement, the government will not be supporting the motion. In fact, it appears unnecessary in that regard.",SENATE,<title>REMUNERATION TRIBUNAL DETERMINATION 2009/11</title>,<title>Motion for Disallowance</title>,Miscellaneous,11,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2009-08-20,"—I seek leave to make a brief statement.
—Leave is granted for two minutes.
—Firstly, if the Remuneration Tribunal has reason for altering parliamentarians’ or public servants’ entitlements then that information should be made available with the determination when it is requested in the Senate chamber. I made a request for that determination and I got it, but I had to write to the president, Mr John Conde AO, to get that information, which was made available to me last night. I hope that in future the Remuneration Tribunal will furnish information to parliamentarians when it makes determinations. We should not have to seek it out, the way the minister says.
Secondly, over the last 12 months, the inflation rate was 1.5 per cent while this is a seven per cent lift in the travel allowance. We ought to be keeping this in proportion. You cannot escape the surmise, at least, that, with the Prime Minister having frozen increases in parliamentary salaries last year and with way-above-inflation increases in the electorate allowance and now in the travel allowance, there is an adjustment here to make up for that freezing. That may not be so, but it is a matter that ought to be debated. I think that, as parliamentarians, we are vulnerable to the sort of speculation that we do not like but that we see in the press and in the public arena if we do not have due reasoning up front. As far as I am concerned, the reasoning from the Remuneration Tribunal is way short of sufficient.",SENATE,<title>REMUNERATION TRIBUNAL DETERMINATION 2009/11</title>,<title>Motion for Disallowance</title>,Miscellaneous,11,1,speech
"Ronaldson, Sen Michael",LP,2009-08-20,"—I seek leave to make a short statement.
—Leave is granted for two minutes.
—I will reflect on Senator Bob Brown’s words about vulnerability to speculation. My argument with Senator Brown in relation to his constant raising of these matters—which I think, with the greatest respect are more about politics than good policy—is that we will be far more vulnerable to speculation if we do not have an independent arbiter. I cannot for the life of me understand why Senator Brown constantly attacks the independent tribunal. As I have said in this place before, if you want to provide the opportunity for speculation then we will be the ones who will make decisions. It is a ridiculous notion that members of parliament should be making decisions about their own remuneration, and that can be the only outcome of Senator Brown’s constant attack on the Remuneration Tribunal.
I am very confident going out into the community and saying there is an independent umpire. I would have no confidence in going out into the community and saying that members and senators make determinations about their own entitlements. This is a sensible approach by the Remuneration Tribunal because there is a benchmark. But the beauty of an independent tribunal is that it can make decisions that are not, on the face of it, giving equality to members and senators. Indeed, Senator Brown, the Canberra rate for parliamentarians is substantially lower because the Remuneration Tribunal quite rightly said that we are here for a longer period of time and we can make accommodation decisions so it is economically feasible for us to be on a lower rate. Please can we leave the decision of the tribunal where it is. (Time expired)

—I agree with Senator Ronaldson that we do need to have an independent umpire, but where I differ—with the greatest respect to Senator Ronaldson—is that I think the disquiet in the community is as a result of the processes involved, and there ought to be greater degree of transparency in relation to the process. The reasons need to be given, the process of the reasoning needs to be given publicly and there ought to be greater input in that decision-making process. That is where I differ. I agree with Senator Ronaldson that it has to be done by an independent umpire, but it needs to be done in the context of a transparent process, a process where there is greater input in terms of the decision making, and also that the reasons given for the increases are quite clear. I think that would give greater confidence in the system. It may well be that, in relation to these allowances, we go to a receipt based system. That is something that I think the tribunal ought to consider in due course. But I think it is important that we have this debate, and I think there is room for improvement in the way that the Remuneration Tribunal carries out its work.

Dear Minister
I refer to the Ozone Protection and Synthetic Greenhouse Gas Management Amendment Regulations 2009 (No. 1), Select Legislative Instrument 2009 No.4. These Amendment Regulations insert new regulation 111 into the principal Regulations which creates the strict liability offence of handling a refrigerant.
The Committee notes that paragraph 111(2)(b) defines the phrase ‘handle a refrigerant’ to include the situation where a person manufactures, installs, commissions, services or maintains refrigeration or air conditioning equipment even where there is no refrigerant present. It thus appears that a person can be liable for the strict liability offence created by subregulation 111(1) relating to handling a refrigerant even where they do not handle a refrigerant because no refrigerant is present. The Committee would appreciate your advice as to why the offence is created in these terms.
The Committee would appreciate your advice on the above matter as soon as possible, but before 1 May 2009, to enable it to finalise its consideration of these Regulations. Correspondence should be directed to the Chair, Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, Room SG49, Parliament House, Canberra.

Dear Senator Wortley
Thank you for your letter of 12 March 2009 concerning Ozone Protection and Synthetic Greenhouse Gas Management Amendment Regulations 2009 No 1.
Paragraph 111(2)(b) has been added to the Regulations to clarify an ambiguity that existed in the Regulations in the context of the definition of handling a refrigerant. The amendment aims to ensure that the areas of highest risk for emissions of refrigerant are prescribed in the Regulations and only appropriately skilled technicians undertake work on this equipment.
As background, the Ozone Protection and Synthetic Greenhouse Gas Management Regulations 1995 (the Regulations) and its parent Act give effect to Australia’s obligations under the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer and the synthetic greenhouse gas (SGG) aspects of the Kyoto Protocol.
The primary purposes of the Act and Regulations are to meet our obligations under the Montreal Protocol and, for SGGs, the Kyoto Protocol by phasing out the use of ozone depleting substances (ODS) in Australia and minimising the emissions of both ODS and SGGs.
Section 45A of the Act provides the power to make regulations covering the sale, purchase, acquisition, disposal, storage, use and handling of these substances. To date specific regulations have been created for the refrigeration and air conditioning and fire protection industries. The refrigeration and air conditioning industry uses 93% of ODS and SGGs consumed in Australia.
A permit scheme for the refrigeration and air conditioning industry was created under the Regulations in 2005 for businesses and technicians that acquire, possess, use and dispose of ODS and SGG refrigerants.
The permit scheme aims to ensure that emissions of ODS and SGG refrigerants are minimised by allowing only suitably skilled technicians to handle refrigerant where there is a reasonable opportunity for its emission to the atmosphere. The Regulations require that any person who handles an ODS or SGG refrigerant hold an appropriate licence. To obtain a licence, an applicant must have completed training appropriate to the type of work that they will be performing.
The risk of emission of refrigerant comes primarily from inappropriate use of tools or improper design, assembly and maintenance of equipment. Therefore, the conditions that will allow refrigerant to be emitted to the atmosphere are generally established before refrigerant is introduced into a system.
To handle a refrigerant, in the literal sense, is in most cases neither possible nor desirable as most refrigerants are gases at room temperature and direct contact, particularly with refrigerant at high pressure, could result in quite serious injury. Due to these considerations, refrigerant cannot be present for most work on a piece of refrigeration and air conditioning (RAC) equipment. The addition of refrigerant to a piece of RAC equipment is the final step in the process of manufacture, installation or maintenance. Proper assembly and preparation of the equipment are essential to prevent emissions once the refrigerant is introduced.
The phase “handle a refrigerant” is, for the purposes of the new regulation, construed in the same way that an electrician could be construed to be working with electricity. The skill of the electrician is in the design, installation and servicing of the current bearing components and, through ensuring that only qualified and licensed electricians do this work, regulators ensure that, when the system is live, the public and environment are protected.
The Regulations were amended to ensure that ODS and SGG refrigerant emissions are minimised through appropriate system design, installation, maintenance and decommissioning.

Dear Minister
Thank you for your letter of 2 April 2009 responding to the Committee’s concerns with the Ozone Protection and Synthetic Greenhouse Gas Management Amendment Regulations 2009 (No. 1), Select Legislative Instrument 2009 No.4. These Amendment Regulations, among other things, create a strict liability offence of handling a refrigerant.
In your letter you indicate that “refrigerant cannot be present for most work on a piece of refrigeration and air-conditioning (RAC) equipment” and that the “addition of refrigerant to a piece of RAC equipment is the final step in the process of manufacture, installation or maintenance”. You advise that the phrase ‘handle a refrigerant’ is, for the purposes of the new regulation, “construed in the same way that an electrician could be construed to be working with electricity”.
The Committee notes that this provision is not simply an offence provision, but a strict liability offence provision. This means that a person may commit the offence irrespective of their intent. In such circumstances, clarity and certainty are essential. Arguably, charging someone with the offence of ‘handling a refrigerant’ where no refrigerant is present does not meet those standards of certainty and clarity.
The Committee notes that provisions in the legislation covering electricians often refer to undertaking ‘electrical work’ (which is defined in terms of work on equipment as well as with power) rather than ‘handling electricity’. It may be that taking a similar approach to the description of this offence may make it clearer and more certain.
The Committee would appreciate your advice on the above matter as soon as possible, but before 12 June 2009, to enable it to finalise its consideration of these Regulations. Correspondence should be directed to the Chair, Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, Room SG49, Parliament House, Canberra.

Dear Senator
Thank you for your letter of 14 May 2009 regarding the Ozone Protection and Synthetic Greenhouse Gas Management Amendment Regulations (No. 1) 2009 (the Amendment Regulations).
I fully agree with your concern that there should be clarity and certainty in the definition that underpins a strict liability offence provision. It is for this reason that the change to regulation 111 has been made.
The term “handle a refrigerant” is now defined for the purposes of the offence in regulation 111 to mean doing anything with the refrigerant, or a component of refrigeration and air conditioning (RAC) equipment, that carries the risk of refrigerant being emitted, including: (a) decanting the refrigerant; or (b) manufacturing, installing, commissioning, servicing or maintaining RAC equipment, irrespective of whether or not refrigerant is present; or (c) decommissioning RAC equipment where refrigerant is present.
The inclusion of “irrespective of whether or not refrigerant is present” makes it unambiguous that correct manufacture, installation and servicing of RAC equipment, which must be carried out in the absence of refrigerant, is an integral part of preventing unintended emissions and should not be carried out by unlicensed persons.
The change to the definition removes the previous ambiguity about what types of activities were encompassed by the term “handle a refrigerant”. The definition was amended at the request of, and in consultation with, the RAC industry which endorses the revised definition and the continuing use of the term “handle a refrigerant”.
The definition is widely understood in the RAC industry and sits within a broader framework regulating the RAC industry, which includes the requirement for persons to have refrigerant handling licences to work with refrigerant or equipment that contains or is intended to contain refrigerant. The licences are issued to persons who hold the appropriate qualifications to handle refrigerants. These qualifications have long been accepted by the RAC industry as sufficient to ensure such emissions are minimised when undertaking the type of work which is encapsulated by the term “handle a refrigerant”. A holder of such a licence can and does work on RAC equipment (for example by maintaining, servicing or installing) which does not contain refrigerant and is therefore handling a refrigerant within the meaning of that definition.
The licences are required therefore to ensure that when the refrigerant is added to the RAC equipment, the refrigerant is not emitted into the atmosphere. As the refrigerants controlled by the Ozone Protection and Synthetic Greenhouse Gas Management Regulations 9995 (the Regulations) are ozone depleting substances or synthetic greenhouse gases, it is imperative that their emission to the atmosphere be minimised. This is necessary to achieve the policy intent of the legislation and to give effect to Australia’s international obligations under the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer and the synthetic greenhouse gas aspects of the Kyoto Protocol. The Amendment Regulations are an integral part of this broader framework.
In conclusion, I am satisfied that the definition of “handle a refrigerant” provides certainty and clarifies the application of the offence in regulation 111 for the RAC industry. The Amendment Regulations are an important part of the overall regulatory framework aimed to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases and ozone depleting substances.

Thank you for your letter of 20 June 2009 responding to the Committee’s concerns with the Ozone Protection and Synthetic Greenhouse Gas Management Amendment Regulations 2009 (No. 1), Select Legislative Instrument 2009 No.4. These Regulations, among other things, create a strict liability offence of ‘handling a refrigerant’.
In your letter you address the Committee’s concerns with regard to the structure and content of this offence. However, the Committee remains concerned by the title of the offence. Notwithstanding that industry has endorsed the revised definition and the continuing use of the term ‘handle a refrigerant,’ the Committee considers that offences – particularly strict liability offences – should be described with the utmost clarity and certainty. This is a matter of public expectation. Given this, can you advise why the title of this offence cannot be amended to “handle a refrigerant or refrigerant equipment”? This would remove any ambiguity about the conduct in issue. The substance of the offence would remain unchanged.
The Committee would appreciate your advice on the above matter as soon as possible, but before 3 August 2009, to enable it to finalise its consideration of these Regulations. Correspondence should be directed to the Chair, Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, Room SG49, Parliament House, Canberra.

Dear Senator
Thank you for your letter of 25 June 2009 concerning the Ozone Protection and Synthetic Greenhouse Gas Management Amendment Regulations (No. 1) 2009 (the Regulations).
I note the Committee’s recommendation to reword the relevant offence provision to ‘handle a refrigerant or refrigerant equipment’. The Commonwealth’s heads of power under ratified international agreements do not currently allow for the regulation of all refrigerants, only fluorinated refrigerants. Thus, the generally encompassing nature of the phrase ‘refrigerant equipment’ might cause further ambiguity for and concern amongst currently unregulated sectors of the industry who may feel that this construction represents an intention by the Commonwealth to extend the scope of the Regulations into previously unregulated sectors.
To address the Committee’s concerns, I have instructed my Department to consider the matter, liaise with industry and to advise on an appropriately specific and unambiguous phrase to be included in the next set of amendments to the Regulations presented for the consideration of the Governor-General.
Thank you for writing on this matter.

"Boswell, Sen Ron",NATS,2009-08-20,"—I move opposition amendment (1) on sheet 5872:
(1)    Schedule 2, item 8, page 13 (after line 26), at the end of section 38B, add:
         (3)    Regulations made under subsection 38AA(1) must determine a food processing activity, to the extent that it is trade‑exposed, to be an emissions‑inten-sive trade‑exposed activity. The partial exemption of an emissions‑intensive trade‑exposed food processing activity for 2010 and any later year is to be calculated to be equal to 90% of the additional renewable source electricity acquisition obligation of the activity during the relevant year.
         (4)    In subsection (3):

additional renewable source electricity acquisition obligation means the amount of renewable source electricity that the activity is required to acquire under this Act after the commencement of the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Amendment Act 2009 in addition to the amount of renewable source electricity that the activity was required to acquire under this Act before the commencement of the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Amendment Act 2009.
The amendment seeks to provide trade assistance to Australian dairy and livestock farmers and food processors. It seeks to protect Australian farming families against costs being passed backwards from food processors that would lead to substantial farm gate income losses. It seeks to protect the future viability of farming in Australia by providing assistance to Australian trade-exposed food processors, including dairying and abattoirs.
The amendment requires regulation to determine that food processing activities, to the extent they are trade exposed, be given a 90 per cent exemption from liabilities associated with the RET. It seeks the same protection for farmers as that given to industries such as cement, newsprint, glass and those sorts of industries. Processed agricultural products are among the most trade exposed in the world and any additional cost imposed on Australian production cannot be passed on to customers. These costs will inevitably be passed back to farmers.
Can I quote the case of the Murray Goulburn dairy cooperative. They are a high energy user and trade exposed. The RET squeezes their profit margins to the extent they will have a lot of trouble competing in export markets. They cannot sustain the cost increases and will be forced to pass the costs back to dairy farmers or actually go out of business. Murray Goulburn Co-Operative told the Senate Standing Committee on Economics that liabilities under the CPRS would result in income losses to its 2,500 farming members of between $5,000 and $10,000 and that the RET would impose an additional $1 million in 2010, rising to over $2 million by 2020. I have been told by regional Queensland abattoirs that the RET costs will start at $315,000 in 2010 and rise by $850,000 by 2020. Like dairy, these additional costs cannot be absorbed and will be passed back to the graziers.
The Australian Dairy Industry Council’s submission to the economics committee inquiry states:
Although dairy processing is highly trade exposed in most products – the main activities do not meet the cut-offs for EITE classification …
We believe this is a flaw in the CPRS system which will see less competitive food processing and farming in Australia and lead to carbon leakage. Our major competitors in the world dairy market will provide support for dairy processors and exclude farm emissions or will not have an ETS at all.
I refer to the Australian Financial Review article ‘Burke seeks to calm fears of farmers’. What he is saying in here, in short, is that we should synchronise our dairy industry with New Zealand. I understand that Senator Wong had a very delightful evening the other evening as she sat next to Murray Goulburn. She had an introduction to the dairy industry, and I am sure after an hour’s discussion that she would have been right across—
—My grandfather was a dairy farmer.
—Her grandfather was a dairy farmer and she has been told about the dairy industry. Senator Wong, you did mention yesterday some breaks that the Productivity Commission could give the dairy industry. I do not think they are going to be terribly helpful, but I would like you to explain again how the dairy industry goes through the Productivity Commission to get some benefits. You did indicate that yesterday, but could you reiterate how the Productivity Commission can assist the dairy industry. And can the dairy industry make a direct representation to the Productivity Commission or do you have to give it a tick? Could you also refer to the Burke statement that he believes the dairy industry should be synchronised with that of New Zealand, who are the biggest exporters in the world and with whom we compete very heavily, bringing their cheese and other milk products into Australia. The earliest they will get an ETS and a RET, if they do get them, will be in 2018.",SENATE,<title>RENEWABLE ENERGY (ELECTRICITY) AMENDMENT BILL 2009</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2009-08-20,"—First, obviously the dairy industry in Australia, given the competition with New Zealand, particularly with Fonterra, is an important issue. The New Zealand parliament has in fact already passed its emissions trading scheme, although it is not in operation as yet, pending some legislative committee review, from memory. But I would say that both prime ministers have indicated in previous discussions—and also I have had discussions with my New Zealand counterpart—the possibilities of harmonising the Australian and New Zealand schemes in the future. So that is a matter where the two governments are considering those possibilities. A lot more work would need to be done, because obviously Australia does not actually have a scheme as yet, but that preliminary work is being done in order to consider that, because there would obviously be some benefits in the two markets being integrated. So that is one set of issues, and that work will continue. If we are going to harmonise, we will actually have to have our own scheme, Senator Boswell! That is a prerequisite.
You asked a question about the Productivity Commission possibilities. I am happy to provide those words again, Senator Boswell. I have provided them to the opposition formerly—yesterday. I do not know if the relevant shadow ministers have had a discussion with the National Party, but these words were provided to the opposition and their representatives as part of the negotiations and they were also read into Hansard.
What the government agreed to do in relation to the Productivity Commission is extend the capacity which already exists under the CPRS white paper if an industry which does not qualify for industry assistance—I should take a step back. In terms of assistance, the first point for any industry, if they believe that they should and can qualify for assistance under the CPRS, is to make application accordingly and to work with the department on assessing whether or not they are sufficiently emissions intensive to qualify for assistance. I do not know if the dairy industry has formally started that process or not. If they are eligible then there are a quantity of free permits available in accordance with the government’s policies. If they are not eligible, what we did include as part of our agreement with the opposition to pass this bill was enable the existing provisions of the white paper in relation to industries who do not qualify for assistance to extend that to industries impacted on by the renewable energy target. So these arrangements allow firms, including those that do not qualify for industry assistance—I perhaps erroneously suggested that this option was open only to industries that did not qualify for assistance; it is potentially open to both: industries that have assistance and those that do not. So I will read again the words I read out yesterday, Senator Boswell, that form part of the agreement with the opposition:
… the government will extend the current potential review provisions under the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme—as set out in the white paper at section 12.7.4—to industries potentially affected by the renewable energy target once the renewable energy target has commenced. These arrangements allow firms, including those that do not qualify for industry assistance, to make representation to the government to request that the government commission the Productivity Commission to undertake an assessment of the renewable energy target’s impact on their industry. The government will not necessarily refer all requests to the commission; it will take into account the nature and details of the request.
The Productivity Commission will make an assessment of this industry’s circumstances, taking into account the range of factors unrelated to the scheme that will also affect the profitability of firms and industries, such as exchange rate movements, capital and labour costs, and commodity price movements. It will assess whether the introduction of the renewable energy target—including the assistance provided under the renewable energy target and Climate Change Action Fund assistance programs—will substantially adversely affect the industry in which the firm is located within the next five years, result in carbon leakage and be likely to result in the premature closure of an industry that would be likely to be competitive in a carbon constrained world. Taking into account all of the above, the commission will make recommendations to the government about whether it should provide additional support to this industry from the Climate Change Action Fund and the appropriate mechanism for that support.
That is what was read into Hansard yesterday and provided to the opposition yesterday as well. I think that answers your questions in relation to the Productivity Commission issue.
I would also make the point that the government is opposing this amendment, Senator Boswell, and there are a range of reasons for that. The first is that there is not an activity definition for food processing and, as you know, food processing would encompass a diverse range of businesses which would have very different levels of exposure to changes in electricity prices, whether from the renewable energy target or the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. This is precisely why the government has chosen to go down the route of providing assistance on the basis of activities rather than industries. ‘Industries’ can be very broad notions that cover a whole range of activities, some of which are very energy intensive and some of which are not; therefore, if you provided assistance on the basis of industries, you would get a less fair form of assistance, a less fair architectural assistance. We welcome the fact that the opposition has recognised this by, in this bill, essentially endorsing the architecture for assistance under the CPRS which is based on activities. We think it is important that assistance be fair.
It would be unfair to provide more assistance to a firm that was, arguably, engaged in food processing but had a lower exposure to electricity price increases than another firm that was not doing food processing but had higher energy use. You would essentially be saying, ‘We’ll give more to one sector because it’s called food processing, even if they have less liability.’ We do not think that is a sensible or fair way to provide assistance. We think the fairest way is to do what we have done, which is to assess the potential cost impact and the exposure to cost increases by looking at the energy intensity of activities. On that basis, you provide assistance across the economy fairly. So the government is not minded to support this amendment.
In addition, neither the renewable energy target for which you voted when in government, Senator Boswell, nor, for example, the Victorian renewable energy target provided any exemptions to the food-processing sector. The John Howard renewable energy target, which was introduced under the previous government, did not provide an exemption for this sector.
In addition to the Productivity Commission possibility, as I said, food-processing businesses may qualify for assistance under the Climate Change Action Fund to implement, for example, low-emission technologies, energy efficiency technologies. I note there is some capacity in some of these industries to abate, and in fact a number of industries and firms have been very responsible in seeking, ahead of the introduction of the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme and the renewable energy target, to reduce their liability by becoming more energy efficient. For example, I know from my private discussions with Murray Goulburn that they have significantly reduced their emissions over their, I think, eight sites over the last few years. Fonterra, which the senator referred to, has also cut its energy use by around 15 per cent since 2002-03. Obviously, reducing energy use reduces your exposure to cost increases flowing from these bills. So, Senator, I appreciate where you are coming from, but we do not think this is the fairest or most sensible way to provide assistance to that industry or to any other industry.",SENATE,<title>RENEWABLE ENERGY (ELECTRICITY) AMENDMENT BILL 2009</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Milne, Sen Christine",AG,2009-08-20,"—Unfortunately, there seems to be a really high degree of confusion about the CPRS and the RET. In my view, that was caused by the government coupling the legislation in the first place. Out in rural and regional Australia people were looking at the combined impact and trying to understand what it would mean if they went together and so on, and that led to the high level of confusion. Now that they are decoupled and there is no CPRS, we are just talking about the impact of a renewable energy target price.
I am also interested in the fact that the coalition, in its negotiations with the government, reached an agreement with the government that it would support the government’s legislation in exchange for certain concessions. It is very clear to me, from what has happened here, that the coalition dropped all its other demands to get specific demands on the big emitters, particularly the aluminium sector. They got what they wanted for aluminium and dropped support for emerging technologies. They ought to be under no illusion that anybody out there is not aware that they dumped solar thermal, geothermal and wave.
The industry understands that Senator Abetz has withdrawn all the opposition amendments. I am interested in why the National Party, as part of the coalition, did not insist on them and instead preferred to get outcomes for the aluminium rather than the farming sector. The coalition withdrew every amendment but this one. This is clearly a concession to the National Party, a grandstand, because they did not fight for it. It is not part of the deal. This did not get up for the National Party. The coalition decided to support the bill, dump this amendment and get a concession, some form of words about a reference to the Productivity Commission. That is the reality, and I think that anyone who does not see it that way, who cannot see that when push came to shove they preferred aluminium and coal gas to the dairy industry—

Senator Nash interjecting—

—Well, it’s true—otherwise that would be part of the deal. It is also true that that is why there is no reference to the emerging technologies—those amendments were withdrawn. The industry says the coalition made them a promise and then reneged on it, and they did renege on it. Let’s understand that.
Let’s go specifically to the renewable energy target and the points that are being made in relation to food processing, and I take the minister’s point in terms of the definitional issues that need to be established here. The Greens have long supported a renewable energy target. As the minister has just indicated, the mandatory renewable energy target has gone on for a very long time and there have not been exemptions for this sector. There have, of course, been exemptions for aluminium, which I will get to in a minute when we get to the next amendment. That is something that has been spread across the whole community and, as a result, it is less of an impost.
I will be interested to see what the Productivity Commission has to say when these matters are referred in the future and to see what the government comes up with in terms of how it might work in association with the CPRS if it is ever passed. But, at the moment, I think there is total confusion in the National Party about these two issues. That is the result of the government linking them. I accept that, now that they are decoupled, we should be looking at this purely in terms of impost. I remind Senator Boswell that a number of other countries also have renewable energy targets—it is not a case of trade exposure when other countries operate under these targets as well. In fact, by bringing in the renewable energy target and spreading it across the system, as the pool price is depressed, everybody benefits by the reduced wholesale pool price.",SENATE,<title>RENEWABLE ENERGY (ELECTRICITY) AMENDMENT BILL 2009</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Joyce, Sen Barnaby",NATS,2009-08-20,"—Hearing what Senator Milne just said, the opportunity is there for the Greens today—if they have a concern for food processing, as the National Party does—to support this amendment and have food processing removed. I acknowledge your desire, Senator Milne, to represent regional issues and regional people; to look after food labelling; and to make sure that we keep Australian product on Australian tables and support the Australian processing sector. If you are authentic, that can be done so easily. All you have to do is support this amendment and you will have done those things, and you will have displayed your authenticity.
This issue is one that is a clear call about where you stand on the production of food inside Australia. Quite obviously, if the Australian food production industry is made unviable it will move overseas, and food production that is overseas uses food from overseas; therefore, we start once more to put further weight on the capacity of Australians to eat Australian product produced in Australia. You need there to be a nexus, in both geography and locality, between the production facilities and the food. If the production facilities go overseas they will quite obviously have to use food from overseas.
The challenge is that this is an amendment, regardless of people’s views on other issues, that specifically deals with keeping Australian food on Australian shelves—produced by Australian farmers and employing Australian working families in its manufacture and all the things associated with it. Therefore, I am strongly in support of it. I commend Senator Boswell. He has been pursuing this all the way through. Senator Boswell has really taken this issue on board. It is reflects his time in the Senate—as a father of the Senate—and his passion in supporting such places as Golden Circle, his passion in always going to bat for regional industries and his passion to look at the detail and how it affects things on the ground. This amendment needs to be supported if we want to have a clear statement about looking after the production of Australian food that is supplied by Australian farmers and put on the supermarket shelves for us to eat.
I am also interested in getting back information from Minister Wong about the Climate Change Action Fund and exactly where that money comes from. I also would like to know that if this amendment fails—and I hope it does not—are we then in the hands of the Productivity Commission to try and protect Australian manufacturing workers’ jobs in the food industry and to protect Australian farmers who supply that process? Is it not just a little bit nebulous to rely on the possible musings of the Productivity Commission when we can make it quite clear? This is a most important thing. The Australian people are focused on food sovereignty. They are focused on the capacity for the Australian nation to eat Australian product that is produced by Australian farmers. This amendment can do it and if this amendment succeeds we will have put that issue to bed. I think that would be an extremely decent thing to do.",SENATE,<title>RENEWABLE ENERGY (ELECTRICITY) AMENDMENT BILL 2009</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Fielding, Sen Steve",FFP,2009-08-20,"—It is interesting to listen to this debate. Why are we moving an exemption here for food processing? It is because we are concerned about the escalating price of electricity for food processing—the extra cost. Here we are, standing up for food processing. We have seen the coalition roll on getting something for aluminium. Some of the other industries are still very nervous about it. Food processing misses out because the Nationals went missing, and here they are trying to get some scraps off the table and scrambling around the chamber trying to get enough votes to guarantee that they are looked after. But, no—they were sold out. The Nationals should not have agreed. How can they stay in with the coalition when they are selling out food processing, which is in rural and regional areas? It is a disgrace. Where are your principles on this one? You have sold them out. Mums and dads are being sold out because the electricity prices are going to go through the roof. I tell them they can send their bills to the Prime Minister, but he is not going to pay either.
We needed to look at this issue a lot harder. We have had a week since the Senate report was out. There are other models that maybe we should be considering; rather than getting mums and dads, the diary industry and the food processing to foot the bill for risky renewable energy. I am for renewable energy. Let us be simple here. The sun shines, and if we can get it from the sun, why not? If we can get it from the wind—the wind blows. If we can get it from a hot core in the earth, by all means do so. But do you know how much these cost? People out there genuinely think it is free. I have spoken to people on the street and they think this is free. They think renewables are a great idea because the sun shines and the wind blows. They do—they are great ideas. But do you know how much they are going to cost? They cost a lot of money. They are not viable. Wind energy is not viable. Solar energy is not viable. Geothermal is not viable. They are expensive and they are propped up with subsidies. And who is paying those subsidies? The mums and dads of Australia are paying.
And here we are worried about the food processing industry. We should be worried about mums and dads. We should be worried about all the others. They have been sold out by the coalition. You did not have the guts or the stamina to hold on even longer because you are worried about holding this bill up and coming back to it a second time. You are making sure. Many years ago, when we invested in energy for electricity, the government took the risk—not mums and dads. They were state owned. We have had no debate about this at all. Even yesterday we were debating and saying: ‘Look, we have got to keep some aside for geothermal because we have got wind and solar. And, even though it is attractive, it will not do base load.’ This is a dog’s breakfast, seriously. We are passing this, and we are putting our hands into our pockets for the investors and the bankers, and mums and dads are footing the bill. I will support this amendment but we should not have been supporting the rest of it. It is disgraceful. It is a dog’s breakfast.",SENATE,<title>RENEWABLE ENERGY (ELECTRICITY) AMENDMENT BILL 2009</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Xenophon, Sen Nick",IND,2009-08-20,"—Senator Fielding talks about viability, and that is fair enough, in terms of renewable energy and emerging technologies. Can I just say that what will not be viable is if we do not have comprehensive policies in place to deal with climate change. There are doubters—and I do not criticise Senator Fielding for this; he has these views—but it seems to me that the preponderance of scientific evidence is that unless we take action to deal with greenhouse gases there could be irreversible climate change. So all I ask the sceptics out there to do is to consider, from a risk management point of view, that if there is a risk of catastrophic climate change we ought to do everything possible to deal with it, because the consequences of not dealing with it will simply be too great and they will be irreversible. We are already seeing issues in relation to climate change—there is the debate about the Murray-Darling Basin. Whether you think it is anthropogenic or not, there will have to be considerable adaptation to deal with that.
I cannot support this particular amendment for several reasons. It is not because I do not support Australian made goods—and I am very grateful to Senator Joyce for co-sponsoring a bill along with Senator Brown earlier today on food labelling and truth in labelling, so that when consumers go to their supermarket shelves they can have a genuine choice as to whether they are buying Australian goods and not have to deal with the misleading labels we have now. In relation to this issue in the context of the renewable energy target, the modelling indicates in the order of four per cent over 10 years. That is nothing to be sneezed at, but it is still a relatively minor, absorbable cost of business in the context of this particular bill. The real challenge will be in the context of the government’s CPRS legislation and that is why it is important we get that right, because it is predicted that there will be electricity price increases in the order of 40 to 50 per cent.
I know the Liberal Party is considering the Frontier Economics modelling; it is not their policy. Well, I can say that in my party room it is my policy in the sense that it is important that we go down a path where you can mute electricity price rises and you do not have revenue churn, because that is where the real challenge will be. So I indicate to Senator Boswell and Senator Joyce, who are passionate advocates for their communities, for food processing and for regional industry, that the real challenge will be to get the CPRS right to ensure that we do not have massive spikes in electricity prices. This is not the bill to deal with this. It is important that we get the modelling right in the CPRS legislation. I think hiving off food processing in relation to this particular bill is bad policy. It is important that we get the big policy issue right, and that is the design of the CPRS.",SENATE,<title>RENEWABLE ENERGY (ELECTRICITY) AMENDMENT BILL 2009</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2009-08-20,"—I thank Senator Xenophon for that rare insight into his party room! I am sure we are all a lot better off for knowing how things operate in that party room. To respond to Senator Fielding, it seems that Family First have adopted the Labor Party approach of getting out to a focus group to see what little slogan works and then repeating it ad nauseam. It seems as though the latest slogan is ‘sold out’. But can I say to Senator Fielding: just because you repeat it 10 times does not make it a fact. It might sound good, it might be great rhetoric, but it does not make it the truth.
The simple fact is that overwhelmingly the Australian people want this upgrade of the renewable energy target to go through. We as a coalition had a decision to make as to whether we simply blocked the legislation at this stage or allowed it through. With the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, there was no urgency for that legislation—the government itself had delayed the starting date by 12 months; there was no need for it to be carried. However, there is a lot of investment, there is a lot of concern and I think there is a community expectation that this legislation be passed as soon as possible, therefore we entered into good faith negotiations with the government.
Can I disabuse Senator Fielding if he honestly believes that the National Party sold out in relation to food processing: they did not. I think everybody knows that they are the absolute champions in this place of rural and regional communities and of rural and regional jobs—and, if I might say so, no other senator has as long, distinguished and proud a record of doing that as Senator Boswell has. So to try to pin something like that onto Senator Boswell defies the history of, what—30 years in this place?
—27.
—Twenty-seven years in this place—over a quarter of a century of excellent advocacy. To suggest that somehow he has sold out just defies the evidence of over 25 years of active advocacy by Senator Boswell. What we as a coalition sought to do was get as good a deal as possible. It is a matter of regret that the government has not come to the party on this aspect, and that is why we are moving our amendment.
In relation to Senator Wong’s contribution, she told us that the approach being undertaken by the coalition and the National Party is not the fairest system to provide assistance to protect the food-manufacturing sector. For the sake of the argument, I am willing to concede that point. Just tell us what the fairest system would be and we would then look at that. It is not an argument to say, ‘Yours isn’t the fairest system, so we won’t have a system at all.’ That is where the National Party in this place in particular can hold their heads up high because they have at least, along with the coalition, come up with a system. It might not be the fairest, it might not be the best—but guess what? It is the only one being put on the table, and that is why we believe it is worthy of support.
As for Senator Milne’s provocative comments, I do not know why she repeated them. I could understand the nonsense yesterday because she was being broadcast. We are not being broadcast today, but still we had a repetition of the arguments, which are completely unsustainable. In relation to the new and emerging technologies, we did seek a deal with the government. To our regret, they did not accept our suggestions.
—Why aren’t you moving that as an amendment—
—If you had not increased your carbon footprint by flying to Sydney and back overnight for some film, you would be aware that we have indicated that we are going to move a private member’s bill, hopefully within a matter of weeks. We will be introducing it as a separate bill into this place and hoping to get the support of the Senate. If we had not got that deal, and Senator Milne knows this, we could have been like a dog in a manger—not get out of it and then block the whole legislation. Is that what the Australian Greens wanted—that, for the sake of that section, we block the legislation and not let it go forward? I do not think so. That is why we had a balancing act. We can see the benefits of supporting this legislation going through, albeit that it has major faults, such as in the emerging technologies and food manufacturing. In relation to the emerging sector, we will be moving our private member’s bill.
In relation to the so-called ‘big emitters’, I remind the Senate yet again that Australia’s ‘big emitters’ are in fact some of the cleanest manufacturers in the world. I have got a funny feeling that even today we might hear about the closure of an energy intensive plant somewhere in this country, partially because of the projected introduction of a carbon pollution reduction scheme. People’s jobs will be lost. Senator Fielding, by the way, is right here—renewable energy is more expensive than the way we do energy at the moment. But the way we do energy at the moment has certain environmental consequences, and we are trying to wean ourselves off that type of energy. That is why the Howard government introduced renewable energy targets. We have always said it should be staged, systematic and done in a way that does not mug the economy along the road of transition. That is why we started with a modest target today. Hopefully, we will be voting for an increased target but, if we increase the target too quickly, we will make the energy intensive industries less competitive on the world market. That will mean the closure of our manufacturers in this country. But guess what? The world demand for cement, aluminium and zinc will still be there, and, if we are not making it in Australia, it will be made in China or Russia or India or Brazil or Indonesia or Vietnam.
Now tell me this: for a tonne of zinc produced in any of those countries, what are the CO2 emissions in comparison to a tonne of zinc produced in Australia today? In China, it is threefold—six tonnes of CO2 per tonne of zinc produced compared to only two tonnes of CO2 in Australia. So, by us pricing our manufacturing sector out of world markets through increased power prices, we will in fact see higher pollution levels throughout the world. That is the consequence of the dogmatic, ideological attitude of the Australian Greens when it comes to these matters.
I indicate on behalf of the coalition our support for Senator Boswell and commend him for his long advocacy in this area. I think Senator Fielding’s comments to the father of the Senate and his party were inappropriate, because Senator Boswell has been an excellent advocate in this area for many, many years.",SENATE,<title>RENEWABLE ENERGY (ELECTRICITY) AMENDMENT BILL 2009</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Joyce, Sen Barnaby",NATS,2009-08-20,"—I was just pointing rudely across the chamber at Senator Wong in an attempt to find out if she was going to answer the question about the Climate Change Action Fund.
—When I get the call, I will respond to the question.",SENATE,<title>RENEWABLE ENERGY (ELECTRICITY) AMENDMENT BILL 2009</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Boswell, Sen Ron",NATS,2009-08-20,"—There have been certain accusations levelled by Senator Fielding and by Senator Milne. It was a difficult decision to support this legislation because it does increase the cost of electricity. As I have said before, if you increase the cost of energy—and it is not four per cent; it is about seven per cent on an increased ETS, when it comes in—it not only impacts on every working family but also gets passed through to every industry. So it was a difficult decision. It was probably one of the hardest decisions we have ever had to make, and the thing that pushed us over the line to vote for this was the fact, as Senator Wong included in her speech, that there were millions and millions and millions of dollars invested on the word of the coalition and the Labor Party. These people acted in good faith and took us on our word that we would go down the road of a renewable energy target. At that stage, I do not think anyone knew what it meant, but they went out and invested. Some of those people are National Party customers—the sugar industry, for one, has put millions into the gas.
So what were we to do? Should we have walked away from our word and left these people high and dry? They went out and invested on our say-so. That is not the way the National Party do business. Our word is our bond, and we stick to it. That is the area that we got pushed over the line. Were we going to walk away from people who invested money on our say-so? The answer was that we could not. That does not necessarily mean that I agree with this. I think it increases the price of electricity. I think it increases it on top of an ETS. I think wind power is not only unreliable but dangerous to our birds and all the other things that the Greens stand up for. It just clutters up and is very dangerous for our endangered species. I do not hear the Greens talking about that. I just want to say that we stuck to our word, and that word was, ‘You go out and invest and we’ll cover it.’ Maybe we were right and maybe we were wrong, but at least we stuck to our word.",SENATE,<title>RENEWABLE ENERGY (ELECTRICITY) AMENDMENT BILL 2009</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2009-08-20,"—I will endeavour to respond to a number of the propositions that have been brought, including Senator Joyce’s question. I will start by suggesting that the debate today and yesterday really demonstrates the lack of wisdom in the opposition, the Greens and the Independents in voting against the CPRS legislation even going in committee. Essentially, much of the debate has been about the CPRS. We could have had this debate, but you shut down debate because you did not want to debate it. As parliamentarians, many of the contributions in this debate have really dealt with the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, something you did not want to debate in committee. Senator Boswell said, ‘People took us at our word.’ Whilst I disagree with a lot of Senator Boswell’s policies, I think that is something he cares about. I would suggest to him he should care about it in relation to an emissions trading scheme. That was your policy. That was your policy before the last election.
—No-one invested money in it, though!
—So a policy is able to be given away if no-one acts upon it? Is that the proposition, Senator Boswell? I mean, really. You went to the Australian people supporting an emissions trading scheme and your party has demonstrated—
—But not your scheme.
—I will take that interjection. Senator Abetz said, ‘Not your scheme.’ I do not think Senator Joyce has made that clear. He just says, ‘No, no, no, no, no, full stop’ to an emissions trading scheme. Did no-one in your party room or in your government actually talk to the National Party when you made that election promise? Is that what happened?
Can I suggest that some of the questions—and I do not want to labour this too much—from the chamber about things like the Climate Change Action Fund and the household compensation package demonstrate just how not seriously some senators in this debate have taken their responsibility as parliamentarians. You have come into this debate and asked the government questions about policy that has been on the books for over eight months. It was published and announced by the Prime Minister. Yet you still know so little about the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme that you are asking whether we have a household compensation package, which has been publicised, and whether we have a Climate Change Action Fund, which has been on the books and talked about and discussed not only in the white paper but in many speeches. It is known to many industry groups. That really demonstrates that you voted against the CPRS without considering the detail at all. That really demonstrates that the coalition’s position on the CPRS is driven by very blind ideology, not by analysis of the policy. I hope that changes. I hope that those in the coalition who care about action on climate change—
—Why can’t you negotiate on the CPRS like you can on renewables?
—I will take that interjection, Senator Abetz. He asked why I could not negotiate on the CPRS like we did on renewables. It is because you came to us with your propositions. You came to us with a position. You came to us with amendments. You did not and you have not come to us—
—You have said all along, ‘No negotiation.’
—You have not come to us with a position supported by your party room when it comes to the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. The more you interject on this, Senator, and thrash around, the more you demonstrate the ridiculous position that the coalition has been in when it comes to action on climate change. You cannot even put forward amendments on a policy that is of such national importance. You cannot even do that.
On the Climate Change Action Fund, Senator Joyce, you asked about the revenue source. The revenue source is the auction revenue from the permits under the CPRS. My recollection is that there is some budget funding in the 2010-11 year but it is balanced over the forward estimates. All of those details were laid out first in the white paper released in December and were indicated in the budget papers released in May. If you want a Climate Change Action Fund, the source of the revenue is CPRS revenue—the scheme you have voted against.
Senator Abetz said, ‘If this is not the fairest system, what is?’ Senator Abetz, it is the one you have supported. We are very pleased that you are supporting that. I will just remind you again of what you signed up for. The government will replicate the industry assistance provisions from the CPRS for the purpose of the RET. The government will use the same eligibility thresholds under the CPRS as for the RET. A separate eligibility assessment process for activities that will be provided partial exemption under the RET will not be necessary. As CPRS eligibility assessments are finalised, these will be used as the basis to determine eligibility under the RET and prepare appropriate regulations. It is a pity you were not briefed sufficiently, Senator Abetz. It is a fairer system—
—We didn’t sign up to this for food manufacturing.
—I know you are thrashing about.

(Senator Hurley)—Order!
—Thank you.
—You cannot rewrite history.
—The fairer system is the system the government has been proposing all along, which is the one the coalition has signed up for. I have explained—
—We didn’t.
—Would you like me to read it back at you again, Senator?
—We told you at all times we would move an amendment on food processing.
—Order! Senator Wong, I would ask you not to respond to interjections. Senator Abetz, I would ask you to maintain order and not interject.
—You can always tell when Senator Abetz is getting sensitive. He interjects on a machinegun basis. He does not stop talking and starts to thrash around like a fish on a hook. The fairer system is the one that the coalition has agreed to, which is the activity based assistance on the basis of emissions intensity that the government has put out under the CPRS, which the coalition is now agreeing to utilise in relation to the renewable energy target. I have gone through already why we do not support this amendment. I do not propose to traverse that again. If we are able to proceed with voting on this particular set of amendments, that would be good. We have three more amendments after this before we are able to vote on the legislation.",SENATE,<title>RENEWABLE ENERGY (ELECTRICITY) AMENDMENT BILL 2009</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Joyce, Sen Barnaby",NATS,2009-08-20,"—Obviously, a lot of the questions that we ask here are not so much for our information but for the information of the Australia people. To get it on the record, what is clear from what the minister said is that the Climate Change Action Fund is going to source its money through the sale of permits through the CPRS. The CPRS is another piece of legislation. This legislation was supposed to be decoupled—that is, there is supposed to be no connection between the two. Quite obviously, there is. If we are going to be financing the food production industry with revenue from another piece of legislation, then it is to be queried as to whether there is true decoupling.
What we want, and this is why we have moved this amendment and why it gets to the source of the issue, is to make sure that the decoupling is truly authentic and therefore we want to make sure that food production is outside the scheme. Therefore, we have to pass this amendment. What the government has put up in regards to the ETS—the ‘employment termination scheme’ or ‘extra tax system’—or the CPRS, the cunning plan to get them to a double dissolution, with RS standing for what the economy will look like when they have finished, is putting immense duress on the food production industry. They gave the guarantee that they would decouple it, and they have not. To bring about a proper decoupling, we have to make sure that the food production industry is outside.
Minister, you clearly put on the record for the Australian people—and I thank you for that—the connection between the CPRS and the renewable energy target. In doing that, you have also confirmed that you have not actually decoupled the two pieces of legislation. Senator Wong is nodding. She acknowledges that they are not decoupled. There is no authenticity to the promise that you gave to the Australian people that you would decouple them. That means that you are now going to use the food production industry—the farmers, the working families who work in those plants—as pawns in your little game. That is completely unfair. You should not do that. One of the pawns in your little game is also going to be the capacity of Australian farmers to put Australian produce on the shelves of shops in Australia. And who are we going to replace those people with? We are going to replace them with the people who produce food that we import from overseas. They are going to have no renewable energy target or cunning plan reduction schemes or cunning plan RSs. We are going to take it backwards.
If you truly believe in catastrophic climate change—if that is what it is all about; if that is the be all and end all; if that is the thing that you have to put at the forefront of everything; if no matter what that is the goal and all other things should be put aside except that—then quite obviously you have to look at nuclear power. But you cannot do that, because that is a sacred cow. You cannot talk about nuclear power; you cannot mention that sacred cow; you have to leave that one alone.
What we are going to do if we do not pass this today is bang up the dairy farmers. It is dairy production that is going to cop it in the neck because of this.
—What about abattoirs?
—And the abattoirs and the canneries. It is the food production people who are going to cop it, because the Labor Party want to use that section of the economy, that section of the community and that section of regional Australia as a little pawn in their game. There should have been proper decoupling—decoupling that the government gave a guarantee, a warrant, that they would do. But they have not done it. The minister admitted this. She nodded in the chamber and said, ‘That’s exactly what we’re doing.’ She said that over there. She said: ‘That’s exactly what we’re doing. We’re keeping the two tied together.’ Why are you doing that? You gave a guarantee that you would not do that, Minister. But you are doing that. So you are being a little bit mischievous in the way that you are conducting things here. Maybe you should go back to Murray Goulburn and have dinner with them again and say: ‘What we intend to do with you, dairy producers of Australia, is use you as a little pawn in our game. You are now a political football.’
Let us be fair about this. You have heard it in the chamber. This is about connecting the two schemes. This is about putting duress on the whole process in full knowledge of what is going to happen to dairy. This is a clear connection. She has told us that the action fund is connected to the CPRS. Therefore, you have the duress. That is what we are up against. This ETS is a most insidious new tax that is going to come into play with words such as ‘catastrophe’ and ‘abomination’ connected to it. But the realities are economic realities for the people who government policy will affect.

"Fielding, Sen Steve",FFP,2009-08-20,"—I could not resist on this one. Here we have a partner of the coalition now worried about whether it has been decoupled or not. The coalition yesterday trumpeted that it had been decoupled. And here we have them now, just before the vote on the RET, an admission that it has not been decoupled. How can you operate? Seriously. That is what you have just said. You have admitted that it is not decoupled. The minister has just admitted that it is not decoupled. This is an absolute farce.",SENATE,<title>RENEWABLE ENERGY (ELECTRICITY) AMENDMENT BILL 2009</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Milne, Sen Christine",AG,2009-08-20,"—I will not delay the chamber but I think it is interesting that the coalition have been out overnight saying that their greatest achievement in this was the decoupling of the legislation. Either it is decoupled or it is not. Senator Joyce now believes it is not. So either the coalition were duped or they did not understand it, or Senator Joyce is wrong. I would like the minister to clarify: did the government dupe the coalition and this is in fact linked, or have they decoupled it and the Nationals do not understand it? Could we have clarity about that?",SENATE,<title>RENEWABLE ENERGY (ELECTRICITY) AMENDMENT BILL 2009</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2009-08-20,"—I suspect Senator Milne probably should address that question to Senator Abetz, but I am happy to have a go. Again we seem to be debating the CPRS rather than the RET, but I want to respond to Senator Joyce’s intervention.
He suggested that this is a game. This is not a game. This is about tackling climate change and increasing investment in renewable energy. This is about the government providing fair and consistent assistance to industries and providing certainty to business. It is about the government doing what we said we would do before the election and it is about the government doing what we believe is right for the nation. We do not do this because we think it is a game. We do this because we accept the consensus science about what climate change means to this nation now and what it will mean in the future.
I said in the CPRS debate that the ability of the nations of the world, including Australia, to prevent any climate change is already lost to us. But what this generation of political leaders have is the opportunity to lessen the risk for our children and for those who come after us. I for one think that is a responsibility we should discharge properly. It is not a responsibility we should walk away from because we are frightened or because we are too weak. So I reject in the strongest terms, Senator Joyce, the way in which you have characterised the approach. You can have an argument with us on the policy, but what you are implying is just incorrect. I do not think it is consistent with the way many Australians understand this issue.
In relation to coupling and decoupling I am reminded of Lenore Taylor’s article about the way in which this discussion has gone on. The amendments that the government moved in the House, which we announced on the weekend, did not make the commencement of assistance under the RET conditional upon the passage of the CPRS. So that is true. But the effective consequence of the agreement with the coalition is precisely what the government have been arguing for—that is, that we should build the renewable energy target assistance onto the architecture of the CPRS assistance. Frankly, I am not sure that it assists in the political debate—clearly it assists inside the coalition and possibly in terms of the Greens trying to have a go at the coalition or the government for the agreement we have come to—whether you say that the date of commencement is the coupling or decoupling or that the architecture of the assistance is the coupling or decoupling. But I can tell you that, from the government’s perspective, we think this was a sensible compromise because it deals with the policy issue about which we were always concerned, which was to reflect industries’ view to us that we needed to consider the cumulative cost. We are pleased that the coalition were able to come to a view. I will quote from Mr Turnbull’s press release that referred to what has been agreed, which is using the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme of assistance, or design of assistance, where that is described as ‘appropriate protection for emissions-intensive trade-exposed industries such as aluminium’. So we are pleased with that.
Obviously senators can conduct this debate how we want, but my suggestion to the chamber is that we are not debating the CPRS. With respect to Senator Milne, we are actually not debating whether the coalition got it right. She has put a view about that and I accept that. We are actually debating an amendment on food processing. We will then have an amendment from the government and two amendments, I think, from Senator Milne, which the government is happy to debate and proceed. Obviously this matter has precedence, I think, through you Madam Temporary Chair, until 12.45 pm. I express again, as I expressed last night, the government’s keenness to get this legislation through for the reason that Senator Boswell correctly alluded to—that is, this is investment-sensitive legislation. This is legislation on which a lot of private sector investment hangs and we are keen to pass it and give that signal to Australian business.",SENATE,<title>RENEWABLE ENERGY (ELECTRICITY) AMENDMENT BILL 2009</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Joyce, Sen Barnaby",NATS,2009-08-20,"—All we can do is put before the chamber Senator Boswell’s amendment to protect food production industries, specifically the dairy industry, the abattoir industry and the canning industry. The numbers in the Senate will determine what happens to it.
I clearly put before the chamber before we vote that, if we do not support this amendment, we will leave the dairy industry especially, because it has a huge carbon footprint, and behind that the abattoir industry out there. I do not believe that there are numbers present in this chamber for the support of the government’s ETS or CPRS, or whatever acronym they want to devise for it next time; therefore, there will not be capacity for a so-called climate change action fund to exist which would be able to sponsor or assist with the cost impost of the renewable energy target on these industries.
I do acknowledge that the Australian community in general has a view about renewable energy and that it wants to progress that issue. If you are trying to be conciliatory, it is in the nature of trying to be conciliatory that you move towards something even though you might not totally agree with it. In some instances you might not agree with it at all but you still try, for the benefit of what is desired, to move in that direction. But you try to do that in a form that will alleviate the unnecessary consequences for other sections of the economy.
We cannot put any more pressure on the production of Australian food. We cannot put any more pressure on the food-processing sector. You cannot have a farm if you do not have somewhere to process what you produce. This chamber can pass this amendment, and if it passes the amendment we can excise food production from the renewable energy target and give some confidence to the food production sector that their future is important. We talk about what is terribly important. The minister talks about what is extremely important for kids, and I agree with that. But I will tell you what is really important to families: affordable food. It is very important for working families in Australia to be able to put food on the table that they can pay for and not to have the whole dietary component of their lives changed by government policy and regulation. That will happen if you keep putting these imposts on. This is a common-sense amendment that takes food production out of this legislation. As time progresses, other things can happen, but at the moment it is a huge slug to the food production industry—and I draw your attention specifically to the issues in the dairy industry.",SENATE,<title>RENEWABLE ENERGY (ELECTRICITY) AMENDMENT BILL 2009</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1,speech

—But you are.
—No. This is important. What will happen here is that the National Party will run out to the dairy industry and the food-processing industry and say, ‘We tried to look out for you and we tried to help you but we just couldn’t do it on the floor.’ Where were you when you agreed to this? Seriously—where were you when you agreed to this? Did you even know that it was agreed to? Did you really know what time it was agreed to yesterday? Were you really consulted about this being one of those things that would be dropped off the table?
—The amendment was tabled, Senator Fielding.

(Senator Marshall)—It is Senator Joyce.
—Through you, Chair, it is a bit like when he came into this chamber and said, ‘I’ve saved Christmas Day and Anzac Day under Work Choices.’ He never did. It was a crock then and he is doing the same thing again today. He is saying, ‘Well, I tried.’ You have not saved anything.

If we get defeated, then that is the will of the Senate. It is not the will of the coalition; it is the will of the Senate. Senator Fielding, I think Family First was built on honesty and integrity and you are not showing either of those capacities at all. You are being very disingenuous.
—Mr Temporary Chairman, I rise on a point of order. That is way over the mark.

"Joyce, Sen Barnaby",NATS,2009-08-20,"—Just briefly, I think it is a bit rich that Senator Fielding comes out with these inflammatory comments and then gets a bit upset when people pull him up on them. Senator Fielding, the issue is a simple one. It is about mathematics. We have 37 votes; we need 39. The purpose of being in committee is to try and obtain those votes. Maybe you can assist—that remains to be seen—if you give your commitment that you will support it. Then we will need one more. That is what we call the process of the Senate. There is a little article that we have called democracy, Senator Fielding. You should have a crack at it one day.

"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2009-08-20,"—by leave—I move government amendments (1) to (4) on sheet BF213:
(1)    Schedule 2, item 8, page 14 (line 2), omit “Authority’s”, substitute “Regulator’s”.
(2)    Schedule 2, item 8, page 14 (lines 4, 7, 11 and 15), omit “Authority”, substitute “Regulator”.
(3)    Schedule 2, item 14, page 15 (lines 17, 28 and 30), omit “Authority”, substitute “Regulator”.
(4)    Schedule 2, item 14, page 16 (lines 3, 12, 17, 21, 26, 28, 29 and 32), omit “Authority”, substitute “Regulator”.
These are minor amendments dealing with an administrative matter and clarifying that the Renewable Energy Regulator, who administers the current Mandatory Renewable Energy Target scheme and who will administer the expanded Renewable Energy Target scheme, will be responsible for administration of partial exemptions in relation to emissions-intensive trade-exposed activities under the RET scheme. When the Carbon Pollution Production Scheme comes into force, the Renewable Energy Regulator will be absorbed into the Australian Climate Change Regulatory Authority, which will administer these partial exemptions. The proposed amendments simply replace several references made in the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Amendment Bill 2009 to the Australian Climate Change Regulatory Authority, known as ‘the authority’, with references to the Renewable Energy Regulator, ‘ the regulator’, as the authority will only come into existence once the CPRS legislation passes. Consequential amendments in the CPRS legislation will give effect to the requisite change of reference from ‘regulator’ to ‘authority’ in the RET legislation at the appropriate time. These provisions are to commence on the day in which the act receives royal assent.
Question agreed to.",SENATE,<title>RENEWABLE ENERGY (ELECTRICITY) AMENDMENT BILL 2009</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Milne, Sen Christine",AG,2009-08-20,"—The Australian Greens oppose clause 17 in the following terms:
(17)  Schedule 2, page 12 (line 1) to page 18 (line 15), Schedule TO BE OPPOSED.
I would seek agreement of the chamber that the debate be a cognate debate on amendment (17) and amendment (18). In other words, let us have one debate and two votes. That would facilitate the time. It is the same issue and so I would hope that the chamber agrees this is an appropriate way to proceed.
 (Senator Marshall)—There has been no opposition indicated to the chair, Senator Milne, so proceed.
—Thank you. This amendment from the Australian Greens moves to see that there is no partial exemption for emissions-intensive trade-exposed activities. This is in complete opposition to what the government and the coalition have agreed, which is to provide exemptions to the renewable energy target. I seek some information from both the government and the coalition, if they have any, in relation to this matter. I would like to start with the principle of: why would you want to exempt anyone from having to pay their fair share of a transition to a low-carbon, zero-carbon economy and expand the renewable energy target? Why shouldn’t the price be paid by everybody? As you know, when you exempt sections of the economy from paying, other people have to pay more. In this case, by exempting the aluminium sector—and there are all the other sectors that you have provided exemptions to—the taxpayers, the consumers, actually have to pay more because somebody has to pay for the renewable energy target being achieved and, if those big emitters do not pay, the community will.
We just heard the National Party talking about food processing. It means that the community is going to pay a higher price and so will have less money to spend on the products that the National Party is talking about. In fact, the Treasury gave evidence about this at the inquiry. Treasury’s Ms Meghan Quinn said:
It is the case with all analysis with CGE models that if you restrict coverage of a particular component, whether it be what part of the economy is faced with an emission price or which elements of the economy are covered by a particular scheme, we find typically that narrowing the scope on which the policy acts increases the economic costs to the economy in aggregate. It obviously has different impacts at the sector level, but narrowing the focus on a particular component tends to raise the aggregate economic costs of any policy.
It is actually bad policy to say, ‘We want to have a renewable energy target but we are going to exempt these industries.’ In principle, that is a bad idea. We should be spreading the cost so that everybody has an obligation to see the transition to a low-carbon, zero-carbon economy.
Having said that, I want to go to the question of aluminium. We all know, especially those of us who have lived in Tasmania for a long time, that the aluminium sector has never paid a fair price for energy. That is because the Tasmanian government fell over itself to provide cheap bulk power contracts in order to attract energy-intensive industries to Tasmania. That is the history of why we have Comalco in Tasmania. They came to Tasmania and received secret bulk power contracts, which were give-away power contracts to the aluminium sector. In fact, something like 60 per cent of the energy generated in Tasmania was given as bulk power contracts to energy-intensive industries at very cheap prices, and the rest of the community subsidised that. During the Labor-Greens accord, the Labor Party in Tasmania agreed to make public the bulk power contracts, but of course they reneged on that once we got into government. It is a written part of the Labor-Greens accord that the community be told what those contracts mean.
At the moment, Minister Wong, the mandatory renewable energy target does not, as I understand it, offer exemptions for the aluminium sector. So why aren’t they complaining about having to pay the mandatory renewable energy target? It is because they are not paying it. We know that in Victoria, for example, the Victorian taxpayer pays the share for the aluminium sector. I bet the people in Victoria do not know they are doing that. The Victorian government said that they would subsidise the Portland smelter so that the aluminium sector would not have to pay. The reason the aluminium sector is now wound up about this legislation is that, for most of them, their bulk power contracts will come up for negotiation some time in the next decade. They want to make sure that, when their price negotiation comes up, they are sheltered from having to pay a renewable energy target. If that is the case, they are already not paying. Why are you exempting them in the future when their profits over the last couple of decades have been mega profits? Why are you sandbagging them now? The first question is: which of the aluminium smelters around the country is actually paying the mandatory renewable energy target at the moment?
The second point concerns the actual price that the aluminium sector pay. They claim that this legislation is going to put a huge impost on them, that it is impossible and that they will have to go offshore. We know that that is a load of nonsense. We did not hear any evidence to that effect in the inquiry. None of them said that they would shut up shop and go offshore, because they all admit that what they need is a stable environment in which to work. They need a skilled workforce and a reliable supply of baseload power. That is why they are not going to leave the country. In fact, the best way to put them out of business is to keep on sandbagging them and then let them establish themselves in other countries where there is a large supply of reliable renewable energy. In other words, the only way to make them competitive is to have green aluminium.
We should be expanding renewable energy so that in the future energy-intensive industries generally will be able to insulate themselves against carbon prices by accessing a large and reliable supply of renewable energy. That is a standard case in point. Comalco’s long-term bulk power contract was supplied by hydro, but it may not be in the future. It will be buying from the wholesale market. It may well go away from having hydro power because it will be accessing whatever it gets through Basslink, and that could be baseload coal for all we know. The issue here is that, for energy-intensive industries to be competitive in the future and to insulate themselves from the high carbon price which is coming, they will need large, available and reliable sources of baseload power in the renewable sector.
Why should they not have to pay, as everybody else pays, to get those energy sectors up and running and expanded all over the country? Overseas, geothermal is already providing baseload power to smelters. Why should not the aluminium sector have to pay something towards the development of, for example, geothermal or solar thermal in Australia so that they have large, reliable sources of renewable energy power in the future? What you are saying is that taxpayers should pay for that development so that the aluminium sector can take advantage of it in the future. I think, in the scheme of things, that it is completely inappropriate not to make them pay.
The third point that I would make is in relation to the actual price. There were four reports done that are in the public arena. One has not been published—the one that was done for the big energy users. I suspect it was not made public because it did not provide the answers on price that they wanted. The argument has been very strongly put that, because you are bringing renewables such as solar into the energy generation sector, they are going to shave off the peaks. What these reports have all argued is that there is going to be downward pressure on the pool price because of the renewables bidding in. That was very clear evidence given, for example, by Mr Upson of Infigin Energy. There were also reports from Rome Consulting and the Clean Energy Council which pointed this out, but the one that the government focused on was the McLennan Magasanik Associates report. It said, ‘The RET is expected to have a modest impact on electricity prices.’ Retail prices are expected to increase on average around 3½ per cent above the business as usual scenario in the period 2010 to 2020.
However, the report said that the average pool price impact is going to be between minus four and plus eight. The position I put to you is that, if the aluminium industry do not have to pay the renewable energy price, the target price, but the rest of us do and, as a result of that, the pool price falls, they then get a windfall gain. They get a windfall gain because they do not have any of the risk—government absorbs the risk—and they get a windfall gain as the pool price is forced down. I would like the minister to tell me whether she believes, and whether her analysis is, that the pool price is going to come down. If it is, why are you exempting the aluminium industry from paying the RET, because it could be strongly argued that the pool price might actually fall far enough to cancel out the renewable energy target price?
There is no doubt that electricity prices are going to rise due to a range of factors. In part, that will occur as a result of a carbon price being established in the future. It will occur as coal, ultimately, has to pay its way—although in this country, the way things are going, coal will always be let off the hook. But, anyway, at some point electricity prices are going to rise. What we are saying here is that renewable energy is going to drive down the wholesale price. Why should the rest of us sandbag aluminium and let them achieve a windfall gain? If they are not paying the RET, why should they benefit from the lower future wholesale price? I am very keen for the minister to explain that and to tell me about the analysis from those other reports that I mentioned—the Roam Consulting report, for example.
There was also a study for the Business Council of Australia. That report estimated that, ‘The RET will make wholesale electricity prices lower than they otherwise would be.’ I repeat: ‘lower than they otherwise would be’. So why would you want to exempt them when the price is going to be lower than it otherwise would be? It is a classic case of privatising the profits and the benefits and socialising the costs. If these companies do not have to pay then, as Treasury has said, everyone else will pay a higher price. They do not pay, but then they get the benefit from the lower wholesale prices. They get another windfall gain after decades of having been sandbagged by consumers and by the government. I think it is really incumbent upon the minister to explain.
The other point I would strongly make is this: the aluminium industry are being exempted because they are supposedly trade exposed. Is that really the case? It implies that smelters elsewhere are not covered by a mandatory renewable energy target. But let me tell you that there are many countries that now have renewable energy targets. Japan has set a target for an additional 16,000 gigawatt hours of renewable energy by 2014. Japan already sources 10 per cent of its electricity generation from renewables—this target is additional to that. So is aluminium from Australia trade exposed to Japan because of this RET? No, of course it is not.
The EU has a renewable energy target of 20 per cent. There is no specific target for the share of renewable energy in electricity generation—the target is across several sectors, including transport. My point here is that the EU has a renewable energy target. The UK has a renewable energy target and Japan has a renewable energy target.
Consider the United States. California has a mandated requirement for 33 per cent of electricity to come from renewables by 2020. The Waxman-Markey bill includes a combined efficiency and renewable electricity standard for the United States as a whole which incorporates a target of 20 per cent by 2020. It also includes energy efficiency measures, as our target is going to do—I was trying to put such measures on top of the target to increase it.
So are we trade exposed against California or the rest of the United States? Are we trade exposed against Japan? Are we trade exposed against any of these places? No, we are not. So if we are talking purely about the impact of a renewable energy target on the aluminium industry, they are not trade exposed. So why are we exempting them when they are not trade exposed?

"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2009-08-20,"—There were a number of things in there, albeit nothing new. It is the same old mantra and, I might say, the same old telling of half the story. Yes, the renewable energy targets referred to by Senator Milne are right, although she did not tell us what the actual percentage would be with the increase in Japan. That would have been an interesting figure. But, even with their renewable energy targets, did Senator Milne take us through the exemptions that are available to various industries in Europe, in Japan, in the United States? No, she did not. There is only one reason she did not do that: she knew it would debunk her argument, because country after country has included them. Indeed, the Waxman-Markey bill to which she referred has special protection for any energy-intensive trade-exposed industry. We know that to be the case, but why didn’t she mention it? Because time and time again the Australian Greens go out to the Australian population telling a deceptive story because they only tell half of it. What they say is true but it is misleading. If the whole story were to be painted on the canvas, the picture would be so very different. We know that to be the case and we have got another example today.
Senator Milne’s contribution, rhetorical as it was, started off with the question: why would you want to exempt anyone from paying their fair share? We do not want to exempt anyone from paying their fair share; of course we do not. But I suppose it depends on what your definition of ‘fair’ is, and according to the Greens ‘fair’ includes throwing hundreds and thousands of Australians out of employment. We know that with the renewable energy target—and Senator Milne herself said, and I wrote it down—electricity prices will rise. Of course they will, and that is why we as a coalition say: to transition your economy to be less carbon dependent, you do it in a stepped and staged manner so you protect your economy and jobs. We could get up here today and say, ‘Aren’t we great? We have a 50 per cent renewable energy target.’ It sounds good but for the fact that lots of people would lose their jobs and we would devastate our economy. What is more, we would also devastate the world environment. Why is that? Because, if our aluminium smelters become uncompetitive on the world market due to increased energy costs, they will close down. I think, as I speak, there is an announcement being made today about a facility in Queensland being closed down, partly because of their concerns about what the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme will mean for their future operations, with the loss of jobs.
Do you think the world demand for that particular product is going to decrease? Of course it will not. The demand will still be there for that product, but it will no longer be made in Australia and we will be importing it, undoubtedly, from China, Indonesia or Vietnam. I ask the Australian Greens and I ask the Australian public: do you honestly believe that the closure of a manufacturing facility in Australia and its transplanting to one of the countries I have just mentioned will leave a lesser carbon footprint on the world environment? Of course it will not.
I have used the example of zinc manufacturing before in this debate: in China, three times the amount of CO2 is produced per tonne of zinc in comparison with zinc production in Australia. If you make zinc manufacturing non-competitive on the world market, you will see Australian zinc manufacturing close down. The world demand for zinc will still be there; it will just be made in China, where they put three times as much CO2 into the atmosphere per tonne of zinc produced than we do in Australia. But somehow we are to put our hand on our heart and say, ‘Aren’t we good environmentalists? We have stopped polluting by two tonnes of CO2 per tonne of zinc produced; aren’t we good?’ knowing full well that, as a result of that action, zinc being produced in another country is putting three times the amount of CO2 into the atmosphere.
The Greens recipe is not only to mug Australian jobs, to mug Australian wealth and industry; it is also to mug the world environment. There will be a worse outcome. It is about time that the Australian Greens realised the consequences of their policies. I would also say that you know the debate is taking an interesting turn when the Australian Greens start providing gratuitous business advice to various industries, telling them how all the industry and other analysis is wrong but the Greens have somehow got the answers to all the problems and that their energy costs will really be cheaper! I do not know how Senator Milne got to that convoluted conclusion. After having said that electricity prices would rise, she then tells us that somehow electricity will in fact be cheaper.
Well, I am not aware of any business or any businessperson in this country that is so wedded to carbon-producing electricity generation that they would not want cheaper electricity if it could be obtained from a renewable source—I know of nobody. So it is just pure fantasy to believe the Greens’ approach on this issue—that somehow business is doing itself in the eye by not accepting the cheaper energy that would result from renewable energy. I think we are all agreed, and Senator Milne herself said this, that renewable energy will cost more. That is a price we need to pay if we want to shift our dependence on carbon-producing energy sources. But we need to do that in a transitional way that will protect the Australian job market, protect Australian industry and, what is more, ensure that we do not have carbon leakage into other parts of the world. So we as an opposition indicate that we will be opposing Green amendments (17) and (18) on sheet 5816 revised.",SENATE,<title>RENEWABLE ENERGY (ELECTRICITY) AMENDMENT BILL 2009</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Milne, Sen Christine",AG,2009-08-20,"—It is obvious that Senator Abetz did not actually read the Senate committee report on this. What is interesting is that some of the large aluminium sectors in their annual reports do not even note the impact of the government’s legislation in terms of their operations. I did not hear Senator Abetz name the aluminium smelters that are going to close down around the country. I have not heard them say they will close down. Of course they are rushing around here wanting more, but they are not saying that.
The 2008 annual report from ALCOA this year makes only general comments relating to the risks posed by climate change regulations and does not foreshadow facility closures or job losses in Australia. That is a funny thing, Senator Abetz—if ALCOA were so worried about it, why didn’t they mention it in their annual report? Why didn’t they threaten to shut down around Australia? Rio Tinto Alcan’s annual report for 2008, published early in 2009, noted that production had fallen by 450,000 tonnes per annum, attributable largely to the impact of the economic downturn. Despite this, the report contained the following assessment by Mr Tom Albanese, chief executive:
The fundamentals of the aluminium industry nevertheless remain strong. Higher energy costs are raising the aluminium cost curve, particularly in China, to the advantage of lower cost producers like Rio Tinto Alcan.
Dr Liu did explain when that report was made that Mr Albanese was referring to Rio Tinto Alcan’s global operations, which include Canadian assets using hydropower, not specifically to their Australian operations.
The point I was making that Senator Abetz clearly did not understand—unlike, I am sure, the minister because she has followed this debate—was on the issue of the wholesale pool price. Senator Abetz clearly does not understand that issue. I note that ROAM Consulting said:
Increasing REC generation will depress pool prices below base case levels … the reduction in pool prices will be offset by the cost of RECs to the retailers (due to the necessity of meeting the expanded MRET—
or mandatory renewable energy target. So here you have ROAM Consulting saying increasing renewable energy will depress pool prices. As I indicated, the Business Council of Australia said:
Although retail prices are higher under the RET scheme (due to the obligation on retailers to surrender RECs), wholesale prices are lower, as … renewable generators typically have low marginal costs, and also because they receive a REC revenue “subsidy” that lowers the revenue they require from the energy market to justify their investment.
I am really keen to know from the minister why these industries are trade exposed and with which countries. In view of the fact that all these places have renewable energy targets, I want to know why we are exempting them when in the future their competitive advantage depends on having a large baseload supply of renewables. I also want to know, Minister, why you would want to give them a windfall gain and, if you would not, whether you will support the amendment to say that they must not get a windfall gain as a result of these exemptions if the pool prices fall in the way that is expected. If you believe they will not get a windfall gain then there is no problem with you voting for it—it is not going to happen, apparently. I will be very interested to hear what the minister has to say, particularly on the pool price issue.",SENATE,<title>RENEWABLE ENERGY (ELECTRICITY) AMENDMENT BILL 2009</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2009-08-20,"—I am very pleased that I actually have the opportunity to respond because there have been a lot of questions raised and people being more interested in having a further debate in the chamber than having the government respond—which is fine, if that is how they wish to proceed.
Let’s go through the various questions that the senator asked. I will go to the technical one. She has raised this with me previously, and I thought we had finished the discussion. Perhaps we are simply not of the same view about this. The senator refers to the wholesale price. It is the case that the modelling demonstrates—and of course this is modelling—quite a range of potential impacts on wholesale price. I think the senator herself referred to the MMA modelling, which suggested a range between minus five and eight per cent to 2020. It did of course indicate an average increase of 0.5 per cent. However, what people pay is not the wholesale price; what people pay is the retail price, which of course is the wholesale price plus the REC liability. So the reality is that the wholesale price may be relevant for your speech; in terms of public policy consideration, it is not what we look at to consider the potential price impact on a sector or particular sectors, because you need to consider the REC liability.
The second point is on the fair share argument. We agree people should pay their fair share. That is our argument against those in this place who argue for trade-exposed industries to get 100 per cent exemption. That is our argument when some industry sectors seek 100 per cent exemption. This is an argument about who funds the costs of transforming the Australian economy, whether it is via CPRS or the renewable energy target. The question is how best to spread those costs. I accept that Senator Milne has a different view. The government’s view is that we do have to recognise the potential cost impact on very high energy users. The reality is that, although the cost impact for the RET alone is small for most industries, the aluminium industry probably faces a cost impact, with our other policy mechanism, that is around 10 times that of other industries. I am sorry, Senator Milne, but we do think that is relevant. That is something the government has to consider. We are not proposing 100 per cent exemption for anyone. The thresholds in the CPRS which are agreed as the basis for assistance via partial exemption under this legislation are 60 per cent and 90 per cent, depending on their exposure to the cost increases.
The senator asked who was paying for the current mandatory renewable energy target. This government does not make policy on the basis of what state governments may or may not do. We have to make a policy decision for this legislation that is transparent, that is across the economy and that is certain. We did not accept the coalition’s original position that aluminium and other sectors—but particularly aluminium I think—should be exempted for the existing renewable energy target as well. We said that, from the Commonwealth’s perspective, we do not think that exempting and assisting somebody to reach a target that is already in place is good policy. We think there is an argument to provide assistance for the impact of the expanded policy, and that is what we have done. In response to your asking who is paying for the current MRET, that is not information that is comprehensively in the public arena. It is information in relation to contracts to which the Commonwealth is not a party. From the Commonwealth’s perspective, we have not exempted people from the existing renewable energy target.
Senator Milne asked about the price impact and made what I think is a reasonable point. She said that when you make decisions about exempting you are shifting the costs from one sector to another. That is precisely the policy issue—I do not want to go back to the CPRS—that is challenging—
—Yes, you do.
—Actually, you are the one that did not want to debate it.
Opposition senators interjecting—
—I will debate you, Senator Cormann, anywhere. You are the one who refused to debate CPRS in this chamber. There is a question of judgment about the best policy framework and how best to spread the costs across the community. Senator Milne may or may not have heard me say that a decision to exempt one sector or another further from the carbon price, which is analogous to the RET price, imposes costs on other parts of the economy. We have taken that into account. We have had to balance the need, in our view, to assist particular industries, given their very high potential exposure under this policy, with the need to ensure that people pay their fair share.
I may not have previously indicated our assessment of the extended or wider assistance. Again, I emphasise that nobody gets away with 100 per cent exemption. There would be a 0.8 per cent increase in electricity prices between 2010 and 2020 as a result of that policy decision. Without any assistance or exemptions, we approximate that the impact of RET alone will be about three per cent between 2010 and 2020. We estimate that the impact of these decisions around industry exemption, made for the reasons I have outlined, will be around an additional 0.8 per cent. Yes, we have made that judgment, one that the coalition has supported, because we believe that we have to recognise the greater exposure to cost for some sectors than for others.
On the issue of the windfall gain test, because we are having a cognate debate, the fact is that the calculation of windfall gain is not an easy proposition. I know that implementation issues may not be front of mind in this discussion, but to calculate a windfall gain the government would be required to estimate what prices would otherwise have been for any particular entity and therefore to calculate what its actual financial position is as compared to not offering this assistance. A lot of hypothetical and detailed calculations would be required. We do not think it is sensible to get involved in an ongoing windfall gain discussion or process as the way to deal with this issue. Our view is that the way this is best dealt with is to ensure that assistance is less than 100 per cent. That comes back to the issue that you do not want to provide more assistance than is required. The way we have done that is to say that we will not exempt for the existing MRET and we will only exempt 90 per cent or 60 per cent, depending on the level of emissions intensity, for the remaining renewable energy target—that is, the expanded target. We think that is a more sensible way to deal with the prospect of windfall gain. So the government will not be supporting the Greens amendments.",SENATE,<title>RENEWABLE ENERGY (ELECTRICITY) AMENDMENT BILL 2009</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Milne, Sen Christine",AG,2009-08-20,"—I also asked the minister: how are we trade exposed when these other countries have a renewable energy target? But I will just put that to one side for a moment and go back to something else she said. As she rightly pointed out, the wholesale price plus the RET gives you the retail price. If you are not paying the RET because you are exempted, and your wholesale price goes down, you are making a windfall gain. That is the reality and that is the point that I am making here: if the wholesale price goes down by the same or more than the RET cost, they are making a windfall gain. I am really horrified to learn that the Commonwealth just does not know which of these big energy users is already being protected from the MRET obligations by state governments. What we effectively now have is cost shifting from the states to the Commonwealth, because currently the states are picking up the obligation and not passing it on. So the aluminium sector is already protected in Victoria—they just press on, and the taxpayers in Victoria do that.
The issue then becomes: if the Commonwealth now steps up and says, ‘We will exempt them from the RET,’ then what is happening here is that the states will not have to keep on paying that obligation into the future when those contracts are renewed. In fact, what the Commonwealth has done is shifted the decision of the states to sandbags those industries across to the consumers of Australia. When people go to the supermarket they will have less money to spend because they are paying more for their electricity bills so that the aluminium sector does not have to pay it and state governments do not have to pay it. So it is a nice little cost shift from state governments to the consumers via the Commonwealth because of what is happening here.
Senator Abetz made quite a big statement about all those countries that I mentioned. I talked about California, the European Union, the UK, Japan, Canada and China all having renewable energy targets. I would like Senator Abetz or the minister if she can, since Senator Abetz seems to be the expert on this, to tell me which countries shield their energy-intensive industries from their renewable energy target and to what extent. It is a wild claim by Senator Abetz. He may have the Waxman-Markey bill, but let him stand up here and explain to the Senate exactly what he is talking about. I know the minister is going to respond to me in the moment.
On the issue of windfall gain, the minister’s explanation was just to say, ‘Oh, well, the RET is on top of the wholesale price, and therefore the retail price blah, blah.’ I want to know about that connection between the two. She talked about transparency, and I think the community deserves to know which of the energy-intensive industries around Australia is already paying the mandatory renewable energy target. It seems to me that none of them are, even though they are not exempted. They are being paid for by the taxpayers of Australia, no doubt through state taxes, to offset the costs that the state governments are shielding them from. What we have here is a scream from the aluminium sector, who are not paying for any obligation as it currently stands. I think that is most unfortunate.
None of them are talking about leaving the country. They all admit the benefits they have by working in Australia. They all talk about the fact that they like a stable political scenario. They want reliable baseload power. They want a skilled workforce. They have got all of those things in Australia and they are not packing up and going anywhere very soon. They do not even threaten to their shareholders that they are. You would think if this was a major problem for them they might actually put it in their annual reports, but they do not. The renewable energy target is not the problem that they contend it to be. I really cannot see the government’s problem with saying that they agree that there ought not to be windfall gains, and acting accordingly. Otherwise we are basically saying that the people who should help to transform the economy to a low-carbon or zero-carbon future, the people who should be paying to create the jobs in the renewable energy sector and in rural and regional Australia, should be everybody except the industry sectors we are talking about here—that, for some reason, we all should pay so they can benefit. I have made the point that they are energy intensive and so in the future they need renewable energy. They need it because they will pay higher prices for coal fired power unless they can get it, and we are facilitating that outcome.
While I am on that subject, I was interested to hear earlier from the National Party about rural and regional Australia and jobs and so on. I note that the National Party did not support the Greens amendment last night to take the 1.5 kilowatt hour cap off off-grid solar in particular. That affects every community, particularly Indigenous communities, but the Northern Territory cattlemen, for example, were very keen to have that supported because they recognise that this is going to kill off-grid renewable energy around Australia. This is going to seriously undermine any further rollout, and yet we had the National Party opposing it. The government opposed it as well, although I concede that the minister has said she will look at it. I am glad about that because I absolutely want to see the roll out of renewables and I hope that there can be some agreement. I regard COAG as the lowest denominator outcome for anything, but I also appreciate that the minister has said they will try to expedite consideration of that matter. That is another matter entirely, but I would be interested to hear from Senator Abetz about those countries that do shield their energy-intensive industries from their renewable energy target and to what extent; if the minister can provide it, well and good.",SENATE,<title>RENEWABLE ENERGY (ELECTRICITY) AMENDMENT BILL 2009</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2009-08-20,"—Senator, in relation to what is going to COAG, I note you were paired last night and were not here to move your amendments. I provided that advice to the Leader of the Greens and to the chamber twice, I think, and I have also provided it to you privately. So I do not know that I would suggest that extending this debate on a bill that I understand everyone is going to vote for—perhaps not Senator Fielding—is a sensible use of the chamber’s time. I can reiterate it to you again if you wish.
In relation to trade exposure, we do have a test in the white paper, which is the test that companies conducting activities seeking exemption would have to meet, and I would refer you to that. It is the case for a range of these firms that they are competing in the markets where the international price is set not necessarily with regard to increased electricity costs as the result of renewable energy policies.
In relation to the cost-shifting argument, I would make two points. The first is that the senator comes in here making a whole range of assertions as fact about contracts to which she is not a party and the Commonwealth is not a party and which are by their very nature commercial-in-confidence. I make no comment about those contracts; they are not contracts that the Commonwealth is a party to. She can have an argument about the history in Tasmania; I am not party to that. We make policy on the basis of what we think is sensible policy across the economy.
We are not exempting for the current MRET—I want to say that again. We did not accept that amendment, for the very sound reason that it seemed to us that compensating and assisting industry for a liability that was already in place and for which there was no Commonwealth assistance was not sensible. What we are assisting with is a proportion, a partial exemption, of the expanded liability.
In relation to the assertion about wholesale price, we could have a modelling argument for a number of hours. I would say this to the senator: there are a range of modelling outcomes in relation to wholesale price. There is credible modelling in the MMA report commissioned by the Department of Climate Change which suggests the average increase in the wholesale price would be half of one per cent. We are only providing partial exemption for the extended liability under the extended renewable energy target; we are not providing exemption for the existing renewable energy target. In those circumstances, my advice is that a windfall gain is unlikely. If the modelling is not accurate in a range of ways, and if the design of the policy requires reconsideration, we have said that there will be a review in 2014 to consider these issues. That would be an issue amongst a number of other issues that could be dealt with in those circumstances.
I think I have addressed and responded to all the issues that were raised by the senator.",SENATE,<title>RENEWABLE ENERGY (ELECTRICITY) AMENDMENT BILL 2009</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Milne, Sen Christine",AG,2009-08-20,"—I would like to know whether the government took into account the modelling other than the McLennan Magasanik modelling and whether those other reports, by Roam Consulting et cetera, were taken into account as well. It seems to me that only the government’s report gives that increase. All the others talk about the downward pressure on the pool price. So I am very interested to know if the government considered those other modelling reports. I note the government did not name any countries in the context of trade exposure or any countries that have the renewable energy target. She talked about meeting the test; I am interested to know which countries this is going to apply to and how.
In terms of the transparency issue, the minister says she does not know what the contracts are with these energy intensive industries, but she is giving them an exemption anyway. Surely, the due diligence of the Commonwealth should have been to establish which energy intensive industries are paying the mandatory renewable energy target to start with. No, they are not exempted—that is absolutely right—and they ought not be exempted. It has been a decision of state governments to pay it for them. It is a choice of state governments to subsidise them, which is fine if they want to do that. So why would you now exempt them into the future when their contracts are up for renewal? I just do not understand why the Commonwealth would make a decision to exempt them when they are not paying already and, essentially, will have no intention of paying.",SENATE,<title>RENEWABLE ENERGY (ELECTRICITY) AMENDMENT BILL 2009</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2009-08-20,"—In relation to the other modelling, yes, the government took all relevant modelling into consideration before making its decisions. In relation, again, to the assertion about government policy, this discussion is a bit like groundhog day. We do not make government policy on the basis of state government policy which may or may not be in place and private contracts which are commercial-in-confidence to which the Commonwealth is not a party. We make judgments about what is the best policy position from the Commonwealth’s perspective, and that is what we have done.",SENATE,<title>RENEWABLE ENERGY (ELECTRICITY) AMENDMENT BILL 2009</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Milne, Sen Christine",AG,2009-08-20,"—I hear the minister’s frustration about this debate, but the frustration is shared by the community, who want to actually have answers to these questions. It is the community who are going to pay a higher price because the government has made this decision. I note that she said that she took all relevant modelling into account. I would be interested to know specifically which modelling was taken into account in addition to the McLennan Magasanik modelling.
While we are talking about modelling, last night I read into the Hansard what Hugh Saddler had to say about the percentage of the existing renewable energy target that is taken up by solar hot water and heat pumps. He estimates that, of the existing target, it has around 24 per cent. He went on to say that he thinks it will have 20 per cent of the expanded space in renewable energy by 2020. The minister says, no, their modelling shows much less than that. I ask the minister if she would provide the modelling that shows that the assessment of Dr Saddler, who is an expert in the field, is wrong. I would be very interested in seeing that modelling.
I conclude by saying that the Greens believe the community is desperate to get renewable energy out there and expanded. They want to have that opportunity to be able to reduce carbon emissions and they are prepared to pay extra for renewable energy. But to have included in these measures the coal gas and the burning of native forests, to be giving these massive exemptions to the polluters and to refuse to rule out a windfall gain is not going to make the community feel the kind of enthusiasm in the transition to a low-carbon future that I think they would have liked to have felt. It remains to be seen, of course, as this begins to operate, what does happen to the pool prices. I think it is tragic that the review is not going to occur before 2014. If the government had accepted the Greens’ proposition, there would be a review in two years. I believe that that would have been an appropriate thing to do because I believe there are going to be a lot of outcomes that are not what the government is anticipating.",SENATE,<title>RENEWABLE ENERGY (ELECTRICITY) AMENDMENT BILL 2009</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Xenophon, Sen Nick",IND,2009-08-20,"—Very briefly, and with some reluctance, I cannot support the Greens amendments because I am concerned about the issue of the contractual arrangements in relation to the state governments. I think there is a real concern there. Whilst I understand the reservations of the Greens in respect of compensation, I think you do need to have a degree of compensation on a transitional basis to move from a high-carbon to a low-carbon economy.

I have responded on the modelling that the government took into account. Perhaps I could take on notice precisely which other modelling was considered in formulating the government’s position and see if we can provide any further information. I do not think there is anything further, except what Senator Milne asked me, that I have not already addressed.

"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2009-08-20,"—One of the core responsibilities of parliament is to scrutinise the activities and performance of executive government, in particular the way executive government spends public money. The Senate, of course, has a very particular responsibility in relation to that. We have significant responsibilities under our Constitution, and over the last 108 years the Senate practices and procedures have developed to ensure that the Senate is a very effective institution helping to hold executive government to account.
One of the core requirements for us to be able to do our job as senators in this chamber is that we can ask questions of government, and we are entitled to expect answers. We are able to ask for documents that are held by government, and we are entitled, indeed, to get access to those documents. The default position should be that, if in the context of Senate committee inquiries a question is asked of a public official or of a minister, the minister or official will answer that question or he will provide a particular document that is being asked for. That is the default position unless there is a justifiable and specified public interest ground as to why it would not be in the public interest for the minister or that public official to provide either access to that information or access to that document.
There has been a lot of confusion for the time that I have been in this place, whether it was confected confusion or real confusion, as to how some of the past procedures and principles of the Senate were to be applied in the context of Senate inquiries. Indeed, ministers have been confused, officials have been confused and chairs of Senate committees have been confused when the issue was raised that, if a minister declines to provide access to a particular piece of information then he has to, first, point to a recognised public interest ground and, second, make a statement of the reasons as to why it would not be in the public interest for that particular information to be provided.
The purpose of the motion passed by the Senate on 13 May was to set out very clearly the process to be followed by ministers and officials when they are in a position where they want to decline to provide access to information because they think that it might not be in the public interest for that information to be provided. Of course there have been over the last 108 years a number of recognised public interest grounds that have developed. I will just read them back into the record. They include that, essentially, if there is a prejudice to legal proceedings, if there is prejudice to law enforcement investigations, damage to commercial interest, unreasonable invasion of privacy, disclosure of executive council or cabinet deliberations, prejudice to national security or defence, prejudice to Australia’s international relations, and prejudice to relations between the Commonwealth and states. If there are any of these then the government may be able to claim proper public interest immunity as a reason not to provide access to a particular piece of information. The problem is that ministers and officers have continued to refuse to provide information to Senate committees without properly raising claims of public interest immunity and, indeed, chairs of Senate committees have not always been as enthusiastic as they should have been in enforcing that particular requirement.
I am just going to reflect on some of the experiences that I have had, and point to one other experience. During Senate estimates I asked an official from the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet whether advice had been provided to the Prime Minister in relation to the alcopops tax measure. I was given a number and in a particular period of time seven pieces of advice have been provided. I asked whether that advice had been part of the cabinet deliberations or whether it was routine advice to government. It was not part of the cabinet deliberations. Okay, so there was one public interest ground that was excluded. The question then was: can we have access to copies of that advice? The answer was, ‘No, it’s advice to the government,’ and the question was ultimately taken on notice. Still no answer has been provided to this day, and no reason has been given as to why it is not in the public interest for the Senate committee to be given access to that information. I asked Senator Faulkner, who supposedly is in favour of openness and transparency in government, what the recognised public interest ground was. Why is it not in the public interest for the Senate to be given access to that particular piece of advice? He was not able to point to any and he did not even try. The question arises: would it put our national security at risk? Is there an infringement, or would it prejudice legal proceedings or law enforcement investigations? Which one is it? There is not one.
Of course, I had an even worse experience with Senator Conroy. There is quite a serious issue at play, and I really urge every individual senator to reflect on this quite carefully. The Leader of the Opposition announced in his budget reply speech an alternative savings model to take the place of Labor’s broken promise on the private health insurance rebate. The Leader of the Opposition quite constructively and positively proposed instead that the excise on tobacco should be increased by 12½ per cent. Clearly the government sought advice from Treasury on that and, as part of a political exercise, that Treasury advice was released to the media on 17 May. The media spontaneously went out and reported it, and, essentially, the purpose of the government was to discredit the very constructive and positive alternative proposal made by the Leader of the Opposition. When we asked questions in Senate estimates whether we could have access, as a Senate committee, to a copy of that same advice we were told no and it was taken on notice. To this day it has not been provided. I think that is a complete disregard of the Senate. If a copy of a piece of advice can be handed to the media, what possible public interest can there be for a copy of that same piece of advice not to be provided to a Senate committee, which is there to scrutinise the activities and performance of the government, and which is there to scrutinise whether the public expenditure is appropriately effected.
I will point to one more example before concluding my remarks. Senator Coonan asked a question of Dr Ken Henry, ‘When did you first become aware of the government’s infamous $43 billion National Broadband Network plan?’ He refused to answer the question following which Senator Bushby asked, very sensibly and in complete compliance with the order passed on 13 May, whether he was claiming public interest immunity and, if so, on which ground was he basing his public interest immunity claim. Senator Bushby asked him to give us a statement of reasons. He said, ‘No, I’m not claiming public interest immunity; I’m just not answering your question,’ without giving any sort of reason whatsoever. These examples demonstrate complete arrogance. This is not the open and transparent government that we were promised by the Rudd government before the last election. This is secretive government at its worst. It is fair to say that officials are obviously being protected by senior ministers in this government. Ministers are treating this Senate and the Senate committee system with complete disregard—dare I say, with contempt. I really urge all senators to have a very close look at the report of the Procedure Committee. Clearly, it was never the expectation that a very bad culture that has become entrenched in this current government, of not wanting to reveal information, would be changed overnight. I believe that the order that we passed on 13 May will continue to do its work. Hopefully, it will over time continue to encourage officials and ministers to reflect very carefully on their obligations to be accountable to the Senate and, through the Senate, to the Australian people.
I would suggest that the Clerk of the Senate be asked, and be required, to make regular reports to the Senate on how this order operates after each Senate estimates period so we can reflect on, observe and monitor how the implementation of this particular order is progressing as we move forward. Indeed, I think these regular reports should perhaps be provided after each estimates for a period of up to five years. Hopefully, by then everyone will understand what the requirements are and everybody will understand that government should provide access to information and documents unless there is a recognised public interest ground as to why that should not be the case. I am sure that we would have significantly better government for it. Open government makes for better government; secretive government makes for bad government.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2009-08-20,"—I agree with much of what Senator Cormann has had to say on the Procedure Committee report. If he would like to present the Senate with a request for the clerk to review, after each committee sitting, those cases in which there has been a claim of public interest by ministers or others when not answering questions before Senate committees, we would look at that very favourably. The report indicates that there are de facto or real claims of public interest made quite frequently. That situation is not confined to this government. It was a hallmark of the proceedings of the last government. I think the Senate ought to take a much stronger stand to ensure that it is informed about issues and is not simply fobbed off by claims of public interest. Indeed, I do not know of any contingency whatever in a representative democracy whereby a matter should not be revealed to a Senate committee which, if necessary, goes in camera. If there is such a case which does not flout the principle of democracy representing the people in which the parliament is supreme, I would like a senator to state what it is. We are a long way short of that mark. As Senator Cormann said, we ought to be reviewing this.
When you look at the American committee system, for example, you see there is much more incisive questioning of and answering by witnesses without resort to claims of information needing to be in confidence, which we see in our parliament, and I do not think the American Congress is a paragon when it comes to that. I reiterate that in a representative democracy it is not the government or the executive but the parliament which runs the affairs of the country and the parliament cannot do that if it is denied information. Let me say that once again: it is not the executive or the cabinet but the parliament which, in our representative democracy, has the burden of running the country. Where it is denied information in its deliberations, that ideal is being eroded. Once again, if there is information that is sensitive then let the committee system resort to going in camera so that the representatives can be informed and make up their mind not without the information but while taking into consideration that they have information that should not be divulged in the public arena because it might not be in the public interest. The dividing line as to having information is not across the committee. The dividing line is between the parliament and the public, and the parliament has a very big responsibility in adjudicating where that line should be. It should not be up to a witness or a minister to arbitrate on that matter.
The second matter dealt with by this report is under the heading, ‘Senators caring for an infant’. This matter came out of Senator Hanson-Young bringing her child into a recent sitting of the Senate and being asked by the President to have the child removed. I moved that the committee look at changing paragraph (3) of standing order 175, which says that nobody else other than senators should be in the chamber. Paragraph (3) says:
(3) Paragraph (2) does not apply in respect of a senator breastfeeding an infant.
I moved that it include at the discretion of the President a senator caring for an infant briefly, providing the business of the Senate is not disrupted. We are all human beings and there is not anybody that I know of here that believes children should intrude into the business of the Senate, certainly not in any way that is going to disrupt it. But there are exceptions to every rule. We looked at the record. There are at least a dozen occasions when, with no interruption of and with no hazard to the proceedings of the House of Representatives or the Senate, children have been briefly present.
One of those times was a memorable occasion when a very esteemed and long-serving conservative senator had a grandchild with him as eulogies to his service in this place were read out. It was a very happy occasion. Well, this Procedure Committee report puts an end to that. You cannot deprive the President of an opportunity, brought forward here, which would explicitly codify the President’s right to use his or her common sense in the circumstances that occur in the chamber, to permit such an event happening again. Effectively, the committee’s decision, if it is upheld, will prohibit children being present, under any circumstances, in the chamber.
I again say that we are human beings. I think it is a bad ruling. I have had my opposition to it recorded. I am an absolute defender of the right of the Senate to not have its procedures interrupted by anybody else but that is not the case at point here. The case at point is treating each other as human beings and making sure the Presiding Officer has the facility occasionally to levy common sense, when it is not to the detriment of the Senate at all. That has been ruled down by the majority of this committee. It is a mistake, and I think we will live to regret it. I seek leave to continue my remarks at a later time.

"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2009-08-20,"—One of the core responsibilities of parliament is to scrutinise the activities and performance of executive government, in particular the way executive government spends public money. The Senate, of course, has a very particular responsibility in relation to that. We have significant responsibilities under our Constitution, and over the last 108 years the Senate practices and procedures have developed to ensure that the Senate is a very effective institution helping to hold executive government to account.
One of the core requirements for us to be able to do our job as senators in this chamber is that we can ask questions of government, and we are entitled to expect answers. We are able to ask for documents that are held by government, and we are entitled, indeed, to get access to those documents. The default position should be that, if in the context of Senate committee inquiries a question is asked of a public official or of a minister, the minister or official will answer that question or he will provide a particular document that is being asked for. That is the default position unless there is a justifiable and specified public interest ground as to why it would not be in the public interest for the minister or that public official to provide either access to that information or access to that document.
There has been a lot of confusion for the time that I have been in this place, whether it was confected confusion or real confusion, as to how some of the past procedures and principles of the Senate were to be applied in the context of Senate inquiries. Indeed, ministers have been confused, officials have been confused and chairs of Senate committees have been confused when the issue was raised that, if a minister declines to provide access to a particular piece of information then he has to, first, point to a recognised public interest ground and, second, make a statement of the reasons as to why it would not be in the public interest for that particular information to be provided.
The purpose of the motion passed by the Senate on 13 May was to set out very clearly the process to be followed by ministers and officials when they are in a position where they want to decline to provide access to information because they think that it might not be in the public interest for that information to be provided. Of course there have been over the last 108 years a number of recognised public interest grounds that have developed. I will just read them back into the record. They include that, essentially, if there is a prejudice to legal proceedings, if there is prejudice to law enforcement investigations, damage to commercial interest, unreasonable invasion of privacy, disclosure of executive council or cabinet deliberations, prejudice to national security or defence, prejudice to Australia’s international relations, and prejudice to relations between the Commonwealth and states. If there are any of these then the government may be able to claim proper public interest immunity as a reason not to provide access to a particular piece of information. The problem is that ministers and officers have continued to refuse to provide information to Senate committees without properly raising claims of public interest immunity and, indeed, chairs of Senate committees have not always been as enthusiastic as they should have been in enforcing that particular requirement.
I am just going to reflect on some of the experiences that I have had, and point to one other experience. During Senate estimates I asked an official from the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet whether advice had been provided to the Prime Minister in relation to the alcopops tax measure. I was given a number and in a particular period of time seven pieces of advice have been provided. I asked whether that advice had been part of the cabinet deliberations or whether it was routine advice to government. It was not part of the cabinet deliberations. Okay, so there was one public interest ground that was excluded. The question then was: can we have access to copies of that advice? The answer was, ‘No, it’s advice to the government,’ and the question was ultimately taken on notice. Still no answer has been provided to this day, and no reason has been given as to why it is not in the public interest for the Senate committee to be given access to that information. I asked Senator Faulkner, who supposedly is in favour of openness and transparency in government, what the recognised public interest ground was. Why is it not in the public interest for the Senate to be given access to that particular piece of advice? He was not able to point to any and he did not even try. The question arises: would it put our national security at risk? Is there an infringement, or would it prejudice legal proceedings or law enforcement investigations? Which one is it? There is not one.
Of course, I had an even worse experience with Senator Conroy. There is quite a serious issue at play, and I really urge every individual senator to reflect on this quite carefully. The Leader of the Opposition announced in his budget reply speech an alternative savings model to take the place of Labor’s broken promise on the private health insurance rebate. The Leader of the Opposition quite constructively and positively proposed instead that the excise on tobacco should be increased by 12½ per cent. Clearly the government sought advice from Treasury on that and, as part of a political exercise, that Treasury advice was released to the media on 17 May.

"Heffernan, Sen Bill",LP,2009-08-20,"—I present the final report of the Select Committee on Agricultural and Related Industries on the pricing and supply arrangements in the Australian and global fertiliser market, together with the Hansard record of proceedings and documents presented to the committee.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—by leave—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
Australian farmers were put under great pressure in the last couple of years. Some of it was due to the global bull market in fertilizer chemicals and fuel oil but some of it, as this report will show, was due to market power in Australia, a global cartel in world rock phosphate and the incapacity of on-time information to help farmers to know what the global market was doing.
There was a dramatic rise in prices in 2007-08 with an over 100 per cent increase in prices. Obviously, the farming community expressed great concern. International and demand factors were used as the reason that fertilizer prices went up so much. I was pretty amazed to go to a fertilizer industry conference and hear them bragging about how they got away with several $100-a-tonne rises that were not really justified.
In Australia the industry is dominated by two major companies, including IPL—Incitec Pivot. The ACCC ticked off the merger of Incitec and Pivot; it was probably a mistake. They have a dominant market in eastern Australia, with over 70 per cent of the market at the wholesale level and 60 per cent at the distribution level. In Western Australia the other great player is CSBP, which has a market share of two-thirds of the market. IPL has 100 per cent of the manufacture, and yet they are not considered to be a monopoly. I would have thought that that obviously demonstrates a need for more competition in the market, and that is what this report says.
Obviously, the report makes several recommendations. I will not go through the recommendations here because before I sit down I will seek leave to continue my remarks at a later time. The committee recommended that the states adopt uniform description and labelling of fertilizers. For instance, we received evidence that, over the years, when the farmer picked up his MAP or DAP or whatever it is, he took for granted that what he had in his truck is what the label says. Some evidence we received was that that is not necessarily always the case. So we recommended that there be some independent sampling taken by the states. And we think the Commonwealth should do regular sampling. The states should adopt uniform labelling.
The Commonwealth should review the provisions of the Trade Practices Act relating to restrictive practice so as to more effectively regulate anti-competitive practices and prevent abuse of market power. The ACCC gave evidence to us that market power did not count unless someone was being done over in the process. We think that plenty of people have been done over.
ABARE should publish, we recommend, international price information on fertilizer products to provide farmers with access to accurate, timely and accessible international prices. If you read the rural press in July last year you would have seen that commentators were saying, ‘Get in and buy your fertilizers now, boys and girls,’ because the price might go from what it was then for MAP/DAP—$1,400 a tonne—to $2,000 a tonne. And yet on the Bloomberg sight in July there were indications—due to a number of factors, including a dramatic price drop in the FOB price of fertilizer on the Black Sea and freight rates—that prices would fall dramatically.
Some farmers were caught badly by forward ordering. They have lost trust in the suppliers. Obviously the new management of IPL have made a commitment, which is reflected in the report, to build a better relationship with their farmers, and it is badly needed. At the time that farmers were being told to lock in at $2,000 a tonne the Bloomberg site was showing a dramatic fall at the same time. So we need to get on-time information to farmers so that they can be given a reasonable chance of understanding what a fair price is. There was obviously the withholding of evidence on the rising price the year before, where fertiliser was withheld from the market as the market rose. Even though they could see fertiliser in the shed, farmers could not access it because the industry knew the price was going up. As the price was falling they tried the opposite trick of trying to get rid of the fertiliser in their inventory; it obviously hurt some of the big companies like Elders or HiFert that they had what they called ‘expensive’ fertiliser in their pipeline and they wanted to get rid of it. In the report it is also reflected that if Australian farmers pay the global price it should be reflected by the FOB prices in the various ports around the world, and that simply is not the case.
The report reflects on the operations in Nauru of a series of companies. We received evidence—I have to say it was from the new CEO, who gave very good evidence and displayed a different culture to the committee—that 15 to 20 per cent of IPL’s rock phosphate fertiliser comes from Nauru. We received evidence that was clearly misleading in that there was a $5 million facility extended by IPL to Nauru in return for getting the works up and going, and they cut that out by buying fertiliser back at $40 a tonne, which at the time was a pretty cheap price. The shipping records, which are now tabled with the report, show that well beyond the time at which they paid the $5 million back they were still selling fertiliser to Samsung, Getax and IPL at $40 a tonne when in fact at the time IPL took the last lot at $40 a tonne the global price was $367 a tonne. According to the tables presented to the committee, over the period of the time of the report the government of Nauru missed out on $155 million from not getting the global price. That is probably something to do with the internal workings of Nauru and their incapacity to have enough resources to compete against the global cartel of places like Morocco, which seem to be able to impose their power on the market. We received evidence that 85 per cent of the rock phosphate market of the world is controlled by five entities, so there is very much a global monopoly, much the same as the oil setup.
So, there it is. We have made some serious recommendations to assist not only farmers but also the industry by trying to reflect global prices and recommending more competition in the market. We received evidence of a mine starting up east of Tennant Creek. If we can get it up it will be just as big a resource as Mt Isa. It needs 200 kilometres of railway line to hook it up to the north-south railway line. We are hoping that that infrastructure can be built. We received evidence from a company in Western Australia that is going to start up a urea plant from gasification of coal. It will produce two million tonnes of urea. Sadly, because of the financing arrangements, Australia will not get a lot of that, and I think the issue that has to be answered by everyone in this place is: if sovereign nations come in and buy Australia’s sovereign resources and then lock Australia out of access to those resources, we have a serious problem. There are indications of that happening.
Finally, before I ask for time to continue my remarks I would like to thank the hard-working committee that put this report together, especially Peter Short. I should not name any more as he is the main participant in this. The hard-working secretary and all the other girls in the secretariat have to be very patient to put up with people like me. I cause them heart attacks every second day. I am grateful for their understanding and patience. I suppose they will all have a sigh of relief now that we have got this one done.

According to the tables presented to the committee, over the period of the time of the report the government of Nauru missed out on $155 million from not getting the global price. That is probably something to do with the internal workings of Nauru and their incapacity to have enough resources to compete against the global cartel of places like Morocco, which seem to be able to impose their power on the market. We received evidence that 85 per cent of the rock phosphate market of the world is controlled by five entities, so there is very much a global monopoly, much the same as the oil setup.
So, there it is. We have made some serious recommendations to assist not only farmers but also the industry by trying to reflect global prices and recommending more competition in the market. We received evidence of a mine starting up east of Tennant Creek. If we can get it up it will be just as big a resource as Mt Isa. It needs 200 kilometres of railway line to hook it up to the north-south railway line. We are hoping that that infrastructure can be built. We received evidence from a company in Western Australia that is going to start up a urea plant from gasification of coal. It will produce two million tonnes of urea. Sadly, because of the financing arrangements, Australia will not get a lot of that, and I think the issue that has to be answered by everyone in this place is: if sovereign nations come in and buy Australia’s sovereign resources and then lock Australia out of access to those resources, we have a serious problem. There are indications of that happening.
Finally, before I ask for time to continue my remarks I would like to thank the hard-working committee that put this report together, especially Peter Short. I should not name any more as he is the main participant in this. The hard-working secretary and all the other girls in the secretariat have to be very patient to put up with people like me. I cause them heart attacks every second day. I am grateful for their understanding and patience. I suppose they will all have a sigh of relief now that we have got this one done. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2009-08-20,"—The Law and Justice (Cross Border and Other Amendments) Bill 2009 contains a range of measures relating to legal proceedings with a domestic cross-border element. Its reach also extends to New Zealand. Disputes having a connection with different states are governed by the Service and Execution of Process Act 1992. Australia also has a cooperative scheme with New Zealand for the service of subpoenae under the Evidence and Procedure (New Zealand) Act 1994. The amendments proposed by this bill are intended to provide some additional flexibility and to broaden the coverage of the existing regime.
Firstly, the bill seeks to amend the Service and Execution of Process Act to support the Cross Border Justice Scheme. This scheme is a joint initiative of the Western Australian, South Australian and Northern Territory governments and will apply initially to the border region Ngaanyatjarra Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara—or NPY—Lands in the central desert. This will allow criminal justice officials to deal with offenders from any of the participating jurisdictions, provided the offender has some connection with the region. This scheme operates under both state and Territory law, but the amendments to the Service and Execution of Process Act are necessary to ensure that the act does not override those arrangements.
Secondly, the bill seeks to amend the Service and Execution of Process Act to clarify that prisoners subpoenaed to give evidence in interstate proceedings may give evidence by audio or audiovisual link with the approval of the court. Finally, the bill seeks to amend the Evidence and Procedure (New Zealand) Act to include family law proceedings in the scheme relating to the services of subpoena between Australia and New Zealand. Family law proceedings were previously excluded at New Zealand’s request, but the New Zealand government has now passed amendments providing for their inclusion.
The latter two proposals seem to the coalition to be eminently sensible and have our support. The first proposal, that relating to the policing of the central desert region, also has the coalition’s support, but it needs to be noted that the scheme to which it applies, which is principally the responsibility of the state and Territory governments concerned, has attracted some criticism. Liberal senators on the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, which reported on this bill on 12 May, expressed some discomfort with elements of the scheme. They noted the submission of the Aboriginal Legal Rights Movement that, amongst other things, the scheme is complex, has resource implications for legal aid commissions and for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders Legal Services, has the potential to encourage forum shopping on the part of the police and has a retrospective effect. They also noted, however, these are not matters which are within the remit of this particular bill.
The need for this bill is simply to ensure that the provisions of the Service and Execution of Process Act do not override the operation of the scheme. The challenges of maintaining law and order in the central desert region are very real. The fact that the region straddles three jurisdictions can only complicate matters. Any problems with the scheme are for those jurisdictions to iron out. To the extent that the Commonwealth can lessen that burden, it ought to do so. The coalition supports the bill.",SENATE,<title>LAW AND JUSTICE (CROSS BORDER AND OTHER AMENDMENTS) BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,25,1,speech
"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2009-08-20,"—I rise to speak on the same bill, and will express some of the same concerns just raised by Senator Brandis because the Australian Greens have taken a broadly similar position. We will not be moving any amendments to this bill; we are also happy to leave it non-controversial, but I do want to make a couple of comments.
As Senator Brandis has outlined, the bill establishes a cross-border scheme between three different states which applies to the region known as the NPY Lands, covering a very large portion of Central Australia. It does not only relate to that area, and that is something that is worth pointing out. Evidence provided in the committee hearings by the Attorney-General’s Department identified for us that it generally enables state and Territory laws to operate across borders, extending the geographical area in which each jurisdiction applies, across the board to any part of Australia. So while the drafting and the timing of the bill is clearly intended to harmonise these legal processes through Central Australia, in fact there is nothing in the bill that would prevent it from applying right across the country.
State and Territory laws to allow and enable this cross-border cooperation have already been passed in WA, South Australia and the Territory. The Commonwealth bill is intended to disapply the Service and Execution of Process Act, or SEPA, if there is overlap with the states and Territory legislation. Our understanding is that this is intended to remove any complications when allowing judicial officers from any of the state jurisdictions to deal with offenders from other participating jurisdictions, provided that the offence is suspected to have taken place in the region or if the offender was arrested in the region or the offender ordinarily resides in the region. Prisoners will also be able to give evidence by audiovisual link-ups before an interstate court, authority or tribunal. There are some pluses and minuses to this. In some cases it is extremely desirable to avoid transport of prisoners across long distances. This has recently resulted in a tragedy in Western Australia when a prisoner died in transit between regional Western Australia and the city. So in some cases it is appropriate for more and easier audiovisual link-ups to be held in these matters. But also, it is potentially disadvantaging some of the people who are being prosecuted for these crimes if they are removed from the people who will be trying them.
Several submissions to the committee inquiry raised relevant and pertinent issues about how the cross-border jurisdictional laws between WA, South Australia and the Territory are actually occurring in practice over the Aboriginal people of the area. The reason I wanted to make this contribution is that in some sense their evidence and their points of view were set aside during the process of hearings, for the reason that Senator Brandis outlined—that is, they are not directly relevant to the drafting of this bill. But this bill is enabling and encouraging, from the Commonwealth’s point of view, a system that in some cases is working exceptionally poorly. I do not think it is good enough for us to say, ‘Well, that’s for the states and Territory to sort out,’ when we are playing this role and legislating in this place to make that system mesh more harmoniously. So I just wanted to put a couple of points on the record that were made to the committee on the way through in some extremely valuable submissions.
People working directly in the field of Aboriginal legal rights pointed out to us that Indigenous Australians are 13 times more likely to end up in jail than the rest of the population. That is according to an Australian National Council on Drugs report issued in June. Almost one-quarter of the male prisoners in this country are Aboriginal people. Almost one-third of female prisoners are Aboriginal women. Half of the juvenile detainees are Aboriginal. The likelihood of arrest is about 20 times greater for Aboriginal Australians than it is for non-Aboriginal Australians. This is a group of people who make up between two and three per cent of the population; these numbers are skewed vastly out of proportion! The rate of Indigenous imprisonment has almost doubled since the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. That is absolutely damning: the government took evidence from people right around the country, who took an enormous amount of time and trouble to tell their stories and to put the evidence on the table, but since that royal commission report was handed down the rate of Indigenous imprisonment has doubled. That is an indictment on our whole country. Eighty-three per cent inmates in the Northern Territory are Aboriginal people; in Western Australia it is 41 per cent.
As was evident, and I hope fairly clear, in my additional comments to the committee’s inquiry report on this bill, some of the issues raised by organisations dealing with the implications of the cross-border arrangements for Aboriginal legal rights were dismissed. The reason, we were told, is that this Commonwealth bill was not the cause of the problems; rather, the state legislation was to blame. Of course, I understand the jurisdictional issues, and Senator Brandis has just outlined that the coalition does as well. But when the Commonwealth is facilitating legal processes between states, which is what this bill does, and we have such a crisis in Aboriginal communities when it comes to law and justice, it is appropriate to take the time to recognise the reality created by the laws and police practices as they are actually occurring.
The access to justice inquiry currently being conducted by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs References Committee is revealing enormous barriers to justice for Aboriginal people. A lot of the evidence we are taking relates directly to this bill. So I hope some of the concerns raised in the course of the inquiry into this bill can be heard at the access to justice inquiry and make their way at last into government policy.
The system is effectively broken when it comes to Aboriginal people and law and justice. So much more needs fixing, beyond throwing in more police and enabling more court cases and video link-ups. That simply puts more Aboriginal people in jail. It is time that we started to look at some of the root causes of the catastrophic oversentencing and jailing of Aboriginal people in this country.",SENATE,<title>LAW AND JUSTICE (CROSS BORDER AND OTHER AMENDMENTS) BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,25,1,speech
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2009-08-20,"—Firstly, I want to thank Senator Brandis and Senator Ludlam for their contributions. The Law and Justice (Cross Border and Other Amendments) Bill 2009 comprises a range of amendments to simplify cross-border litigation. Most significantly, the bill includes amendments to support the operation of the cross-border justice system. Once operational, the scheme will make the delivery of justice services in the NPY Lands simpler and quicker. It will enable police, magistrates and other officials to deal with offenders from any of the participating jurisdictions in cases where the offender has a connection to the cross-border region.
The amendments in this bill will confirm that state and territory laws establish this scheme and have primacy over any inconsistent arrangements in the Commonwealth’s Service and Execution of Process Act 1992. The bill also includes amendments to conform the capacity of a prisoner in one Australian state or territory to give evidence by audio or audiovisual link in proceedings in another and it extends the range of subpoenas that can be served in civil proceedings between Australia and New Zealand.
The amendments in this bill will make the process for resolving legal disputes with an interstate or trans-Tasman connection simpler, quicker, cheaper and more flexible. This is consistent with the government’s broader efforts to improve access to justice for all Australians. Once again, I thank Senator Ludlam and Senator Brandis for their support and I thank all those involved in the work in support of this important reform.

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2009-08-20,"—I would like to start my comments on the Health Insurance Amendment (Extended Medicare Safety Net) Bill 2009 by articulating that the Australian Greens believe in a universal healthcare system. I think we have made that plain on a number of occasions. We believe we need to be prioritising primary health care and preventive health care. We believe that, currently, there are fundamental flaws in the way our healthcare system is funded, and I have made that plain on numerous occasions. We are particularly concerned about the way the extended Medicare safety net has operated. It has in fact encouraged excessive out-of-pocket expenses, which have necessitated this supposed fix.
While the extended Medicare safety net payments have provided some consumers with financial relief from significant out-of-pocket costs, there is compelling evidence that shows this policy measure is not working effectively. A recent study of the extended Medicare safety net by the Centre for Health Economics Research and Evaluation, CHERE, demonstrates that the extended Medicare safety net is an inflationary measure that does nothing to restore equity of health care for those most in need. It advantages those who can afford their payments upfront and encourages specialists to raise their fees.
Whilst the Greens understand the intent of the proposed changes in this bill, and we understand that it is to reduce the cost to the public purse, we are not convinced that the government’s approach will be effective. We believe this legislation is a halfway house that will address only part of the problem; in fact, it will introduce another set of inequalities.
When the extended Medicare safety net was introduced in 2004, it provided individuals and families with an additional rebate for out-of-hospital Medicare costs once an annual threshold of out-of-pocket expenses was reached. The intention was to ensure that all Australians could access specialty medical services no matter what their level of income. The government’s additional spending on the extended Medicare safety net benefits has not been matched by a drop in the out-of-pocket costs of patients.
Since its introduction, there have been concerns that the extended Medicare safety net has led providers to increase fees, thereby diluting the potential benefits to patients. Since the introduction of the extended Medicare safety net, average fees have increased by around 4.2 per cent per year, and that excludes general practice and pathology. This increase is over and above the rate of inflation, and the CHERE report estimates that the extended Medicare safety net is in fact responsible for 70 per cent of this increase. According to figures taken from the Centre for Health Economics Research and Evaluation report, between 2003 and 2008 the fees charged by obstetricians for in-hospital services reduced by six per cent while the fees charged for out-of-hospital services increased by 267 per cent. Similarly, the fees charged for ART services fell by nine per cent for in-hospital services while the fees for out-of-hospital services increased by 62 per cent. In 2007, over 30 per cent of all extended Medicare safety net benefits helped to fund obstetric services, and 22 per cent went to assisted reproductive services. The extended Medicare safety net has more than doubled the amount of Commonwealth funding for these two professional groups. Only eight per cent of the extended Medicare safety net benefits went towards funding general practice consultations.
We believe, overall, that reform is needed and is, in fact, essential. The health system is in dire need of this overhaul. We do not believe there is a doubt about that and we do not believe that there is much argument about the fact that we need some changes. Decades of fragmented policy and political expediency have resulted in little discipline with respect to financial accountability and, at best, limited attempts to contain and control some of the excessive fees charged by some medical specialists.
The Greens are committed to reducing patients’ out-of-pocket costs, but we do not believe that this particular bill is the way to go about it. This debate over the government’s proposed changes to the EMSN diverts us from the much more important discussion about how we intend to fix health care and fund healthcare costs in this country. We should do this while we have a system that we are still proud of rather than letting it go towards the situation we see in the United States, which everybody thinks is a bad way to go.
Out-of-pocket payments constitute the third largest source of health funding in Australia after federal government and state and territory government payments. They contribute over $15 billion a year to the health system, which is more than double the $6.3 billion paid, on 2005-06 figures, via private health insurance. Out-of-pocket payments constitute 17 per cent of health spending in Australia—a much higher proportion than in 13 out of 20 OECD countries, including the USA. In her recent paper on out-of-pocket expenses, Jennifer Doggett from the Centre for Policy Development wrote:
Although consumer out-of-pocket payments influence both how consumers access health care and which goods and services they access, they receive little political or policy attention.
Ms Doggett argues that the result of this policy neglect is a system of out-of-pocket payments which:
is inequitable, discriminating against consumers with certain types of health care needs or who live in particular geographic areas;
is complex, expensive to administer and confusing to both consumers and providers;
creates barriers to accessing cost-effective health care, typically imposing the highest costs on consumers when they have the least ability to pay; and
results in perverse incentives in the use of health care.
This is the real issue that we believe we should be debating today. We need to review our out-of-pocket payments, particularly for medical services and pharmaceuticals. Our out-of-pocket arrangements, including the safety net, seem to us, quite frankly, to be a mess. They are hard to understand and achieve few of the disciplines that are necessary. Some services are free. The safety net for medical expenses operates for an individual and on a calendar year basis; the safety net for pharmaceuticals is for a family and operates on a financial year basis. We believe we need to be addressing these very significant issues.
The Greens acknowledge there has been some strong support for this bill. Robert Wells, director of the Menzies Centre for Health Policy at the Australian National University, argues that this bill would address ‘some of the outrageous rorts’ under the extended Medicare safety net ‘without destroying the scheme’. The Australian Healthcare and Hospitals Association has supported the efforts to ‘reduce the opportunities for private providers to manipulate the system’. But the government have not been brave enough to do the work themselves to address the issue of out-of-pocket expenses. What they have come up with is a policy that puts the patients at the front line. The government are basically saying to patients, ‘You go and you bring down these fees.’ The government are telling people whose only hope of having children is through IVF: ‘You go and sort out the doctors who charge thousands more than they really need to. You go and tell them.’ The government are saying, ‘You go and doctor shop to find the cheapest doctor to help you get pregnant, because the market is the best way to drive prices down.’ We do not believe that is the appropriate way to deal with this issue and to deal with patients, particularly patients who are at their most vulnerable. We believe it is inappropriate for the government to say: ‘Here’s the cap, doctors; you’re not going to get more than that. Patients, go and negotiate with doctors to see how much you can drive down their fees.’ We do not believe that is appropriate. As I said, this is for patients who in many cases are at their most vulnerable.
This measure claws back $451 million over the next four years, but what about the $15 billion we are contributing as individuals or families each year to cover out-of-pocket health expenses? What about all those people struggling to make ends meet? We believe the government needs to be addressing this differently. My advice to the government comes from a member of the ophthalmologist’s lobby: ‘In dealing with the problem, this government shouldn’t be thinking about the doctors; it should be focusing on the patients.’
That is what health care is about: the patients. We know that high out-of-pocket costs are a barrier to health care, especially among lower income members of our community, and the CHERE report made the point that this leads to greater health inequities. The Greens believe that out-of-pocket payments undermine the whole basis for sharing the cost of health care because they mean that the less well-off cannot afford health care. What about those people living in rural and remote communities? We know they incur higher out-of-pocket payments than those in the cities because their costs are higher while the rebate remains the same—that is, in the fortunate communities that have access to facilities. Ross Gittins recently made the point in the Sydney Morning Herald that:
People with conditions that can be treated by GPs or in public hospitals usually incur lower out-of-pocket co-payments than those with conditions that require treatment by therapists and over-the-counter medicines.
I quote from a case study from Jennifer Doggett’s paper on out-of-pocket payments:
Michelle and Petra have the same level of income and the same capacity to pay for their health and medical care. Both women have used health and medical services over the past three years that have a value of $20,000. However, of the $20,000 of health care used by each woman, Michelle has contributed $8,000 in out-of-pocket payments and Petra has contributed only $200. This is because Michelle has rheumatoid arthritis and requires regular treatment from a physiotherapist and uses high levels of non-prescription pharmaceuticals (along with GP and specialist care). Petra’s health care needs however have primarily centred on public hospital care for the birth of her two babies, one of which required an operation shortly after birth and an extended hospital stay.
The report continues:
The current system of co-payments impacts unfairly on different consumers, depending on their health care needs. People with ongoing chronic conditions often end up receiving lower levels of subsidy for their health care than those with one-off or self-limiting conditions.
We know matters are made worse by the fact that people who are short of cash have to pay their bills upfront and then see about getting the rebate later. Ms Doggett presents us with another case study and a suggestion that might solve this problem. She suggests we look at creating a healthcare credit card that would allow low-income earners to repay the cost of their care over time without getting into financial difficulties. We do not believe this is the answer, but it may be a transitional process or a way of getting us to a better system of dealing with out-of-pocket expenses. We believe this and other ideas need intense examination so we can start dealing with this issue and bringing equity to health care. Ms Doggett’s second case study also highlights the inequities in the system:
Josh has a cycling accident and injures his back. In the first month after his accident he requires treatment from a number of health care providers, including a GP, specialist physician, exercise physiologist and osteopath. In addition to this, he requires prescription pain relief medication and undergoes a number of tests, including two MRIs. He pays for these goods and services with his health credit card with no upfront payment and therefore is able to access the care he needs immediately, despite not having sufficient savings available to meet the costs up-front. The out-of-pocket costs for this treatment total $900 and he receives a bill for this amount at the end of the month, with each individual service and its cost itemised. Josh’s monthly after-tax income is $3800 and therefore the minimum payment he is required to make for that month is $380. Josh continues to pay the remainder of his $900 bill in monthly instalments with no penalty as long as he meets the minimum payment.
By paying for health services with a health credit card, Josh is able to receive the care he requires immediately, his health care providers are paid promptly, and he is able to repay the cost of his care over time without causing him financial difficulties.
This is what I am talking about when I say we should look at practical ways to move forward in this debate. At the present we do not believe there is enough effort going to addressing situations like this. Instead of asking the patients through market forces to force down the price of the highest-setting fees, we believe we should take a different approach. We believe we should not put the onus on the patients to drive down the costs when, as I said, they are at their most vulnerable. We are talking about people who are ill and in need of medical care. No wonder there is a significant number of people—that is, 17 per cent in one study—who are skipping medical treatment, tests or follow-up because of the high costs. We have been left with an Extended Medicare Safety Net which ignores the overall problem, advantages those who can afford the upfront fees and encourages people in the medical profession—in some instances, and I am not pointing at everybody in the medical profession; I want to make that very clear—to raise their fees. It is quite clear there have been situations where elements of the medical profession and medical specialities have been encouraged to raise their fees.
The Greens cannot support this bill in its current form because we believe it is poor legislation, with poor process and debatable benefits. It is a blunt instrument used to redress what are inarguably excessive fees charged in particular areas of health care, when what is needed is a complete overhaul of the out-of-pocket contributions. There are many areas in this bill that are targeted for a cap, which will leave people worse off. This does not address the overall issue and will cause hardship to a number of people, particularly those requiring ART services. We believe the government need to outline a much more comprehensive approach to how they intend to deal with inequity and how they intend to deal with spiralling out-of-pocket expenses. We acknowledge there is a problem. The Extended Medicare Safety Net exacerbated that. Just introducing a cap on certain services does not go far enough to addressing this issue, and we do not want the government to think that it does.
The changes to the EMSN measures set out the government’s ability to introduce caps on the safety net but not the actual caps themselves. We acknowledge that. That is being done by regulation, which has been circulated. This is becoming increasingly common practice with government—that is, they leave the details of the legislation to regulation, which is then a disallowable but also blunt instrument where you can say yes or no. We are concerned that these measures will have a negative impact on access to health services for many people. We have noted in particular the impact on access to cataract surgery for people on low incomes in outer metropolitan, rural and regional areas as well as the impact on those seeking to access ART services. The cataract issue also intersects with a reduction in the service payment. We acknowledge there is a double problem there. We have called for a debate on the critical issue of out-of-pocket payments and the marginalisation of vital elements of Medicare reform. We need to look at the long term to see how we can fix our medical services and our healthcare system into the future.
We believe the process underpinning this legislation is flawed. We believe the safety net has issues and has helped drive this problem. This bill, as I said, establishes a framework to set the caps, which will be set by regulation. We believe there needs to be further consultation about how we actually address issues—for example, around ART. There is absolutely no doubt that prices have gone up, in some cases exponentially. We do not believe the blunt instrument of this bill deals with that. It does not deal with other areas of spiralling medical costs. We are concerned that if you push down here you will get an increase elsewhere.
We believe that the government needs to be very clearly outlining and articulating how they intend to deal with out-of-pocket expenses into the future. As I said, this bill does not do it and at this stage the Greens find themselves in a position where we cannot support the bill. We need a bit of framework for how we are going to be addressing spiralling out-of-pocket expenses. Until the government comes up with another way of ensuring that putting a cap on the expenses of the medical profession that does not require a patient to doctor shop, we cannot support the bill. We do not believe that that is appropriate. We do not believe it is appropriate for government to put the onus on the patient. We believe that the government should have enough guts to say to the medical profession, ‘This is not good enough,’ and to look at another way of controlling out-of-control medical expenses. Do not put the onus on the patient. When I am sick, I do not want to be negotiating with the doctor about how much I am going to pay. That is ridiculous. They need to come up with a better way of doing this. I acknowledge their attempt at doing something—we need to be doing something—but this does not get it right.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT (EXTENDED MEDICARE SAFETY NET) BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,26,1,speech
"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2009-08-20,"—I move:
At the end of the motion, add “and further consideration of the bill be an order of the day for 3 sitting days after a draft of the final regulations and determinations relating to this bill are laid on the table”.
I have moved this second reading amendment on behalf of the opposition, as well as Senators Fielding and Xenophon. The Health Insurance Amendment (Extended Medicare Safety Net) Bill 2009 is yet another Rudd government attack on the health care of Australians. Before the last election, we were promised the world by the Rudd government when it came to health. Labor had a plan to fix our hospitals and, unless enough progress was made by the middle of 2009, they would put a proposal to the Australian people that Canberra should run our hospitals. They promised that they would support the existing policy framework for private health and that they would retain the private health insurance rebates, the Medicare levy surcharge and lifetime health cover. They promised that the buck would stop with them, that there would be a new era of cooperative federalism in health and that things would improve in health.
What have we had instead? We have had broken promises and the start again of the bad old-fashioned Labor crusade against private health and against people who take additional responsibility for their own healthcare needs. We have had a review into our health and hospital system over the last 20 months, which was followed by a review into the review. We have had a tax grab. We have had a $100 million budget cut to chemotherapy treatment. And we have this measure here, which is seeking to make Australians who need to access quality health care pay the price for their reckless spending. Here we have a Rudd government which is going on cash splashes and spending spree after spending spree. And Australians needing timely and affordable access to quality health care are being asked to pay the price.
This is another ill-thought-out budget measure by the Rudd government. The Minister for Health and Ageing, instead of doing her homework, instead of standing up for what is in the best interests of Australians who need timely and affordable access to quality health care, does the bidding of Treasury. The minister is doing the bidding of a government that is out there recklessly spending cash splash after cash splash, sending money overseas, sending money into jails and giving money to dead people. But when there are people in desperate need of timely access to affordable and quality health care, they are being asked to pay the price.
We are absolutely amazed at what an absolute failure the Rudd government has been in the health portfolio. They promised the world and they have delivered nothing other than broken promises, reviews, reviews into reviews, taxes and budget cuts. This is something that fits into the category of ‘budget cuts’—ill-though-out and ill-considered budget cuts.
I will give you one example. Here we have a measure that introduces caps on payments under the Medicare safety net for a variety of medical services by putting those treatments out of the reach of a great many. One of those caps applies to IVF treatment services. In fact, out of the $451 million that the government seeks to save through this measure, $220 million relates to IVF treatment. Initially, when making the announcement and when promoting this budget cut in health, the minister said, ‘Nobody is going to be worse off.’ When asked about this a little while ago to reconfirm that guarantee—when asked whether she can confirm that nobody is going to be worse off and no family seeking access to IVF treatment is going to be worse off as a result of this measure—she was not able to. The minister was caught out. Again and again, she has been the propaganda minister for the Rudd government, talking about the need for fiscal discipline. They are spending recklessly on one side but when it comes to health, when it comes to people who need timely and affordable access to quality health care, the minister for health is out there in the media talking about fiscal responsibility and how fiscally irresponsible it would be not to do this, not to that and not to support all of these ill-thought-out budget cuts.
The government, through this measure, seeks to make savings of $450 million over four years. Not content with the attack on privately insured Australians, the Rudd government also seek to attack people in need of cataract treatment, people in need of IVF treatment and people accessing obstetric services. There is absolutely no doubt that the government did not get their figures right and that there are some serious question marks around the costings and the modelling conducted by the government.
That is why the opposition, together with Senators Xenophon and Fielding, have moved a second reading amendment that will defer further consideration of this bill such that it will be an order of the day for three sitting days after a draft of the final regulations and determinations relating to this bill are laid on the table in the Senate. We want to see the meat on the bone; we want to see the fine print. This is yet another piece of legislation which gives us generalities while we are supposed to take the government on trust: ‘Trust us. We are from the government; we are here to help. Don’t worry. The regulations are going to be fine.’ On the MBS web site, this was said in relation to the extended Medicare safety net changes:
It is important to note that these items will be restructured and the caps will change, however, the overall impact on patients should remain the same.
We are supposed to take the government on trust. The caps will change, but the impact ‘should’ be the same. Well, we will not take this government on trust. We want to see the meat on the bone. We want to see what the costings are, we want to see the modelling and we want to see the final draft of the regulations before we give further consideration to this legislation.
It is really quite extraordinary. In the lead-up to the last election anybody who listened to Mr Rudd, who is now the Prime Minister but was then the Leader of the Opposition, would have thought that Labor had a plan. Labor said they had a plan to fix public hospitals and that everything was going to improve. Do you know what? Things are worse in health today than they were when the Rudd Labor government came into government. Average waiting times for elective surgery have gone up over the last 12 months—from 34 to 36 days. The reality is that there has been absolutely no improvement.
The Prime Minister and the Minister for Health and Ageing are running 100 miles an hour away from the threat, the commitment or whatever it was—it was not a commitment, because they are running away from it now—to put to the Australian people that Canberra should take over the running of public hospitals. We have a government that is prepared to go $315 billion into debt but wants to impose a $100 million budget cut on cancer sufferers, without doing its homework, without covering its bases and without making sure that it can be practically implemented in a way that will not hurt cancer patients. It is extraordinary. The government is out there spending—sending money overseas and having cash splash after cash splash: ‘Do you want $900?’—but cancer sufferers have to pay for it. Privately insured Australians—Australians who are putting additional resources into the health system—are being asked to pay for it.
We were promised by this government that health would be a priority and now we have the Minister for Health and Ageing talking about the need for fiscal responsibility. Us questioning, scrutinising and suggesting that some of these measures are bad policy and bad legislation means that we are being fiscally irresponsible. Is that the minister for health speaking or the Assistant Treasurer, the propaganda minister for the Treasurer? I have never heard a minister for health being so concerned about fiscal responsibility while the Prime Minister and the Treasurer are sending money overseas. Cancer patients in Australia, privately insured Australians, have to pay the price. It is completely inappropriate.
There is a serious need for more scrutiny of this legislation. There is a serious need for the Senate to be able to review the final draft of the regulations before we make a final judgment. There is a serious need for us to get access to the costing, modelling and all of the information that the government has in front of it. We need an assurance that the caps that are being placed on the variety of medical services that have been mentioned are going to be those that will remain in place after this legislation has been passed.
We want to make a judgment on this legislation knowing the full story. We want to know what the government’s intentions are. We want to be able to assess what the impact on families, pensioners and Australians who need access to timely, affordable and quality health care will be before we in this chamber make an informed judgment about this legislation. That is why I, on behalf of Senator Xenophon, Senator Fielding and the opposition, have moved a second reading amendment, which I commend to all senators.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT (EXTENDED MEDICARE SAFETY NET) BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,26,1,speech
"Xenophon, Sen Nick",IND,2009-08-20,"—A lot of the decisions that we make in this place are difficult, but this is not one of them. While I understand the basis on which the government is bringing the Health Insurance Amendment (Extended Medicare Safety Net) Bill 2009 forward, I believe parts of it have been ill-considered in relation to the extended Medicare safety net and the impact it will have, in particular on couples seeking in-vitro fertilisation services.
One in six people in this country will encounter problems conceiving and need medical assistance to conceive. I think most of us know someone who has struggled to start or add to a family. In the past there was little that could be done for these families but, thankfully, science has provided options that many only dreamed of previously. While IVF can provide a solution, I am told by reproductive advocacy groups, such as ACCESS Australia, that the process is still heart wrenching and difficult. My very real concern is that this legislation will make that process all the more difficult.
According to ACCESS Australia and experts in this field, such as Dr John McBain, who is Head of Reproductive Services at Melbourne’s Royal Women’s Hospital, the government’s proposed changes to the Medicare safety net could see couples seeking IVF facing their out-of-pocket expenses increasing from around $1,000 a cycle to $3,000 a cycle. We should keep in mind that the average couple usually endures three cycles before they are able to conceive with IVF. In June I held a press conference with Dr McBain and Queensland mum Peta Clacherty, along with her two-year-old daughter, Emily, who was conceived through IVF. At the time Dr McBain said:
Infertility is not a choice. The one in six people who will need medical assistance to conceive have no control over this condition and these significant increases in the cost of treatment will make an already stressful situation for couples even more stressful.
He is right, and I do not think anybody here should be adding to the stress faced by couples at a time like that.
The government said it was changing the way funding for IVF was applied because some doctors were reportedly rorting the system. My response to that is simple: target the doctors, not the patients. If there is evidence of genuine wrongdoing, address the problem with the doctors involved, but do not punish the 40,000 Australians who access IVF services annually, some of whom are lucky enough to conceive one or more of the 11,000 babies which are born as a result.
For years we have had the baby bonus for anybody who has had a baby in this country, regardless of circumstance, and yet we have a group of Australians with specific medical needs who just want to have the chance to have a child, to add to their lives and to society and the government says to them, ‘Sorry, we can’t afford to help you.’ I do not agree. We can afford to help these couples and we must help these couples. That is why I put forward the second reading amendment that Senator Cormann moved on behalf of the coalition, Senator Fielding and myself. I do not want Australia to become the kind of country where there is IVF for the rich and infertility for the rest.
Also there are some concerns in relation to cataract surgery. Groups, such as the Council on the Ageing, have also expressed some legitimate concerns about the possible unintended consequences of this legislation. That is why I will be pressing for the second reading amendment to be passed. In the absence of that, I cannot support the second reading of this bill.

Is the minister aware of that? Has she read the media release? Will the minister also assure cement and other energy-intensive industries in Australia that any future emissions trading scheme will be designed in such a way as to avoid the additional costs and taxes on Australian industry that are not borne by competitors in other countries, such as those in South-East Asia?

Is she aware that business after business has indicated that investment in these industries would fall off with the Rudd government’s ETS? Is the minister aware, from evidence given at a Senate committee, that the three-quarters of a billion dollar Cement Australia plant in Gladstone that was to begin construction this year has also been shelved? Do you have any feeling for those working Australians in Rockhampton and Gladstone who are now without a job, to a large degree because of Labor’s incompetence in Queensland, with the increase in taxes, and your own emissions trading scheme, Minister?

"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2009-08-20,"—I thank the senator for the question. Can I say this: rather than rushing to try and use this business decision for political gain, I think it is important that we get the facts clear. The first fact, about which the government is very pleased, is that the company has indicated that the 31 employees will be offered employment elsewhere. It is also important to recall that, as a result of the global recession, published data—I think it is the Cement Industry Federation’s own data—has indicated a drop in demand for cement of some 25 per cent. I think any business operating in that kind of environment obviously has had to manage that fact imposed by the global recession.
The other fact that it is useful to put before those who want to rush to use this is that the CPRS is actually not law, because those opposite voted against it. Under the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, clinker production, which is obviously the most emissions-intensive activity in the cement-processing sector, would be eligible for some 94½ per cent of free permits. As a result of other decisions the government has made, the scheme does not commence until 2011. So the context is that the government has put forward a proposition for 94½ per cent of free permits for clinker production and we know that the global recession has imposed a 25 per cent reduction in demand in the cement sector.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Emissions Trading Scheme</title>,Questions Without Notice,27,1,answer
"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2009-08-20,"—I have read the press release. I have also read Mr Truss’s press release. As I said, the industry is eligible for 94½ per cent of free permits issued. I will give some indication, for Senator Macdonald’s edification, of the sort of cost impact that is therefore reduced. In 2011-12, under the fixed carbon price, the government’s package would reduce the carbon cost from under $8 per tonne of cement to around $1 per tonne. This is in relation to a product which I think has been identified by the industry as selling for about $120 a tonne. So the government’s policy, through the CPRS in the first year, reduces the impost from about $8 a tonne to $1 a tonne, in the context of the 2007 cement price of $120 a tonne. It is the case that in the second year there is a floating price. (Time expired)

I would remind the senator that as a result of his leader agreeing, in the context of the renewable energy target, to the CPRS assistance models, essentially the Leader of the Opposition and the opposition have today voted for exactly the same assistance models as exist under the CPRS, which are described by Mr Turnbull as being ‘appropriate protection’.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Emissions Trading Scheme</title>,Questions Without Notice,27,1,answer
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2009-08-20,"—I seek leave to incorporate further information in relation to an answer to a question by Senator Bob Brown about the treatment of women in Afghanistan.
Leave granted.
The answer read as follows—
Senator Brown asked a question with respect to the Shia Personal Status Law and its impact on the rights of Shia women. Australia and other members of the international community made our concerns known to the Government of Afghanistan when the law was first considered in March 2009.
At that time, the draft law contained a number of articles which were unacceptable as they severely undermined the rights of Shia women in violation of the Afghan Constitution, which guarantees gender equality, and also Afghanistan’s obligations as signatory of a number of international human rights agreements.
The Government therefore welcomed President Karzai’s decision to ask the Afghan Ministry of Justice to amend those articles which contravened both the Afghan Constitution and international human rights agreements.
I am advised that the revised law was gazetted on 27 July 2009. The Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission said the law was a step forward, but despite improvements, the Australian Government is concerned that the law still does not meet Afghanistan’s international human rights obligations. This concern is shared by the UK, USA and the European Union.
The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is monitoring developments in relation to this law. The Government will continue to press the Afghan Government to meet its international obligations, including respect for the equality of women before the law.
Senator Brown also asked a question with respect to the practice of men voting on behalf of women in Afghanistan.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2009-08-20,"—In sadness and anger I move:
That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Climate Change and Water (Senator Wong) to a question without notice asked by Senator Macdonald today relating to Cement Australia in Rockhampton, Queensland.
The sadness is because tonight 32 Rockhampton families will be facing the bleak prospect of unemployment, of the main breadwinner of the family being without a job. I congratulate Cement Australia for, in their announcement of the shutting of the Rockhampton plant, indicating that alternative jobs within the company will be offered and that any employee choosing not to accept an alternative job will receive their full entitlements as well as retraining assistance, if required. The jobs in other parts of Cement Australia would not be in Rockhampton, and that means 32 families will face the prospect of being unemployed or packing up all of their belongings, selling their houses and moving to a distant town.
I speak in anger because it was all so avoidable. The disaster that has befallen the cement industry in Australia was predicted in any one of the four Senate inquiries into the Rudd government’s CPRS proposal. This statement from the Cement Industry Federation Australia, which was tabled in the Senate Select Committee on Climate Policy, predicted exactly what happened. I asked Senator Wong in question time whether she bothered to read the evidence, whether she bothered to have serious negotiations with the cement industry and whether she understood what her proposal was doing to those factories and to the people employed in them. Senator Wong, of course, did not answer the question but started prattling on about clinker getting the 90 per cent assistance. The cement industry, in all of the submissions they made to the government and to Senate inquiries, said that they could get by with 90 per cent if it were for the whole industry—not just the clinker part. I am not sure if Senator Wong ever understood that. Clinker is not the cement industry; it is a part of the process. But Senator Wong and the government are so arrogant that they were not prepared to listen to the pleas of the industry.
In their submission, the Cement Industry Federation said this about the decay in the assistance—that is, the rundown in assistance after the first years. They said:
The Australian cement industry can only remain competitive if the assistance rate for EITE industries remains constant until a global scheme is implemented. The decay of the assistance rate will diminish the competitiveness of the Australian cement industry leading to the premature closure of production facilities and deter new investment which contradicts the commitment made by the—
Labor—
Government in the 2007 election campaign to not disadvantage EITE industries.
It was all predicted there. We were all told what was going to happen, regrettably, in Rockhampton today. One can only surmise that there will be other closures around Australia in the future. The industry cannot compete with this sort of taxing. It is the fear of what Labor will do that is causing the lack of investment and has caused this plant in Rockhampton to shut down today. Already, in evidence to committees, Cement Australia have told us that their $750 million new plant proposed for Gladstone would not go ahead because of investment uncertainty. This is a double blow for Rockhampton. I am not sure what the Labor member, Kirsten Livermore, is doing about it. The meat factory in Rockhampton will face the same outcome if this proposal from the Labor government goes ahead. (Time expired)

"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2009-08-20,"—It is very disappointing to hear the opposition seeking to make political points off the back of a plant closure that we all know is largely attributable to the global recession. It is not believable to try to link Cement Australia’s decision with the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme when global recession has caused a 25 per cent drop in global demand for cement.
—Why did they say it was the CPRS?
—The fact is that, under the CPRS, as I am sure Senator Macdonald knows, clinker production—which is the emissions-intensive part of the cement production chain—would be eligible not for 90 per cent free permits, as Senator Macdonald explained, but in fact, as Senator Wong explained in her answer to the question during question time, 94.5 per cent free permits with the scheme not commencing until 2011. I think it is important to remind those in the opposition of Mr Turnbull’s comments yesterday. He described the industry package as:
Appropriate protection for key energy-intensive trade-exposed industries …
Far from Senator Macdonald’s articulation of the issue—which I think was very close to misleading—if clinker production is determined to be eligible for the highest rate of EITE assistance, the government’s proposed assistance package is estimated to reduce the carbon cost associated with the production of a tonne of cement from under $8 per tonne of cement to around $1 per tonne of cement in the first year of the CPRS, in the context of a cement price of around $120 per tonne in 2007. In the second year of the CPRS a carbon cost of $20 per tonne of cement will be reduced to less than $3 per tonne of cement.
As Senator Wong said in her answer to the question, it is not believable to try and link Cement Australia’s decision with the CPRS when cement producers who sell cement for $120 per tonne will only have to pay $1 to $3 per tonne for carbon as a result of the CPRS. It is a very irresponsible and fearmongering approach to come in here and berate the government in the way that Senator Macdonald has sought to do in taking note of this answer today. More than anything else, the CPRS would provide certainty to industry. To come in here and mount an argument that it is the uncertainty that is causing these problems is the height of hypocrisy, given we saw the opposition vote against the CPRS legislation just last week.
The opposition cannot have it both ways on this issue. They cannot bleat about uncertainty when they are the creators of that uncertainty and when they, in voting against the CPRS in this place last week, denied the Australian people and Australian businesses the opportunity for certainty.
I would like to make another critical point on this matter. As Senator Macdonald and the whole of the opposition, I presume, know, the government’s modelling shows that Australian cement production will continue to grow strongly under the CPRS, with the industry roughly doubling its size by the year 2050. This is important modelling, as the opposition knows. The opposition chooses selectively, using modelling when it suits their flimsy arguments and rejecting it when it does not.
The opposition’s shallow political stunt today of trying to gain political points from and play politics with very unfortunate circumstances brings their whole outfit into great disrepute. A global economic recession is a time when we all have to be a little mature about things. We need to support the jobs of Australian workers and support the future of Australian businesses in critical infrastructure industries like the cement sector. I find it very disappointing that today we have seen Senator Macdonald—and remember that he represents part of the Queensland electorate—come in here and fly off the handle, picking and choosing the facts as he sees fit while putting forward a highly hypocritical argument in relation to the position the opposition took on the CPRS.

"Trood, Sen Russell",LP,2009-08-20,"—I hope when the government senators leave this place at the end of the day when we adjourn for a short break that they will reflect upon the way in which the government has mismanaged the agenda in this place over the last two weeks. Before the end of the day, we are likely to pass the renewable energy target bill. We are likely to do that because the opposition has been—as it has always been on these issues—prepared to engage in negotiations and constructive dialogue with the government about this particular matter. What a contrast that has been to how the CPRS has been dealt with, where, notwithstanding all the efforts that were made on behalf of the opposition to engage the government sincerely and truly with regard to its deeply flawed scheme, it has rejected our overtures. We now have a situation where we will leave this place this afternoon and we will have not passed the CPRS but in all likelihood we will have passed the RET scheme.
The people who have to accept responsibility for that failure are those in the government. They have to accept the fact that we were prepared to assist with this particular legislation. We rejected the CPRS legislation because it was a deeply flawed piece of legislation. It was a piece of legislation which would have wreaked havoc on the Australian economy. It was a piece of legislation that would have destroyed Australian jobs. It would have undermined our trade competitiveness and Australian families and Australian business would have incurred crushing burdens. We on this side of the chamber believe that we did the right thing in protecting the Australian economy. And it would have provided almost no particular assistance to the environment and would have done even less for the problem of climate change.
The cost burden is significant. Compared to other emission schemes that are in place or in prospect around the world, the costs which would have been imposed upon the Australian economy were significant. In the US, calculations have been made that the scheme might impose a per capita figure of something in the vicinity of $57. In Europe, it is only 80c. In Australia, the burden which would have been placed upon Australians if the CPRS as drafted by the government had passed would have been in the vicinity of $440 per Australian. That is a burden that no Australian should be forced to bear, particularly in the context that we are a country that emits something in the vicinity of 1.5 per cent of global emissions.
No part of the country would have borne the impact of this imposition more than my state of Queensland. It is a state which is highly decentralised. It has a decentralised population and it has a very diverse and decentralised economy. The consequence of that diversity and decentralisation is that, of all the states and territories of the Commonwealth, my state of Queensland would have felt the greatest impact. Particular industries would have suffered more so than others. I am thinking of the mining industry, where the costs are frightening. An assessment by Concept Economics suggests that if this particular CPRS had been introduced it would have cost in the vicinity of 11,400 jobs directly in Queensland by 2020. By 2030, the figure would have been in the vicinity of 34,000 jobs. That is 34,000 Queenslanders out of work as a result of a scheme which is deeply flawed and which would make no significant contribution to solving the global emissions problem. The annual loss to Queensland taxpayers would have been in the vicinity of $1.6 billion. All it would have done would have added to the significant deficit of the Queensland government.

"Furner, Sen Mark",ALP,2009-08-20,"—I rise today to also take note of the answer given during question time today about job losses at Cement Australia. To some degree I have had experience dealing with workers, as a proponent for working families. Unfortunately, in the past I have had to deal with redundancies. As an official I had to go into workplaces and resolve matters of redundancy and ensure that those workers’ conditions were protected. Those opposite only two years ago introduced Work Choices, which led to the demise of workers’ conditions, particularly the redundancy provisions in their awards and agreements.
We had someone come into the chamber today using their political advantage to claim that the closure of a plant in Rockhampton has something to do with this government’s CPRS legislation that deals with the most significant issue in history—climate change. It is extremely disappointing that somebody raised that in this chamber to capitalise on the cheap political stunts. It is interesting that Senator Ian Macdonald raised this subject.
I was part of the Senate Select Committee on Fuel and Energy that visited Gladstone on 7 April this year. Mr Ritchie, National Sustainability Manager of Cement Australia, gave evidence before the inquiry and fundamentally outlined the reasons why Cement Australia is having difficulty. I would not go so far as to say that Senator Ian Macdonald is misleading the chamber, but certainly we need to recognise some points that are relevant to this debate. The chair of that inquiry asked:
How have difficult global conditions resulting from the global economic downturn impacted on your business in Australia …
To which Mr Ritchie responded:
We have certainly seen a significant decrease in demand across our business as a whole.
That is what the problem is here. It has nothing to do with the proposed CPRS that the opposition voted down. It has to do with the global financial crisis. Cement Australia recognised that in evidence it gave to the Senate Select Committee on Fuel and Energy. That is what this closure is about. It has nothing to do with the CPRS legislation. As a participating member, I asked at that inquiry:
Have you raised these matters with the government during your numerous discussions with them over the CPRS?
Mr Ritchie’s response was:
Not so much in relation to the CPRS …
You would have thought that, if Cement Australia had a problem with the CPRS legislation, they would have raised it as a fundamental issue at that inquiry well in advance of any issues around plant closure. It is quite clear from what was raised in that inquiry and in this chamber today why workers are, unfortunately, losing their jobs—because of the global financial crisis. It has nothing to do with the CPRS, nothing whatsoever.
What is the opposition’s solution? Let us have a look at the record for some of their initiatives. The member for Tangney, Dennis Jensen, not long ago claimed that he wanted to put some sort of shadecloth in orbit. He indicated that the shadecloths could be tailor-made and adjusted according to the energy balance. This is the type of ideological position that the opposition takes in tackling the huge climate problems that this country and the world face. He was described in the Courier-Mail, a Queensland paper, as being ‘completely wacky’. These are the types of initiatives that the opposition want to introduce to deal with climate change.

"Williams, Sen John",NATS,2009-08-20,"—I rise to contribute to the debate on the closure of Cement Australia’s works at Rockhampton. In their media release they clearly say:
The Federal Government’s determination to pass the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme has meant the long term prospects for the plant have been undermined so the business has taken a decision to resolve the matter in fairness to our employees.
They say it clearly:
… the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme has meant the long term prospects for the plant have been undermined …
The cement industry is a vital industry in Australia. We have some 15 plants, employing some 1,870 people. The cement industry produces around 10 million tonnes of cement a year. We also import two million tonnes. We know that the cement industry is a large emitter of greenhouse gases—not from being a large user of electricity but simply from firing their kilns in the production of cement. In fact, in Australia we produce 0.8 of a tonne of greenhouse gases for every tonne of cement that we manufacture, so in total Australia produces eight million tonnes of greenhouse gases when manufacturing our 10 million tonnes of cement. But, as I said, two million tonnes of cement are also imported.
Let us have a look at China. China produces a massive one billion tonnes of cement a year. But here is the catch: when China produces one tonne of cement it produces 1.1 tonnes of greenhouse gases, compared to our 0.8 of a tonne of greenhouse gases. So what is the end result? It is as clear as the nose on your face. When our industry shuts down in Australia, we will import cement from China. So instead of producing eight million tonnes of greenhouse gas in Australia in manufacturing our 10 million tonnes of cement, we will import 10 million tonnes of cement from China, which will produce 11 million tonnes of greenhouse gases. That is the problem with the emissions trading scheme that is coupled with the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme that Minister Wong is proposing. We will shut down our cement industry here, lose our jobs and produce an extra three million tonnes of greenhouse gases. How farcical is that? This is what the nation faces under the proposed emissions trading scheme.
Sure there is a big discount for the cement industry—some 90-odd per cent—but as time goes on and we approach the deadline in 2020 and the targets have been met for that year, those discounts will be wound down. The permits the government will be selling will be reduced—that is how a cap-and-trade scheme works—and the industry will come under further threat. This is the huge concern we have for our cement industry.
Communities like Kandos in New South Wales rely on those jobs for their survival, their livelihoods. What happens when the plants are shut down? What do these people do? Where do they get a job? How do they pay their mortgage? How do they pay for their car? How do they clothe their children to send them off to school? This is a serious issue. Today, unfortunately, is the first piece of bad news in the cement industry, but we are going to see more of it as time goes by. The government must realise that their proposed Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme—and I hate using that term ‘carbon pollution’, because carbon is not a pollutant; if you look at the list of the 93 pollutants that exist, carbon is not mentioned—will threaten industries if they proceed with it. As I said, Cement Australia are saying that the threat of this is enough to undermine their confidence in the industry and hence has caused the closing of their plant.
What are we going to do when we shut up so many of these industries and lose these jobs? Are we simply going to import everything? What will our balance of payments figures be like then? They are just going to tag them onto the foreign debt to balance the monthly current account figures. I wish the government would reconsider the damage they are causing to industries here in Australia. We have already seen too many of our industries move overseas for reasons of cheap labour, to get the products here more cheaply. Australians cannot compete against that cheap labour, especially in Asian countries. But, no, the government are going to continue on their road. This is the start of it. Let us hope that some common sense is brought to this debate before job after job is lost in not only the cement industry but many other industries around the nation.

Government Response
Inquiry into the Sexualisation of Children in the Contemporary Media Environment
Senate Committee on Environment, Communications and the Arts
Inquiry into the sexualisation of children in the contemporary media environment
Australian Government Response to the Committee’s Report
July 2009
Introduction
The Senate Standing Committee on Environment, Communications and the Arts conducted an inquiry in early 2008 into the sexualisation of children in the contemporary media environment, including radio and television, children’s magazines, other print and advertising material and the Internet.
The Senate referred the matter of the sexualisation of children in the contemporary media environment to the Senate Committee on the 12 March 2008. The terms of reference for the inquiry covered:
the sources and beneficiaries of premature sexualisation of children in the media;
the evidence on the short- and long-term effects of viewing or buying sexualising and objectifying images and products and their influence on cognitive functioning, physical and mental health, sexuality, attitudes and beliefs; and
strategies to prevent and/or reduce the sexualisation of children in the media and the effectiveness of different approaches in ameliorating its effects, including the role of school-based sexuality and reproductive health education and change in media and advertising regulation such as the Commercial Television Industry Code of Practice and the Commercial Radio Codes of Practice.
The Committee received over 160 submissions from a wide range of interested individuals and organisations. On 26 June 2008 the Committee tabled its report to the President of the Senate. The report makes 13 recommendations, including that the Senate review the issue again in 18 months time.
The report calls on broadcasters and publishers to review their own content that is of concern (music videos that show sexualising imagery), and for publishers to consider providing reader advice on the cover of magazines indicating the presence of material that may be inappropriate for children.
In regard to children’s television, the report recommends that the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) consider revising the Children’s Television Standards to enable ‘block scheduling of children’s content, and also for broadcasters to consider establishing dedicated children’s television channels’.
The report also calls on the Advertising Standards Board (ASB) and Free TV Australia to consider establishing a media and advertising complaints clearing house.
In regard to the ASB, the report makes a number of recommendations in relation to classification of billboards and outdoor advertising, advertising to children, pre- vetting advertisements which are likely to cause offence, and the development of processes for community consultation.
The report also recommends that state and territory governments consider the introduction of comprehensive sexual health and relationships education programs into all Australian schools.

Regulation of broadcasting and images of children

Commercial television and radio services are currently provided under a co-regulatory framework that recognises the importance of ensuring that programs reflect community standards and provides a means by which the community can formally express its views to commercial broadcasters.
The Broadcasting Services Act 1992 requires sections of the commercial broadcasting industry to develop self-regulatory codes of practice to deal with the content of television and radio programs and methods for handling complaints. The Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) is responsible for overseeing the development of these codes, which include rules for prohibited content and classification guidelines for content that may be considered offensive, such as sexualised images of children.
The Commercial Television Industry Code of Practice includes classification guidelines for the broadcast of programs and advertising within particular time periods. The guidelines relate to a range of matters including adult themes, offensive language, violence, sex and nudity and are intended to be in accordance with prevailing community attitudes.
The Subscription Broadcast Television Codes of Practice also includes guidelines for the classification of programs.
The Commercial Radio Codes of Practice requires radio content to meet contemporary standards of decency having regard to the likely characteristics of the audience.
The ACMA Children’s Television Standards (CTS) also sets out rules for the quantity, classification and scheduling of children’s programming on commercial free-to-air television, including restrictions on advertising directed to children, to ensure that children have access to programming that is suited to their needs while also ensuring that children are protected from television content that is unsuitable for them.
The national broadcasters’ codes of practice reflect their legislative Charters. The ABC Code of Practice comprises a range of general program codes covering ABC policy on the portrayal of violence, language, sex and sexuality, discrimination and privacy, as well as specific codes covering children’s programs, religious and indigenous programs, the portrayal of women and the avoidance of stereotypes. The Code also covers mandatory program content warnings and program classifications, and complaints handling.
The SBS Code of Practice details SBS’s obligations concerning program classification, consumer advice and complaints handling, advertising and sponsorship. Program policies cover levels of violence, sex and nudity and the use of language, as well as particular reference to issues of prejudice, racism and discrimination.

Complaint handling

ACMA handles certain complaints about television and radio content. In the first instance, complaints about content should be submitted in writing to the relevant broadcaster within 30 days of the broadcast at issue. However, under the Broadcasting Services Act 1992, if a complaint is not answered within 60 working days of being received or satisfactorily dealt with, then the matter may be referred to the ACMA. Subscription television broadcasters have 60 days to respond. Complaints about issues covered by the Australian Content Standard and the CTS can be made in writing directly to ACMA.
A number of other issues relating to broadcasting content are not handled by ACMA. Other relevant agencies that have complaint procedures for handling broadcasting content issues include:
Australian Competition and Consumer Commission - for complaints about false, misleading and deceptive conduct in advertising;
Advertising Standards Bureau - for complaints about the decency of advertisements, whether on television, radio, Internet, print or elsewhere; and
Australian Press Council – for complaints about the print media, including articles in newspapers and magazines.
Since April 2008, decisions made by the Advertising Standards Bureau’s Advertising Standards Board in relation to complaints about advertisements may be reviewed by an Independent Reviewer.

Advertising and images of children

Under the television codes, television commercials must comply with the self- regulatory Advertiser Code of Ethics and the Code for Advertising and Marketing Communications to Children developed by the Australian Association of National Advertisers (AANA). These codes deal with the decency and social responsibility of advertisements, particularly in relation to children.
In April 2008, the AANA released a revised Code for Advertising and Marketing Communications to Children after extensive public consultation which now specifically prohibits the use of sexual imagery of children in advertising or marketing, whether in print, on television or online.
The inquiry’s report does not address the sexualisation of children in art photography. However, the Government recognises there must be a sensible approach to the allocation of public funds for arts projects which takes into account community standards.
The Australia Council, the Government’s principal arts funding body, has developed protocols in consultation with the community regarding the depiction of children in artworks, exhibitions and publications that receive Australian government funding. Adherence to these protocols will be a condition of funding for projects supported by the Australia Council and other government arts agencies. These protocols took effect from 1 January 2009.
With respect to material on the internet, at their meeting on 6 November 2008 Censorship Ministers requested the Secretary of the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General (Censorship) convey to relevant peak bodies the Ministers’ view that organisations which use images of children in advertising for commercial gain should consider developing protocols regarding the content and format of such advertisements online.

National framework for protecting Australia’s children

The Government is pursuing a broad children’s policy agenda, including the development and implementation of a National Child Protection Framework. The Government allocated $2.6 million in the 2008-09 Budget to developing the Framework, recognising that the safety and wellbeing of Australia’s children is critical. Action will focus on preventing abuse through early intervention and better integration of family services, and will drive best practice across jurisdictions and government and non-government sectors through clearer national reporting and accountability mechanisms.
The Government is leading a consultation process towards a practical, action-focused framework that makes a difference in the lives of children. Consultation is occurring with appropriate stakeholders including state and territory governments, peak organisations and non-government organisations working with children, families, out-of-home care systems and foster carers.

Recommendations and Australian Government Response


Recommendation 1

The Committee considers that the inappropriate sexualisation of children in Australia is of increasing concern. While noting the complexity of defining clear boundaries around this issue, the Committee believes that preventing the premature sexualisation of children is a significant cultural challenge. This is a community responsibility which demands action by society. In particular, the onus is on broadcasters, publishers, advertisers, retailers and manufacturers to take account of these community concerns.
Noting this heightened concern, the Committee believes that this issue should be followed up and therefore recommends that the steps taken to address it by industry bodies and others should be further considered by the Senate in 18 months time.

Australian Government Response

The Government notes this recommendation.

Recommendation 2

The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth, through the National Health and Medical Research Council or other appropriate body, commission a major longitudinal study into the effects of premature and inappropriate sexualisation of children.

Australian Government Response

The Government agrees in principle with this recommendation.
The National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) is Australia’s main health and medical research funding body, and is tasked with developing health advice for the Australian community, health professionals and governments, and providing advice on ethical behavior in health care and in the conduct of health and medical research. The NHMRC has advised that this topic falls outside the range of health and medical research that it commissions. The Government will explore other opportunities for the conduct of the proposed research.

Recommendation 3

The Committee recommends that, as part of its review of the Children’s Television Standards (CTS), the Australian Communications and Media Authority consider revising the requirement that CTS content be broadcast for at least half an hour per day to enable broadcasters to schedule it in extended blocks at times which are more likely to attract children to watch it.

Australian Government Response

The Government supports this recommendation.
ACMA’s draft Children Television Standards 2008 (CTS) were released on 27 August 2008 for public comment. The draft CTS provide licensees with an
additional flexible scheduling option for the broadcast of children’s (C) programs. While the mandatory annual quota of 260 hours per year has not changed, licensees can choose to broadcast C programs in blocks of a minimum of one hour duration and on a minimum of two days per week.
ACMA considers that giving licensees the alternative option of broadcasting C programs in minimum 60 minute blocks and on a minimum of two days per week has the potential to benefit the child audience by providing increased flexibility for broadcasters to determine how better placement of C programs could occur.
ACMA proposes to review this change after 12 months to ensure that it is not having adverse effects on the scheduling of C programs.
Consultation on the draft CTS closed on 17 October 2008 and ACMA anticipates that the CTS will be finalised in the second half 2009.

Recommendation 4

The committee recommends that broadcasters review their classification of music videos specifically with regard to sexualising imagery.

Australian Government Response

The Government notes this recommendation.
The Government believes that the classification system is intended to reflect community standards. At present, complaints statistics indicate a low level of community concern about music videos. Statistics provided to the Government by Free TV Australia show that, of all complaints received by broadcasters over the past 5 years, only 0.8% have been about a music video program. Free TV Australia has also advised that there was no level of concern raised in the 1300 submissions to the last Code review.

Recommendation 5

The Committee recommends that broadcasters consider establishing dedicated children’s television channels.

Australian Government Response

The Government notes the recommendation and has provided funding for the establishment and ongoing costs of a digital children’s channel on the ABC.

Recommendation 6

The Committee recommends that publishers consider providing reader advice, based on the Office of Film and Literature Classification systems of classifications and consumer advice, on magazine covers indicating the presence of material that may be inappropriate for children.

Australian Government Response

The Government notes this recommendation, while recognising that there would be considerable practical difficulty for publishers in implementing such a system.
The Government notes that since 1 July 2007, the Office of Film and Literature Classification has been integrated into the Attorney-General’s Department. The National Classification Scheme remains unchanged. Classification decisions are made by the independent Classification Board and Classification Review Board which are supported by a co-located secretariat comprising public servants from the Attorney-General’s Department.

Recommendation 7

The Committee recommends that, in 18 months, the Senate review the effectiveness of the operation of the Australian Association of National Advertisers’ Code for Advertising and Marketing Communications to Children, introduced in April 2008.

Australian Government Response

The Government notes this recommendation.

Recommendation 8

The Committee recommends that the Advertising Standards Board and Free TV Australia consider establishing a media and advertising complaints clearing house whose functions would be restricted to:
receiving complaints and forwarding them to the appropriate body for consideration;
advising complainants that their complaint had been forwarded to a particular organisation; and
giving complainants direct contact details and an outline of the processes of the organisation the complaint had been forwarded to.

Australian Government Response

The Government notes this recommendation, and recognises that Free TV Australia directs complaints to the appropriate broadcaster. Free TV Australia has also advised that it maintains a close working relationship with the Advertising Standards Board to enable each organisation to direct complaints to one another as necessary.

Recommendation 9

The Committee recommends that the Advertising Standards Board produce a consolidated half-yearly list of all complaints, including those received by ‘phone, where the impact of an advertisement on children, however described, is a factor in the complaint.

Australian Government Response

The Government notes this recommendation, but recognises that the Advertising Standards Board is an independent organisation.

Recommendation 10

The Committee recommends that the Advertising Standards Bureau consider adopting a process of pre-vetting advertisements either (a) at the request of the advertiser where they are concerned that the content of the material may be pushing the boundaries of the codes or (b) where an advertiser or agency has regularly produced advertising material that has been the subject of complaints.

Australian Government Response

The Government notes this recommendation. Commercial television broadcasters review all advertisements prior to them being publicly released. However, subscription broadcasters and commercial radio broadcasters do not review all advertisements prior to them being publicly released. The Government will ask ACMA to raise this with the subscription television and commercial radio broadcasters in the context of the reviews of their Codes of Practice.

Recommendation 11

The Committee recommends that, to ensure that the Advertising Standards Board is able to make determinations that are in keeping with prevailing community standards, the Advertising Standards Bureau should develop a formal schedule or process for community consultation, including the use of focus groups, and research to act as a benchmark for board determinations.

Australian Government Response

The Government notes this recommendation, but recognises that the Advertising Standards Board is an independent organisation.

Recommendation 12

The Committee recommends that the Advertising Standards Board rigorously apply standards for billboards and outdoor advertising to more closely reflect community concern about the appropriateness of sexually explicit material and the inability of parents to restrict exposure of children to such material.

Australian Government Response

The Government notes that the Advertising Standards Board is an independent organisation. Moreover, the Government recognises that the placement of billboards and other outside advertising material is within the purview of local councils and/or state government planning bodies.

Recommendation 13

The Committee recommends that state and territory governments, which have the responsibility for education, consider the introduction into all Australian schools of comprehensive sexual health and relationships education programs which are inclusive of both young people and parents, adopting a consistent national approach to the question.

Australian Government Response

This is a matter for the State and Territory Governments to consider.
Sex education is an important element in the development of young people’s life skills and supports them in making informed choices about personal relationships. Given diverse community views on this subject, the Government considers that sex education should be implemented in consultation with the school community; be respectful of religious and philosophical views; and be age appropriate.
State and Territory education authorities are responsible for the development of school curriculum, programs and resources in their respective jurisdictions. In most, if not all jurisdictions, sex education programs are currently being delivered in schools. The Government encourages jurisdictional involvement in developing a consistent approach to sex education across Australia.
Government Response
Inquiry into the Effectiveness of the Broadcasting Codes of Practice
Senate Committee on Environment, Communications and the Arts Inquiry into the effectiveness of the broadcasting codes of practice
Australian Government Response to the Committee’s Report
July 2009
Introduction
On 20 March 2008, the Senate referred the matter of the effectiveness of broadcasting codes of practice to the Standing Committee on Environment, Communications and the Arts, for inquiry and report.
The terms of reference for the inquiry covered the frequency and use of coarse and foul language (swearing) in programs; the effectiveness of the current classification standards as an accurate reflection of the content contained in the program; and the operation and effectiveness of the complaints process currently available to members of the public.
The Committee received over 80 submissions including from representatives of the television and radio industries, as well as from family and community groups and the public. On 19 June 2008 the Committee tabled its report to the President of the Senate. The report makes 20 recommendations. The recommendations cover issues relating to the: complaints process; regulatory environment; compliance process; and enforcement process.
Co-regulation of television and radio broadcasting services
Commercial television and radio services are provided under a co-regulatory legal framework that recognises the importance of ensuring that content reflects community standards and provides a means by which the community can formally express its views to commercial broadcasters.
The Broadcasting Services Act 1992 requires sections of the commercial broadcasting industry to develop self-regulatory codes of practice to deal with the content of television and radio programs and methods for handling complaints. The Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) is responsible for registering these codes.
The Commercial Television Industry Code of Practice includes classification guidelines for the broadcast of programs and advertising within particular time periods. The guidelines relate to a range of matters including adult themes, offensive language, violence, sex and nudity and are intended to be in accordance with prevailing community attitudes.
The Subscription Broadcast Television Codes of Practice also includes guidelines for the classification of programs.
The Commercial Radio Codes of Practice requires radio content to meet contemporary standards of decency having regard to the likely characteristics of the audience.
Additionally the Australian Content Standard requires minimum levels of Australian programming to be shown on commercial free-to-air television to ensure that commercial television services develop and reflect a sense of Australian identity, character and culture.
The Children’s Television Standards (CTS) also sets out rules for the quantity, classification and scheduling of children’s programming on commercial free-to-air television, including restrictions on advertising directed to children, to ensure that children have access to programming that is suited to their needs while also ensuring that children are protected from television content that is unsuitable for them.

Complaint handling

ACMA handles certain complaints about television and radio content. In the first instance, complaints about content should be submitted in writing to the relevant broadcaster within 30 days of the broadcast at issue. However, under the Broadcasting Services Act 1992, if a complaint is not answered within 60 working days of being received or satisfactorily dealt with, then the matter may be referred to the ACMA. Subscription television broadcasters have 60 days to respond. Complaints about issues covered by the Australian Content Standard and the CTS can be made in writing directly to ACMA.
A number of other issues related to broadcasting content are not handled by ACMA. Some other relevant agencies include:
Australian Competition and Consumer Commission - for complaints about false, misleading and deceptive conduct in advertising;
Advertising Standards Bureau - for complaints about the decency of advertisements, whether on television, radio, Internet, print or elsewhere; and
Australian Press Council – for complaints about the print media, including articles in newspapers and magazines.
On 27 June 2008 the Australian National Audit Office (ANAO) released a performance audit titled Regulation of Commercial Broadcasting. The audit examined whether ACMA is effectively discharging its regulatory responsibilities under the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 relating to commercial broadcasting services.
An effective complaints process is a central requirement for an effective co-regulatory environment and the ANAO audit found that the majority of broadcasting complaints have been actioned. However, both the ANAO audit report and the Senate Committee’s report highlight areas where improvements can be made.
The two reports recommend that current complaints processes should improve tracking of complaints and accept complaints via a wider range of media, including email. The timeliness of complaint resolutions was also identified as a common issue.
ACMA are currently implementing ANAO recommendations and in 2008-09 their activities included:
identification of ACMA ‘best practice’ investigations processes;
production of an investigations manual that documents best practice processes, ensuring greater consistency across the breadth and diversity of ACMA’s investigations; and
creation of an ACMA forum to promote more efficient use of resources through information-sharing across teams.

Recommendations and Australian Government Response

The Australian Government has considered the Committee’s report and is pleased to provide the following response. The Senate Committee’s recommendations are addressed in turn below.

Recommendation 1

The Committee recommends that, no later than the end of 2010, the government considers a review of ACMA, with a focus on ACMA’s role in the broadcasting co- regulatory system, to determine if ACMA is effectively working with relevant industry bodies to maintain a fair balance in Australia’s broadcast media.
Australian Government Response
The Australian Government does not support this recommendation.
The effectiveness of ACMA in discharging its regulatory responsibilities under the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 relating to commercial broadcasting services has only recently been examined by the Australian National Audit Office (ANAO). The ANAO performance audit titled Regulation of Commercial Broadcasting was released on 27 June 2008 and made a number of recommendations that ACMA has accepted and which are currently being implemented.

Recommendation 2

The Committee recommends that the provision of parental lock-out become an industry standard for digital televisions sold in Australia. The Committee also recommends that the feasibility of using datacasting to provide a more detailed description of program content and the reasons for a program’s rating which could be accessed by the viewer.

Australian Government Response

The Australian Government supports this recommendation in principle, noting that the industry standard is currently under review by Standards Australia.
The current version of the television receiver standard is the voluntary industry standard AS4933.1 – Digital television –Requirements for Receivers (Part 1: VHF/UHF DVB-T television broadcasts). The standard contains requirements in relation to the ability of a digital television receiver to act on parental guidance information and enable parental guidance program lock-out. Consumer electronics suppliers certify that high definition televisions using the industry-licensed HD Tick logo mark are compliant with AS4933. The majority of integrated digital televisions sold in Australia are reported to be compliant with the industry standard.
The use of datacasting to provide additional information on television programs is a matter for broadcasters to consider. Implementation would require the cooperation of all broadcasters to supply the relevant information, and of receiver manufacturers to ensure that receivers can use and display the data.

Recommendation 3

The Committee recommends that ACMA investigate whether the inclusion of additional age-specific symbols in the G and PG categories offer any advantages over the current system.

Australian Government Response

The Government notes this recommendation and that a consistent approach is desirable between broadcasting industry codes of practice and the National Classification Scheme. This is because of the close linkages between the codes and the Scheme. Section 123(3A) of the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 requires that, for the purpose of classifying films, television codes of practice are to apply the film classification system provided for by the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Act 1995. More generally, it is helpful for consumers that there is a degree of consistency between the classification markings used for broadcast material and those used by the National Classification Scheme.
The General (G) and Parental guidance recommended (PG) classification symbols used by the television codes of practice are consistent with the
Guidelines for the Classification of Films and Computer Games. This enables viewers to make informed choices across entertainment media on the basis of consistent symbols.
The Minister for Home Affairs will ask the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General (Censorship) to consider whether changes to the G and PG symbols would offer advantages over the current classification markings used by the National Classification Scheme. ACMA will be consulted in consideration of this issue by Censorship Ministers.

Recommendation 4

Each industry code of practice should clarify terms used for classification and consumer advice as much as is practicable (eg. ‘occasional’, ‘some’ and ‘frequent’). Codes should also contain a clear discussion on the principles for classification, such as ‘impact’, that may be used to determine a program’s classification.

Australian Government Response

The Government agrees that codes of practice should be as clear as practicable on classification matters. At the same time codes should ensure they are flexible enough to allow content classifiers to make judgements about programs taking into account the context and other features of those programs.
The terms used in the industry codes of practice to classify television content should continue to be modelled on the Guidelines for the Classification of Films and Computer Games. Any clarification of the matters that determine the classification level of content, such as ‘impact’, should therefore be considered by the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General (Censorship). The Minister for Home Affairs will ask Censorship Ministers to consider the issues raised by the Committee.
The Government will ask ACMA to consider whether clarification of the terms used for consumer advice would offer advantages for the industry codes of practice.

Recommendation 5

The Committee recommends that ACMA and Free TV Australia investigate, as part of the current review of the Commercial Television Code of Practice, the issue of the appropriateness of the current evening time zones having regard to claims of changed patterns of television usage by children.

Australian Government Response

The Government notes this recommendation, but recognises that ACMA and Free TV Australia have undertaken research in this area which supports the continuation of the current evening time zones.
Free TV Australia has advised that recent ratings data indicates that the current classification time zones reflect child and adult viewing patterns, specifically that:
from 8.30pm – 9pm, 15.0 per cent of children aged 0-17 years are viewing Free TV; and
children aged 0-17 years make up 14.0 per cent of the total viewing audience at this time.
Free TV Australia notes that while it is true that some children and teenagers may be watching television after 8.30pm, ratings data shows that the majority of the audience is made up of adult viewers who wish to see more mature programming. It also indicates that those children who are watching are largely watching with an adult (60% of 5-12 year olds between 6pm to 9pm).
ACMA’s research has shown that it is generally well-understood in the community that programming after 8.30pm is likely to be for mature audiences and that parental supervision is required at this time.

Recommendation 6

The Committee does not wish to tell television stations what they should or should not include in news and current affairs programming. However it recommends that ACMA, in consultation with broadcasters, review the sections of the Classification Code applying to news and current affairs programming, with regard to the use of graphic and disturbing imagery and excerpts from M or higher rated programs in
news and current affairs broadcasting in early evening time zones.

Australian Government Response

The Government shares the Committee’s concern not to interfere with the editorial independence of broadcasters’ news and current affairs programming.
The Government notes that there are provisions in place to ensure viewers are appropriately warned about graphic and disturbing imagery. These include the following measures:
the Commercial Television Industry Code of Practice requires prior warning to viewers when a news, current affairs, or other program which does not carry consumer advice includes material which is likely to seriously distress or seriously offend a substantial number of viewers;
the warning must precede the relevant item in a news and current affairs program and precede the program in other cases; and
such warnings must be spoken, and may also be written. They must provide an adequate indication of the nature of the material, while avoiding detail which may itself seriously distress or seriously offend viewers.

Recommendation 7

Free-to-air television stations should show the classification watermark throughout program promotion to increase viewer awareness of the classification of the program being promoted.

Australian Government Response

The Government recognises that, for some viewers, permanently visible displays on screen can obstruct, or distract from, programming.
The Government is not convinced that existing classification provisions in this area are not effective.

Recommendation 8

The Committee recommends that television broadcasters should give consideration to permanently displaying the classification symbol of a program on screen along with the letters indicating which classifiable elements are present in the program. The Committee believes that there is scope for broadcasters to place this information next to watermarks, which are now displayed by all free-to-air stations.

Australian Government Response

As noted in the response to Recommendation 7, the Government recognises that, for some viewers, permanently visible displays on screen can obstruct, or distract from, programming.
Furthermore, there is an extensive range of consumer advice provided to viewers, regarding the classification of television programming, specifically:
the classification symbol must be displayed for at least 3 seconds as close as practicable to a program’s start, as soon as practicable after each break and in any program promotion; and
clearly visible classification symbols must accompany all press advertising of programs and all program listings in program guides produced by broadcasters.
For these reasons, the Government does not support the recommendation that television broadcasters should give consideration to permanently displaying the classification symbol of a program on screen next to existing watermarks.

Recommendation 9

The electronic programming guide on digital free-to-air television stations should contain the classification of the program being viewed and the consumer advice relevant to the program.

Australian Government Response

The Government notes this recommendation, and will request that ACMA bring it to the attention of free-to-air television broadcasters. Electronic program guides (EPG) are not mandatory or subject to particular regulation about their format which is a matter for the free to air television industry to consider.
ACMA has developed a number of principles and key performance characteristics that it will look for in relation to EPGs provided by free-to-air broadcasters as part of their digital television services. One of these principles is that EPGs must include parental guidance ratings to inform families.
ACMA will monitor the performance of industry EPGs against these principles, taking them into account when considering whether to use its powers to mandate industry codes or determine industry standards for digital commercial and national television services.

Recommendation 10

The Committee recommends that ACMA, in consultation with industry bodies for radio, considers implementing the use of verbal warnings in their next codes of practice.

Australian Government Response

The Government notes this recommendation.
ACMA will raise this issue with Commercial Radio Australia within the context of the current review of the Commercial Radio Code of Practice. ACMA will give particular consideration to how verbal warnings might be employed by broadcasters as one of a number of mechanisms to ensure that listeners are not surprised by the nature of content they may be exposed to.

Recommendation 11

The Committee recommends that all free-to-air commercial television stations should maintain a log of all telephone complaints received, including a short summary of the complaint, and provide that log to Free TV Australia and ACMA.

Australian Government Response

The Government notes this recommendation and that existing arrangements provide for summary information to be provided to Free TV Australia and ACMA.
Licensees are currently required to maintain a log of telephone complaints and record their substance and bring them to the attention of key staff. Licensees are then required to report quarterly to Free TV Australia on valid written complaints. Free TV Australia is required to provide a summary of this information to ACMA within 10 workings days of receiving it.
ACMA has the discretion to seek more detailed information on complaints where it considers that this is appropriate.

Recommendation 12

All broadcasters should amend their codes of practice and website capabilities to allow viewers to make complaints about the code by email or electronically. Email and electronic complaints about code-related issues should receive the same response as a written complaint.

Australian Government Response

The Government supports this recommendation.
ACMA will raise this issue with Free TV Australia and Commercial Radio Australia within the context of the current reviews of the Commercial Television and Radio Codes of Practice, and with industry representative bodies relating to other broadcasters when appropriate.

Recommendation 13

Similarly worded complaints received by email, electronically or in writing may receive a standard written response from the broadcaster following notification to, and approval by, ACMA.
Australian Government Response
The Government supports this recommendation in part.
ACMA will raise this issue with Free TV Australia and Commercial Radio Australia within the context of the current review of the Commercial Television and Radio Codes of Practice, and with industry representative bodies relating to other broadcasters when appropriate.
ACMA notes that it is open to permitting licensees to deal with similarly worded complaints about the same broadcast with a standard written response. However, ACMA considers that prior notification to the regulator would be sufficient. Prior approval would be a departure from the approach taken under the co-regulatory framework as it could compromise the ability of broadcasters to resolve complaints promptly in the first instance without intervention by the regulator. One of the agreed objectives of the Commercial Television and Radio Codes of Practice in relation to handling complaints to licensees ‘is to ensure that licensees respond promptly to written complaints ... and make every reasonable effort to resolve them.’ If the complainant is not satisfied with the response, the matter may then be referred to the ACMA.

Recommendation 14

Codes of practice should contain a formal undertaking by broadcasters that they will direct complainants as appropriate. Industry bodies and ACMA should ensure that their staff are aware of how to re-direct complaints received in error and inform complainants where this occurs.

Australian Government Response

The Government notes this recommendation, and that the industry codes of practice contain requirements for complaint handling, including directing complainants to ACMA as appropriate.
ACMA advises that it will reiterate existing staff processes for the redirection of complaints received in error and will monitor compliance by industry with the current requirements to redirect complaints as appropriate.

Recommendation 15

The Committee recommends that, by the time of the next triennial review of free-to-air television codes of practice, broadcasters should seek to respond to all complaints received within 15 working days.

Australian Government Response

The Government notes this recommendation. The Commercial Television Code of Practice requires that complaints be responded to within 30 days. However, a broadcaster is able to respond in a shorter period if it wishes.
The Government will request that ACMA consult with the broadcasting industry on the incorporation of a shorter response period.

Recommendation 16

Each broadcaster should have a nominated complaints officer within the organisation whose sole role it is to respond to complaints. The officer should be separate from the program production and scheduling sections and from the area responsible for classifying or rating programs. Officers should receive relevant training in the appropriate code of conduct and complaint management. The contact details of the complaints officer should be published on the website of the broadcaster, industry body and ACMA.

Australian Government Response

The Government does not support this recommendation, and notes that broadcasters employ dedicated regulatory affairs staff who are responsible for coordinating responses to complaints.

Recommendation 17

Broadcasters should ensure that responses to complaints are comprehensive, deal with the substantive issue and are courteous in tone.

Australian Government Response

The Government notes this recommendation and will ask that ACMA bring it to the attention of the broadcasting industry.

Recommendation 18

ACMA should develop a practice of testing compliance with standards and codes of practice by conducting investigations into a sample of programs that may, in its opinion, raise issues with regard to the appropriateness of the classification received.

Australian Government Response

The Government does not support this recommendation as it is inconsistent with the co-regulatory framework. The co-regulatory approach to broadcasting requires broadcasters to respond, in the first instance, to complaints relating to their adherence to the industry codes of practice. Complaints may be referred to ACMA if the complainant is not satisfied with the response provided. Section 170 of the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 allows ACMA to conduct investigations where community concern is evident.

Recommendation 19

In the event that SBS or the ABC fails to comply with an ACMA recommendation within a 14 days period of receiving such a recommendation, ACMA should automatically provide a report to the Minister on the matter.

Australian Government Response

The Government notes that ACMA currently has discretion to give the Minister a written report about a failure by a national broadcaster to comply with a recommendation. The Government does not support replacing this discretion with a requirement to report to the Minister within a specified timeframe. The discretion allows ACMA to consider the circumstances of the failure to take action before giving the Minister a written report on the matter.

Recommendation 20

ACMA should limit its use of unenforceable undertakings from broadcasters in relation to a breach of the code. The second time that a broadcaster is found to be in breach of the same part of the code within the duration of its code of practice, ACMA should use its existing powers to impose additional conditions on a license of the broadcaster. In the event of subsequent breaches, ACMA should use its powers to:
Pursue a civil penalty;
Refer the matter for prosecution as an offence;
Suspend or cancel the licence; or
Impose an enforceable undertaking.

Australian Government Response

The Government does not support this recommendation.
The automatic imposition of a licence condition following a second breach of the same part of a code would be an unnecessarily inflexible approach that runs counter to the objectives of the co-regulatory framework set out in the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 (BSA). As set out below, the legislative intention is that the ACMA should use its discretion to form an opinion on the exercise of its power in relation to individual breaches, rather than be constrained by the application of inflexible rules.
Section 5 of the BSA confers on the ACMA a range of functions and powers that are to be used in a manner that, ‘in the opinion of the ACMA’, will:
produce regulatory arrangements that are stable and predictable; and
deal effectively with breaches of the legislation.
Section 5 also provides that: ‘Where it is necessary for the ACMA to use [its] powers... the Parliament intends that the ACMA [should do so] in a manner that, in the opinion of the ACMA, is commensurate with the seriousness of the breach concerned’.
The Government notes that this requires ACMA to use its enforcement powers appropriately and to identify the most effective and proportionate way of dealing with breaches. This is further reinforced in the Explanatory Memorandum to the BSA.
It [section 5] promotes the ABA’s [now ACMA’s] role as an oversighting body ... rather than as an interventionist agency hampered by rigid, detailed statutory procedures and formalities and legalism ... It is intended that the ABA [now ACMA] monitor the broadcasting industry’s performance against clear, established rules, intervene only where it has real cause for concern, and has effective redressive powers to act to correct breaches.
The automatic imposition of a licence condition runs counter to the intention of the legislation and would fetter the ACMA’s ability to exercise its discretion in assessing the most appropriate way of dealing with breaches.
The imposition of a licence condition may not necessarily be the best way to promote compliance. In practical terms, for a licence condition to be imposed under section 43 of the BSA, ACMA first needs to give the licensee written notice of its intention to impose the licence condition. The licensee must then be given a reasonable opportunity to make representations to ACMA in relation to the proposed licence condition, which ACMA must consider under natural justice principles. The proposed licence condition must be published in the Commonwealth Gazette before becoming effective. The licensee can then apply for ACMA’s decision to be reviewed by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.
In contrast, negotiated agreements offer the prospect of a practical resolution of the matter within a much sorter timeframe. For example, ACMA has on many occasions agreed measures with licensees involving action by them intended to ensure compliance problems are addressed and are effective. Such informal measures have often succeeded in improving behaviour within licensees.
Where ACMA finds that a breach of the Commercial Television Industry Code of Practice has occurred, it generally requires that the investigation report be circulated to the broadcaster’s staff, that the action leading to the breach not be repeated, and that a similar breach in the future will result in significantly heightened compliance measures.
ACMA is currently working to further improve the quality and transparency of its investigations. It is implementing the recommendations of a recently released Australian National Audit Office audit report titled Regulation of Commercial Broadcasting, including the recommendation that ACMA regularly analyse investigations information to identify any patterns or trend in non-compliance and to reduce the time taken to complete investigations.
The Government will consult with ACMA about its compliance and enforcement capabilities and consider whether there are any new or alternative measures that could be introduced in this regard.
Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration
Committee Report Additional Estimates 2008-09
Australian Government Response

Recommendation 1: The Committee recommends that the Government respond to the Standing Committee on Appropriations and Staffing reports on the ordinary annual services of government as a matter of priority.

Agreed: The Government has a clear policy to enhance budget transparency. This is set out in our Operation Sunlight policy document. Clarifying the ordinary annual services of the government is part of this policy.  The Government is considering proposals to be put to the Senate to clarify the allocation of items between appropriation bills.  It is expected that the clarification of the Compact of 1965 will address the concerns underpinning this recommendation.

Recommendation 2: The Committee recommends that the Department of Finance and Deregulation conduct briefings for members of Parliament and their staff on the implementation of Operation Sunlight. 

Agreed: The Department of Finance and Deregulation (Finance) provided briefings to Senate Committee members on 18 May 2008 and 20 May 2009, prior to the 2008-09 and 2009-10 Budget Estimates Hearings respectively.  Finance will be available to provide further briefings prior to future Estimates Hearings.

Recommendation 3: The Committee recommends that the Department of Finance and Deregulation publish, on a quarterly basis, a newsletter for members of Parliament on the progress of implementing Operation Sunlight.

Not Agreed:  The Government released the former Senator Andrew Murray’s report on Overhauling Budget Transparency in December 2008, together with the response and a revised presentation of Operation Sunlight which incorporates the agreed recommendations from the Murray report. In the response the Government committed to provide progress reports on the range of initiatives under Operation Sunlight, the initiatives that have been implemented and the effect of these changes.
This includes assisting the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit to examine Budget documents and related reporting arrangements
(Murray recommendation 34).
Together with the commitment for Finance to be available to brief Committee members prior to Estimates Hearings, this will meet the intent of this recommendation while at the same time, allowing the Government to present progress reports in the most effective and efficient manner.
Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee
Fourth Progress Report into Reforms to Australia’s Military Justice System
GOVERNMENT RESPONSE

Recommendation 1

The committee recommends that the Defence Force Discipline Act be amended to include provisions governing the conduct and protection of military jurors (paragraph 2.31).

Response


Agreed. The Government agrees that legislation should be enacted to provide for more comprehensive military jury provisions. Legislation will be introduced into Parliament this year.

Recommendation 2

The committee recommends that Defence undertake an audit of all legal officers in the ADF with a view to ensuring that the legal skills, expertise and experiences available to the ADF are being used to full advantage and to identify deficiencies that may need addressing (paragraph 2.74).

Response


Agreed. The Government has directed Defence to conduct a review of the establishments of both the permanent and Reserve forces to ascertain where legal officer positions are posted. A related audit survey is being undertaken of both the permanent and Reserve forces which reviews, by both Service and rank, qualifications (undergraduate, postgraduate and doctoral), years of experience since admission and specialist accreditations. Defence has also begun an audit of the types of legal work being undertaken by legal officers posted throughout the ADF.

Recommendation 3

The committee recommends that in 12 months, Defence report to the committee on its progress implementing reforms to improve the ADF’s investigative capability (paragraph 3.34).

Response


Substantially Agreed. A further report on the progress of the implementation of the ADF’s investigative capability reforms is agreed. However, a 2010 time frame for the report will take into account the implementation of the recommendations arising from the independent Street/Fisher review of the military justice reforms and the new structure and establishment of ADFIS recommended by a 2008 Unit Establishment Review.

Recommendation 4

The committee recommends that the government commission an independent review of the ADF’s investigative capability at the conclusion of the 5-year remediation period (paragraph 3.35).

Response


Agreed. It would be very appropriate to conduct a further independent review of the ADF investigative capability at the conclusion of the five-year remediation period in December 2011.

Recommendation 5

The committee recommends that a specific time limit, for example 90 days, be imposed on referrals of redresses of grievance to the service chiefs (paragraph 4.14).

Response


Not Agreed. The Government will not impose a time limit on referrals to the Service Chiefs, but will adopt reasonable and achievable benchmarks to ensure the timely functioning of the overall redress of grievance (ROG) system.
The Government recognises that the right to complain is a core element of the military justice system and acknowledges the legitimate expectation that grievances should be responded to expeditiously. There are, however, issues concerning Defence’s capacity to deal with applications for redress of grievance within a specified time limit, and what would happen to a complaint not finalised within that time limit.
The committee correctly identifies the primary cause of delay in ROGs referred to a Service Chief as the time taken to allocate the ROG to a case officer (due to a shortage of case officers), rather than the time taken for the inquiry itself – which currently averages about 75 work hours on a part-time basis by Reserve officers to inquire into the grievance and prepare a decision brief.
While this issue has been recognised as a problem for some years and action has been taken to address it, it remains difficult to attract and retain Reserve officers of appropriate rank who possess the suitable skills and experience to fill Reserve case officer positions. Other options have been, and are being, explored, such as remote Reserve service arrangements, civilian case officers and external service providers, but have not yet proven successful.
It should also be noted that the significantly improved performance of unit commanders in handling ROGs since mid-2006 has been achieved through the provision of more detailed advice and guidance from the case officers whose primary task is to manage ROGs referred to the Service Chiefs and the Chief of the Defence Force (CDF). In effect, this reduces the time taken at the unit level but increases it once referred to a Service Chief, due to the higher workload of case officers.
The imposition of a specified time limit on referrals of ROGs to a Service Chief also raises the question of what action should be taken upon the expiration of that time limit. The options would appear to include terminating action by the Service Chief on the grievance (thereby ceasing the member’s legislated right to a Service Chief inquiry), elevating the grievance to the CDF (which would create a new right of review for all members below the rank of chief petty officer, warrant officer class 2, or flight sergeant, and create a significant extra workload for the CDF) or forcing the member to take the complaint to the Ombudsman (again, an increased workload and the Ombudsman has no power to provide redress should a member’s grievance be found to have merit).
None of these options are in the best interests of ADF members as they simply move the resource requirement within Defence, or from Defence to the Ombudsman’s office, without providing any benefit to the member and are inconsistent with Defence’s policy of attempting to resolve all complaints at the lowest possible level.
The Government supports the implementation of benchmarks for handling ROGs rather than a time limit, but the benchmarks need to be both reasonable and achievable.
Experience over the past three years shows that an overall performance benchmark of 90 days would far exceed the current capability to process ROGs. As one of the central elements of the military justice system, the ROG process is thorough and rigorous. As such, it has a number of levels of review as well as the initial complaint handling, and these reviews inevitably add considerably to case handling time.
Under the current process, unit commanding officers have 90 days to finalise a ROG. Defence currently allocates Service Chief-level ROGs for management in accordance with the urgency of the matter under consideration. ROGs relating to ‘termination of service’ decisions, for example, are the highest priority, and for these ROGs a benchmark of 90 days is both reasonable and achievable. For lower priority matters, however, 180 days for finalisation would be a more reasonable benchmark.
A further benchmark would need to be set for those ROGs that are referred for review by the CDF. A 90-day benchmark is considered appropriate for these cases and could be applied from the time the member decides to refer the matter to CDF.

Recommendation 6

The committee recommends that the ADF commission an independent review of the learning culture in the ADF, along similar lines as the investigation conducted in 2006. The main purpose of the inquiry would be to assess whether the recommendations contained in the 2006 report have been effectively implemented and whether additional measures need to be taken to improve the learning culture in the ADF. This review should take place within five years and the report on its findings should be made public (paragraph 4.39).

Response


Agreed in Part. A learning culture assessment has been incorporated into planned regular external reviews on the health of the military justice system. The first of these has been conducted by Sir Laurence Street and Air Marshal Fisher (Retd). That review found evidence that ADF training establishments have embraced the intent and spirit espoused within the learning culture inquiry recommendations.
In addition, there are quarterly reports to the Chiefs of Service Committee on learning culture assessment. Rigorous evaluation measures are being developed to continuously monitor and provide assurance that the prevailing culture in training institutions aligns with the desired learning culture.
The Government does not support the commissioning of a further review along similar lines as the investigation conducted in 2006, given the extensive current oversight and the regular independent assessment mentioned above.

Recommendation 7

The committee recommends that the findings of Defence’s attitude survey contain a greater level of detail and analysis than that provided in the most recent publication (paragraph 4.42).

Response


Agreed in Principle. The Inspector General – Australian Defence Force (IGADF) relies on a broad range of indicators to assess the health and effectiveness of the ADF’s military justice system and the perceptions of its members, with the annual Defence Attitude Survey results being just one source element of military justice data used to inform the IGADF.
As an additional diagnostic tool, the IGADF is implementing a regime of detailed military justice feedback questionnaires targeted at ADF members with recent and actual exposure to the disciplinary and administrative complaint processes. The questionnaires will be introduced by the end of 2009.
In view of this new initiative, the practicality and necessity for the expansion of Defence Attitude Survey content and analysis will be the subject of close examination in collaboration with the agency responsible for its production.

Recommendation 8

The committee recommends that the government amend the Defence Force Discipline Act to require the Australian Military Court (AMC) to publish material such as court lists, transcripts of proceedings and judgments in a readily and easily accessible form (paragraph 5.20).

Response


Substantially Agreed. The Act will be amended to provide for the publication of the court lists, rulings, findings and sentencing remarks, subject to any non-publication orders made by a military judge.
The Government does not agree that full transcripts of proceedings should be published as a matter of course for reasons of privacy, practicality (particularly if a new trial were to be ordered) and because it is inconsistent with the practice in the civil courts.

Recommendation 9

The committee recommends that the CMJ appear before the committee to give evidence on the operation of the AMC and matters raised in the CMJ’s annual report when invited by the committee to do so (paragraph 5.30).

Response


Agreed. The Chief Military Judge is available to appear before the committee to provide evidence, on appropriate matters, when invited to do so.

Recommendation 10

The committee recommends that the Defence Act 1903 be amended to include in section 110 the requirement for the IGADF to, as soon as practicable after each 31 December, prepare and give to the Minister, for presentation to the Parliament a report relating to the functions of his office as set out in section 110C(1) (paragraph 5.59).

Response


Agreed. Action will be taken to amend section 110R of the Defence Act 1903 to include a specific requirement in future for the IGADF to prepare, as soon as practicable after 31 December each year, an annual report on the functions of his or her office to be furnished to the Minister for presentation to the Parliament.
Section 110R provides for the IGADF to prepare and give to the Chief of the Defence Force such reports on the operations of the IGADF as the CDF directs. Pursuant to this section, the IGADF prepares an annual report on the functions of his office for the CDF.
For the past three years, extracts of this report have appeared in the Justice and Fairness in Defence chapter of the Defence Annual Report. In addition, the substantive IGADF Annual Report has been made available as part of the online material associated with the Defence Annual Report 2007-08.

Recommendation 11

The committee recommends that the government consider additional measures to strengthen the independence of the IGADF using the provisions governing the CMJ and the DMP as a template (paragraph 5.61).

Response


Agreed in Part. The need for the IGADF to be able to fulfil functions in an independent manner is important and is fully supported. While this has happened in practice since the commencement of the position in 2003, both the need for, and the perception of, the IGADF being able to act independently in fulfilling the role was given legislative underpinning in 2005 by the present provisions of sections 110A-S of the Defence Act 1903 which established the position of IGADF as a statutory appointment.
The Government does not hold the committee’s view that section 110A curtails the independence of the IGADF, particularly as the Government has agreed, under recommendation 10, that the IGADF will now make available an annual report for the Minister to present to the Parliament.
However, a measure to further strengthen the perception of independent action by the IGADF will be taken by amending sub-section 110D(2) to make it clear that, where the IGADF is directed to conduct an inquiry or investigation by the CDF, he or she may cease the inquiry or investigation if he or she forms a belief that the continuation of the inquiry or investigation is not otherwise warranted, having regard to all the circumstances. An amendment to this effect would align sub-section 110D(2) with the general scheme of the rest of section 110D and will improve the perception that the IGADF can exercise an independent judgement whether to continue to inquire into a matter, including where the inquiry has been initiated by CDF direction.

Recommendation 12

The committee recommends that the regulations governing the establishment of Commissions of Inquiry (COIs) be amended to require that COIs be conducted in public except in circumstances where the president deems there to be a compelling reason for privacy. In cases where the president makes such a decision, the regulations should require the president to issue a public statement containing the reasons for this decision (paragraph 5.63).

Response


Agreed. The Government appreciates the importance of conducting Commissions of Inquiry in a way that promotes public confidence in the integrity of inquiry processes. Indeed, it is now CDF’s general practice to appoint Commissions of Inquiry as public inquiries, subject to considerations of security and the exercise of legal discretions by inquiry Presidents.
Accordingly, the Government agrees to pursue amendment to the Defence (Inquiry) Regulations to reflect the ADF’s current practice by providing that Commissions of Inquiry be appointed as public inquiries. This would be subject to the CDF having authority to close public access for reasons of security, and inquiry Presidents retaining their existing authority to restrict public access (under regulation 62). It is further agreed that CDF and inquiry Presidents, as the case may be, should issue a public statement containing the reasons for an inquiry being closed to the public.

Recommendation 13

The committee recommends that the government undertake a comprehensive consultation process on any future proposed legislation, including subordinate legislation, that is intended to make significant changes to Australia’s military justice system. The committee cites in particular the importance of consulting with the Law Council of Australia (paragraph 5.91).

Response


Agreed in Principle. The existing legislative process is rigorous. It is designed to ensure that prospective legislation is fully and publicly scrutinised and debated. As a part of this process, opportunities already exist for organisations (such as the Law Council of Australia) and individuals to make submissions on proposed legislation and established procedures allow for these submissions to be properly considered by the Parliament.
The Government acknowledges that the Law Council of Australia has made significant and influential submissions in relation to reforms to the military justice system in recent years. Furthermore, Defence has actively consulted the Law Council of Australia’s Military Justice Working Group on reforms to the Defence Force Discipline Act, most recently over significant changes to the summary authority evidentiary regime.
The Government agrees there are benefits in such consultation with the Law Council and other interested external parties on military justice matters. Notwithstanding that general statement, there is a need to maintain flexibility and discretion regarding consultation on proposed legislation. The benefits of consultation can best be achieved through appropriate non-mandatory engagement case by case. Accordingly, the Government notes that Defence will continue to informally engage with the Law Council and any other interested external stakeholders, as circumstances permit and call for, on future proposed legislation that is intended to make significant changes to Australia’s military justice system.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reports: Government Responses</title>,Committees,30,1,speech

"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2009-08-20,"—I want to make a couple of brief remarks. I initiated the inquiry of the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee into public transport on the last sitting day of last year. I am really quite pleased to see the report come to fruition, after eight or nine months of work. It is a valuable contribution to the debate on public transport and we certainly welcome it. Australian cities, with a few notable examples, are still getting by on the public transport investments that we made several generations ago. In Perth, for example, an extensive tram network was allowed to fall into disrepair in the immediate postwar years as Australian planners began to follow the North American model of low-density, car-dependent, land use planning. So of course that tram network was torn up.
In no Australian city has public transport funding really kept pace with our rapidly expanding communities. This did not happen by accident; it happened by design. While states retain the responsibility for planning decisions and shoulder a lot of the cost of transport, the Commonwealth, for many decades, has made a conscious decision to vastly favour road funding over public transport. There is nothing in the Constitution that says this should be so. The report that we are tabling today notes that in the 30 years to 2004 the Commonwealth spent $58 billion on roads, $2.2 billion on rail, much of it for freight purposes, and $1.5 billion on public transport. This is finally starting to change, and it needs to change urgently, but we have five decades of catch-up ahead of us.
The report strongly warns that funding by the Commonwealth should only be allocated to states and territories with integrated, well-planned transport and land use planning systems, which should be a trigger for some states to urgently reassess their attitudes to public transport. The report is really a shot across the bows—that there will not be any blank cheques on public transport spending coming from the Commonwealth. States and territories with coherent public transport plans and proposals will benefit, and states that retain outdated planning policies favouring freeways over public transport will miss out. We had an object lesson in this approach, as flawed as it may be and as much as we have critiqued it. Infrastructure Australia assessed the proposals that were put up by the states and territories. Western Australia, my own state, put up no coherent public transport proposal, apart from sinking the Northbridge railway line, and we got nothing. Other states and territories of course did get Commonwealth contributions.
Public transport is meaningless without land use planning that supports it so that we do not continue to strand people, many of them on very low incomes, in the far reaches of our cities. In this report, the committee agree that significant catch-up investment in public transport infrastructure is needed. Public transport competes with private transport for ridership. So instead of working out how to make it cheaper, we need to work out how to make it better. That means higher service frequencies, safe places to transfer from one service to another and designing public transport to really appeal to a much larger number of people. It will mean working very closely with planning for pedestrians and for cyclists—an essential part of making the best use of public transport in our communities. It may mean getting bicycles on buses and trains, as has been trialled in some parts of Australia. It may mean expanding the availability for people to take their pets onto public transport vehicles, subject to sensible conditions, as already occurs in many places.
The report recognises that building more roads does not alleviate congestion but rather encourages growth of traffic and entrenches patterns of urban development that creates dependence on cars, particularly in middle ring and outer metropolitan areas. The committee also notes that it would be wise for Australia to pay more attention to peak oil concerns and to adopt strong policies to reduce our oil dependence in the long term. The committee found that the CPRS alone would not have been nearly enough action for the federal government to take to deal with the rapidly rising carbon emissions from the transport sector. This is crucial. It will not be enough, when the CPRS bill returns to the Senate, for the government to argue that a carbon price—somewhere mixed in there, particularly with the fact that motorists would be shielded for a couple of years—would be enough to change behaviour. Clearly, it will not.
The committee also identifies important health benefits in this report. There is a very strong connection between car dependent life styles, inactivity and incidence of obesity. These are major public health issues to which public transport infrastructure in the urban planning field can play a major role.
The report takes a contradictory position in the executive summary at 5.4 implying that public transport remains solely the financial and planning responsibility of the states, while then going on to persuasively argue the case why this should change. The report notes that the committee ‘agrees that the demand on public transport infrastructure will continue to rise and require an expansion’. But of course it refuses to then take the next logical step to recommend that the Commonwealth allocate any funding for this task.
In the face of the evidence, which is very well presented in this report, it borders on the bizarre that the majority report does not make a clear recommendation in this regard. The risk here is that this report will join the many others in the recent past to have made similar recommendations, while state and federal governments carry on funding and building obsolete infrastructure for an age which has passed. Public transport is an import part of the post-fossil world which the Greens are committed to building. We will be working actively in the community and in parliaments around the country to make sure that the lessons learned in the course of this inquiry will actually be heeded.
I want to thank Senator Sterle from Western Australia who chaired the inquiry for the first few months and got us started. I also offer my thanks to Senator Nash for carrying it through to completion. Particularly, thanks go to the committee staff who worked extremely hard to prepare a report which I think is going to make a valuable contribution. Lastly I want to thank all the people who took time to give evidence, to write submissions, to appear before the committee, people who rang talkback radio in Adelaide and Perth—which was then accepted as evidence to the committee—the academics and the community advocates who do so much work for us in this area. I thank them on behalf of the committee. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

It will not be enough, when the CPRS bill returns to the Senate, for the government to argue that a carbon price—somewhere mixed in there, particularly with the fact that motorists would be shielded for a couple of years—would be enough to change behaviour. Clearly, it will not.
The committee also identifies important health benefits in this report. There is a very strong connection between car dependent life styles, inactivity and incidence of obesity. These are major public health issues to which public transport infrastructure in the urban planning field can play a major role.
The report takes a contradictory position in the executive summary at 5.4 implying that public transport remains solely the financial and planning responsibility of the states, while then going on to persuasively argue the case why this should change. The report notes that the committee ‘agrees that the demand on public transport infrastructure will continue to rise and require an expansion’. But of course it refuses to then take the next logical step to recommend that the Commonwealth allocate any funding for this task.
In the face of the evidence, which is very well presented in this report, it borders on the bizarre that the majority report does not make a clear recommendation in this regard. The risk here is that this report will join the many others in the recent past to have made similar recommendations, while state and federal governments carry on funding and building obsolete infrastructure for an age which has passed. Public transport is an import part of the post-fossil world which the Greens are committed to building. We will be working actively in the community and in parliaments around the country to make sure that the lessons learned in the course of this inquiry will actually be heeded.
I want to thank Senator Sterle from Western Australia who chaired the inquiry for the first few months and got us started. I also offer my thanks to Senator Nash for carrying it through to completion. Particularly, thanks go to the committee staff who worked extremely hard to prepare a report which I think is going to make a valuable contribution. Lastly I want to thank all the people who took time to give evidence, to write submissions, to appear before the committee, people who rang talkback radio in Adelaide and Perth—which was then accepted as evidence to the committee—the academics and the community advocates who do so much work for us in this area. I thank them on behalf of the committee. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

"Farrell, Sen Don",ALP,2009-08-20,"—During the past several weeks we have seen in the media the names of two of world’s most respected female freedom fighters, including the farewelling of one who did her best to help her people. I refer to two courageous women who have forged their names indelibly in the world’s history books, Aung San Suu Kyi in Burma, and the late Cory Aquino, a former president of the Philippines.
Burmese freedom fighter Aung San Suu Kyi has spent more than 14 of the past 20 years under house arrest and now, thanks to that country’s brutal and arrogant military regime, this will continue for at least another 18 months following a decision by Burmese courts on 11 August. The court handed Suu Kyi a three-year prison term for violation of an internal security law, but that was halved on the orders of the military government, which said the 64-year-old Nobel Peace Laureate could serve the time in her Yangon home. The decision has, quite rightly, brought wide condemnation from around the world.
Suu Kyi is the daughter of politically active parents. Her father, Aung San, founded the modern Burmese army and negotiated Burma’s independence from the United Kingdom in 1947 but was assassinated by his rivals in the same year. Her mother, Daw Khin Kyi, gained prominence as a political figure in the newly formed Burmese government and was appointed Burmese ambassador to India and Nepal in 1960.
Aung San Suu Kyi married Dr Michael Aris, a scholar of Tibetan culture, and the following year gave birth to their first of two sons. Sadly, Michael was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 1997 and died on his 53rd birthday, on 27 March 1999. Prior to that, Suu Kyi had returned to Burma in 1988 to tend to her ailing mother and to subsequently lead the pro-democracy movement. She was not present when her husband died overseas as by that time Suu Kyi was under house arrest and knew that even if she had left Burma the regime would not allow her to return.
On 26 August 1988, Suu Kyi addressed half a million people at a mass rally in front of the Shwedagon Pagoda in Rangoon, calling for a democratic government. However, in September the military junta took power and later that same month the National League for Democracy was formed, with Suu Kyi as general secretary. On 20 July 1989 she was placed under house arrest. Suu Kyi has been placed under house arrest on numerous occasions since she began her political career, and during these periods, she has been prevented from meeting her party supporters, international visitors including the Secretary General of the United Nations, and international media. She has appealed against her detention, and many nations and world figures, including the Pope, have continued to call for her release and that of 2,100 other political prisoners in the country.
In 1991 she was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, and to this have been added many other awards including the Mahatma Gandhi International Award for Peace and Reconciliation, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the Jawaharlal Nehru Award and Honorary Companion of the Order of Australia.
This latest saga occurred when an American man identified as John Yettaw swam across Inya Lake to her house on 3 May this year, with Suu Kyi subsequently being arrested on 13 May for violating the terms of her house arrest. There is no doubt that the court case was fabricated by the barbaric military regime to keep the charismatic Suu Kyi out of circulation ahead of next year’s polls. While Suu Kyi will spend another 18 months under house arrest, the American who caused this outrage has been freed and is now in a Bangkok hospital. The court’s decision simply reinforces the world view that the brutal Burmese military regime is made up of terrified old men who will stop at nothing to retain their hold on power.
On a brighter note, Suu Kyi, who once opposed tourism to Burma, is now encouraging it. She now believes, according to the United Kingdom newspaper the Telegraph of 14 August this year, that tourism should be encouraged:
... provided it is run through private operations and not through the government, and that visitors might help draw attention to the oppression of the people by the military junta. She has made her views known through a close acquaintance and former member of her party, the National League for Democracy (NLD).
Finally, I refer to the late Cory Aquino, who was the sixth of eight children in what was considered to be one of the richest Chinese-Mestizo families in the Philippines. Mrs Aquino was largely educated in the United States and returned to the Philippines in 1954, where she married Benigno Aquino Jr, the son of a former speaker of the national assembly, and had five children.
During her husband’s political career, Mrs Aquino remained in his shadow, although he consulted her regularly on political matters because he valued her judgments enormously. Benigno Aquino was jailed by President Marcos during the early 1970s. He was subsequently permitted to live in exile in Boston before he returned to the Philippines, without his family, on 21 August 1983 only to be assassinated on a staircase leading to the tarmac of the Manila international airport. I was actually in the Philippines at the time of the assassination. Cory Aquino and her family returned for his funeral and participated in many of the mass actions that were staged during the two years following the assassination of her husband.
When Marcos unexpectedly announced a snap presidential election to be held in February 1986, Aquino became, at first, a reluctant presidential candidate despite pleas that she was the only person who could unite the opposition against Marcos. However, clad in her trademark yellow, Cory Aquino proved to be a formidable and fearless campaigner. She vowed to dismantle the dictatorial edifice built by Marcos in his two decades in power and eliminate corruption. After protracted vote-counting marked by fraud and violence, on 16 February 1986 a rubber-stamp legislature officially proclaimed the re-election of Marcos to a new six-year term. Cory Aquino launched a civil disobedience campaign in protest. Millions of Filipinos responded and three days after the revolt began Marcos was forced to flee to the United States, where he died in 1989, and Cory Aquino took over as president.
The ouster of a dictatorship through non-violent popular protest became the model for democracy movements all over the world, and Mrs Aquino was named Time magazine’s Woman of the Year for 1986. In her six tumultuous years in office, Mrs Aquino resisted seven coup attempts or military revolts, battled a persistent communist insurgency and grappled with the effects of typhoons, floods, droughts, a major earthquake and a devastating volcanic eruption. As president, Cory Aquino also won the Eleanor Roosevelt Human Rights Award, the United Nations Silver Medal, and the Canadian International Prize for Freedom. She died on 1 August at the age of 76 after a battle with colon cancer. She was a true freedom fighter for the Philippines.
It is easy for Australians to take liberty for granted when they have never had it taken from them, but for the people of Burma and the Philippines, Aung San Suu Kyi and Cory Aquino have been courageous and determined fighters for freedom. Without them, the world would have been much the poorer.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Aung San Suu Kyi</title>,Adjournment,39,1,speech
