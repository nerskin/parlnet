Senator GALLAGHER
 (Australian Capital Territory—Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate) (10:10):  The Competition and Consumer Legislation Amendment (Small Business Access to Justice) Bill 2017 is about making sure our competition laws are better enforced by giving small business better access to justice. Labor wants to empower small business private litigants to bring litigation under part 4 of the Competition and Consumer Act without the burden of prohibitive legal fees. This bill represents a policy that we took to the last election. Since its inception the Trade Practices Act 1974, now the Competition and Consumer Act 2010, has had section 46. This is a key component of Australia's competition laws. It is designed to prevent firms with substantial market power from deliberately using that power to eliminate or substantially damage a competitor, prevent the entry of a competitor or to deter or prevent competition. Businesses have the legal right to take action under section 46 if a competitor is engaged in anticompetitive conduct. However, at the moment this is hard for small and medium-size businesses to do, even when there is a clear breach of our competition laws. We all know that the larger players have the money, the lawyers and the capacity to fight these cases. In some instances they have an incentive to drag these cases out. Even where the small business has a strong case they worry that if they lose or if they have to fold they could face huge legal bills. This means that smaller players are discouraged from taking action to enforce Australia's competition laws and, through this, they are discouraged from accessing justice.


There is a concern that there is an uneven playing field between large and small businesses in Australia. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission has taken action in this space, although it has been suggested that this is insufficient relative to the number of allegations. The issue is addressed by the Harper competition review, which found small business access to remedies to be wanting, stating:


From submissions and consultations with small business, the Panel is convinced that there are significant barriers to small business taking private action to enforce the competition laws.


This bill will address the difficulties small businesses face in getting justice under Australia's competition law. It does this by two measures. First, it allows judges in the Federal Court to waive liability for costs to small business private litigants bringing these cases. We know that all too often small businesses do not take the big end of town to task, despite the fact that they may have a strong case. This is simply because they cannot afford to risk the costs of going to court, especially when their cash flow is already tight.


We on this side of the chamber want to make sure that small and medium businesses are on the same level playing field in our justice system as big business. This bill will do exactly that. It will be up to the judge whether a no adverse costs order is warranted. This empowers the small business owner with the knowledge that they will be able to argue their case without fear of a huge legal bill at the conclusion. If the application is not approved, they can then make a decision knowing that they are proceeding at their own risk. Either way, they will have greater up-front knowledge and certainty about the impact of proceeding with the competition case.


The second element of the bill is that small businesses will be able to go to the Ombudsman to get early assistance to find out whether they should consider going for these new no adverse costs order. The legislation would allow the Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman to provide professional assistance as to whether the no adverse costs order is likely to be granted. This is to assist in the process of a private litigant requesting a no adverse costs order. While this will not be legally binding, the ombudsman will assist small businesses to better understand their prospects of successful action under the Competition and Consumer Act. The small business ombudsman, Kate Carnell has commented on this bill. She has said:


Regarding anti-competitive behaviour, the ASBFEO office remains committed to ensuring small businesses have every opportunity to compete on a level playing field. Labor's proposal regarding a 'no adverse costs order' has merit, and deserves serious consideration by all sides of politics.


This bill represents a practical change for small businesses and is in the public interest. By allowing private litigants to better bring action under the Competition and Consumer Act, anticompetitive behaviour by powerful interests will be better mitigated, helping to support Australia's competition policy framework. This is a sensible proposal to provide some support for small businesses without damaging competition in the process.


Unlike some other international jurisdictions, competition litigation in Australia is primarily by public in nature. In the United States, about 10 private cases are brought for each public case. In Australia, the ratio is about one private case for every three public cases. There are certainly a number of disincentives to bringing private litigation under the Competition and Consumer Act. The primary consideration is the potential liability of opposing costs, in the situation where an applicant loses a case. When the misuse of market power is considered, the opposing costs are likely to be large given the reliance on solicitors and barristers, as well as competition experts. Further, defendants in these types of cases tend to be both wealthy and powerful. This is distinct from litigants who, given the nature of their grievance, tend to be less powerful. We think this bill is an important step to improving competition, strengthening enforcement of our competition laws and giving small business greater access to justice. We think this is an area where enabling small and medium businesses to take action here would lead to a more competitive economy, more opportunities for small business and better outcomes for consumers.


Some have linked an effects test to this bill. Labor is opposed to the effects test. However, we know that other parties in this chamber have a different position on it. This bill is separate from the effects test. It ensures that when action is taken under Australia's competition laws, the playing field is more even between small and large businesses. I want to make it clear that this is a measure that both those in favour of the effects test and those against the effects test can support. This bill simply allows better access to competition laws for small and medium businesses. Labor certainly support strong competition policy; however, we are opposed to an effects test because we have serious concerns about its impact on competition. 'Effects test' is shorthand for a test that looks at whether conduct engaged in by a firm with a substantial degree of market power has the purpose, effect or likely effect of substantially lessening competition. This is dangerous economic policy. In our view, the effects test creates a legal risk for a business every time it seeks to lower prices for its customers. We believe that consumers are the losers under the effects test. The effects test risks making businesses afraid to compete, which ultimately, in the long run, hurts consumers.


There have been many inquiries into Australia's competition laws. Since 1974 at least 10 inquiries have considered the proposal of an effects test and have rejected it. Apart from Professor Harper's review, only one other inquiry has ever recommended it. In submissions to the Harper review, the effects test has been described as 'legally unworkable', something that 'will chill competition' and something that 'will create uncertainty for business'. We believe that it will deter investment by adding new layers of red tape and will not help competition.


We believe that this bill is a better approach to competition law, by making sure that small and medium businesses have greater access to justice, and are not discouraged from taking action under our competition laws where they have a good case. However, as I have said, the access to justice policy in this bill is distinct from the effects test. It can be supported by those in favour of the effects test—the government's position—and by those opposed to the effects test. It complements the competition laws in Australia by allowing greater access to them.


We know that small businesses make up 97 per cent of businesses in Australia and they are the engine room of the economy. They employ almost five million people and contribute in excess of $343 billion to the economy every year. This scale simply cannot be ignored. That is why we would have liked to have seen Malcolm Turnbull and Scott Morrison put more of a focus on small and medium businesses in this budget instead of focusing on the big end of town. Small businesses are crucial to Australia's economy, and the budget that we have just seen confirms that the priority for this government is very much the big end of town over those working hard to grow their businesses and to create more jobs in their communities. When small businesses receive the support they need then they are able to grow, which in turn creates jobs and allows them to contribute more to the national economy.


Unfortunately, from our point of view, this budget is a missed opportunity. It has not addressed some of the most significant issues for small business. For example, it has not addressed issues including rising energy costs, delays in payments times and the delays in the rollout of the NBN. These are issues that are consistently and constantly raised with me by small businesses across Australia. We did welcome the decision to extend for one year the small business instant asset write-off. However, we are disappointed that the government has not acted to stimulate jobs or growth or to address the all-important issue of cash flow for businesses. Waiting for payments for supplies or services delivered is debilitating for small businesses right across Australia, and this budget, from my reading of it, has made no effort to address the 'payment terms' problem exposed in the Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman's recent report into the practice.


In order to compete in a global economy, small businesses need access to high-speed internet to grow their business and sell their products. But, again, this budget provides no solutions for Malcolm Turnbull's substandard National Broadband Network. This inaction simply makes it inevitable that Australian small businesses will continue to struggle with one of the slowest and most expensive internet services in the developed world.


The budget also leaves small businesses to fend for themselves on increasing energy prices. We have seen a complete absence of leadership from the top of this government on energy policy. This has a real impact on small businesses. In the last six months it has been mentioned to me at almost every meeting I have had with small business. As the contracts that they have to enter into for the next three years or so arrive, some businesses have raised with me the prospect that their annual energy bill is going from, say, $20,000 a year to $90,000 a year. I do not know how the government expects small businesses to absorb that kind of increase in a year. There is no response to this from the government. The lack of any consistent national policy, move to an emissions intensity scheme or investment certainty that is required around renewables is a policy void that is impacting on small businesses. They are raising it with me. They are extremely concerned and they want to see a response from the government, and it was absent in this year's budget. Wholesale power prices have doubled under this budget, and it looks like small businesses and households will continue to have to pay the price for this government's head-in-the-sand approach to delivering a national energy policy.


This bill before us today is all about levelling the playing field when it comes to access to justice for small business. We have consulted on this bill. It was a policy that we took to the last election. My predecessor in this position, Michelle Rowland, consulted heavily on this with a range of small-business stakeholders. Since taking up this portfolio, I too have met with not just industry associations but small and medium business owners themselves to talk through Labor's policy in this regard.


I have to say that, at the small business level, the effects test itself has not been raised with me as a top priority. On the issue of creating a level playing field—this perception, rightly, and wrongly at times perhaps, that small business does not get treated fairly is certainly one that is alive and thriving in the small business community, and I think there is a lot of merit to that argument. There is no doubt that small businesses want to see some improvements to the legislation around creating a level playing field, and the feedback that we have got from stakeholders of this bill supports it. Even those stakeholders who support the effects test also want to see this legislation get through; they see it as complementary too. And, for those that support an effects test, it is not necessarily an either/or scenario. We believe that this is the best way to go, and we do not support an effects test, which is why we have developed this legislation to deal with the issue of a level playing field and have that debate here.


Certainly, small businesses think access to justice is a difficulty for them, as well as the affordability of access to justice, which is why this bill goes particularly to that point. Many have raised with me examples of where they would have considered pursuing legal action or just taking legal advice, but the costs of that and the risks to their business resulted in them deciding to just cop it, ignore it or move on. That is exactly what this bill tries to address.


There have been very concerning stories around small-business loans, for example, This has come up across my portfolio into financial services, and small-business loans are something that I think we need to do further work on. We note that there is an initiative in the budget around a streamlined complaints mechanism which will allow small-business complaints, particularly about their loan arrangements, to be considered. We are having a look at the detail of that over the next few days and we will have some questions about it at estimates. 


But there is no doubt that there have been some extremely concerning stories about small businesses doing all the right things, meeting their loan obligations, making all their repayments, and then quite unfairly losing their businesses because of the actions of particular banks. I have spent a fair bit of time with people who have gone from being extremely successful business owners with long histories in the business community, with good records as employers and as contributors to the community, to having the rug essentially pulled out from under them—through, seemingly, no fault of their own—and having to refinance their loans or having their loans called in, and it has absolutely crippled them. In some instances, it has bankrupted them. Not only has the bank taken their business; it has taken their house. It has taken their super. In some instances, the banks have taken everything and left them destitute. We saw another example of that on 60 Minutes on Sunday night, with the case of the Maloneys. 


I think as parliamentary leaders of the country we must look at every way we can make sure that small-business owners are not placed in that position, because there should be protections there, or, if they are, that there are protections provided to get a fair hearing, to be treated fairly at all times and to make sure that, if it gets to the point where there is a dispute, that dispute is heard quickly and, where able, there is compensation for harm that is caused. The Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman has looked into this and made some comments on it. This is something that we need to pursue further. Of course, our position would be around a banking royal commission, but what I am saying in terms of running alongside this bill is that there are other ways that we need to look at making sure that small business is being given a fair go. We cannot take our eye off the ball. This does one thing, but there are many other ways that we need to support small businesses and make sure that they are treated fairly, treated with respect, and that their contribution to the community is acknowledged and they are not treated badly, particularly by the banks.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2017-05-11,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (10:30):  I am pleased that the Labor Party—at least their rhetoric—is about giving small business a fair go. I applaud that stated aim. I am pleased that Senator Gallagher, who has introduced this bill, has talked to small business in Canberra—one of the most privileged cities in Australia, I might add, and good luck to them—but I wonder how many small businesses Senator Gallagher has spoken to in Rockhampton, Mackay, Ayr—where I live—Townsville, Charters Towers, Clermont, the Bowen Basin towns, Dysart and Moranbah. I wonder how many small businesses she has spoken to there, because, if she had spoken to small business there, she would understand they are really struggling because of the downturn in the mining industry and the relentless campaign by the Greens to stop coalmining—a campaign which seems to be supported in this chamber by Labor senators and, I am disappointed to say, Labor senators from Queensland.


Small business in the towns that I mentioned in my home state of Queensland are desperate to see the Adani mine go ahead, and the only thing holding it up at the moment is the uncertainty on the native title issue, which has been addressed by the government and by Indigenous leaders across Australia. Agreement has been reached to fix that issue, but it is essential that it be done urgently and immediately, which is what Indigenous leaders want and what the Queensland state Labor government wants. If the native title issue were made certain, Adani could go ahead with more confidence and small businesses in those northern towns would be delighted because it would be a lifeline thrown to many of them who are now looking at their life savings and their small business going down the drain. So, Senator Gallagher, I urge you, if you are serious about small business, to slip up to Central and North Queensland, talk to small businesses there and see how important Adani is to them.


The government has asked the Labor Party to sit tomorrow, on a Friday. I appreciate that is a holiday for most Labor senators. We just want them to give up one day of their holiday and sit tomorrow in this chamber so that we can fully debate the native title amendment and hopefully have it passed, because the Labor Party say they support it. Certainly, the Liberal and National parties support it. I understand One Nation supports it and I understand that the Liberal Democrats support it. So it should fly through the chamber if we have a whole day's debate on it tomorrow. Will the Labor Party sit and pass that legislation, which will help Adani, which will help small business, which Senator Gallagher has spent 20 minutes telling us she supports? Will they sit tomorrow? No—tomorrow is their day off. They have a long weekend. They do not want to work tomorrow. One can only ask why. Clearly, within the Labor Party there are deep divisions over the Adani issue and the Labor Party are doing everything in their power to delay this so that Adani will walk away and the mine will not go ahead. Could I ask Senator Gallagher again: what will that do for small business in Rockhampton, Gladstone, Clermont, Moranbah, Dysart, Ayr, Bowen, Home Hill, Townsville and Charters Towers? They are looking to Adani to save their businesses.


It is not only the Labor government in Queensland that is very keen to see this happen; Labor mayors of Townsville, Rockhampton and Gladstone are also urging that this native title issue be made certain so that Adani can go ahead and small business will be able to look to a bright future. I hope Mayor Strelow, the Townsville mayor and Mr Burnett in Gladstone—Labor mayors—will be on the phone to Labor Queensland senators saying, 'Please give up a day of your long weekend and sit tomorrow so that we can pass this legislation, so that we can give certainty to the native title owners in that area, who desperately want to see this go ahead.' Why? Because it means jobs for their people. They understand this. That is why they have, by an overwhelming majority, already supported this. It is very important for Indigenous businessmen, and there are a number of very good Indigenous small-business people in North Queensland. They are looking to the Adani project to give their small businesses a boost. But what does the Labor Party do? It takes a day off tomorrow when we could be dealing with the native title legislation and having it passed through this parliament.


Again I plead with Premier Palaszczuk: 'If you are serious'—and I think you are because I know your government desperately needs the revenue from Adani—'please give your Queensland Labor senators'—and there are only four of them so it will not cost you a lot of money in phone calls—'a call and tell them Queensland is desperate for this.' Remember, the Senate is the states house. Labor senators from Queensland should be standing up for their state. This is not a Liberal-National Party person saying this; this is the Labor Premier of the state of Queensland desperately wanting this passed, and yet the Labor Party senators in this chamber want to ensure they have a long weekend by having tomorrow off.


I am pleased that the Labor Party are talking about helping small business, but the example I have just given clearly is like so much the Labor Party do: it is not what they say—talk is cheap; it is what they do. All those small businesses in my home state of Queensland are desperately awaiting this, and what do the Labor Party do? They turn their back on them. I appreciate that Labor has no senators outside the south-east corner of Queensland and their small business minister comes from Canberra, but I urge Queensland Labor senators to get out of the south-east corner and I urge the shadow minister to get out of Canberra and talk to small businesses in those areas and see what they say about Adani and the native title thing. If you were serious in your job, you would do something to make sure that that goes through.


The government on Tuesday night announced a budget that will set the growth in the years ahead in a positive way for Australians. In this budget the government has continued the very substantial concessions to small business in last year's budget. If the Labor Party want to help small business, they will do two things: (1) allow the Adani bill to pass through the parliament tomorrow, by sitting an extra day, and (2) support the budget legislation when it comes forward. As we all know, the Labor Party have not been very good at passing budget measures in the past, but we do ask them to support the extended instant asset write-off that was announced in the budget on Tuesday night. The budget extends the $20,000 instant asset write-off for a further 12 months to 30 June 2018. The turnover threshold will also be lifted to $10 million. This measure will substantially improve the cash flow for small business, helping them reinvest in their businesses, replace or upgrade their assets and employ more people.


The Turnbull government has also committed budgeted money—budgeted money, as opposed to what you will hear from Mr Shorten tonight, who will throw around promises of money without paying for those promises; he will no doubt put it on the big credit card that Labor is very good at operating—to reduce red tape by providing up to $300 million to states and territories to remove unnecessary regulatory barriers. This builds upon the $5.8 billion of red tape reductions delivered by the coalition government.


While I am on this subject, I divert slightly to the low-value GST bill which is currently before the parliament and on which the committee has reported with some comments by the chair. It is a committee on which the government has a majority, but that does not stop us Liberal and National Party senators from criticising or making suggestions to government legislation where we think it appropriate. Senators may have read where the government majority committee unanimously has recommended that the starting date of that bill be delayed by one year to allow agencies and businesses to get ready for it.


The committee also raised an issue in the context of small business and having the shippers actually collect the new tax on goods under $1,000 rather than the vendors, for many reasons which I will not go into here. But I think the government has a different view—although the committee is seeking clarification of this—in that, because the shippers already collect the money for goods over $1,000, why can't they do it under for goods under $1,000? That is a question that the committee has raised, and I look forward to the government explaining that. It seems to me that it would be better to continue in the same vein. I only mention this because I think any senators who go and talk to small businesses outside Canberra will understand that small businesses have been doing it tough in the face of competition from overseas suppliers of goods.


You can understand why buying your goods online overseas is attractive to many Australians, because they do not have to pay the 10 per cent GST. They can get the same goods from the shop downtown, but they would have to pay the 10 per cent GST. Whether you like the GST or not, it is there and it is part of Australian life these days. But, if you buy overseas, your overseas competitor does not have to bother about that 10 per cent. So, for a start, the overseas competitor can sell the goods at 10 per cent less. The low-value GST bill is a way in which the coalition is trying to help small businesses.


I walk around many towns in Central and North Queensland and it is really distressing to see the number of closed shops and to think that many people have put their life savings into these small businesses and they have gone bust. There is a lifeline in Queensland, and that is called Adani. That must go ahead for many reasons but certainly small business in those areas would be delighted to see that happen. I just cannot understand why the Labor Party will not sit tomorrow so that we can debate the Native Title Amendment (Indigenous Land Use Agreements) Bill, which is the last real hurdle holding up Adani going ahead. If we could deal with that tomorrow—the Labor Party say they agree, One Nation agrees and the Liberal Democrats agree—we could get that bill through, Adani could have confidence to go ahead, and small business in central and north Queensland would be delighted. But we cannot get the Labor Party to sit tomorrow—I don't know, they might be used to three-day weekends! But please, why don't we sit tomorrow? You have paid for it, and we could deal with that bill, debate it fully, and hopefully get it passed.


If anyone happens to be listening to this debate and they happen to be from Queensland—and they will understand just how important this is to Queensland, particularly to Queensland's small businesses—then I would ask them to get on the phone and ring the four Queensland Labor senators. There are only four of them; it will not cost you much in telephone costs. But get on the phone to them. It might be a trunk-line call because they are all in Brisbane, and if you do not happen to live in Brisbane there might be a little bit of extra cost, but there are only four of them. Get on the phone to them and say: 'This is important for small business in Queensland, this is important for Indigenous small business in Queensland and this is important for Indigenous workers in Queensland.' It is important for all workers. It will mean 10,000 new jobs in an area which is currently struggling with substantial unemployment following the mining downturn a couple of years ago.


This bill, the Competition and Consumer Legislation Amendment (Small Business Access to Justice) Bill 2017, will not really do anything for small business—




Senator Gallagher:
  That is not what they told me!




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  I am sorry Senator Gallagher; perhaps they do not understand that what you are doing is encouraging more litigation. As a former lawyer, I tell you that if you start on litigation, the only people that will win are the lawyers. Yet this is what the Labor Party is doing; perhaps these days they have a lot of lawyers who are members of their party. That might be why they think it is a good idea.


The government has embarked on another course which we think will help small business. One of the provisions of this bill obliges the Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman to provide legal advice on the prospect of obtaining an order of no costs. That is not good public policy—we should not have government agencies giving legal advice of that nature. If a party took up litigation on the basis of such advice from the ombudsman, and if the courts did not grant this order in their favour, can the party withdraw from the litigation without cost penalty? It is also not clear what liability the ombudsman's office would have for providing legal advice which turned out not to be accepted by the court. So there are a lot of flaws in this bill; unfortunately, time does not allow me to go through all of them.


The government is trying to help small business by giving confidence to the Adani mine, which will really help small business. We are also bringing in tax cuts whereby 3.2 million small businesses will pay less tax as of this current financial year, and more small businesses will be able to access small business tax concessions as a result of the change to the definition of small business, raising the threshold from $2 million to $10 million. Those tax cuts were legislated for in May this year, and that will really help small business. We are reforming the competition policy, as suggested in the Harper review in section 46 on the misuse of market power; we are levelling the playing field for small business, to encourage competition and greater productivity; and we have extended the unfair contract term protections to small business entering standard form contracts—that provision commenced in November last year.


It is no good for Labor to bring forward these bills which they know will not be passed. It is no good for Mr Shorten to get up tonight and promise money he does not have. If they want to help small business, Labor need to support the government's proposals for small business in the back tax—and please, can I ask the Labor Party: if you are serious about small business, sit tomorrow! Curtail your long weekend, and do what you are paid to do: come into this chamber tomorrow and debate this, so that we can get this bill through. It not only benefits Adani, workers and Indigenous people, it also benefits the steel mill in Whyalla—I cannot understand why any South Australian senator would oppose that.

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",NXT,2017-05-11,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (10:50):  I will not be lectured by Senator Macdonald on the issue of supporting Australian industry and Australian steel—



Senator Ian Macdonald interjecting—




Senator XENOPHON:
  Every time Senator Macdonald opens his mouth on this, it is extremely unhelpful. I am one of the few people in this chamber who actually genuinely likes Senator Macdonald—




Senator Dastyari:
  Shame!




Senator XENOPHON:
  No; I acknowledge his long contribution and his advocacy for the people of Queensland, and I do have genuine respect for him. But if he was fair dinkum about the issue of the steel industry and about government procurement—the federal government did not commit yesterday unequivocally to use Australian steel in the billions of dollars they will be spending on rail in this country. They did not commit to that. Instead, we hear all these protectionist arguments.


Every steel contract is important. But, in the totality of what is occurring in the Australian steel industry, there are a whole range of measures: weak anti-dumping laws, and weak laws when it comes to procurement—which have been dealt with to some significant degree by the changes in procurement laws that my colleagues and I negotiated with the finance minister a number of months ago. But we need to—




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  Why won't you support Adani then?




Senator XENOPHON:
   Mr Acting Deputy President, that is very unhelpful in relation to this. As much as I genuinely like Senator Macdonald, that is not helpful.


This Labor bill, the Competition and Consumer Legislation Amendment (Small Business Access to Justice) Bill, is about access to justice. My colleagues and I wholeheartedly support this bill. The intent of this bill is to do something about the chronic lack of access to justice in this country when it comes to dealing with disputes, particularly commercial disputes. As I have done before, I disclose that I am the proprietor of a very, very small law firm with 2.6 lawyers working in it, where we do principally personal injuries work and a bit of commercial work. From my time as a practising lawyer—and I still have a practising certificate, so that I can do my pro bono work in gambling cases and the like—I know that the justice system in this country is broken when it comes to access to justice. There are so many people in this country who have a genuine dispute and who are told by their lawyers: 'You have a 70 or 80 per cent chance of winning.' But they still will not go ahead with that case because of the risk of adverse cost orders which could cause them to lose their home.


But it goes beyond that. There is an independent supermarket proprietor—I will not name that person—who is very successful; he has a significant turnover and employs many, many people in more than one state. He tells me that if Coles and Woolies do something, whether it is predatory pricing or some other conduct, which his lawyers say could lead to a successful action for abuse of market power—under our current laws—his lawyers tell him: 'You have a really good chance of winning. But, by the way, it is going to cost you $3 or $4 million to run it, and you could be up for adverse cost orders of millions of dollars more.' That is not a justice system.


We know what the Productivity Commission said back in September 2014 when they looked at access to justice arrangements. They said:


There are widespread concerns that Australia's civil justice system is too slow, too expensive and too adversarial.


That goes to the nub of the problem that this bill seeks to address. We know what has happened in other countries, including in the UK. My understanding is that this bill picks up on elements of best practice, so that we can have a system where there are filters and safeguards in place before an action is brought, to deal with frivolous and vexatious actions; a system where you need to show that you have a prima facie case where you have a matter that has got real merit in it but that is subject to dispute.


Getting rid of adverse cost orders will not mean that it is going to be a pushover to deal with these cases, but it will mean that at least parties will know what they are up for in terms of their own costs. It will mean that they will not be subject to being 'deep-pocketed' by a much larger corporation that can drive the litigant, the plaintiff, into the ground. This bill attempts to address that. The bill, in terms of the specific provisions, may need some fine-tuning, may need some extra work done to it, but the principle of the bill that has been introduced here by Senator Gallagher is a very good one. That is why we support it.


Can I also say, on behalf of my colleagues, that we also support, with some amendments, the 'effects test' that the government is putting up, in the Competition and Consumer Amendment (Misuse of Market Power) Bill 2016. It is something that the Nationals have been outspoken on and something that I have worked on for many years with people like former Senator Joyce, now the Deputy Prime Minister. We think that will make a real difference for those small and medium businesses in disputes involving large corporations which abuse their market power. But we think that that bill will be so much more effective, will do what it is meant to do, if it incorporates the elements of this bill.


To Senator Gallagher, I say, 'Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.' We are going to flatter you by moving a whole range of amendments based on this bill to the government's effects test bill, because we think that is the right thing to do in order to make that piece of legislation work much more effectively. It is no good having a rolled-gold piece of legislation on an effects test. The effects test needs to be modified. It has been constrained in its current form in terms of the government's bill. If we have these amendments in substance, it will mean that the bill will have genuine teeth, because people will be able to have their day in court without the fear of being bankrupted by taking a meritorious claim to court.


That is why, as a team, we support this legislation. It is a worthy piece of legislation. It is long overdue. I congratulate Senator Gallagher for moving this legislation. This is the way forward. If you want to have effective competition and consumer laws in this country, you must have an effective system of access to justice, and this bill goes some considerable way to achieving it. That is why we so wholeheartedly support it.

"Dastyari, Sen Sam",ALP,2017-05-11,"



Senator DASTYARI
 (New South Wales—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (10:57):  I want to speak to the Competition and Consumer Legislation Amendment (Small Business Access to Justice) Bill 2017, but I feel it is important to address some of the comments that have been made by some of the previous senators in this debate. I will start by echoing some words from Senator Xenophon that he said towards Senator Macdonald—that he is very fond of the senator. Senator Xenophon, I am one of the many senators who are very fond of you, but even I at times have to question your judgement when it comes to friends! Senator Macdonald appeared to spend a large proportion of his time speaking on the bill. I will be speaking a little bit more broadly about other issues. I will take the precedent that we are able to have a wide-ranging debate on this issue.


I want to note the incredible work of Senator Gallagher from the Australian Capital Territory. I do not quite understand why this became a point of attack. Yes, Senator Gallagher is from the ACT. While at times—especially when we have to sit over long winters—we all question the ACT for many different reasons, I do not understand the idea that, because she is a senator from the territory that she represents, speaks to people from the territory that she represents and was the Chief Minister of the territory that she represents, it somehow means that she cannot possibly have had conversations with people outside of the ACT and cannot possibly have had conversations with people in Queensland or other places. I note that Senator Gallagher has actually spent more time in Queensland than the Treasurer of Australia. The Treasurer has not even visited Queensland this year, let alone the Northern Territory, which he has not visited, it appears, since becoming Treasurer. I cannot speak to Western Australia and other states.


I want to commend Senator Gallagher and her predecessor from the other place, the honourable member for Greenway, Michelle Rowland, for the work they have done on this bill. Senator Xenophon touched on this quite well: fundamentally, we in this country have a legal system that is not fair in practice, even when at times it may be fair in theory. There is a huge disconnect between what is the law and what is access to the law. What this bill attempts is to do what it can to close that gap in the legal system—it is not going to be perfect, because there is no perfect solution. We pass bills constantly in this place, and they all seem fantastic and great and they are equitable and fair and we have these great principles of 'everybody is equal before the law', as we should have those principles. At the same time we have a legal system where access to justice makes a big difference. In this particular case, access to justice relates to the power of large corporations, as opposed to the power of small businesses, when it comes to being able to access those legal remedies. That is the real problem, the real challenge, that we have to face and that this legislation attempts to face.


Here is the reality. I come from a family of small-business people. My parents had a small cake store in Castle Hill in the north-west of Sydney when I was growing up. They now own a small business in the Queen Victoria Building—a King of Knives kind of retail outlet. When you deal with small—




Senator Fierravanti-Wells:
  Is that what makes you so effective in the Labor Party?




Senator DASTYARI:
  I will take that interjection. Senator Fierravanti-Wells wants to know whether the fact that my parents own a knife store is what has made me so effective in the New South Wales Labor Party. I remind the senator that the art of using a knife is knowing when not to use one, not knowing when to use one.


There are two separate debates that we are going to have. There is going to be the debate around the effects test. I think the Labor Party position on that has been quite clear. We do not believe the evidence is there and we do not believe that it is the right approach, but there are others who support the view. I have heard a lot of arguments about the effects test. I think it is an important debate to have. It is not mutually exclusive from this bill and it is not mutually exclusive from the debate we are having. They are two separate pieces of legislation. I believe access to justice in fact is a far more important principle than what we are looking at. Frankly, the idea that larger businesses are able to use the threat of the costs that may be incurred from legal action to prevent people from using their rights under the law is a highly concerning one. Let us not kid ourselves: it is a tactic that has been used, not just in business cases. Those of us involved in politics have seen these kinds of intimidatory tactics used, especially around defamation and other areas. But a tactic of big businesses with big pockets is to tie up and make the legal process so difficult and expensive for a smaller business as to prevent them from being able to get the legal remedy that they may seek, to prevent them from being able to get the outcome they may want.


When you as a smaller business are dealing with larger institutions that have their own army of lawyers, that have the sunk cost of in-house counsel—let us deal with a hypothetical: the type of situation where there may be a dispute over a brand or a site or a location of a business. The idea that some small business with a handful of staff is really going to be able to compete at a legal level with the enormity of the legal representation that is presented by some of these companies creates an unfair playing field. While the legislation itself, and how it is written, may not be the problem—the legislation itself presents everyone as being equal before the law—we all know and have seen used time and time again the tactic of having lawyers and access to justice as the vehicle for preventing equity and preventing justice from being carried out.


This bill looks at restoring that balance. It will never be perfect. We are never going to have a system that will perfectly give equal opportunity before the law, but this bill looks at how much of that gap can be closed. It is about making sure our competition laws are better enforced by giving small business a level of access to justice that they do not have.


Businesses have the legal right to take action if a competitor is engaging in anticompetitive conduct. However, it is so hard for businesses to do that even when there is a breach of competition laws, as the justice level between them is so stretched. I think the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, the ACCC—who we will have before our estimates in the next few weeks and we will have an opportunity to go further into the conversation we have with them—have highlighted their concern at the idea that the access to justice is not really there. This bill will address the difficulties small business face in getting that justice, because it does two really important things.


Firstly, it allows the Federal Court to waive liability for costs to smaller business private litigants bringing these cases. Senator Xenophon presented a figure from his life experiences as being those who have a strong case and a good case, but you are never sure before the law, nor should you be—there is always a risk involved when there is a lawyer. A good lawyer may advise that they have an 80 to 90 per cent chance, but that 10 per cent chance of having costs awarded against them may be so significant that they are unable to pursue that action. Secondly, businesses will be able to go to the ombudsman to get early assistance to find out whether they should consider going for these new non-adverse cost orders. In fact, there will be an independent procedure for them to be able to get the information that they need to determine whether they should or should not pursue this.


This is an important equity measure, an important step to be taken for equity. Senator Macdonald spent the whole of his 20-minute speech talking at length about the small business contribution and the small business relationship between the Adani coalmine in northern Queensland—sorry, I will be fair, the proposed Adani mine in northern Queensland—and its impact on small business. The point he was making was about the flow-on effects that a project like that will present to small businesses. I believe that if we are talking about small businesses and we are talking about equity and fairness, then the big issue of fairness that we need to address—and this bill goes in part to start doing that—is the inequity between larger corporations and how they pay their tax and how small businesses, which do not have those legal structures, do not have those opportunities.


Senator Macdonald went on at length about Adani and about their supposed record of being great corporate citizens. I feel that it would be only fair to make a contrast with a company like Chevron, that we have had the opportunity to hear from recently. At the end of April the new managing director of Chevron Australia, Nigel Hearne, fronted a Senate inquiry about corporate tax avoidance held in Perth in Western Australia. This whole notion of inequity between small business and big business was really brought to light for me by seeing a situation where you have a company the size, nature and structure of Chevron that has paid no corporate tax last year, will pay no corporate tax this year, paid no PRRT—petroleum resource rent tax—last year, paid no PRRT this year and will likely not be paying it for many, many years into the future.


When we talk about justice and equity for small business we have to ask ourselves: where is the justice and equity when the small businesses of Australia are paying their taxes, paying their fair share, and the larger corporations are able to structure themselves in ways that allow them not to do so? My issue with the structures of companies like Chevron is not that what they are doing is illegal, as I do not believe what they are doing is illegal. My concern is that in many, many cases what they have done has been legal; what they have done has been allowed under our laws. Sure, there have been some shark tactics—there are matters before the Federal Court at the moment. There are issues that are being challenged by the tax office, and I give the tax office credit for doing that. But these are the real issues—these are the equity issues that have to be addressed.


At the moment, the oil price is $50 a barrel. At today's price, Chevron and other multinational corporations will not pay PRRT, petroleum resource rent tax, for the whole life of the projects. We are giving away this entire resource without getting back the tax that is meant to be there for us to be able to recoup something. How is that fair for small businesses, when they do not have those opportunities? How is that equitable?


We heard from the CEO of Chevron himself, Mr Nigel Hearne. He was previously the CEO of Chevron Appalachia, and under his watch there was an explosion at a Chevron-owned oil well in Pennsylvania that killed a 27-year-old contractor who was working on the site. It also forced nearby residents to be evacuated. Five days after the explosion, when the fire was still smouldering, Chevron sent letters to local residents who might have been impacted and offered them a voucher for a large pizza and a two-litre soft drink. After this incident, the state of Pennsylvania's Department of Environmental Protection issued Chevron with one of the largest fines it has ever levied. The parents of the killed worker reached a $5 million settlement with the company after the state confirmed the site was not properly supervised.


Before that role, from 2011 to 2013 Mr Hearne was the general manager of Chevron's refinery in Richmond, California. This is one of Chevron's largest refineries, and, under Mr Hearne's watch, a fire at the refinery nearly killed 19 workers and caused 15,000 people to seek hospital treatment. According to a report by the US Chemical Safety Board, a federal government agency, a pipe rupture released flammable high-temperature light gas oil, which then partially vaporised into a large opaque vapour cloud that engulfed 19 Chevron employees. The cloud ignited, and the explosion caused a large plume of vapour, particulates and black smoke, which travelled across the surrounding area. There was an emergency warning for three nearby cities in the following weeks, and approximately 15,000 people sought medical treatment at nearby medical facilities, for ailments including breathing problems, chest pains, shortness of breath, sore throat and headaches. California's Attorney-General and the local District Attorney brought criminal charges against Chevron for the incident. Chevron pleaded no contest to six charges, agreeing to increase oversight by state agencies and pay $2 million in fines and remediation costs. Separately, the state's occupational safety and health regulator fined Chevron $782,000 and issued six 'serious' and nine 'wilful' violations for the incident. Less than three weeks after the incident, health and safety inspectors were back at the refinery and issued five 'serious' and two new 'wilful' violations, with fines of over $173,000. This is the track record of the CEO of Chevron in Australia.


We are debating here how it is that there is one set of rules for larger corporations, one set of standards for the big multinationals, and yet, when it comes to small business wanting access to justice, access to decency, access to fairness, that is not present. There is a huge gulf between the ways in which different groups of people, different groups of businesses, are treated in our society. Especially when it comes to justice—and I believe justice relates to tax justice as well as legal justice—we should be asking ourselves: why is it not fair; why do these gulfs exist; why is there this gap?


The bill that we have before us is not going to fix all these problems. The bill that we have before us is not going to fix the huge inequity between small and big business in Australia. No one piece of legislation will. But it goes a step in the right direction towards providing justice. It goes a step in the right direction towards creating a fair, more equitable, more even playing field insofar as it relates to being able to get court access and court justice. This is a bill that represents a commitment that the Labor Party took to the last election. It was developed by wide consultation with a lot of businesses, many of whom said that, at a practical level, the theoretical structure of the law, as important as that is—and everyone believes that is important—it is the practical reality of how it is implemented on the ground that really affects the day-to-day lives of different businesses and that really affects the day-to-day lives of business operators. Where we need to be looking at is not just having the perfect laws in theory passed through our parliaments but making sure that everyone has equal access to that.


Equity in business does not just stop here. There is a huge equity issue. I note that Senator Scullion from the Northern Territory is here and he can talk at length about the challenges of inequity when it comes to, particularly, Indigenous Australians and others. I think we in this parliament do a very good job in many instances in framing laws that we believe are fair and equitable, and that are fair and equitable. But the challenge always is at a delivery level when we leave a chamber like this or a place like parliament. Let us not kid ourselves; we are all very privileged to be here and we are privileged people. Having that same kind of access on the ground on a day-to-day basis and having that same kind of representation before the law—that is always a really big challenge that we struggle with.


In conclusion—and I note I have used up my time—this is a bill that is about making sure competition laws are better by giving a little bit of a leg up to small businesses in the unfair fights that they have to face. Businesses who have a right to access and go laws often do not do so because of the fear of the costs that are associated with it. Even when small businesses have a strong case, they have to be very careful about the fact that larger players have a lot of money and a far greater capacity to fight these cases.


There is a worry that if they lose their case they could face large bills and be driven out of business. They do not have the same kind of risk profile that larger businesses, especially those that have huge in-house legal teams that are already sunk costs, are able to deal with. I note that the ACCC has been very strong on this issue. I note that other consumer groups have been very strong on this issue. I note that the small business lobby has been very strong on this issue.


I commend this bill. I believe it is a bill that should be supported by the Australian Senate.

"Back, Sen Chris",LP,2017-05-11,"



Senator BACK
 (Western Australia) (11:17):  Before addressing myself to the Competition and Consumer Legislation Amendment (Small Business Access to Justice) Bill 2017, I propose to spend some moments on the importance of the Native Title Amendment (Indigenous Land Use Agreements) Bill 2017. Also, I foreshadow that I will be responding to what I believe to have been a highly inaccurate and cowardly statement by Senator Dastyari about Chevron and its now managing director, Mr Hearne. I think it is a disgrace that a person under parliamentary privilege would come in and make the statements that he has made. But I will get onto that in a few moments, because he is wrong. This chamber and those listening need to know just how wrong and how dastardly Senator Dastyari has been in that attack on Chevron.


Let me go, if I may, because it is directly relevant to the opportunities in small business access, to that associated with the native title amendment bill that is before us. I have to urge everybody in this chamber that, before we rise and return to our home states and territories, we have to address this anomaly. It comes about as a result of the fact of a decision of a justice in McGlade in the Federal Court in Perth recently in which he overturned what had been the decision of a justice in Bygrave previously in relation to native title claims, particularly the percentage of native title claimants associated with them. In Bygrave, the justice had the view that so long as there was greater than 51 per cent of native title claimants then it was possible to proceed with what is known as an Indigenous Land Use Agreement. Where the McGlade case has caused the change and has caused the ruction, is McGlade has effectively required 100 per cent of claimants to be in agreement before anything can proceed.


Yes, it has something to do with Adani mine. But, by Jove, that is one of the very few. I learned from my very good colleague Senator Scullion that there are some 126 agreements around Australia associated with native title that are affected by this decision. They are going to affect the benefits to native title claimants associated with those Indigenous Land Use Agreements. These land use agreements are themselves, of course, voluntary. They are providing an opportunity for native title groups to use those rights in beneficial ways, particularly in relation to economic development to provide certainty for all parties doing business on native title land. And if Senator Dastyari and his colleagues, and indeed everyone in this chamber, is genuinely interested in ensuring the continued benefit to native title recipients under those ILUAs then it will be in their greatest interests to make sure we do not rise from this place until we deal with it.


There is a bill before the chamber. It will address the concerns that McGlade has raised, and it is incumbent on all of us. If we fail to, each one of us must go back to those native title groups, including those in the Indigenous areas as well as the companies with whom they deal, and explain to them why there is now no certainty. I know on a personal basis a colleague who, only this week and next week, is associated with some negotiations on native title. This particular person is in the eastern states this week representing the interests of Aboriginal people, and next week in the North of Australia he will be representing the interests of a mining company. He is an absolutely eminent man of great integrity, but I know that this negotiation is now on hold whilst we deal with this issue.


It is the case that a grant that is made under an invalid Indigenous Land Use Agreement will itself be invalid against native title—that is in my state with the Noongar people for whom this particular judgment was made in the Federal Court by Justice McGlade. It will have application right around Australia and, I dare say, the islands adjacent to us. This is of critical importance and, if people really want to do something in the small business space to continue to encourage Aboriginal people under these ILUAs, to continue to encourage other companies to deal with, to participate in and to work for the improvement of people in those communities, it is essential that we deal with this native title amendment Indigenous land act.


I appreciate the fact that Senator Dastyari has remained in the chamber—I thank you for that. Senator Dastyari made the comment a few moments ago—and, if Hansard proves I am wrong, I am willing to be corrected—through you, Acting Deputy President, that Chevron had paid no corporate tax in the last couple of years. I can tell you that—perhaps wrongly—I used a mobile phone in the chamber to check only in the last few minutes with the senior executive of Chevron of Australia, who assured me that in the last four to five years that company has paid no less than $4 billion of tax. If you listen to Senator Dastyari, you would be invited to draw the conclusion that company had paid no tax. Those were the words that were used: no corporate tax paid. They were your words—through you, Acting Deputy President. Senator Dastyari should know about the petroleum resource rent tax. It is a super profits tax after you have met and have reimbursed certain costs. He is making the comment that, in the projects with which Chevron is associated, they have paid no PRRT. For heavens' sake, the project at Gorgon on Barrow Island has only got two of three new LNG trains up and running. The project at Wheatstone has not yet commissioned its first one. How in heavens' name would a person who pretends to have the economic knowledge that Senator Dastyari pretends to understand and believe and stand up in this place and draw the inference that this company has paid no PRRT when indeed they have not yet got to the stage of making a profit? What Senator Dastyari failed to say was that this company, Chevron, which he is so keen to run down, has invested no less than—




Senator Dastyari:
  They paid no corporate tax last year. Are you claiming they paid corporate tax last year?




Senator BACK:
  Isn't it amazing? Did I interrupt Senator Dastyari when he was attacking a fine company investing billions of dollars in my home state? No, I offered him the courtesy of silence. But the words that I am saying are resonating with Senator Dastyari, because he is trying to close me down.




Senator Dastyari:
  You are lying.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Marshall
):  Senator Dastyari, you will not use those words in this place, and you will withdraw them.




Senator Dastyari:
  Sorry, Mr Acting Deputy President—which words? I am not quite sure what you want me to withdraw.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  You do know which words you have to withdraw, and you will withdraw them.




Senator Dastyari:
  Sorry, I withdraw any comment. I genuinely did not mean offence.




Senator BACK:
  I assure you, Senator Dastyari, no offence was taken. I do want to place on the record the fact that this company, in two major projects—at Gorgon and Wheatstone—are investing US$130 billion. To put it into perspective, in today's dollars, that is a project 15 times the size of the Snowy Mountains Scheme—US$130 billion. They will employ 19,000 people in construction. Over the 40-year life of those two projects they will contribute trillions of dollars to the Australian economy, over 100,000 jobs, billions of dollars in taxes and royalties, and, yes, a petroleum resource rent tax. They have invested billions of dollars with local small businesses in Western Australia, around Dampier, Onslow and the other ports. They have effectively developed the town of Onslow. Whilst comments were made by Senator Dastyari—about a person who cannot defend himself and on projects outside of Australia—I can relate to this chamber, as I have done in the past, the very fine occupational health, safety and welfare record of that company.


Finally, in passing, before I go back to addressing the subject of this discussion today, I should say to those who have any concerns about Chevron in the environmental space that Chevron's Gorgon project on Barrow Island is, in fact, in an A-class reserve. It is by far and away, as a result directly of Chevron's investment and care for the natural environment of Barrow Island, the best managed A-class reserve anywhere, not only on mainland Australia but around the Australian coastline. I reject, totally and thoroughly, the assertions made by Senator Dastyari.


I now turn, if I may, to the bill that is before us. I say very proudly that the coalition government always has and always will back small business. We will back it like a Melbourne Cup winner: up the straight, all the way, past the finishing line and through to the parade area. I will tell you why—because it is the engine room of the Australian economy. It employs nearly five million Australians in rural regions, in remote areas of Australia and in suburbs. It employs people at the lower end of the skills level as well as through to highly skilled people. It is the most versatile of all of the employment groups in this country. I am very proud to say that, in the budget of only the last couple of days, we announced a further tax cut for small business and, of course, we will see the company tax rate reduced to some 25 per cent. For those who quite rightly say that an enormous number of small businesses are not companies, it is important to record that there is also a five per cent tax discount for unincorporated companies, for sole operators and partnerships. These are the real issues that help small businesses and encourage further employment of young people and older people in our economy. There is the tax deduction of being able to write off in the one year $20,000 for assets purchased, and multiples of them—not just one. As a restaurant and cafe owner said to me when we first introduced this, 'I can now bring forward by four months the start of my new business because I can purchase different equipment to make that operation run—each one up to $20,000—and I can write it off fully in the first year.' That restaurant is up and running with 14 or 15 staff already.


I am very proud to say what the coalition government is doing and will continue to do. Having run small and medium sized businesses and still assisting constituents where I am able to, in terms of their obligations under the BAS, PAYG, superannuation et cetera, I can say it is the small-business person who really does the work for the Tax Commissioner. They fill out the BAS at the end of every quarter, make sure that the superannuation commitments are met and paid and ensure, of course, that workers compensation insurance and public liability insurance are paid. It is no wonder it is so difficult to make a quid in small business. But this government has cut red tape by $4½ billion, simplifying those processes that I was just speaking about, and removing many small businesses—up to half a million of them—from the PAYG system.


A scheme which I am very minded towards and I think needs enormous support from the parliament is the employee share scheme. If we can get employees to actually own shares in the business in which they are employed, then of course they have that greater incentive, because they themselves are part of the ownership. I, for one, will be watching that aspect of it very, very closely.


We have seen in recent times the opening up of the China-Australia, the Korea-Australia and the Japan-Australia free trade agreements. The best example of all, of course, is the cherry producer in Tasmania who has taken his cherry exports from a very small proportion to being a very significant exporter of that horticultural product into the Chinese market with significant improvement in employment, as I understand it—perhaps Senator McKim would be more familiar than I am and might know—




Senator McKim:
  I used to work for him.




Senator BACK:
  There you go: we have proof here of the evidence of not only the quality of the product but also, hopefully, the quality of his staff—through you, Deputy President, to Senator McKim.


These are the initiatives being taken by this coalition government in the services sector and the commodities sector to encourage small business even more. An ombudsman being appointed—and reference is made to the ombudsman in the bill being proposed by the Labor Party, and I will speak some more about the ombudsman's position. It is proposed in the bill to enable the ombudsman to provide assistance, as I understand it, with advising a private litigant on the arguments that might be made and the evidence needed to satisfy a court to grant a no adverse costs order. That of itself sounds all right. The only problem is: to what extent might it compromise an ombudsman who afterwards may have been seen to have given advice to an applicant or to a private litigant only to find out that that advice is now the subject of a challenge? We cannot really have a circumstance in which the ombudsman could themselves be the subject of a court action as a result of incorrect or inadequate advice given to a litigant. So there are, I think, difficulties associated with that particular element.


I applaud the Labor Party for putting this bill before the chamber. It recognises that they do have an understanding of some of the challenges associated with the issues of small business in Australia—expanding small business.


For those of us who have been in business all our lives, we actually do not like the term 'small business' all that much. It suggests that you want to remain small. Of course you do not want to remain small; the whole objective of business is to grow that business and move, perhaps, towards medium business and, in so doing, to employ more people.


I come back to the employee share scheme: imagine the scenario as long-trusted employees are part of an opportunity to expand a business and then indeed the next step—not always the best step for a business in my own experience—to move into export markets and be able to develop both your services and/or commodities along those lines.


Mention is made in this legislation—and I come to the decision of the coalition government in accepting the recommendations of the Harper review on the repeal of section 46 of the Competition and Consumer Act and replacing it with a provision that prevents firms with substantial market power from engaging in conduct that has the purpose, effect or likely effect of substantially lessening competition. I join with Senator Dastyari in the concept of the capacity of a larger company to be able to use its market power, market strength, to be able to dominate a small business. I have no difficulty with that argument; he just chose the wrong example in my humble opinion.


I will give you an example of some of the big retailers who will proudly announce to the retail market that they are going to undertake a huge discount of some product, only then to go back to the farmer, the supplier or the horticulturalist and say, 'Oh, by the way, we're undertaking a big discount on milk'—or a big discount on chicken or a big discount on some other product, be it almonds or whatever—'and, by the way, we're going to pay for most of it by reducing the payment to you in that scenario.' That is abuse of market power. It places the small business in a situation where they cannot negotiate their way out of that, as they are locked into supply and of course they have no alternative. So there are definitely circumstances where we have to ensure that big business does not have that unfair competitive advantage.


Legislation that we have introduced in this space, the Fair Work Amendment (Small Business—Penalty Rates Exemption) Bill—which we introduced into this parliament in 2015—is directed at protecting the interests of small business and indeed protecting the interests of employees in small business. We have also of course seen the involvement of the ACCC. In November of last year they released their report going to the whole concept of unfair trading relationships between large and small business, particularly where small businesses are, in a sense, forced to sign contracts or are at least influenced to sign contracts. Under the provisions of the ACCC, which the government accepted, we now know that a small business can challenge a term in a standard form contract, which is also a small business contract, on the basis that it is unfair. Big business were not happy with us, and they lobbied very, very hard against us. But the decision was taken to ensure the protection of small business.


As we all know, most small business people are their own accountant, their own person associated with marketing and they are their own person associated with sales. As I said earlier, at the end of every quarter they are the person sitting down trying to work out the BAS, trying to work out revenue and expenditure and trying to make sure they get superannuation liabilities paid et cetera. They are not the sorts of organisations that have huge teams of lawyers, accountants and others.


The coalition will continue to support small business by way of entrepreneurship, by way of innovation and by way of start-up and particularly by protecting small business when it comes to competition with big business and indeed with big unions. Whilst the Labor Party's bill is there to be debated, it does miss most of the elements important to small business.

"Ketter, Sen Christopher",ALP,2017-05-11,"



Senator KETTER
 (Queensland) (11:37):  I rise to speak to the Competition and Consumer Legislation Amendment (Small Business Access to Justice) Bill 2017. In commencing my comments I want to commend the work of Senator Gallagher in putting together this bill, which I think is very much targeted at the heart of the problem regarding competition between large and small businesses.


Before I go to my more substantive comments on the bill, I feel compelled to make some comments in respect of the contribution made by Senator Macdonald earlier in the debate. Senator Macdonald, in the course of his contribution, found ways of talking about Adani and the native title bill and then went on to discuss the low-value GST report which the Senate Economics Committee has handed down and had a good discussion about some of those points. In their own right, there were some interesting and perhaps constructive comments made throughout parts of Senator Macdonald's contribution, but they certainly lacked any connection with the very worthwhile bill that is before the chamber for consideration today, which is unfortunate.


I welcome Senator Xenophon's support for this bill. I note that he said that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery and that there would be comparable amendments coming forward from his party in relation to government legislation to address this area. I think that illustrates the fact that this bill does go to the heart of many of the problems that are affecting small business—they are fighting in the marketplace, trying to do the right thing and conduct their business, but they are rubbing up against the interests of big business, who have a substantial advantage over them.


We know that this is an issue. Senator Dastyari, in his contribution, talked about that issue—where businesses have deep pockets, they are able to, essentially, deny others the right to access justice. This is a huge concern. It has been identified by the Productivity Commission, which made some recommendations in respect of protective cost orders in 2014. We know that this is a very important issue. Unfortunately, we do not see a great deal of wholehearted support for this proposition on the other side. Instead, we see the government going down the track of the proposal to amend the effects test, which we have some concerns with.


This bill is the right pathway to improve competition in our economy. On our side of the chamber we understand small businesses and the struggles they face against the much bigger, well-funded and well-advised corporations. We know that small businesses face many barriers when it comes to taking action against anticompetitive behaviour by the big end of town. Rather than implementing the Deputy Prime Minister's latest thought bubble, which was the effects test, this bill delivers real change for small businesses.


An effects test is shorthand for a test that looks at whether conduct engaged in by a firm with a substantial degree of market power has the purpose, effect or likely effect of substantially lessening competition. This is dangerous economic policy. It is not just Labor that is saying this. I note that, in relation to the inquiry into the government legislation, the Waste Buying Group—a waste and recycling services business in the commercial industrial marketplace—made a submission which was quite informative. This business indicated that it was operating in an industry dominated by huge multinational firms who practise a range of tactics designed to hold a client bound to service contracts. They say the consequence is that it leads to poor competition in the marketplace and results in high prices and poor service outcomes for the client base.


One would think that this is one of those types of businesses that would wholeheartedly embrace the effects test and any purported effort to even up the position of large and small businesses. However, that is not the case. This business indicates that small business and clients will simply not be able to afford the costs of expensive trials in relation to this matter. Based on their experience, they believe that the ACCC will be overwhelmed with work, under resourced or just not interested. They believe that the ACCC—this is their own view, not my own view—is not an authority they can rely upon to advocate for the industry. In their submission, they recommended the introduction of an affordable tribunal to adjudicate abuse or market-power competition issues, so that small businesses or their clients could access it. That is a good illustration of the fact that this is not a Labor thought bubble; this is something that does have support out there amongst small businesses who understand that the government's approach is flawed.


The effects test risks making business afraid to compete, which ultimately hurts consumers. This will create a legal risk every time a business seeks to lower prices for their customers, and what obviously will happen in that situation is that consumers will be the losers. This is at a time when we are all faced with cost-of-living pressures. We know that we have wage growth at record lows. We know we have increasing unemployment and below trend economic growth. In this environment, we need all of the resources of the market to bring prices down so that consumers can benefit from that, so that families can make ends meet. This is a hugely important consideration.


Labor are not the only group of people warning of a lawyers' picnic if the government's legislation on the effects test were to pass. The small business lobby group COSBOA themselves have stated that they are concerned that the wording will create a lawyers' picnic, as predicted by the opponents of the effects test. When even the original proponents of the policy are saying that it is dangerous, you know that the government has made a complete mess of competition policy.


Labor do welcome strong competition policy, but it must be informed and enforced, and the government package is neither. What we are seeing are dangerous legislative proposals without addressing either the resources of the ACCC, which was commented on by the Waste Buying Group submission, or making it easier for small businesses to litigate in their own private capacity. In the words of former Treasurer Peter Costello, 'a so-called effects test will protect competitors, especially less efficient ones, from competition'. 


Since 1974—and I think this point has been made previously—there have been at least 10 inquiries into Australia's competition laws which have considered a proposed effects test and rejected it. Apart from Professor Harper's review, only one other inquiry has ever recommended it. So there is a reason why 10 out of 12 inquiries have recommended against an effects test. The reason for that is it is bad law. It is going to have a detrimental impact on the consumer. In the submissions to the Harper review, the effects test has been described as legally unworkable, something that will chill competition and something that will create uncertainty for business. These changes will deter job-creating investment in Australia by adding to the new layers of red tape and barriers to investment which have already been imposed by the coalition government.


It is little wonder that the government's own former Minister for Trade and Investment, Mr Robb, is opposed to this latest anti-investment measure. The Turnbull government's proposed effects test is a move to satisfy internal politics. This is not about policy. A level-headed analysis of the effects test shows that the Prime Minister is using competition policy as a political prop. We know that the Prime Minister himself has said previously that he would be deeply concerned about the introduction of an effects test, and we have seen other people such as Mr Samuel, the former ACCC chairman, saying:


Under the Harper amendment, businesses would curb their competitive behaviour because of the legal risk. This would have drowned the commercial activity of big business in a sea of uncertainty. Lawyers and economists would need to sit at the right hand of business CEOs to guide them on the legality of every significant transaction.


It is quite clear that it is Mr Joyce, the Deputy Prime Minister, who has become the government's chief economic spokesperson, and this is detrimental to the Australian consumers and the broader economy.


Labor understand that cost orders from courts represent an insurmountable barrier for many small businesses. We have the Competition and Consumer Act, but if it is too expensive for small businesses to take action then clearly that is a problem; our society is the worse for it, with some anticompetitive conduct not made public and not properly addressed. It should not be acceptable today for big businesses with deep pockets and armies of lawyers to overwhelm small businesses. The legal fees are a significant obstacle for small businesses across this country.


To generate this public good of a fair, competitive economy, it is important that small businesses be given the ability to raise court actions without the threat of long, expensive and protracted court cases. It is important that a well-funded and well-advised large firm is not able to wear small businesses down. The Turnbull government has refused to address this inequity despite, as I said earlier, the Productivity Commission and the government's own competition review saying that small businesses are disadvantaged in the court process. Labor's Competition and Consumer Legislation Amendment (Small Business Access to Justice) Bill 2017 will restore the balance by letting a small business request a no adverse costs order early in the court case. Allowing small businesses to seek relief from adverse costs orders at an early stage of the judicial process will provide financial certainty to the private litigant. A judge would hear this application and decide on the merits. This would require amendments to the Federal Court Rules.


This is a sensible change, a pro-small-business move that empowers them to make full use of the laws that we have on the books. It is also in line with international trends. Other countries are trying to find ways to encourage private litigation so the public interest can be served. In the United States there is a view that public interest in private litigation occurring is so great that positive measures should be taken to actively encourage it. Consequently, a private party which successfully proves an antitrust claim is entitled to treble damages—three times the proven loss caused by the conduct. No such policy currently exists under Australian law. In the European Union the commission has called on all jurisdictions in which costs follow the event, as in Australia, to carefully review the appropriateness of this approach in competition cases as, again, there is considered to be a significant benefit to the public when private matters are pursued through the courts. In the United Kingdom the Competition Appeals Tribunal has been established and has been granted discretion to make any order it sees fit in relation to costs, as opposed to the usual rule. So there is international interest in the approach that has been taken by Labor on this matter. It shows that we are at the forefront of seeking to address one of the key concerns that small businesses have today.


When it comes to the issue of mitigating risk, Labor's legislation will enable the Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman to provide professional assistance as to whether the no adverse costs order is likely to be successful. There are risks when opposing no adverse costs order. Where legal action has no or little cost, the risk of frivolous or vexatious litigation increases. In fact, if legal action is of sufficiently low cost, the threat of vexatious legal action could be used when negotiating with a larger firm. However, these risks can be mitigated and do not outweigh the potential benefit of increasing private litigation under the Competition and Consumer Act. It is proposed that the small business ombudsman be funded to vet applications, preventing adverse costs orders under part IV of the Competition and Consumer Act. This process is designed to provide advice to the potential litigant and will not mandate a no adverse costs order in any court case. This will help small businesses to better understand their prospects of obtaining a no adverse costs order and will act to reduce the risk of frivolous litigation where the ombudsman does not see merit in the litigation. This will not constitute legal advice under this bill, and the ombudsman cannot provide advice and support to private litigants. The ombudsman will be restricted to assessing whether there is the possibility of a no adverse costs order. Where the ombudsman positively vets an application from a potential private litigant, a letter of support will be provided to the applicant. This nonbinding letter of support would indicate to the applicant that there is a good case for a no-costs order to be approved by a judge.


This is a pragmatic approach and it is the sort of approach that gives small business the confidence to use the legal system. Unfortunately, there is a widespread view amongst not only small businesses but also other members of the community that, when they are taking on a large adversary in the court system, they might as well not even try, because the odds are stacked against them. This very pragmatic approach breaks down those barriers to access to justice. It assists small businesses and private litigants, as opposed to the introduction of the effects test, and confers a useful and practical power on the new ombudsman. A three-person section in the small business ombudsman has been costed at $500,000 per year.


Small business is crucial to Australia's economy. The budget that we have just seen confirms that Mr Turnbull is a Prime Minister for the big end of town over those working hard to grow their businesses and create jobs. Small businesses make up 97 per cent of businesses in Australia and are the engine room of the economy. We all use that terminology, but it is true. They employ more than 4.7 million people and contribute in excess of $343 billion to the economy every year. This scale simply cannot be ignored. That is why we would like to have seen Mr Turnbull and the Treasurer put more of a focus on small and medium businesses in the budget instead of focusing on the big end of town.


This bill is about making sure our competition laws are better enforced by giving small business access to justice. Businesses have the legal right to take action if a competitor is engaging in anticompetitive conduct. However, at the moment it is very hard for small businesses to do this, even where there is a clear breach of our competition laws. Even where a small business has a strong case, they have to think very carefully about the fact that larger players have money and a far greater capacity to fight these cases. Of course, there is the worry that, if they lose, they will face huge legal bills. We know that small-business people have gone into business often leveraging their homes, taking on financial burdens and employing people. This means, in effect, that small players are discouraged from taking action to enforce Australia's competition laws. This is contrary to the public interest.


This bill will address the difficulties small businesses face in getting access to justice under Australian competition laws. Small businesses are too often discouraged from pursuing strong cases. This bill empowers small business to go forward to enforce our laws to ensure that the legal system is fairer for everyone and to ensure that true competition applies. Consumers are the winners in that situation. This is a win-win bill. I encourage those opposite to support this bill.

"Watt, Sen Murray",ALP,2017-05-11,"



Senator WATT
 (Queensland) (11:57):  I am pleased to follow Senator Ketter to speak in support of the Competition and Consumer Legislation Amendment (Small Business Access to Justice) Bill 2017, which has been lodged and introduced by Labor. It is another sign that, despite the government's rhetoric to the contrary—and I will come to that a little bit later—Labor does have a very good understanding of the real needs of small business and is prepared to take action via introducing legislation like this to back in small business and ensure that they do get a fair deal and a level playing field.


Anyone who has dealt with small business or has run a small business understands that small businesses do face many barriers to taking action, especially against anticompetitive behaviour by the big end of town. One of the reasons for that is that big businesses do invariably have deep pockets and armies full of my former profession, lawyers. The risk of small businesses being overwhelmed and having to pay big business's legal fees is a significant obstacle when they are considering standing up for their rights. Unfortunately, even though this inequity has been recognised for a very long time, the Turnbull government has, nevertheless, refused to address this inequity. That is despite the government's own Productivity Commission and competition review saying that small businesses are disadvantaged in the court process.


As I say, I am very pleased to speak in support of this private member's bill introduced by Labor. As its name suggests, the Competition and Consumer Legislation Amendment (Small Business Access to Justice) Bill 2017 will help deliver some level of access to justice to small business. It will restore the balance by letting a small business request a no adverse costs order early in a court case. For those who have not been involved in litigation before, first of all I say: well done! It is something that is very well worth avoiding if you ever get the opportunity.


But one of the strengths of our system of litigation, particularly compared to the American system, is that, generally speaking, if a party brings legal action against another, particularly for a civil claim, they do have to think twice about whether that legal action has good prospects of success and whether it is frivolous because, at the end of the litigation, Australian courts do typically award costs to whichever party succeeds in a case. So, if you bring legal action against someone and make a claim against them, you need to think about the prospect that, if you lose, you may be facing quite a hefty order to pay at least a portion of the successful side's legal costs.


Overall, I think that is actually a good thing in our legal system. We do, from time to time, see what seem to be absurd examples of litigation in the US, and I think everyone would acknowledge that the US's legal system is pretty out of control compared to Australia's. We hear terms like 'litigation frenzy'. It is a much more litigious society than our own, and I think that one of the reasons for that is that, generally speaking, American courts do not order costs against an unsuccessful party in litigation, so there is not a tendency to issue adverse costs orders, and that means that people in the US can, pretty much without any repercussions, initiate legal action even though it may actually not have very much prospect of succeeding. We do not have that system in Australia. We have a system where unsuccessful parties in litigation run the risk of having to pay the successful party's legal fees, or at least a significant proportion of them, so that does give people pause for thought before they charge into a lawyer's office threatening to start legal action. Of course, the downside of that is that, if you are a smaller player, whether a small business or an individual, the fact that you may, at the end of a litigation, need to pay the other side's costs, again can be a bit of a deterrent from taking legal action which might actually be warranted.


As a lawyer, I have had many occasions where I have advised small businesses and other smaller parties, whether individuals or families, who have come to me with what, on its face, seems to be a reasonable claim—a claim that, though you never have a 100 per cent guarantee when you start legal action, on its face looks like it might have a reasonable prospect of succeeding—but, as the person's lawyer, you are obviously duty-bound to inform them that if all goes wrong and they do lose then there is a possibility that they could be up for the other side's legal costs. I have certainly personally advised more than one potential client about that, only to see them say, 'It's just not worth the risk,' even though they may have had a reasonably strong chance of succeeding in their legal action. The kind of work that I did—acting, usually, for plaintiffs—meant that they did not have the same level of resources as companies that they would take on, and very often they would weigh up the risks and decide that it just was not worth the risk of getting an adverse costs order. So that is a deterrent to litigation and sometimes does tilt the scales a bit too much towards big business.


So our bill, Labor's bill, seeks to restore that balance by letting a small business request a no adverse costs order early in a court case. As I say, we do not want that used frivolously. We do not want that to open the floodgates to litigation. So one of the other things that this bill provides for is: when a small business seeks a no adverse costs order early in a court case, a judge would have the ability to decide that, if the case has merit, the small business will not have to pay a big business's legal costs. So there is a check and balance in there. An application would need to be made to a court, and a judge would still need to weigh up the evidence. It would not be a full hearing of the case, because that in itself would run up massive legal costs. But this bill seeks to get that balance right, giving small businesses the opportunity to present their case, or a portion of their case, and have a judge determine whether the case has some merit and then have the ability to issue a no adverse costs order.


This bill will also enable the Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman to provide professional assistance as to whether the no adverse costs order is likely to be successful. Again, we do not want people just trotting off to court and starting up legal action that has no prospect of success and that inevitably will result in an adverse costs order. This bill provides a capacity for small businesses to get some advice, prior to taking legal action, about whether a no adverse costs order is likely to be successful.


Working as a lawyer for over 10 years, I have had many instances where I have advised small businesses and other clients about their chances of succeeding in litigation, and they have weighed up the costs and the benefits. Most recently, before I entered the Senate, I practised in the area of class actions, which is a relatively new area of law in Australia. It has been going a lot longer in the US. I had the privilege of acting for individuals and small businesses in a couple of fairly large class actions. One was on behalf of shareholders in the National Australia Bank, and that was an action essentially about misleading the share market to do with the subprime crisis in America. Another class action that I was privileged to be involved in was on behalf of hundreds of horse breeders and horse owners and other people in the horse industry, who brought a class action against the Commonwealth in relation to a massive quarantine failure.


I mention this because many of the clients that we were acting for in those two class actions—and the firm I worked at obviously runs many more than just those two—were small businesses. If you spoke to them, there was no way that an individual shareholding small business or an individual horse industry small business could possibly have had the resources to take on either the National Australia Bank, in the first case, the shareholder case, or the Commonwealth of Australia, in the case concerning quarantine failures. These people had absolutely suffered some sort of financial loss through the wrongdoing of either the Commonwealth or the National Australia Bank. There was always going to be the matter of having to prove that it was the fault of the defendant, but there was no doubt these people had suffered financial losses, some in the thousands of dollars, some in the tens of thousands and some in the millions. But, no matter what size of loss they had suffered, there was absolutely no way they had the resources to fight a prolonged legal battle against some of the biggest defendants in the country, who would roll out their armies of lawyers and paralegals to review every single document. They would incur millions and millions of dollars in legal costs and invariably drag out a court case. 


Class actions tend to run for three or four years. They are long, complex pieces of litigation. But there is no way that the ordinary small business out there can undertake that kind of legal action on an affordable basis. And that is one of the reasons we have seen a growth of litigation funding in Australia, where class actions can be run by plaintiff law firms, who have the security of getting their fees covered as the case rolls on. But the clients, the small businesses who take this legal action, only end up having to pay back those legal costs if they have a successful outcome.


I think that our class actions system in Australia, with litigation funding, has evolved to an extent that it does provide access to justice for many small businesses, who can band together, rather than each taking individual action against a large defendant for a similar wrong. They can band together with dozens or hundreds of other businesses or individuals who have suffered similar losses as a result of the same wrongdoing. They can come together and have someone else pay their legal fees and take the risk of an adverse costs order if the action is unsuccessful. That way, they are able to get access to justice which they would not be able to get on an individual basis. 


But, while it is true that our class actions system and litigation funding system in Australia has evolved to an extent that it can provide access to justice to people, there are nevertheless some cases which are too small to be run as a class action and be viable.


The reality is that, as I say, they are long, complex cases where legal fees are expensive. If you are talking about a loss that has been suffered by people of, say, $10 million to $20 million all up, at one level that is a large amount of money, but, once you get legal costs taken out of that, there would not actually be a lot of money left over. That is the kind of instance that this bill will support. It will give opportunity to small businesses whose losses are not so great that they can afford to take the risk of incurring lots of legal costs and incurring adverse costs if they are unsuccessful in their action. We want to make sure that small businesses that have suffered relatively smaller but significant losses can still have their day in court. That is a pretty basic right in the Australian legal system, and this bill will enable that by giving some level of protection for small businesses that they will not face an adverse costs order if they bring a case that does have some merit but, at the end of the hearing, fails. All in all, this bill will give small and medium businesses greater power to enforce their rights under Australia's competition law.


The other thing I wanted to touch on in my contribution to this debate is an incredible misconception which has been perpetuated by conservative parties and some of their supporters in the business community over many years—that is, only those in the conservative side of politics are friends of small business. It is one of those mantras that we hear from conservative parties—and I can see my friend Senator Smith over there agreeing with that mantra. Well, he is wrong, and not for the first time. I know it is an article of faith in conservative parties that they are the defenders of small business and that Labor is anti-small business. If you have a look at the facts, you will see that nothing could be further from the truth. I will be honest—there are some issues that, from time to time, Labor takes a different position to—




Senator Hume:
  Penalty rates.




Senator WATT:
  I will come to that, Senator Hume. There are times when Labor takes a different position on issues to some parts of small business. Penalty rates is an example of that. We have heard some small businesses be vocal about their desire to see penalty rates being cut. But equally—and this does not get quite as much attention—there are many small businesses out there that are quite happy to pay penalty rates to their employees. And they remain so despite the decision of the Fair Work Commission, backed in by this government.


Even in the duty electorates that I represent in Queensland there have been high-profile examples where small businesses have come out publicly and said that they want to stand by their employees. They understand that, if they pay their employees properly, and if all other small businesses do so as well, that will ensure there is a flow of money coming through a particular town that can be spent in other small businesses. It does not help small businesses to impose a massive wage cut on employees of those businesses, because all they are going to do is keep their money in their pocket and not spend it in the neighbouring small business down the street. I can think of a butcher's store near Yeppoon in Central Queensland which has come out publicly and said that they are going to continue paying penalty rates to their workers on Sundays—and good on them. Lush, who are a retail chain that sells bath products that my wife likes to go and spend lots of money on all the time, have said that they are going to maintain penalty rates for their employees. Again, good on them! They are taking a broader view than the penny-pinching view that some businesses take, which is a very short-term attitude that sees them cut back on their wages bill without understanding that what they are actually doing is cutting their own throats by reducing the amount of money that is available for their own customers to spend in their own business and in the businesses down the street.


Even with an example like penalty rates in which conservative governments and conservative parties hold up as something that all small businesses hate, it is actually not the case. There are many who understand that supporting their workers with decent wages actually enables the entire society and entire communities to prosper, which in turn creates more jobs.


I was reflecting on my very brief time as a state member of parliament in Queensland, and I well remember some of the conversations that I had with small businesses in my old electorate, particularly in the suburb of Albany Creek. There was a jeweller that I used to run into from time to time. He ran a jewellery store that was, basically, a family business. His biggest complaint was never things like penalty rates or tax issues, or the things that conservative governments trot out; his biggest complaint was that he could not get any fair treatment by the shopping centre owner, who kept on lifting his rent and lifting the payments he had to make to the shopping centre owner for utilities, whether it be electricity or water or other things. There was nothing he could do as an individual small-business owner to take on the shopping centre owner. There was no way that he would have the resources to wander into court and take up what seems to be quite a legitimate claim and quite an abuse of the law by a shopping centre. There was no way he had the resources to do that and in addition face the risk that, if he lost any legal action, he would potentially have to pay the costs of the shopping centre owner in that litigation. This bill will help people like Wayne Goddard, who ran that jewellery store, and will help many other small-business people right around the country. It will give them the ability to take up legitimate legal action against big business without the fear of having to pay a massive legal bill at the end of a case if it does turn out to be unsuccessful.


Some of the other things that small businesses raise with me as impediments to their business: I was in Rockhampton last week meeting with small businesses there, and one of the biggest complaints that they had was the difficulty they have dealing with big business and having no certainty about orders placed for their products by big business. That was what was stopping them putting people on to work for them. They did not know from month to month whether their major big business customers were actually going to keep ordering from them. We heard that from farmers. We heard that from manufacturing firms who were supplying to some of the biggest multinationals in the mining industry. 


They are the kinds of things that are stopping small business from growing. We do not hear anything whatsoever from this government about how they are actually going to support them and how they are going to overcome those problems. Instead, this government, like conservative parties before it, just keeps on pulling out the old bottom drawer, pulling out the tax stuff, pulling out the penalty rate stuff and ignoring the fact that there are many small businesses who are quite comfortable with arrangements as they currently stand and actually have real problems, different problems, that this government is ignoring.


If you speak to any small business in the country, whether it is someone who is operating from their home or from a small shop, the first thing they are probably going to hit you up with is the NBN and the failure of this government to provide a decent telecommunications network which will allow them to operate quickly and efficiently, and communicate with their suppliers and their clients and people overseas. This government has had a gross failure in the provision of decent telecommunications infrastructure in this country, particularly through the NBN. I am sure someone must have done some kind of analysis of the impact that that has had on economic growth. They are the real difficulties that small business is facing in this country and they are the things that this government should be concentrating on.


In particular in this bill, this is another attempt by Labor to even the playing field between big and small business. It will give small businesses their day in court for the very first time, and I would hope that the alleged supporters of small business sitting opposite might rethink this and support the bill.

"Hume, Sen Jane",LP,2017-05-11,"



Senator HUME
 (Victoria) (12:17):  What incredible hypocrisy. I have never heard anything like it: an attempt by Labor to level the playing field between big and small businesses. That is extraordinary. I know you have heard those words, Senator Watt, come from this side of the chamber, but I have to put my hand on my heart and say it is the first time I have ever heard it come from your side of the chamber. The Labor opposition have constantly opposed good quality, sensible, pragmatic policies that this side of politics, that this side of the chamber, have put forward to look after small business—those 3.2 million businesses that currently employ more than six million workers. Indeed, they are the engine room of the economy. Senator Ketter was right in saying that. They are the small businesses that we go to every day. They are the small manufacturers, the fish and chip shop down the road, the bakery, the small grocery on the corner—these are the people that keep our economy going, that keep our economy alive. Only a coalition government genuinely looks after small business. Labor looks after big business. It looks after its big business, big union mates, but it never comes to the rescue of small business, not with any genuine credibility. This bill is no different.


I am rising today to speak about the Competition and Consumer Legislation Amendment (Small Business Access to Justice) Bill 2017. This proposed bill from Labor, if enacted, would see private litigants given a power to request a no adverse costs order at any stage of a competition case. That is a part IV action under the Competition and Consumer Act. That is any stage of a competition case that they have brought before a court under proposed subsections 82(3) to 82(4). If a court grants such an order, the legal fees of the defendant would be prevented from being transferred to the litigant. In order to make a no adverse costs order, a judge must be satisfied that the action has a reasonable prospect of success and it raises an issue that may be significant for persons or groups other than the applicant, and that the disparity between their respective financial positions of the applicant and respondent is such that the respondent could use the possibility of a costs order against the applicant as a means to deter the applicant from pursuing the action. That is in proposed subsection 82(5).


The proposed bill would enable the Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman to provide assistance with advising private litigants on the arguments that might be made and the evidence that is needed to satisfy a court to grant that no adverse costs order, and the Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman would provide assistance preparing those arguments under this bill's proposed section 15(c) and 74B of the Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman Act 2015.


It will come as no surprise to have heard previous speakers in this chamber say that the government does not support Labor's bill. The main reason it does not support this bill is that the bill overpromises and yet will fail to deliver its objectives. There is no point in Labor promising access to justice for small businesses when the current law, section 46, is broken. If Labor is genuine about supporting small businesses, then they should support the government's changes to section 46 of the Competition and Consumer Act.


For the benefit of the chamber, it is probably worth giving section 46 some context. On 24 March 2014, the government commissioned an independent competition policy review, known colloquially as the Harper review, of Australia's competition framework. The key focus of the Harper review was to identify impediments across the economy that restrict competition and reduce productivity. It was described as the first root-and-branch review of Australia's competition laws for 20 years. The review panel, chaired by Professor Ian Harper, undertook extensive consultation with businesses, consumers and other industry stakeholders. The misuse of market power was one of the top issues raised in submissions to that review, with stakeholder opinions divided as to the efficacy of section 46 in deterring anticompetitive conduct.


On 31 March 2015, the Harper review released its final report. The report made 56 separate recommendations on Australia's competition framework. Those covered most sectors of the economy, with implications for almost all levels of government. In examining the misuse of market power provisions, the review panel considered section 46 to be deficient in its current form. On 16 March 2016, the government announced its final position on the Harper review recommendations and agreed to adopt in full the review's recommended changes to section 46 of the Competition and Consumer Act. The Prime Minister, the Treasurer and the Assistant Treasurer emphasised the government's commitment to strengthening Australia's competition policy. They commented:


... the amendment of section 46 to deal with the unilateral and anti-competitive conduct is an important step to ensure Australia has the best possible competition framework to support innovation and boost economic growth and jobs.


Indeed, the Minister for Revenue and Financial Services, the Hon. Kelly O'Dwyer MP, explained how those proposed amendments would support and promote pro-competitive conduct in business for the ultimate benefit of Australian consumers. I quote the minister. She said:


These amendments will make markets work better for the benefit of all Australians and help to lift our long-term productivity growth. They will ensure that all business can compete on a level playing field—


that sounds familiar, doesn't it, Senator Watt?—


rewarding innovative and dynamic businesses that provide the best services at the lowest cost. This will benefit households by giving them more choice and better value products and services.


Section 46 is what is broken. This bill is entirely unnecessary.


The changes to section 46 that the government has proposed will genuinely level the playing field for small businesses to ensure that they compete on merit against those businesses that have substantial market power. The changes to section 46 balance the small business to big business market relationship and will do far more to assist small businesses than the proposed bill under discussion today. These changes are necessary and they are championed by the small business sector.


This piece of proposed legislation is expensive and time consuming. Labor's policy encourages small businesses to engage in litigation—it actually actively encourages it—and potentially that could be vexatious legislation. It does not, however, assist in the resolution of disputes at the earliest available opportunity or at the least cost to parties and to the courts. Labor's policy will, in fact, do the very opposite: it will encourage businesses to commence litigation. The applicant and proceedings will still have very high legal costs and a high evidentiary burden in challenging legal thresholds to establish a breach of the current section 46. The seeking of the order itself carries with it a legal cost in satisfying the court that the order satisfies the hurdle tests—a cost which would be borne by the small business applicant. And, if the court grants a no adverse costs order, the applicant must still fund its own case, and the case is likely to be complicated by the legal argument about the facts and addressing the expert advice brought by the respondent. The costs to the applicant for its own legal representatives are still very likely to be high.


But, most importantly, is the role of the Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman. The functions given to the ASBFEO would require the ombudsman to provide legal advice on the prospects of obtaining an order, and that is not at all appropriate for a public statutory office of this nature. It is not clear how a party who took up litigation on the basis of such assessment and subsequently did not obtain an order in their favour could then withdraw from litigation without a cost penalty. It is also not clear what liability the Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman would have should the party not be successful in obtaining an order in their favour. A party in receipt of a no adverse costs order would be incentivised to take up belligerent litigation tactics, which are very unhelpful for the presiding judicial officer and for the other party who is acting in good faith. As it stands, this bill would allow a party to request a no adverse costs order when it becomes aware that it does not have a reasonable prospect of success, rather than withdrawing the case, which is what should happen in these circumstances. 


The bill would also fundamentally change the role of the Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman from advocacy and assistance. In particular, the addition of this function would severely limit the Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman's ability to advocate on issues. Advocating and assisting are what it does. They are its two key functions. The Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman advocates under a number of different activities, including conducting inquiries and research, working with other realms of government, contributing to other inquiries and promoting good business practice, and it assists because it understands the challenges that face small business owners. The Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman provides dispute resolution services for those who may be involved in a disagreement so that they can try to provide a solution to the problem without having to resort to costly litigation. The provisions of this bill fall outside the current remit of the Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman and would create an undue burden on that office. Additionally, Treasury does not consider that the Labor Party's estimates of the cost of $1 million reflects the full cost of this policy. Small business is indeed the engine room of the economy, but the Labor Party is no friend of small business.

"Gallagher, Sen Katy",ALP,2017-05-11,"



Senator GALLAGHER
 (Australian Capital Territory—Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate) (10:10):  The Competition and Consumer Legislation Amendment (Small Business Access to Justice) Bill 2017 is about making sure our competition laws are better enforced by giving small business better access to justice. Labor wants to empower small business private litigants to bring litigation under part 4 of the Competition and Consumer Act without the burden of prohibitive legal fees. This bill represents a policy that we took to the last election. Since its inception the Trade Practices Act 1974, now the Competition and Consumer Act 2010, has had section 46. This is a key component of Australia's competition laws. It is designed to prevent firms with substantial market power from deliberately using that power to eliminate or substantially damage a competitor, prevent the entry of a competitor or to deter or prevent competition. Businesses have the legal right to take action under section 46 if a competitor is engaged in anticompetitive conduct. However, at the moment this is hard for small and medium-size businesses to do, even when there is a clear breach of our competition laws. We all know that the larger players have the money, the lawyers and the capacity to fight these cases. In some instances they have an incentive to drag these cases out. Even where the small business has a strong case they worry that if they lose or if they have to fold they could face huge legal bills. This means that smaller players are discouraged from taking action to enforce Australia's competition laws and, through this, they are discouraged from accessing justice.


There is a concern that there is an uneven playing field between large and small businesses in Australia. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission has taken action in this space, although it has been suggested that this is insufficient relative to the number of allegations. The issue is addressed by the Harper competition review, which found small business access to remedies to be wanting, stating:


From submissions and consultations with small business, the Panel is convinced that there are significant barriers to small business taking private action to enforce the competition laws.


This bill will address the difficulties small businesses face in getting justice under Australia's competition law. It does this by two measures. First, it allows judges in the Federal Court to waive liability for costs to small business private litigants bringing these cases. We know that all too often small businesses do not take the big end of town to task, despite the fact that they may have a strong case. This is simply because they cannot afford to risk the costs of going to court, especially when their cash flow is already tight.


We on this side of the chamber want to make sure that small and medium businesses are on the same level playing field in our justice system as big business. This bill will do exactly that. It will be up to the judge whether a no adverse costs order is warranted. This empowers the small business owner with the knowledge that they will be able to argue their case without fear of a huge legal bill at the conclusion. If the application is not approved, they can then make a decision knowing that they are proceeding at their own risk. Either way, they will have greater up-front knowledge and certainty about the impact of proceeding with the competition case.


The second element of the bill is that small businesses will be able to go to the Ombudsman to get early assistance to find out whether they should consider going for these new no adverse costs order. The legislation would allow the Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman to provide professional assistance as to whether the no adverse costs order is likely to be granted. This is to assist in the process of a private litigant requesting a no adverse costs order. While this will not be legally binding, the ombudsman will assist small businesses to better understand their prospects of successful action under the Competition and Consumer Act. The small business ombudsman, Kate Carnell has commented on this bill. She has said:


Regarding anti-competitive behaviour, the ASBFEO office remains committed to ensuring small businesses have every opportunity to compete on a level playing field. Labor's proposal regarding a 'no adverse costs order' has merit, and deserves serious consideration by all sides of politics.


This bill represents a practical change for small businesses and is in the public interest. By allowing private litigants to better bring action under the Competition and Consumer Act, anticompetitive behaviour by powerful interests will be better mitigated, helping to support Australia's competition policy framework. This is a sensible proposal to provide some support for small businesses without damaging competition in the process.


Unlike some other international jurisdictions, competition litigation in Australia is primarily by public in nature. In the United States, about 10 private cases are brought for each public case. In Australia, the ratio is about one private case for every three public cases. There are certainly a number of disincentives to bringing private litigation under the Competition and Consumer Act. The primary consideration is the potential liability of opposing costs, in the situation where an applicant loses a case. When the misuse of market power is considered, the opposing costs are likely to be large given the reliance on solicitors and barristers, as well as competition experts. Further, defendants in these types of cases tend to be both wealthy and powerful. This is distinct from litigants who, given the nature of their grievance, tend to be less powerful. We think this bill is an important step to improving competition, strengthening enforcement of our competition laws and giving small business greater access to justice. We think this is an area where enabling small and medium businesses to take action here would lead to a more competitive economy, more opportunities for small business and better outcomes for consumers.


Some have linked an effects test to this bill. Labor is opposed to the effects test. However, we know that other parties in this chamber have a different position on it. This bill is separate from the effects test. It ensures that when action is taken under Australia's competition laws, the playing field is more even between small and large businesses. I want to make it clear that this is a measure that both those in favour of the effects test and those against the effects test can support. This bill simply allows better access to competition laws for small and medium businesses. Labor certainly support strong competition policy; however, we are opposed to an effects test because we have serious concerns about its impact on competition. 'Effects test' is shorthand for a test that looks at whether conduct engaged in by a firm with a substantial degree of market power has the purpose, effect or likely effect of substantially lessening competition. This is dangerous economic policy. In our view, the effects test creates a legal risk for a business every time it seeks to lower prices for its customers. We believe that consumers are the losers under the effects test. The effects test risks making businesses afraid to compete, which ultimately, in the long run, hurts consumers.


There have been many inquiries into Australia's competition laws. Since 1974 at least 10 inquiries have considered the proposal of an effects test and have rejected it. Apart from Professor Harper's review, only one other inquiry has ever recommended it. In submissions to the Harper review, the effects test has been described as 'legally unworkable', something that 'will chill competition' and something that 'will create uncertainty for business'. We believe that it will deter investment by adding new layers of red tape and will not help competition.


We believe that this bill is a better approach to competition law, by making sure that small and medium businesses have greater access to justice, and are not discouraged from taking action under our competition laws where they have a good case. However, as I have said, the access to justice policy in this bill is distinct from the effects test. It can be supported by those in favour of the effects test—the government's position—and by those opposed to the effects test. It complements the competition laws in Australia by allowing greater access to them.


We know that small businesses make up 97 per cent of businesses in Australia and they are the engine room of the economy. They employ almost five million people and contribute in excess of $343 billion to the economy every year. This scale simply cannot be ignored. That is why we would have liked to have seen Malcolm Turnbull and Scott Morrison put more of a focus on small and medium businesses in this budget instead of focusing on the big end of town. Small businesses are crucial to Australia's economy, and the budget that we have just seen confirms that the priority for this government is very much the big end of town over those working hard to grow their businesses and to create more jobs in their communities. When small businesses receive the support they need then they are able to grow, which in turn creates jobs and allows them to contribute more to the national economy.


Unfortunately, from our point of view, this budget is a missed opportunity. It has not addressed some of the most significant issues for small business. For example, it has not addressed issues including rising energy costs, delays in payments times and the delays in the rollout of the NBN. These are issues that are consistently and constantly raised with me by small businesses across Australia. We did welcome the decision to extend for one year the small business instant asset write-off. However, we are disappointed that the government has not acted to stimulate jobs or growth or to address the all-important issue of cash flow for businesses. Waiting for payments for supplies or services delivered is debilitating for small businesses right across Australia, and this budget, from my reading of it, has made no effort to address the 'payment terms' problem exposed in the Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman's recent report into the practice.


In order to compete in a global economy, small businesses need access to high-speed internet to grow their business and sell their products. But, again, this budget provides no solutions for Malcolm Turnbull's substandard National Broadband Network. This inaction simply makes it inevitable that Australian small businesses will continue to struggle with one of the slowest and most expensive internet services in the developed world.


The budget also leaves small businesses to fend for themselves on increasing energy prices. We have seen a complete absence of leadership from the top of this government on energy policy. This has a real impact on small businesses. In the last six months it has been mentioned to me at almost every meeting I have had with small business. As the contracts that they have to enter into for the next three years or so arrive, some businesses have raised with me the prospect that their annual energy bill is going from, say, $20,000 a year to $90,000 a year. I do not know how the government expects small businesses to absorb that kind of increase in a year. There is no response to this from the government. The lack of any consistent national policy, move to an emissions intensity scheme or investment certainty that is required around renewables is a policy void that is impacting on small businesses. They are raising it with me. They are extremely concerned and they want to see a response from the government, and it was absent in this year's budget. Wholesale power prices have doubled under this budget, and it looks like small businesses and households will continue to have to pay the price for this government's head-in-the-sand approach to delivering a national energy policy.


This bill before us today is all about levelling the playing field when it comes to access to justice for small business. We have consulted on this bill. It was a policy that we took to the last election. My predecessor in this position, Michelle Rowland, consulted heavily on this with a range of small-business stakeholders. Since taking up this portfolio, I too have met with not just industry associations but small and medium business owners themselves to talk through Labor's policy in this regard.


I have to say that, at the small business level, the effects test itself has not been raised with me as a top priority. On the issue of creating a level playing field—this perception, rightly, and wrongly at times perhaps, that small business does not get treated fairly is certainly one that is alive and thriving in the small business community, and I think there is a lot of merit to that argument. There is no doubt that small businesses want to see some improvements to the legislation around creating a level playing field, and the feedback that we have got from stakeholders of this bill supports it. Even those stakeholders who support the effects test also want to see this legislation get through; they see it as complementary too. And, for those that support an effects test, it is not necessarily an either/or scenario. We believe that this is the best way to go, and we do not support an effects test, which is why we have developed this legislation to deal with the issue of a level playing field and have that debate here.


Certainly, small businesses think access to justice is a difficulty for them, as well as the affordability of access to justice, which is why this bill goes particularly to that point. Many have raised with me examples of where they would have considered pursuing legal action or just taking legal advice, but the costs of that and the risks to their business resulted in them deciding to just cop it, ignore it or move on. That is exactly what this bill tries to address.


There have been very concerning stories around small-business loans, for example, This has come up across my portfolio into financial services, and small-business loans are something that I think we need to do further work on. We note that there is an initiative in the budget around a streamlined complaints mechanism which will allow small-business complaints, particularly about their loan arrangements, to be considered. We are having a look at the detail of that over the next few days and we will have some questions about it at estimates. 


But there is no doubt that there have been some extremely concerning stories about small businesses doing all the right things, meeting their loan obligations, making all their repayments, and then quite unfairly losing their businesses because of the actions of particular banks. I have spent a fair bit of time with people who have gone from being extremely successful business owners with long histories in the business community, with good records as employers and as contributors to the community, to having the rug essentially pulled out from under them—through, seemingly, no fault of their own—and having to refinance their loans or having their loans called in, and it has absolutely crippled them. In some instances, it has bankrupted them. Not only has the bank taken their business; it has taken their house. It has taken their super. In some instances, the banks have taken everything and left them destitute. We saw another example of that on 60 Minutes on Sunday night, with the case of the Maloneys. 


I think as parliamentary leaders of the country we must look at every way we can make sure that small-business owners are not placed in that position, because there should be protections there, or, if they are, that there are protections provided to get a fair hearing, to be treated fairly at all times and to make sure that, if it gets to the point where there is a dispute, that dispute is heard quickly and, where able, there is compensation for harm that is caused. The Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman has looked into this and made some comments on it. This is something that we need to pursue further. Of course, our position would be around a banking royal commission, but what I am saying in terms of running alongside this bill is that there are other ways that we need to look at making sure that small business is being given a fair go. We cannot take our eye off the ball. This does one thing, but there are many other ways that we need to support small businesses and make sure that they are treated fairly, treated with respect, and that their contribution to the community is acknowledged and they are not treated badly, particularly by the banks.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2017-05-11,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (10:30):  I am pleased that the Labor Party—at least their rhetoric—is about giving small business a fair go. I applaud that stated aim. I am pleased that Senator Gallagher, who has introduced this bill, has talked to small business in Canberra—one of the most privileged cities in Australia, I might add, and good luck to them—but I wonder how many small businesses Senator Gallagher has spoken to in Rockhampton, Mackay, Ayr—where I live—Townsville, Charters Towers, Clermont, the Bowen Basin towns, Dysart and Moranbah. I wonder how many small businesses she has spoken to there, because, if she had spoken to small business there, she would understand they are really struggling because of the downturn in the mining industry and the relentless campaign by the Greens to stop coalmining—a campaign which seems to be supported in this chamber by Labor senators and, I am disappointed to say, Labor senators from Queensland.


Small business in the towns that I mentioned in my home state of Queensland are desperate to see the Adani mine go ahead, and the only thing holding it up at the moment is the uncertainty on the native title issue, which has been addressed by the government and by Indigenous leaders across Australia. Agreement has been reached to fix that issue, but it is essential that it be done urgently and immediately, which is what Indigenous leaders want and what the Queensland state Labor government wants. If the native title issue were made certain, Adani could go ahead with more confidence and small businesses in those northern towns would be delighted because it would be a lifeline thrown to many of them who are now looking at their life savings and their small business going down the drain. So, Senator Gallagher, I urge you, if you are serious about small business, to slip up to Central and North Queensland, talk to small businesses there and see how important Adani is to them.


The government has asked the Labor Party to sit tomorrow, on a Friday. I appreciate that is a holiday for most Labor senators. We just want them to give up one day of their holiday and sit tomorrow in this chamber so that we can fully debate the native title amendment and hopefully have it passed, because the Labor Party say they support it. Certainly, the Liberal and National parties support it. I understand One Nation supports it and I understand that the Liberal Democrats support it. So it should fly through the chamber if we have a whole day's debate on it tomorrow. Will the Labor Party sit and pass that legislation, which will help Adani, which will help small business, which Senator Gallagher has spent 20 minutes telling us she supports? Will they sit tomorrow? No—tomorrow is their day off. They have a long weekend. They do not want to work tomorrow. One can only ask why. Clearly, within the Labor Party there are deep divisions over the Adani issue and the Labor Party are doing everything in their power to delay this so that Adani will walk away and the mine will not go ahead. Could I ask Senator Gallagher again: what will that do for small business in Rockhampton, Gladstone, Clermont, Moranbah, Dysart, Ayr, Bowen, Home Hill, Townsville and Charters Towers? They are looking to Adani to save their businesses.


It is not only the Labor government in Queensland that is very keen to see this happen; Labor mayors of Townsville, Rockhampton and Gladstone are also urging that this native title issue be made certain so that Adani can go ahead and small business will be able to look to a bright future. I hope Mayor Strelow, the Townsville mayor and Mr Burnett in Gladstone—Labor mayors—will be on the phone to Labor Queensland senators saying, 'Please give up a day of your long weekend and sit tomorrow so that we can pass this legislation, so that we can give certainty to the native title owners in that area, who desperately want to see this go ahead.' Why? Because it means jobs for their people. They understand this. That is why they have, by an overwhelming majority, already supported this. It is very important for Indigenous businessmen, and there are a number of very good Indigenous small-business people in North Queensland. They are looking to the Adani project to give their small businesses a boost. But what does the Labor Party do? It takes a day off tomorrow when we could be dealing with the native title legislation and having it passed through this parliament.


Again I plead with Premier Palaszczuk: 'If you are serious'—and I think you are because I know your government desperately needs the revenue from Adani—'please give your Queensland Labor senators'—and there are only four of them so it will not cost you a lot of money in phone calls—'a call and tell them Queensland is desperate for this.' Remember, the Senate is the states house. Labor senators from Queensland should be standing up for their state. This is not a Liberal-National Party person saying this; this is the Labor Premier of the state of Queensland desperately wanting this passed, and yet the Labor Party senators in this chamber want to ensure they have a long weekend by having tomorrow off.


I am pleased that the Labor Party are talking about helping small business, but the example I have just given clearly is like so much the Labor Party do: it is not what they say—talk is cheap; it is what they do. All those small businesses in my home state of Queensland are desperately awaiting this, and what do the Labor Party do? They turn their back on them. I appreciate that Labor has no senators outside the south-east corner of Queensland and their small business minister comes from Canberra, but I urge Queensland Labor senators to get out of the south-east corner and I urge the shadow minister to get out of Canberra and talk to small businesses in those areas and see what they say about Adani and the native title thing. If you were serious in your job, you would do something to make sure that that goes through.


The government on Tuesday night announced a budget that will set the growth in the years ahead in a positive way for Australians. In this budget the government has continued the very substantial concessions to small business in last year's budget. If the Labor Party want to help small business, they will do two things: (1) allow the Adani bill to pass through the parliament tomorrow, by sitting an extra day, and (2) support the budget legislation when it comes forward. As we all know, the Labor Party have not been very good at passing budget measures in the past, but we do ask them to support the extended instant asset write-off that was announced in the budget on Tuesday night. The budget extends the $20,000 instant asset write-off for a further 12 months to 30 June 2018. The turnover threshold will also be lifted to $10 million. This measure will substantially improve the cash flow for small business, helping them reinvest in their businesses, replace or upgrade their assets and employ more people.


The Turnbull government has also committed budgeted money—budgeted money, as opposed to what you will hear from Mr Shorten tonight, who will throw around promises of money without paying for those promises; he will no doubt put it on the big credit card that Labor is very good at operating—to reduce red tape by providing up to $300 million to states and territories to remove unnecessary regulatory barriers. This builds upon the $5.8 billion of red tape reductions delivered by the coalition government.


While I am on this subject, I divert slightly to the low-value GST bill which is currently before the parliament and on which the committee has reported with some comments by the chair. It is a committee on which the government has a majority, but that does not stop us Liberal and National Party senators from criticising or making suggestions to government legislation where we think it appropriate. Senators may have read where the government majority committee unanimously has recommended that the starting date of that bill be delayed by one year to allow agencies and businesses to get ready for it.


The committee also raised an issue in the context of small business and having the shippers actually collect the new tax on goods under $1,000 rather than the vendors, for many reasons which I will not go into here. But I think the government has a different view—although the committee is seeking clarification of this—in that, because the shippers already collect the money for goods over $1,000, why can't they do it under for goods under $1,000? That is a question that the committee has raised, and I look forward to the government explaining that. It seems to me that it would be better to continue in the same vein. I only mention this because I think any senators who go and talk to small businesses outside Canberra will understand that small businesses have been doing it tough in the face of competition from overseas suppliers of goods.


You can understand why buying your goods online overseas is attractive to many Australians, because they do not have to pay the 10 per cent GST. They can get the same goods from the shop downtown, but they would have to pay the 10 per cent GST. Whether you like the GST or not, it is there and it is part of Australian life these days. But, if you buy overseas, your overseas competitor does not have to bother about that 10 per cent. So, for a start, the overseas competitor can sell the goods at 10 per cent less. The low-value GST bill is a way in which the coalition is trying to help small businesses.


I walk around many towns in Central and North Queensland and it is really distressing to see the number of closed shops and to think that many people have put their life savings into these small businesses and they have gone bust. There is a lifeline in Queensland, and that is called Adani. That must go ahead for many reasons but certainly small business in those areas would be delighted to see that happen. I just cannot understand why the Labor Party will not sit tomorrow so that we can debate the Native Title Amendment (Indigenous Land Use Agreements) Bill, which is the last real hurdle holding up Adani going ahead. If we could deal with that tomorrow—the Labor Party say they agree, One Nation agrees and the Liberal Democrats agree—we could get that bill through, Adani could have confidence to go ahead, and small business in central and north Queensland would be delighted. But we cannot get the Labor Party to sit tomorrow—I don't know, they might be used to three-day weekends! But please, why don't we sit tomorrow? You have paid for it, and we could deal with that bill, debate it fully, and hopefully get it passed.


If anyone happens to be listening to this debate and they happen to be from Queensland—and they will understand just how important this is to Queensland, particularly to Queensland's small businesses—then I would ask them to get on the phone and ring the four Queensland Labor senators. There are only four of them; it will not cost you much in telephone costs. But get on the phone to them. It might be a trunk-line call because they are all in Brisbane, and if you do not happen to live in Brisbane there might be a little bit of extra cost, but there are only four of them. Get on the phone to them and say: 'This is important for small business in Queensland, this is important for Indigenous small business in Queensland and this is important for Indigenous workers in Queensland.' It is important for all workers. It will mean 10,000 new jobs in an area which is currently struggling with substantial unemployment following the mining downturn a couple of years ago.


This bill, the Competition and Consumer Legislation Amendment (Small Business Access to Justice) Bill 2017, will not really do anything for small business—




Senator Gallagher:
  That is not what they told me!




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  I am sorry Senator Gallagher; perhaps they do not understand that what you are doing is encouraging more litigation. As a former lawyer, I tell you that if you start on litigation, the only people that will win are the lawyers. Yet this is what the Labor Party is doing; perhaps these days they have a lot of lawyers who are members of their party. That might be why they think it is a good idea.


The government has embarked on another course which we think will help small business. One of the provisions of this bill obliges the Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman to provide legal advice on the prospect of obtaining an order of no costs. That is not good public policy—we should not have government agencies giving legal advice of that nature. If a party took up litigation on the basis of such advice from the ombudsman, and if the courts did not grant this order in their favour, can the party withdraw from the litigation without cost penalty? It is also not clear what liability the ombudsman's office would have for providing legal advice which turned out not to be accepted by the court. So there are a lot of flaws in this bill; unfortunately, time does not allow me to go through all of them.


The government is trying to help small business by giving confidence to the Adani mine, which will really help small business. We are also bringing in tax cuts whereby 3.2 million small businesses will pay less tax as of this current financial year, and more small businesses will be able to access small business tax concessions as a result of the change to the definition of small business, raising the threshold from $2 million to $10 million. Those tax cuts were legislated for in May this year, and that will really help small business. We are reforming the competition policy, as suggested in the Harper review in section 46 on the misuse of market power; we are levelling the playing field for small business, to encourage competition and greater productivity; and we have extended the unfair contract term protections to small business entering standard form contracts—that provision commenced in November last year.


It is no good for Labor to bring forward these bills which they know will not be passed. It is no good for Mr Shorten to get up tonight and promise money he does not have. If they want to help small business, Labor need to support the government's proposals for small business in the back tax—and please, can I ask the Labor Party: if you are serious about small business, sit tomorrow! Curtail your long weekend, and do what you are paid to do: come into this chamber tomorrow and debate this, so that we can get this bill through. It not only benefits Adani, workers and Indigenous people, it also benefits the steel mill in Whyalla—I cannot understand why any South Australian senator would oppose that.

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",NXT,2017-05-11,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (10:50):  I will not be lectured by Senator Macdonald on the issue of supporting Australian industry and Australian steel—



Senator Ian Macdonald interjecting—




Senator XENOPHON:
  Every time Senator Macdonald opens his mouth on this, it is extremely unhelpful. I am one of the few people in this chamber who actually genuinely likes Senator Macdonald—




Senator Dastyari:
  Shame!




Senator XENOPHON:
  No; I acknowledge his long contribution and his advocacy for the people of Queensland, and I do have genuine respect for him. But if he was fair dinkum about the issue of the steel industry and about government procurement—the federal government did not commit yesterday unequivocally to use Australian steel in the billions of dollars they will be spending on rail in this country. They did not commit to that. Instead, we hear all these protectionist arguments.


Every steel contract is important. But, in the totality of what is occurring in the Australian steel industry, there are a whole range of measures: weak anti-dumping laws, and weak laws when it comes to procurement—which have been dealt with to some significant degree by the changes in procurement laws that my colleagues and I negotiated with the finance minister a number of months ago. But we need to—




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  Why won't you support Adani then?




Senator XENOPHON:
   Mr Acting Deputy President, that is very unhelpful in relation to this. As much as I genuinely like Senator Macdonald, that is not helpful.


This Labor bill, the Competition and Consumer Legislation Amendment (Small Business Access to Justice) Bill, is about access to justice. My colleagues and I wholeheartedly support this bill. The intent of this bill is to do something about the chronic lack of access to justice in this country when it comes to dealing with disputes, particularly commercial disputes. As I have done before, I disclose that I am the proprietor of a very, very small law firm with 2.6 lawyers working in it, where we do principally personal injuries work and a bit of commercial work. From my time as a practising lawyer—and I still have a practising certificate, so that I can do my pro bono work in gambling cases and the like—I know that the justice system in this country is broken when it comes to access to justice. There are so many people in this country who have a genuine dispute and who are told by their lawyers: 'You have a 70 or 80 per cent chance of winning.' But they still will not go ahead with that case because of the risk of adverse cost orders which could cause them to lose their home.


But it goes beyond that. There is an independent supermarket proprietor—I will not name that person—who is very successful; he has a significant turnover and employs many, many people in more than one state. He tells me that if Coles and Woolies do something, whether it is predatory pricing or some other conduct, which his lawyers say could lead to a successful action for abuse of market power—under our current laws—his lawyers tell him: 'You have a really good chance of winning. But, by the way, it is going to cost you $3 or $4 million to run it, and you could be up for adverse cost orders of millions of dollars more.' That is not a justice system.


We know what the Productivity Commission said back in September 2014 when they looked at access to justice arrangements. They said:


There are widespread concerns that Australia's civil justice system is too slow, too expensive and too adversarial.


That goes to the nub of the problem that this bill seeks to address. We know what has happened in other countries, including in the UK. My understanding is that this bill picks up on elements of best practice, so that we can have a system where there are filters and safeguards in place before an action is brought, to deal with frivolous and vexatious actions; a system where you need to show that you have a prima facie case where you have a matter that has got real merit in it but that is subject to dispute.


Getting rid of adverse cost orders will not mean that it is going to be a pushover to deal with these cases, but it will mean that at least parties will know what they are up for in terms of their own costs. It will mean that they will not be subject to being 'deep-pocketed' by a much larger corporation that can drive the litigant, the plaintiff, into the ground. This bill attempts to address that. The bill, in terms of the specific provisions, may need some fine-tuning, may need some extra work done to it, but the principle of the bill that has been introduced here by Senator Gallagher is a very good one. That is why we support it.


Can I also say, on behalf of my colleagues, that we also support, with some amendments, the 'effects test' that the government is putting up, in the Competition and Consumer Amendment (Misuse of Market Power) Bill 2016. It is something that the Nationals have been outspoken on and something that I have worked on for many years with people like former Senator Joyce, now the Deputy Prime Minister. We think that will make a real difference for those small and medium businesses in disputes involving large corporations which abuse their market power. But we think that that bill will be so much more effective, will do what it is meant to do, if it incorporates the elements of this bill.


To Senator Gallagher, I say, 'Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.' We are going to flatter you by moving a whole range of amendments based on this bill to the government's effects test bill, because we think that is the right thing to do in order to make that piece of legislation work much more effectively. It is no good having a rolled-gold piece of legislation on an effects test. The effects test needs to be modified. It has been constrained in its current form in terms of the government's bill. If we have these amendments in substance, it will mean that the bill will have genuine teeth, because people will be able to have their day in court without the fear of being bankrupted by taking a meritorious claim to court.


That is why, as a team, we support this legislation. It is a worthy piece of legislation. It is long overdue. I congratulate Senator Gallagher for moving this legislation. This is the way forward. If you want to have effective competition and consumer laws in this country, you must have an effective system of access to justice, and this bill goes some considerable way to achieving it. That is why we so wholeheartedly support it.

"Dastyari, Sen Sam",ALP,2017-05-11,"



Senator DASTYARI
 (New South Wales—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (10:57):  I want to speak to the Competition and Consumer Legislation Amendment (Small Business Access to Justice) Bill 2017, but I feel it is important to address some of the comments that have been made by some of the previous senators in this debate. I will start by echoing some words from Senator Xenophon that he said towards Senator Macdonald—that he is very fond of the senator. Senator Xenophon, I am one of the many senators who are very fond of you, but even I at times have to question your judgement when it comes to friends! Senator Macdonald appeared to spend a large proportion of his time speaking on the bill. I will be speaking a little bit more broadly about other issues. I will take the precedent that we are able to have a wide-ranging debate on this issue.


I want to note the incredible work of Senator Gallagher from the Australian Capital Territory. I do not quite understand why this became a point of attack. Yes, Senator Gallagher is from the ACT. While at times—especially when we have to sit over long winters—we all question the ACT for many different reasons, I do not understand the idea that, because she is a senator from the territory that she represents, speaks to people from the territory that she represents and was the Chief Minister of the territory that she represents, it somehow means that she cannot possibly have had conversations with people outside of the ACT and cannot possibly have had conversations with people in Queensland or other places. I note that Senator Gallagher has actually spent more time in Queensland than the Treasurer of Australia. The Treasurer has not even visited Queensland this year, let alone the Northern Territory, which he has not visited, it appears, since becoming Treasurer. I cannot speak to Western Australia and other states.


I want to commend Senator Gallagher and her predecessor from the other place, the honourable member for Greenway, Michelle Rowland, for the work they have done on this bill. Senator Xenophon touched on this quite well: fundamentally, we in this country have a legal system that is not fair in practice, even when at times it may be fair in theory. There is a huge disconnect between what is the law and what is access to the law. What this bill attempts is to do what it can to close that gap in the legal system—it is not going to be perfect, because there is no perfect solution. We pass bills constantly in this place, and they all seem fantastic and great and they are equitable and fair and we have these great principles of 'everybody is equal before the law', as we should have those principles. At the same time we have a legal system where access to justice makes a big difference. In this particular case, access to justice relates to the power of large corporations, as opposed to the power of small businesses, when it comes to being able to access those legal remedies. That is the real problem, the real challenge, that we have to face and that this legislation attempts to face.


Here is the reality. I come from a family of small-business people. My parents had a small cake store in Castle Hill in the north-west of Sydney when I was growing up. They now own a small business in the Queen Victoria Building—a King of Knives kind of retail outlet. When you deal with small—




Senator Fierravanti-Wells:
  Is that what makes you so effective in the Labor Party?




Senator DASTYARI:
  I will take that interjection. Senator Fierravanti-Wells wants to know whether the fact that my parents own a knife store is what has made me so effective in the New South Wales Labor Party. I remind the senator that the art of using a knife is knowing when not to use one, not knowing when to use one.


There are two separate debates that we are going to have. There is going to be the debate around the effects test. I think the Labor Party position on that has been quite clear. We do not believe the evidence is there and we do not believe that it is the right approach, but there are others who support the view. I have heard a lot of arguments about the effects test. I think it is an important debate to have. It is not mutually exclusive from this bill and it is not mutually exclusive from the debate we are having. They are two separate pieces of legislation. I believe access to justice in fact is a far more important principle than what we are looking at. Frankly, the idea that larger businesses are able to use the threat of the costs that may be incurred from legal action to prevent people from using their rights under the law is a highly concerning one. Let us not kid ourselves: it is a tactic that has been used, not just in business cases. Those of us involved in politics have seen these kinds of intimidatory tactics used, especially around defamation and other areas. But a tactic of big businesses with big pockets is to tie up and make the legal process so difficult and expensive for a smaller business as to prevent them from being able to get the legal remedy that they may seek, to prevent them from being able to get the outcome they may want.


When you as a smaller business are dealing with larger institutions that have their own army of lawyers, that have the sunk cost of in-house counsel—let us deal with a hypothetical: the type of situation where there may be a dispute over a brand or a site or a location of a business. The idea that some small business with a handful of staff is really going to be able to compete at a legal level with the enormity of the legal representation that is presented by some of these companies creates an unfair playing field. While the legislation itself, and how it is written, may not be the problem—the legislation itself presents everyone as being equal before the law—we all know and have seen used time and time again the tactic of having lawyers and access to justice as the vehicle for preventing equity and preventing justice from being carried out.


This bill looks at restoring that balance. It will never be perfect. We are never going to have a system that will perfectly give equal opportunity before the law, but this bill looks at how much of that gap can be closed. It is about making sure our competition laws are better enforced by giving small business a level of access to justice that they do not have.


Businesses have the legal right to take action if a competitor is engaging in anticompetitive conduct. However, it is so hard for businesses to do that even when there is a breach of competition laws, as the justice level between them is so stretched. I think the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, the ACCC—who we will have before our estimates in the next few weeks and we will have an opportunity to go further into the conversation we have with them—have highlighted their concern at the idea that the access to justice is not really there. This bill will address the difficulties small business face in getting that justice, because it does two really important things.


Firstly, it allows the Federal Court to waive liability for costs to smaller business private litigants bringing these cases. Senator Xenophon presented a figure from his life experiences as being those who have a strong case and a good case, but you are never sure before the law, nor should you be—there is always a risk involved when there is a lawyer. A good lawyer may advise that they have an 80 to 90 per cent chance, but that 10 per cent chance of having costs awarded against them may be so significant that they are unable to pursue that action. Secondly, businesses will be able to go to the ombudsman to get early assistance to find out whether they should consider going for these new non-adverse cost orders. In fact, there will be an independent procedure for them to be able to get the information that they need to determine whether they should or should not pursue this.


This is an important equity measure, an important step to be taken for equity. Senator Macdonald spent the whole of his 20-minute speech talking at length about the small business contribution and the small business relationship between the Adani coalmine in northern Queensland—sorry, I will be fair, the proposed Adani mine in northern Queensland—and its impact on small business. The point he was making was about the flow-on effects that a project like that will present to small businesses. I believe that if we are talking about small businesses and we are talking about equity and fairness, then the big issue of fairness that we need to address—and this bill goes in part to start doing that—is the inequity between larger corporations and how they pay their tax and how small businesses, which do not have those legal structures, do not have those opportunities.


Senator Macdonald went on at length about Adani and about their supposed record of being great corporate citizens. I feel that it would be only fair to make a contrast with a company like Chevron, that we have had the opportunity to hear from recently. At the end of April the new managing director of Chevron Australia, Nigel Hearne, fronted a Senate inquiry about corporate tax avoidance held in Perth in Western Australia. This whole notion of inequity between small business and big business was really brought to light for me by seeing a situation where you have a company the size, nature and structure of Chevron that has paid no corporate tax last year, will pay no corporate tax this year, paid no PRRT—petroleum resource rent tax—last year, paid no PRRT this year and will likely not be paying it for many, many years into the future.


When we talk about justice and equity for small business we have to ask ourselves: where is the justice and equity when the small businesses of Australia are paying their taxes, paying their fair share, and the larger corporations are able to structure themselves in ways that allow them not to do so? My issue with the structures of companies like Chevron is not that what they are doing is illegal, as I do not believe what they are doing is illegal. My concern is that in many, many cases what they have done has been legal; what they have done has been allowed under our laws. Sure, there have been some shark tactics—there are matters before the Federal Court at the moment. There are issues that are being challenged by the tax office, and I give the tax office credit for doing that. But these are the real issues—these are the equity issues that have to be addressed.


At the moment, the oil price is $50 a barrel. At today's price, Chevron and other multinational corporations will not pay PRRT, petroleum resource rent tax, for the whole life of the projects. We are giving away this entire resource without getting back the tax that is meant to be there for us to be able to recoup something. How is that fair for small businesses, when they do not have those opportunities? How is that equitable?


We heard from the CEO of Chevron himself, Mr Nigel Hearne. He was previously the CEO of Chevron Appalachia, and under his watch there was an explosion at a Chevron-owned oil well in Pennsylvania that killed a 27-year-old contractor who was working on the site. It also forced nearby residents to be evacuated. Five days after the explosion, when the fire was still smouldering, Chevron sent letters to local residents who might have been impacted and offered them a voucher for a large pizza and a two-litre soft drink. After this incident, the state of Pennsylvania's Department of Environmental Protection issued Chevron with one of the largest fines it has ever levied. The parents of the killed worker reached a $5 million settlement with the company after the state confirmed the site was not properly supervised.


Before that role, from 2011 to 2013 Mr Hearne was the general manager of Chevron's refinery in Richmond, California. This is one of Chevron's largest refineries, and, under Mr Hearne's watch, a fire at the refinery nearly killed 19 workers and caused 15,000 people to seek hospital treatment. According to a report by the US Chemical Safety Board, a federal government agency, a pipe rupture released flammable high-temperature light gas oil, which then partially vaporised into a large opaque vapour cloud that engulfed 19 Chevron employees. The cloud ignited, and the explosion caused a large plume of vapour, particulates and black smoke, which travelled across the surrounding area. There was an emergency warning for three nearby cities in the following weeks, and approximately 15,000 people sought medical treatment at nearby medical facilities, for ailments including breathing problems, chest pains, shortness of breath, sore throat and headaches. California's Attorney-General and the local District Attorney brought criminal charges against Chevron for the incident. Chevron pleaded no contest to six charges, agreeing to increase oversight by state agencies and pay $2 million in fines and remediation costs. Separately, the state's occupational safety and health regulator fined Chevron $782,000 and issued six 'serious' and nine 'wilful' violations for the incident. Less than three weeks after the incident, health and safety inspectors were back at the refinery and issued five 'serious' and two new 'wilful' violations, with fines of over $173,000. This is the track record of the CEO of Chevron in Australia.


We are debating here how it is that there is one set of rules for larger corporations, one set of standards for the big multinationals, and yet, when it comes to small business wanting access to justice, access to decency, access to fairness, that is not present. There is a huge gulf between the ways in which different groups of people, different groups of businesses, are treated in our society. Especially when it comes to justice—and I believe justice relates to tax justice as well as legal justice—we should be asking ourselves: why is it not fair; why do these gulfs exist; why is there this gap?


The bill that we have before us is not going to fix all these problems. The bill that we have before us is not going to fix the huge inequity between small and big business in Australia. No one piece of legislation will. But it goes a step in the right direction towards providing justice. It goes a step in the right direction towards creating a fair, more equitable, more even playing field insofar as it relates to being able to get court access and court justice. This is a bill that represents a commitment that the Labor Party took to the last election. It was developed by wide consultation with a lot of businesses, many of whom said that, at a practical level, the theoretical structure of the law, as important as that is—and everyone believes that is important—it is the practical reality of how it is implemented on the ground that really affects the day-to-day lives of different businesses and that really affects the day-to-day lives of business operators. Where we need to be looking at is not just having the perfect laws in theory passed through our parliaments but making sure that everyone has equal access to that.


Equity in business does not just stop here. There is a huge equity issue. I note that Senator Scullion from the Northern Territory is here and he can talk at length about the challenges of inequity when it comes to, particularly, Indigenous Australians and others. I think we in this parliament do a very good job in many instances in framing laws that we believe are fair and equitable, and that are fair and equitable. But the challenge always is at a delivery level when we leave a chamber like this or a place like parliament. Let us not kid ourselves; we are all very privileged to be here and we are privileged people. Having that same kind of access on the ground on a day-to-day basis and having that same kind of representation before the law—that is always a really big challenge that we struggle with.


In conclusion—and I note I have used up my time—this is a bill that is about making sure competition laws are better by giving a little bit of a leg up to small businesses in the unfair fights that they have to face. Businesses who have a right to access and go laws often do not do so because of the fear of the costs that are associated with it. Even when small businesses have a strong case, they have to be very careful about the fact that larger players have a lot of money and a far greater capacity to fight these cases.


There is a worry that if they lose their case they could face large bills and be driven out of business. They do not have the same kind of risk profile that larger businesses, especially those that have huge in-house legal teams that are already sunk costs, are able to deal with. I note that the ACCC has been very strong on this issue. I note that other consumer groups have been very strong on this issue. I note that the small business lobby has been very strong on this issue.


I commend this bill. I believe it is a bill that should be supported by the Australian Senate.

"Back, Sen Chris",LP,2017-05-11,"



Senator BACK
 (Western Australia) (11:17):  Before addressing myself to the Competition and Consumer Legislation Amendment (Small Business Access to Justice) Bill 2017, I propose to spend some moments on the importance of the Native Title Amendment (Indigenous Land Use Agreements) Bill 2017. Also, I foreshadow that I will be responding to what I believe to have been a highly inaccurate and cowardly statement by Senator Dastyari about Chevron and its now managing director, Mr Hearne. I think it is a disgrace that a person under parliamentary privilege would come in and make the statements that he has made. But I will get onto that in a few moments, because he is wrong. This chamber and those listening need to know just how wrong and how dastardly Senator Dastyari has been in that attack on Chevron.


Let me go, if I may, because it is directly relevant to the opportunities in small business access, to that associated with the native title amendment bill that is before us. I have to urge everybody in this chamber that, before we rise and return to our home states and territories, we have to address this anomaly. It comes about as a result of the fact of a decision of a justice in McGlade in the Federal Court in Perth recently in which he overturned what had been the decision of a justice in Bygrave previously in relation to native title claims, particularly the percentage of native title claimants associated with them. In Bygrave, the justice had the view that so long as there was greater than 51 per cent of native title claimants then it was possible to proceed with what is known as an Indigenous Land Use Agreement. Where the McGlade case has caused the change and has caused the ruction, is McGlade has effectively required 100 per cent of claimants to be in agreement before anything can proceed.


Yes, it has something to do with Adani mine. But, by Jove, that is one of the very few. I learned from my very good colleague Senator Scullion that there are some 126 agreements around Australia associated with native title that are affected by this decision. They are going to affect the benefits to native title claimants associated with those Indigenous Land Use Agreements. These land use agreements are themselves, of course, voluntary. They are providing an opportunity for native title groups to use those rights in beneficial ways, particularly in relation to economic development to provide certainty for all parties doing business on native title land. And if Senator Dastyari and his colleagues, and indeed everyone in this chamber, is genuinely interested in ensuring the continued benefit to native title recipients under those ILUAs then it will be in their greatest interests to make sure we do not rise from this place until we deal with it.


There is a bill before the chamber. It will address the concerns that McGlade has raised, and it is incumbent on all of us. If we fail to, each one of us must go back to those native title groups, including those in the Indigenous areas as well as the companies with whom they deal, and explain to them why there is now no certainty. I know on a personal basis a colleague who, only this week and next week, is associated with some negotiations on native title. This particular person is in the eastern states this week representing the interests of Aboriginal people, and next week in the North of Australia he will be representing the interests of a mining company. He is an absolutely eminent man of great integrity, but I know that this negotiation is now on hold whilst we deal with this issue.


It is the case that a grant that is made under an invalid Indigenous Land Use Agreement will itself be invalid against native title—that is in my state with the Noongar people for whom this particular judgment was made in the Federal Court by Justice McGlade. It will have application right around Australia and, I dare say, the islands adjacent to us. This is of critical importance and, if people really want to do something in the small business space to continue to encourage Aboriginal people under these ILUAs, to continue to encourage other companies to deal with, to participate in and to work for the improvement of people in those communities, it is essential that we deal with this native title amendment Indigenous land act.


I appreciate the fact that Senator Dastyari has remained in the chamber—I thank you for that. Senator Dastyari made the comment a few moments ago—and, if Hansard proves I am wrong, I am willing to be corrected—through you, Acting Deputy President, that Chevron had paid no corporate tax in the last couple of years. I can tell you that—perhaps wrongly—I used a mobile phone in the chamber to check only in the last few minutes with the senior executive of Chevron of Australia, who assured me that in the last four to five years that company has paid no less than $4 billion of tax. If you listen to Senator Dastyari, you would be invited to draw the conclusion that company had paid no tax. Those were the words that were used: no corporate tax paid. They were your words—through you, Acting Deputy President. Senator Dastyari should know about the petroleum resource rent tax. It is a super profits tax after you have met and have reimbursed certain costs. He is making the comment that, in the projects with which Chevron is associated, they have paid no PRRT. For heavens' sake, the project at Gorgon on Barrow Island has only got two of three new LNG trains up and running. The project at Wheatstone has not yet commissioned its first one. How in heavens' name would a person who pretends to have the economic knowledge that Senator Dastyari pretends to understand and believe and stand up in this place and draw the inference that this company has paid no PRRT when indeed they have not yet got to the stage of making a profit? What Senator Dastyari failed to say was that this company, Chevron, which he is so keen to run down, has invested no less than—




Senator Dastyari:
  They paid no corporate tax last year. Are you claiming they paid corporate tax last year?




Senator BACK:
  Isn't it amazing? Did I interrupt Senator Dastyari when he was attacking a fine company investing billions of dollars in my home state? No, I offered him the courtesy of silence. But the words that I am saying are resonating with Senator Dastyari, because he is trying to close me down.




Senator Dastyari:
  You are lying.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Marshall
):  Senator Dastyari, you will not use those words in this place, and you will withdraw them.




Senator Dastyari:
  Sorry, Mr Acting Deputy President—which words? I am not quite sure what you want me to withdraw.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  You do know which words you have to withdraw, and you will withdraw them.




Senator Dastyari:
  Sorry, I withdraw any comment. I genuinely did not mean offence.




Senator BACK:
  I assure you, Senator Dastyari, no offence was taken. I do want to place on the record the fact that this company, in two major projects—at Gorgon and Wheatstone—are investing US$130 billion. To put it into perspective, in today's dollars, that is a project 15 times the size of the Snowy Mountains Scheme—US$130 billion. They will employ 19,000 people in construction. Over the 40-year life of those two projects they will contribute trillions of dollars to the Australian economy, over 100,000 jobs, billions of dollars in taxes and royalties, and, yes, a petroleum resource rent tax. They have invested billions of dollars with local small businesses in Western Australia, around Dampier, Onslow and the other ports. They have effectively developed the town of Onslow. Whilst comments were made by Senator Dastyari—about a person who cannot defend himself and on projects outside of Australia—I can relate to this chamber, as I have done in the past, the very fine occupational health, safety and welfare record of that company.


Finally, in passing, before I go back to addressing the subject of this discussion today, I should say to those who have any concerns about Chevron in the environmental space that Chevron's Gorgon project on Barrow Island is, in fact, in an A-class reserve. It is by far and away, as a result directly of Chevron's investment and care for the natural environment of Barrow Island, the best managed A-class reserve anywhere, not only on mainland Australia but around the Australian coastline. I reject, totally and thoroughly, the assertions made by Senator Dastyari.


I now turn, if I may, to the bill that is before us. I say very proudly that the coalition government always has and always will back small business. We will back it like a Melbourne Cup winner: up the straight, all the way, past the finishing line and through to the parade area. I will tell you why—because it is the engine room of the Australian economy. It employs nearly five million Australians in rural regions, in remote areas of Australia and in suburbs. It employs people at the lower end of the skills level as well as through to highly skilled people. It is the most versatile of all of the employment groups in this country. I am very proud to say that, in the budget of only the last couple of days, we announced a further tax cut for small business and, of course, we will see the company tax rate reduced to some 25 per cent. For those who quite rightly say that an enormous number of small businesses are not companies, it is important to record that there is also a five per cent tax discount for unincorporated companies, for sole operators and partnerships. These are the real issues that help small businesses and encourage further employment of young people and older people in our economy. There is the tax deduction of being able to write off in the one year $20,000 for assets purchased, and multiples of them—not just one. As a restaurant and cafe owner said to me when we first introduced this, 'I can now bring forward by four months the start of my new business because I can purchase different equipment to make that operation run—each one up to $20,000—and I can write it off fully in the first year.' That restaurant is up and running with 14 or 15 staff already.


I am very proud to say what the coalition government is doing and will continue to do. Having run small and medium sized businesses and still assisting constituents where I am able to, in terms of their obligations under the BAS, PAYG, superannuation et cetera, I can say it is the small-business person who really does the work for the Tax Commissioner. They fill out the BAS at the end of every quarter, make sure that the superannuation commitments are met and paid and ensure, of course, that workers compensation insurance and public liability insurance are paid. It is no wonder it is so difficult to make a quid in small business. But this government has cut red tape by $4½ billion, simplifying those processes that I was just speaking about, and removing many small businesses—up to half a million of them—from the PAYG system.


A scheme which I am very minded towards and I think needs enormous support from the parliament is the employee share scheme. If we can get employees to actually own shares in the business in which they are employed, then of course they have that greater incentive, because they themselves are part of the ownership. I, for one, will be watching that aspect of it very, very closely.


We have seen in recent times the opening up of the China-Australia, the Korea-Australia and the Japan-Australia free trade agreements. The best example of all, of course, is the cherry producer in Tasmania who has taken his cherry exports from a very small proportion to being a very significant exporter of that horticultural product into the Chinese market with significant improvement in employment, as I understand it—perhaps Senator McKim would be more familiar than I am and might know—




Senator McKim:
  I used to work for him.




Senator BACK:
  There you go: we have proof here of the evidence of not only the quality of the product but also, hopefully, the quality of his staff—through you, Deputy President, to Senator McKim.


These are the initiatives being taken by this coalition government in the services sector and the commodities sector to encourage small business even more. An ombudsman being appointed—and reference is made to the ombudsman in the bill being proposed by the Labor Party, and I will speak some more about the ombudsman's position. It is proposed in the bill to enable the ombudsman to provide assistance, as I understand it, with advising a private litigant on the arguments that might be made and the evidence needed to satisfy a court to grant a no adverse costs order. That of itself sounds all right. The only problem is: to what extent might it compromise an ombudsman who afterwards may have been seen to have given advice to an applicant or to a private litigant only to find out that that advice is now the subject of a challenge? We cannot really have a circumstance in which the ombudsman could themselves be the subject of a court action as a result of incorrect or inadequate advice given to a litigant. So there are, I think, difficulties associated with that particular element.


I applaud the Labor Party for putting this bill before the chamber. It recognises that they do have an understanding of some of the challenges associated with the issues of small business in Australia—expanding small business.


For those of us who have been in business all our lives, we actually do not like the term 'small business' all that much. It suggests that you want to remain small. Of course you do not want to remain small; the whole objective of business is to grow that business and move, perhaps, towards medium business and, in so doing, to employ more people.


I come back to the employee share scheme: imagine the scenario as long-trusted employees are part of an opportunity to expand a business and then indeed the next step—not always the best step for a business in my own experience—to move into export markets and be able to develop both your services and/or commodities along those lines.


Mention is made in this legislation—and I come to the decision of the coalition government in accepting the recommendations of the Harper review on the repeal of section 46 of the Competition and Consumer Act and replacing it with a provision that prevents firms with substantial market power from engaging in conduct that has the purpose, effect or likely effect of substantially lessening competition. I join with Senator Dastyari in the concept of the capacity of a larger company to be able to use its market power, market strength, to be able to dominate a small business. I have no difficulty with that argument; he just chose the wrong example in my humble opinion.


I will give you an example of some of the big retailers who will proudly announce to the retail market that they are going to undertake a huge discount of some product, only then to go back to the farmer, the supplier or the horticulturalist and say, 'Oh, by the way, we're undertaking a big discount on milk'—or a big discount on chicken or a big discount on some other product, be it almonds or whatever—'and, by the way, we're going to pay for most of it by reducing the payment to you in that scenario.' That is abuse of market power. It places the small business in a situation where they cannot negotiate their way out of that, as they are locked into supply and of course they have no alternative. So there are definitely circumstances where we have to ensure that big business does not have that unfair competitive advantage.


Legislation that we have introduced in this space, the Fair Work Amendment (Small Business—Penalty Rates Exemption) Bill—which we introduced into this parliament in 2015—is directed at protecting the interests of small business and indeed protecting the interests of employees in small business. We have also of course seen the involvement of the ACCC. In November of last year they released their report going to the whole concept of unfair trading relationships between large and small business, particularly where small businesses are, in a sense, forced to sign contracts or are at least influenced to sign contracts. Under the provisions of the ACCC, which the government accepted, we now know that a small business can challenge a term in a standard form contract, which is also a small business contract, on the basis that it is unfair. Big business were not happy with us, and they lobbied very, very hard against us. But the decision was taken to ensure the protection of small business.


As we all know, most small business people are their own accountant, their own person associated with marketing and they are their own person associated with sales. As I said earlier, at the end of every quarter they are the person sitting down trying to work out the BAS, trying to work out revenue and expenditure and trying to make sure they get superannuation liabilities paid et cetera. They are not the sorts of organisations that have huge teams of lawyers, accountants and others.


The coalition will continue to support small business by way of entrepreneurship, by way of innovation and by way of start-up and particularly by protecting small business when it comes to competition with big business and indeed with big unions. Whilst the Labor Party's bill is there to be debated, it does miss most of the elements important to small business.

"Ketter, Sen Christopher",ALP,2017-05-11,"



Senator KETTER
 (Queensland) (11:37):  I rise to speak to the Competition and Consumer Legislation Amendment (Small Business Access to Justice) Bill 2017. In commencing my comments I want to commend the work of Senator Gallagher in putting together this bill, which I think is very much targeted at the heart of the problem regarding competition between large and small businesses.


Before I go to my more substantive comments on the bill, I feel compelled to make some comments in respect of the contribution made by Senator Macdonald earlier in the debate. Senator Macdonald, in the course of his contribution, found ways of talking about Adani and the native title bill and then went on to discuss the low-value GST report which the Senate Economics Committee has handed down and had a good discussion about some of those points. In their own right, there were some interesting and perhaps constructive comments made throughout parts of Senator Macdonald's contribution, but they certainly lacked any connection with the very worthwhile bill that is before the chamber for consideration today, which is unfortunate.


I welcome Senator Xenophon's support for this bill. I note that he said that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery and that there would be comparable amendments coming forward from his party in relation to government legislation to address this area. I think that illustrates the fact that this bill does go to the heart of many of the problems that are affecting small business—they are fighting in the marketplace, trying to do the right thing and conduct their business, but they are rubbing up against the interests of big business, who have a substantial advantage over them.


We know that this is an issue. Senator Dastyari, in his contribution, talked about that issue—where businesses have deep pockets, they are able to, essentially, deny others the right to access justice. This is a huge concern. It has been identified by the Productivity Commission, which made some recommendations in respect of protective cost orders in 2014. We know that this is a very important issue. Unfortunately, we do not see a great deal of wholehearted support for this proposition on the other side. Instead, we see the government going down the track of the proposal to amend the effects test, which we have some concerns with.


This bill is the right pathway to improve competition in our economy. On our side of the chamber we understand small businesses and the struggles they face against the much bigger, well-funded and well-advised corporations. We know that small businesses face many barriers when it comes to taking action against anticompetitive behaviour by the big end of town. Rather than implementing the Deputy Prime Minister's latest thought bubble, which was the effects test, this bill delivers real change for small businesses.


An effects test is shorthand for a test that looks at whether conduct engaged in by a firm with a substantial degree of market power has the purpose, effect or likely effect of substantially lessening competition. This is dangerous economic policy. It is not just Labor that is saying this. I note that, in relation to the inquiry into the government legislation, the Waste Buying Group—a waste and recycling services business in the commercial industrial marketplace—made a submission which was quite informative. This business indicated that it was operating in an industry dominated by huge multinational firms who practise a range of tactics designed to hold a client bound to service contracts. They say the consequence is that it leads to poor competition in the marketplace and results in high prices and poor service outcomes for the client base.


One would think that this is one of those types of businesses that would wholeheartedly embrace the effects test and any purported effort to even up the position of large and small businesses. However, that is not the case. This business indicates that small business and clients will simply not be able to afford the costs of expensive trials in relation to this matter. Based on their experience, they believe that the ACCC will be overwhelmed with work, under resourced or just not interested. They believe that the ACCC—this is their own view, not my own view—is not an authority they can rely upon to advocate for the industry. In their submission, they recommended the introduction of an affordable tribunal to adjudicate abuse or market-power competition issues, so that small businesses or their clients could access it. That is a good illustration of the fact that this is not a Labor thought bubble; this is something that does have support out there amongst small businesses who understand that the government's approach is flawed.


The effects test risks making business afraid to compete, which ultimately hurts consumers. This will create a legal risk every time a business seeks to lower prices for their customers, and what obviously will happen in that situation is that consumers will be the losers. This is at a time when we are all faced with cost-of-living pressures. We know that we have wage growth at record lows. We know we have increasing unemployment and below trend economic growth. In this environment, we need all of the resources of the market to bring prices down so that consumers can benefit from that, so that families can make ends meet. This is a hugely important consideration.


Labor are not the only group of people warning of a lawyers' picnic if the government's legislation on the effects test were to pass. The small business lobby group COSBOA themselves have stated that they are concerned that the wording will create a lawyers' picnic, as predicted by the opponents of the effects test. When even the original proponents of the policy are saying that it is dangerous, you know that the government has made a complete mess of competition policy.


Labor do welcome strong competition policy, but it must be informed and enforced, and the government package is neither. What we are seeing are dangerous legislative proposals without addressing either the resources of the ACCC, which was commented on by the Waste Buying Group submission, or making it easier for small businesses to litigate in their own private capacity. In the words of former Treasurer Peter Costello, 'a so-called effects test will protect competitors, especially less efficient ones, from competition'. 


Since 1974—and I think this point has been made previously—there have been at least 10 inquiries into Australia's competition laws which have considered a proposed effects test and rejected it. Apart from Professor Harper's review, only one other inquiry has ever recommended it. So there is a reason why 10 out of 12 inquiries have recommended against an effects test. The reason for that is it is bad law. It is going to have a detrimental impact on the consumer. In the submissions to the Harper review, the effects test has been described as legally unworkable, something that will chill competition and something that will create uncertainty for business. These changes will deter job-creating investment in Australia by adding to the new layers of red tape and barriers to investment which have already been imposed by the coalition government.


It is little wonder that the government's own former Minister for Trade and Investment, Mr Robb, is opposed to this latest anti-investment measure. The Turnbull government's proposed effects test is a move to satisfy internal politics. This is not about policy. A level-headed analysis of the effects test shows that the Prime Minister is using competition policy as a political prop. We know that the Prime Minister himself has said previously that he would be deeply concerned about the introduction of an effects test, and we have seen other people such as Mr Samuel, the former ACCC chairman, saying:


Under the Harper amendment, businesses would curb their competitive behaviour because of the legal risk. This would have drowned the commercial activity of big business in a sea of uncertainty. Lawyers and economists would need to sit at the right hand of business CEOs to guide them on the legality of every significant transaction.


It is quite clear that it is Mr Joyce, the Deputy Prime Minister, who has become the government's chief economic spokesperson, and this is detrimental to the Australian consumers and the broader economy.


Labor understand that cost orders from courts represent an insurmountable barrier for many small businesses. We have the Competition and Consumer Act, but if it is too expensive for small businesses to take action then clearly that is a problem; our society is the worse for it, with some anticompetitive conduct not made public and not properly addressed. It should not be acceptable today for big businesses with deep pockets and armies of lawyers to overwhelm small businesses. The legal fees are a significant obstacle for small businesses across this country.


To generate this public good of a fair, competitive economy, it is important that small businesses be given the ability to raise court actions without the threat of long, expensive and protracted court cases. It is important that a well-funded and well-advised large firm is not able to wear small businesses down. The Turnbull government has refused to address this inequity despite, as I said earlier, the Productivity Commission and the government's own competition review saying that small businesses are disadvantaged in the court process. Labor's Competition and Consumer Legislation Amendment (Small Business Access to Justice) Bill 2017 will restore the balance by letting a small business request a no adverse costs order early in the court case. Allowing small businesses to seek relief from adverse costs orders at an early stage of the judicial process will provide financial certainty to the private litigant. A judge would hear this application and decide on the merits. This would require amendments to the Federal Court Rules.


This is a sensible change, a pro-small-business move that empowers them to make full use of the laws that we have on the books. It is also in line with international trends. Other countries are trying to find ways to encourage private litigation so the public interest can be served. In the United States there is a view that public interest in private litigation occurring is so great that positive measures should be taken to actively encourage it. Consequently, a private party which successfully proves an antitrust claim is entitled to treble damages—three times the proven loss caused by the conduct. No such policy currently exists under Australian law. In the European Union the commission has called on all jurisdictions in which costs follow the event, as in Australia, to carefully review the appropriateness of this approach in competition cases as, again, there is considered to be a significant benefit to the public when private matters are pursued through the courts. In the United Kingdom the Competition Appeals Tribunal has been established and has been granted discretion to make any order it sees fit in relation to costs, as opposed to the usual rule. So there is international interest in the approach that has been taken by Labor on this matter. It shows that we are at the forefront of seeking to address one of the key concerns that small businesses have today.


When it comes to the issue of mitigating risk, Labor's legislation will enable the Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman to provide professional assistance as to whether the no adverse costs order is likely to be successful. There are risks when opposing no adverse costs order. Where legal action has no or little cost, the risk of frivolous or vexatious litigation increases. In fact, if legal action is of sufficiently low cost, the threat of vexatious legal action could be used when negotiating with a larger firm. However, these risks can be mitigated and do not outweigh the potential benefit of increasing private litigation under the Competition and Consumer Act. It is proposed that the small business ombudsman be funded to vet applications, preventing adverse costs orders under part IV of the Competition and Consumer Act. This process is designed to provide advice to the potential litigant and will not mandate a no adverse costs order in any court case. This will help small businesses to better understand their prospects of obtaining a no adverse costs order and will act to reduce the risk of frivolous litigation where the ombudsman does not see merit in the litigation. This will not constitute legal advice under this bill, and the ombudsman cannot provide advice and support to private litigants. The ombudsman will be restricted to assessing whether there is the possibility of a no adverse costs order. Where the ombudsman positively vets an application from a potential private litigant, a letter of support will be provided to the applicant. This nonbinding letter of support would indicate to the applicant that there is a good case for a no-costs order to be approved by a judge.


This is a pragmatic approach and it is the sort of approach that gives small business the confidence to use the legal system. Unfortunately, there is a widespread view amongst not only small businesses but also other members of the community that, when they are taking on a large adversary in the court system, they might as well not even try, because the odds are stacked against them. This very pragmatic approach breaks down those barriers to access to justice. It assists small businesses and private litigants, as opposed to the introduction of the effects test, and confers a useful and practical power on the new ombudsman. A three-person section in the small business ombudsman has been costed at $500,000 per year.


Small business is crucial to Australia's economy. The budget that we have just seen confirms that Mr Turnbull is a Prime Minister for the big end of town over those working hard to grow their businesses and create jobs. Small businesses make up 97 per cent of businesses in Australia and are the engine room of the economy. We all use that terminology, but it is true. They employ more than 4.7 million people and contribute in excess of $343 billion to the economy every year. This scale simply cannot be ignored. That is why we would like to have seen Mr Turnbull and the Treasurer put more of a focus on small and medium businesses in the budget instead of focusing on the big end of town.


This bill is about making sure our competition laws are better enforced by giving small business access to justice. Businesses have the legal right to take action if a competitor is engaging in anticompetitive conduct. However, at the moment it is very hard for small businesses to do this, even where there is a clear breach of our competition laws. Even where a small business has a strong case, they have to think very carefully about the fact that larger players have money and a far greater capacity to fight these cases. Of course, there is the worry that, if they lose, they will face huge legal bills. We know that small-business people have gone into business often leveraging their homes, taking on financial burdens and employing people. This means, in effect, that small players are discouraged from taking action to enforce Australia's competition laws. This is contrary to the public interest.


This bill will address the difficulties small businesses face in getting access to justice under Australian competition laws. Small businesses are too often discouraged from pursuing strong cases. This bill empowers small business to go forward to enforce our laws to ensure that the legal system is fairer for everyone and to ensure that true competition applies. Consumers are the winners in that situation. This is a win-win bill. I encourage those opposite to support this bill.

"Watt, Sen Murray",ALP,2017-05-11,"



Senator WATT
 (Queensland) (11:57):  I am pleased to follow Senator Ketter to speak in support of the Competition and Consumer Legislation Amendment (Small Business Access to Justice) Bill 2017, which has been lodged and introduced by Labor. It is another sign that, despite the government's rhetoric to the contrary—and I will come to that a little bit later—Labor does have a very good understanding of the real needs of small business and is prepared to take action via introducing legislation like this to back in small business and ensure that they do get a fair deal and a level playing field.


Anyone who has dealt with small business or has run a small business understands that small businesses do face many barriers to taking action, especially against anticompetitive behaviour by the big end of town. One of the reasons for that is that big businesses do invariably have deep pockets and armies full of my former profession, lawyers. The risk of small businesses being overwhelmed and having to pay big business's legal fees is a significant obstacle when they are considering standing up for their rights. Unfortunately, even though this inequity has been recognised for a very long time, the Turnbull government has, nevertheless, refused to address this inequity. That is despite the government's own Productivity Commission and competition review saying that small businesses are disadvantaged in the court process.


As I say, I am very pleased to speak in support of this private member's bill introduced by Labor. As its name suggests, the Competition and Consumer Legislation Amendment (Small Business Access to Justice) Bill 2017 will help deliver some level of access to justice to small business. It will restore the balance by letting a small business request a no adverse costs order early in a court case. For those who have not been involved in litigation before, first of all I say: well done! It is something that is very well worth avoiding if you ever get the opportunity.


But one of the strengths of our system of litigation, particularly compared to the American system, is that, generally speaking, if a party brings legal action against another, particularly for a civil claim, they do have to think twice about whether that legal action has good prospects of success and whether it is frivolous because, at the end of the litigation, Australian courts do typically award costs to whichever party succeeds in a case. So, if you bring legal action against someone and make a claim against them, you need to think about the prospect that, if you lose, you may be facing quite a hefty order to pay at least a portion of the successful side's legal costs.


Overall, I think that is actually a good thing in our legal system. We do, from time to time, see what seem to be absurd examples of litigation in the US, and I think everyone would acknowledge that the US's legal system is pretty out of control compared to Australia's. We hear terms like 'litigation frenzy'. It is a much more litigious society than our own, and I think that one of the reasons for that is that, generally speaking, American courts do not order costs against an unsuccessful party in litigation, so there is not a tendency to issue adverse costs orders, and that means that people in the US can, pretty much without any repercussions, initiate legal action even though it may actually not have very much prospect of succeeding. We do not have that system in Australia. We have a system where unsuccessful parties in litigation run the risk of having to pay the successful party's legal fees, or at least a significant proportion of them, so that does give people pause for thought before they charge into a lawyer's office threatening to start legal action. Of course, the downside of that is that, if you are a smaller player, whether a small business or an individual, the fact that you may, at the end of a litigation, need to pay the other side's costs, again can be a bit of a deterrent from taking legal action which might actually be warranted.


As a lawyer, I have had many occasions where I have advised small businesses and other smaller parties, whether individuals or families, who have come to me with what, on its face, seems to be a reasonable claim—a claim that, though you never have a 100 per cent guarantee when you start legal action, on its face looks like it might have a reasonable prospect of succeeding—but, as the person's lawyer, you are obviously duty-bound to inform them that if all goes wrong and they do lose then there is a possibility that they could be up for the other side's legal costs. I have certainly personally advised more than one potential client about that, only to see them say, 'It's just not worth the risk,' even though they may have had a reasonably strong chance of succeeding in their legal action. The kind of work that I did—acting, usually, for plaintiffs—meant that they did not have the same level of resources as companies that they would take on, and very often they would weigh up the risks and decide that it just was not worth the risk of getting an adverse costs order. So that is a deterrent to litigation and sometimes does tilt the scales a bit too much towards big business.


So our bill, Labor's bill, seeks to restore that balance by letting a small business request a no adverse costs order early in a court case. As I say, we do not want that used frivolously. We do not want that to open the floodgates to litigation. So one of the other things that this bill provides for is: when a small business seeks a no adverse costs order early in a court case, a judge would have the ability to decide that, if the case has merit, the small business will not have to pay a big business's legal costs. So there is a check and balance in there. An application would need to be made to a court, and a judge would still need to weigh up the evidence. It would not be a full hearing of the case, because that in itself would run up massive legal costs. But this bill seeks to get that balance right, giving small businesses the opportunity to present their case, or a portion of their case, and have a judge determine whether the case has some merit and then have the ability to issue a no adverse costs order.


This bill will also enable the Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman to provide professional assistance as to whether the no adverse costs order is likely to be successful. Again, we do not want people just trotting off to court and starting up legal action that has no prospect of success and that inevitably will result in an adverse costs order. This bill provides a capacity for small businesses to get some advice, prior to taking legal action, about whether a no adverse costs order is likely to be successful.


Working as a lawyer for over 10 years, I have had many instances where I have advised small businesses and other clients about their chances of succeeding in litigation, and they have weighed up the costs and the benefits. Most recently, before I entered the Senate, I practised in the area of class actions, which is a relatively new area of law in Australia. It has been going a lot longer in the US. I had the privilege of acting for individuals and small businesses in a couple of fairly large class actions. One was on behalf of shareholders in the National Australia Bank, and that was an action essentially about misleading the share market to do with the subprime crisis in America. Another class action that I was privileged to be involved in was on behalf of hundreds of horse breeders and horse owners and other people in the horse industry, who brought a class action against the Commonwealth in relation to a massive quarantine failure.


I mention this because many of the clients that we were acting for in those two class actions—and the firm I worked at obviously runs many more than just those two—were small businesses. If you spoke to them, there was no way that an individual shareholding small business or an individual horse industry small business could possibly have had the resources to take on either the National Australia Bank, in the first case, the shareholder case, or the Commonwealth of Australia, in the case concerning quarantine failures. These people had absolutely suffered some sort of financial loss through the wrongdoing of either the Commonwealth or the National Australia Bank. There was always going to be the matter of having to prove that it was the fault of the defendant, but there was no doubt these people had suffered financial losses, some in the thousands of dollars, some in the tens of thousands and some in the millions. But, no matter what size of loss they had suffered, there was absolutely no way they had the resources to fight a prolonged legal battle against some of the biggest defendants in the country, who would roll out their armies of lawyers and paralegals to review every single document. They would incur millions and millions of dollars in legal costs and invariably drag out a court case. 


Class actions tend to run for three or four years. They are long, complex pieces of litigation. But there is no way that the ordinary small business out there can undertake that kind of legal action on an affordable basis. And that is one of the reasons we have seen a growth of litigation funding in Australia, where class actions can be run by plaintiff law firms, who have the security of getting their fees covered as the case rolls on. But the clients, the small businesses who take this legal action, only end up having to pay back those legal costs if they have a successful outcome.


I think that our class actions system in Australia, with litigation funding, has evolved to an extent that it does provide access to justice for many small businesses, who can band together, rather than each taking individual action against a large defendant for a similar wrong. They can band together with dozens or hundreds of other businesses or individuals who have suffered similar losses as a result of the same wrongdoing. They can come together and have someone else pay their legal fees and take the risk of an adverse costs order if the action is unsuccessful. That way, they are able to get access to justice which they would not be able to get on an individual basis. 


But, while it is true that our class actions system and litigation funding system in Australia has evolved to an extent that it can provide access to justice to people, there are nevertheless some cases which are too small to be run as a class action and be viable.


The reality is that, as I say, they are long, complex cases where legal fees are expensive. If you are talking about a loss that has been suffered by people of, say, $10 million to $20 million all up, at one level that is a large amount of money, but, once you get legal costs taken out of that, there would not actually be a lot of money left over. That is the kind of instance that this bill will support. It will give opportunity to small businesses whose losses are not so great that they can afford to take the risk of incurring lots of legal costs and incurring adverse costs if they are unsuccessful in their action. We want to make sure that small businesses that have suffered relatively smaller but significant losses can still have their day in court. That is a pretty basic right in the Australian legal system, and this bill will enable that by giving some level of protection for small businesses that they will not face an adverse costs order if they bring a case that does have some merit but, at the end of the hearing, fails. All in all, this bill will give small and medium businesses greater power to enforce their rights under Australia's competition law.


The other thing I wanted to touch on in my contribution to this debate is an incredible misconception which has been perpetuated by conservative parties and some of their supporters in the business community over many years—that is, only those in the conservative side of politics are friends of small business. It is one of those mantras that we hear from conservative parties—and I can see my friend Senator Smith over there agreeing with that mantra. Well, he is wrong, and not for the first time. I know it is an article of faith in conservative parties that they are the defenders of small business and that Labor is anti-small business. If you have a look at the facts, you will see that nothing could be further from the truth. I will be honest—there are some issues that, from time to time, Labor takes a different position to—




Senator Hume:
  Penalty rates.




Senator WATT:
  I will come to that, Senator Hume. There are times when Labor takes a different position on issues to some parts of small business. Penalty rates is an example of that. We have heard some small businesses be vocal about their desire to see penalty rates being cut. But equally—and this does not get quite as much attention—there are many small businesses out there that are quite happy to pay penalty rates to their employees. And they remain so despite the decision of the Fair Work Commission, backed in by this government.


Even in the duty electorates that I represent in Queensland there have been high-profile examples where small businesses have come out publicly and said that they want to stand by their employees. They understand that, if they pay their employees properly, and if all other small businesses do so as well, that will ensure there is a flow of money coming through a particular town that can be spent in other small businesses. It does not help small businesses to impose a massive wage cut on employees of those businesses, because all they are going to do is keep their money in their pocket and not spend it in the neighbouring small business down the street. I can think of a butcher's store near Yeppoon in Central Queensland which has come out publicly and said that they are going to continue paying penalty rates to their workers on Sundays—and good on them. Lush, who are a retail chain that sells bath products that my wife likes to go and spend lots of money on all the time, have said that they are going to maintain penalty rates for their employees. Again, good on them! They are taking a broader view than the penny-pinching view that some businesses take, which is a very short-term attitude that sees them cut back on their wages bill without understanding that what they are actually doing is cutting their own throats by reducing the amount of money that is available for their own customers to spend in their own business and in the businesses down the street.


Even with an example like penalty rates in which conservative governments and conservative parties hold up as something that all small businesses hate, it is actually not the case. There are many who understand that supporting their workers with decent wages actually enables the entire society and entire communities to prosper, which in turn creates more jobs.


I was reflecting on my very brief time as a state member of parliament in Queensland, and I well remember some of the conversations that I had with small businesses in my old electorate, particularly in the suburb of Albany Creek. There was a jeweller that I used to run into from time to time. He ran a jewellery store that was, basically, a family business. His biggest complaint was never things like penalty rates or tax issues, or the things that conservative governments trot out; his biggest complaint was that he could not get any fair treatment by the shopping centre owner, who kept on lifting his rent and lifting the payments he had to make to the shopping centre owner for utilities, whether it be electricity or water or other things. There was nothing he could do as an individual small-business owner to take on the shopping centre owner. There was no way that he would have the resources to wander into court and take up what seems to be quite a legitimate claim and quite an abuse of the law by a shopping centre. There was no way he had the resources to do that and in addition face the risk that, if he lost any legal action, he would potentially have to pay the costs of the shopping centre owner in that litigation. This bill will help people like Wayne Goddard, who ran that jewellery store, and will help many other small-business people right around the country. It will give them the ability to take up legitimate legal action against big business without the fear of having to pay a massive legal bill at the end of a case if it does turn out to be unsuccessful.


Some of the other things that small businesses raise with me as impediments to their business: I was in Rockhampton last week meeting with small businesses there, and one of the biggest complaints that they had was the difficulty they have dealing with big business and having no certainty about orders placed for their products by big business. That was what was stopping them putting people on to work for them. They did not know from month to month whether their major big business customers were actually going to keep ordering from them. We heard that from farmers. We heard that from manufacturing firms who were supplying to some of the biggest multinationals in the mining industry. 


They are the kinds of things that are stopping small business from growing. We do not hear anything whatsoever from this government about how they are actually going to support them and how they are going to overcome those problems. Instead, this government, like conservative parties before it, just keeps on pulling out the old bottom drawer, pulling out the tax stuff, pulling out the penalty rate stuff and ignoring the fact that there are many small businesses who are quite comfortable with arrangements as they currently stand and actually have real problems, different problems, that this government is ignoring.


If you speak to any small business in the country, whether it is someone who is operating from their home or from a small shop, the first thing they are probably going to hit you up with is the NBN and the failure of this government to provide a decent telecommunications network which will allow them to operate quickly and efficiently, and communicate with their suppliers and their clients and people overseas. This government has had a gross failure in the provision of decent telecommunications infrastructure in this country, particularly through the NBN. I am sure someone must have done some kind of analysis of the impact that that has had on economic growth. They are the real difficulties that small business is facing in this country and they are the things that this government should be concentrating on.


In particular in this bill, this is another attempt by Labor to even the playing field between big and small business. It will give small businesses their day in court for the very first time, and I would hope that the alleged supporters of small business sitting opposite might rethink this and support the bill.

Senator HUME
 (Victoria) (12:17):  What incredible hypocrisy. I have never heard anything like it: an attempt by Labor to level the playing field between big and small businesses. That is extraordinary. I know you have heard those words, Senator Watt, come from this side of the chamber, but I have to put my hand on my heart and say it is the first time I have ever heard it come from your side of the chamber. The Labor opposition have constantly opposed good quality, sensible, pragmatic policies that this side of politics, that this side of the chamber, have put forward to look after small business—those 3.2 million businesses that currently employ more than six million workers. Indeed, they are the engine room of the economy. Senator Ketter was right in saying that. They are the small businesses that we go to every day. They are the small manufacturers, the fish and chip shop down the road, the bakery, the small grocery on the corner—these are the people that keep our economy going, that keep our economy alive. Only a coalition government genuinely looks after small business. Labor looks after big business. It looks after its big business, big union mates, but it never comes to the rescue of small business, not with any genuine credibility. This bill is no different.


I am rising today to speak about the Competition and Consumer Legislation Amendment (Small Business Access to Justice) Bill 2017. This proposed bill from Labor, if enacted, would see private litigants given a power to request a no adverse costs order at any stage of a competition case. That is a part IV action under the Competition and Consumer Act. That is any stage of a competition case that they have brought before a court under proposed subsections 82(3) to 82(4). If a court grants such an order, the legal fees of the defendant would be prevented from being transferred to the litigant. In order to make a no adverse costs order, a judge must be satisfied that the action has a reasonable prospect of success and it raises an issue that may be significant for persons or groups other than the applicant, and that the disparity between their respective financial positions of the applicant and respondent is such that the respondent could use the possibility of a costs order against the applicant as a means to deter the applicant from pursuing the action. That is in proposed subsection 82(5).


The proposed bill would enable the Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman to provide assistance with advising private litigants on the arguments that might be made and the evidence that is needed to satisfy a court to grant that no adverse costs order, and the Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman would provide assistance preparing those arguments under this bill's proposed section 15(c) and 74B of the Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman Act 2015.


It will come as no surprise to have heard previous speakers in this chamber say that the government does not support Labor's bill. The main reason it does not support this bill is that the bill overpromises and yet will fail to deliver its objectives. There is no point in Labor promising access to justice for small businesses when the current law, section 46, is broken. If Labor is genuine about supporting small businesses, then they should support the government's changes to section 46 of the Competition and Consumer Act.


For the benefit of the chamber, it is probably worth giving section 46 some context. On 24 March 2014, the government commissioned an independent competition policy review, known colloquially as the Harper review, of Australia's competition framework. The key focus of the Harper review was to identify impediments across the economy that restrict competition and reduce productivity. It was described as the first root-and-branch review of Australia's competition laws for 20 years. The review panel, chaired by Professor Ian Harper, undertook extensive consultation with businesses, consumers and other industry stakeholders. The misuse of market power was one of the top issues raised in submissions to that review, with stakeholder opinions divided as to the efficacy of section 46 in deterring anticompetitive conduct.


On 31 March 2015, the Harper review released its final report. The report made 56 separate recommendations on Australia's competition framework. Those covered most sectors of the economy, with implications for almost all levels of government. In examining the misuse of market power provisions, the review panel considered section 46 to be deficient in its current form. On 16 March 2016, the government announced its final position on the Harper review recommendations and agreed to adopt in full the review's recommended changes to section 46 of the Competition and Consumer Act. The Prime Minister, the Treasurer and the Assistant Treasurer emphasised the government's commitment to strengthening Australia's competition policy. They commented:


... the amendment of section 46 to deal with the unilateral and anti-competitive conduct is an important step to ensure Australia has the best possible competition framework to support innovation and boost economic growth and jobs.


Indeed, the Minister for Revenue and Financial Services, the Hon. Kelly O'Dwyer MP, explained how those proposed amendments would support and promote pro-competitive conduct in business for the ultimate benefit of Australian consumers. I quote the minister. She said:


These amendments will make markets work better for the benefit of all Australians and help to lift our long-term productivity growth. They will ensure that all business can compete on a level playing field—


that sounds familiar, doesn't it, Senator Watt?—


rewarding innovative and dynamic businesses that provide the best services at the lowest cost. This will benefit households by giving them more choice and better value products and services.


Section 46 is what is broken. This bill is entirely unnecessary.


The changes to section 46 that the government has proposed will genuinely level the playing field for small businesses to ensure that they compete on merit against those businesses that have substantial market power. The changes to section 46 balance the small business to big business market relationship and will do far more to assist small businesses than the proposed bill under discussion today. These changes are necessary and they are championed by the small business sector.


This piece of proposed legislation is expensive and time consuming. Labor's policy encourages small businesses to engage in litigation—it actually actively encourages it—and potentially that could be vexatious legislation. It does not, however, assist in the resolution of disputes at the earliest available opportunity or at the least cost to parties and to the courts. Labor's policy will, in fact, do the very opposite: it will encourage businesses to commence litigation. The applicant and proceedings will still have very high legal costs and a high evidentiary burden in challenging legal thresholds to establish a breach of the current section 46. The seeking of the order itself carries with it a legal cost in satisfying the court that the order satisfies the hurdle tests—a cost which would be borne by the small business applicant. And, if the court grants a no adverse costs order, the applicant must still fund its own case, and the case is likely to be complicated by the legal argument about the facts and addressing the expert advice brought by the respondent. The costs to the applicant for its own legal representatives are still very likely to be high.


But, most importantly, is the role of the Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman. The functions given to the ASBFEO would require the ombudsman to provide legal advice on the prospects of obtaining an order, and that is not at all appropriate for a public statutory office of this nature. It is not clear how a party who took up litigation on the basis of such assessment and subsequently did not obtain an order in their favour could then withdraw from litigation without a cost penalty. It is also not clear what liability the Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman would have should the party not be successful in obtaining an order in their favour. A party in receipt of a no adverse costs order would be incentivised to take up belligerent litigation tactics, which are very unhelpful for the presiding judicial officer and for the other party who is acting in good faith. As it stands, this bill would allow a party to request a no adverse costs order when it becomes aware that it does not have a reasonable prospect of success, rather than withdrawing the case, which is what should happen in these circumstances. 


The bill would also fundamentally change the role of the Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman from advocacy and assistance. In particular, the addition of this function would severely limit the Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman's ability to advocate on issues. Advocating and assisting are what it does. They are its two key functions. The Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman advocates under a number of different activities, including conducting inquiries and research, working with other realms of government, contributing to other inquiries and promoting good business practice, and it assists because it understands the challenges that face small business owners. The Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman provides dispute resolution services for those who may be involved in a disagreement so that they can try to provide a solution to the problem without having to resort to costly litigation. The provisions of this bill fall outside the current remit of the Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman and would create an undue burden on that office. Additionally, Treasury does not consider that the Labor Party's estimates of the cost of $1 million reflects the full cost of this policy. Small business is indeed the engine room of the economy, but the Labor Party is no friend of small business.

Senator SMITH:
  I move: 


That the report be adopted.

",Senate,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Selection of Bills Committee</title>,COMMITTEES,6,1
"Gallagher, Sen Katy",ALP,2017-05-11,"



Senator GALLAGHER
 (Australian Capital Territory—Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate) (12:32):  I think that an amendment to the motion of Senator Smith on the Selection of Bills report has been circulated in the chamber. I move:


At the end of the motion, add ""and, in respect of the:


(a) the Australian Education Amendment Bill 2017, the provisions of the bil be referred to the Education and Employment Legislation Committee for inquiry and report by 9 August 2017; and


(b) Higher Education Support Legislation Amendment (A More Sustainable, Responsive and Transparent Higher Education System) Bill 2017, the provisions of the bill be referred to the Education and Employment Legislation Committee for inquiry and report by 9 August 2017"".


The opposition is moving two amendments to this report to ensure that the two education bills which deliver the government's latest policy announcements on funding for schools and higher education receive the appropriate scrutiny by Senate inquiries.


The two bills are the Australian Education Amendment Bill 2017 and the Higher Education Support Legislation Amendment (A More Sustainable Responsive and Transparent Higher Education System) Bill 2017. The schools package is a large and complex arrangement which covers all schools in Australia. The funding agreements the Commonwealth has released are only for the Commonwealth. States will be required to have to look at the arrangements and make their own commitments. At this stage, state governments have not been provided detail about funding in this complicated package.


There is also a COAG meeting scheduled in June to discuss the school funding issue, bearing in mind this meeting has been delayed several times. The only information available to stakeholders and parents is a website which outlines funding arrangements based on the government's new policy. 


There needs to be sufficient time to assess the impact of these measures across the system. Committee meetings across the winter break will ensure that all parents, teachers and stakeholders can have their say. It will also ensure that states and territories are not blindsided by a rushed legislative package from the Commonwealth.


The higher education bill contains the government's latest higher education reform package, which represents a wholesale cut to universities and an impost on students. The nature of this package is also complex. There are $3.8 billion in cuts. Students have to pay more and faster, and a significant amount of analysis needs to be done. This includes measuring the impact of how repayment changes for HELP impact young Australians, especially at a time when they are entering the workforce, trying to save for a house and start a family.


The package also flags around $500 million a year, or 7.5 per cent of the Commonwealth grants to universities, being pulled for performance funding. It is unclear how this will work. Universities are concerned about the implementation of this with its potential to be a 7.5 per cent cut. Further, the impact of the efficiency dividend and changes to postgraduate courses will have a significant impact on Australia's nearly 900,000 domestic university students.


We believe greater scrutiny is required, and this is required through a considered committee inquiry. The government has had a year to devise this package. We believe the sector should have more than four weeks to allow the Senate to analyse it. So, in terms of our amendments, we would seek that both of those bills were referred to the education and employment legislation committee for a reporting date of 9 August to allow those proper consultations and scrutiny to occur.

 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate, Minister for Communications and Minister for the Arts) (12:35):  I seek leave to move amendments to Senator Gallagher's proposed amendments.


Leave granted.




Senator FIFIELD:
  I move:


That in respect of:


Paragraph (a), omit ""9 August 2017"", substitute ""14 June 2017"".


Paragraph (b), omit ""9 August 2017"", substitute ""16 June 2017"".


I will not delay the chamber other than to say that the government believes that a month is a good and reasonable amount of time to give consideration to these packages of legislation. There has been, and will be, a high degree of scrutiny and interest in the various forums of the Senate. We expect that those will be fully deployed by colleagues in this place and that the time frame available is reasonable to do that.

Senator HANSON-YOUNG
 (South Australia) (12:37):  I rise to speak to the amendment originally moved by Senator Gallagher. I think it is a good compromise. A 9 August reporting date for both of these bills does give a substantial amount of time to look at the consequences. I want to be clear: I do know that there are some people and voices out there wanting certainty about what their funding models and funding packages will look like. And we have heard that.


Weighing up those concerns and the ability for the Senate to inquire properly, I am glad that the Greens and the Labor Party have been able to get to a consistent position of a reporting date of 9 August.

Senator SMITH:
  I move: 


That the report be adopted.

",Senate,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,COMMITTEES,6,2
"Gallagher, Sen Katy",ALP,2017-05-11,"



Senator GALLAGHER
 (Australian Capital Territory—Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate) (12:32):  I think that an amendment to the motion of Senator Smith on the Selection of Bills report has been circulated in the chamber. I move:


At the end of the motion, add ""and, in respect of the:


(a) the Australian Education Amendment Bill 2017, the provisions of the bil be referred to the Education and Employment Legislation Committee for inquiry and report by 9 August 2017; and


(b) Higher Education Support Legislation Amendment (A More Sustainable, Responsive and Transparent Higher Education System) Bill 2017, the provisions of the bill be referred to the Education and Employment Legislation Committee for inquiry and report by 9 August 2017"".


The opposition is moving two amendments to this report to ensure that the two education bills which deliver the government's latest policy announcements on funding for schools and higher education receive the appropriate scrutiny by Senate inquiries.


The two bills are the Australian Education Amendment Bill 2017 and the Higher Education Support Legislation Amendment (A More Sustainable Responsive and Transparent Higher Education System) Bill 2017. The schools package is a large and complex arrangement which covers all schools in Australia. The funding agreements the Commonwealth has released are only for the Commonwealth. States will be required to have to look at the arrangements and make their own commitments. At this stage, state governments have not been provided detail about funding in this complicated package.


There is also a COAG meeting scheduled in June to discuss the school funding issue, bearing in mind this meeting has been delayed several times. The only information available to stakeholders and parents is a website which outlines funding arrangements based on the government's new policy. 


There needs to be sufficient time to assess the impact of these measures across the system. Committee meetings across the winter break will ensure that all parents, teachers and stakeholders can have their say. It will also ensure that states and territories are not blindsided by a rushed legislative package from the Commonwealth.


The higher education bill contains the government's latest higher education reform package, which represents a wholesale cut to universities and an impost on students. The nature of this package is also complex. There are $3.8 billion in cuts. Students have to pay more and faster, and a significant amount of analysis needs to be done. This includes measuring the impact of how repayment changes for HELP impact young Australians, especially at a time when they are entering the workforce, trying to save for a house and start a family.


The package also flags around $500 million a year, or 7.5 per cent of the Commonwealth grants to universities, being pulled for performance funding. It is unclear how this will work. Universities are concerned about the implementation of this with its potential to be a 7.5 per cent cut. Further, the impact of the efficiency dividend and changes to postgraduate courses will have a significant impact on Australia's nearly 900,000 domestic university students.


We believe greater scrutiny is required, and this is required through a considered committee inquiry. The government has had a year to devise this package. We believe the sector should have more than four weeks to allow the Senate to analyse it. So, in terms of our amendments, we would seek that both of those bills were referred to the education and employment legislation committee for a reporting date of 9 August to allow those proper consultations and scrutiny to occur.

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate, Minister for Communications and Minister for the Arts) (12:35):  I seek leave to move amendments to Senator Gallagher's proposed amendments.


Leave granted.




Senator FIFIELD:
  I move:


That in respect of:


Paragraph (a), omit ""9 August 2017"", substitute ""14 June 2017"".


Paragraph (b), omit ""9 August 2017"", substitute ""16 June 2017"".


I will not delay the chamber other than to say that the government believes that a month is a good and reasonable amount of time to give consideration to these packages of legislation. There has been, and will be, a high degree of scrutiny and interest in the various forums of the Senate. We expect that those will be fully deployed by colleagues in this place and that the time frame available is reasonable to do that.

Senator HANSON-YOUNG
 (South Australia) (12:37):  I rise to speak to the amendment originally moved by Senator Gallagher. I think it is a good compromise. A 9 August reporting date for both of these bills does give a substantial amount of time to look at the consequences. I want to be clear: I do know that there are some people and voices out there wanting certainty about what their funding models and funding packages will look like. And we have heard that.


Weighing up those concerns and the ability for the Senate to inquire properly, I am glad that the Greens and the Labor Party have been able to get to a consistent position of a reporting date of 9 August.

Senator CAROL BROWN
 (Tasmania) (12:52):  I rise to talk to the Disability Services Amendment (Linking Upper Age Limits for Disability Employment Services to Pension Age) Bill 2017. This bill amendments the Disability Services Act 1986 to link the upper age limit of the Disability Employment Services Disability Management Services program, referred to as DMS, to the age pension eligibility age under the Social Security Act 1991. The key change to the bill involves the removal of the reference to '65 years of age' and replaces it with the term 'pension age' as defined under the relevant subsections of the Social Security Act.


Labor supports this bill. Labor has a proud record of supporting vulnerable groups in our society. Labor is proud of the track record of support for people living with a disability and very supportive of the Disability Employment Service Disability Management Services that have enabled disability clients across the country to access a range of services that assist them. A gap in service provision would be created without the amendment to this bill. Labor also notes that the financial impact of this recommendation is a modest one, estimated to be $4.6 million over the forward estimates. I commend the bill to the Senate.

Senator POLLEY
 (Tasmania) (15:05):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Finance (Senator Cormann) and the Attorney-General (Senator Brandis) to questions without notice asked by Opposition senators today relating to the 2017-18 Budget.


I have listened to those answers today, and it is very clear that this budget is so—



Honourable senators interjecting—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Polley, could you resume your seat. There is too much noise in here and I am not absolutely certain that your microphone is on. If you resume, we will try again.




Senator POLLEY:
  I am taking note of answers provided by Senators Cormann and Brandis to questions asked by Labor senators.



Senator Abetz interjecting—




Senator POLLEY:
  In fact, Senator Abetz, we are not missing anything out of this budget. What is very clear about this budget is that it is a reflection of how out of touch and arrogant the Turnbull Liberal government is. In fact, because you are still in the chamber—through you, Madam Deputy President—let's go to Tasmania. Senator Duniam came into this chamber yesterday espousing what he said were great outcomes for the Tasmanian community. Well, he was wrong, because there is no money for infrastructure for Tasmania. He was trying to do justify announcements that had been made previously. The Mersey Hospital funding is not new money and has already been announced. But, because the government have no good news, they want to try and re-announce and re-announce. The Building Better Regions Fund is not specific to Tasmania. The Launceston City Deal was announced weeks ago—so nothing new there—and the Regional Jobs and Investment Package was announced at the election last year. Consequently, there was nothing new there.


But what is new is that this government are so far out of touch that they are slugging ordinary Australians to put more money into millionaires' back pockets. That is what they are doing. Millionaires get a $16,400 increase in their pay—that is the difference between them and working Australians. And we know, because they seem to be so proud of it, that the government are moving towards trying to ensure that hardworking young Australians do not have the same access to university as most of the people in this chamber had. That is what this government are doing. They are not investing in young people. What they are doing is making sure that the big end of town is looked after—because that is what they do.


We have seen senators from that side come in since Tuesday night trying to defend a budget that they cannot defend. We know from at least the last four budgets that this government have brought down that, yes, there is a bit of a sugar hit for a day or so until we actually drill down and expose them for the frauds that they are. It is quite clear that Prime Minister Turnbull cannot be trusted. Prime Minister Turnbull has let the Australian people down time and time again. He cannot be trusted with Medicare and he cannot be trusted to protect the health system. We know that he certainly cannot be trusted when it comes to education, because $22 billion has been taken away from every Australian child in this country. That is what the government have done in terms of education.


We have seen, yet again, unemployment and youth unemployment increasing in our home state. I am disappointed that Senator Duniam, who is in the chamber, thinks it is such a light-hearted matter to talk about young people and the unemployment rate, when we know what a severe crisis we have in our home state of Tasmania. The government are targeting young Australians. They are targeting people who cannot get a job, who are out there every day trying to get a job. What are the government doing? They are doing what they always do—that is, slug ordinary Australians to protect the big end of town.


I listened very intently to the budget on Tuesday night. And what did I hear that was there for aged care and ageing Australians? There was absolutely nothing, except for one small thing—



Senator Duniam interjecting—




Senator POLLEY:
  I am not in government, Senator Duniam.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Through the chair.




Senator POLLEY:
  But we did a lot more when it came to aged care than what you ever did. I would have thought that you might have learnt something through the aged-care workforce inquiry that you had been on. I thought that you might have at least got a grasp of the issues that are fronting the Australian community and the aged-care sector. But, quite clearly, once you step into this chamber you say very different things to what you do through the media and within the community in Tasmania. I am bitterly disappointed. It just demonstrates that, in this chamber and in your own caucus, the Liberal Senate team from Tasmania has no influence whatsoever over this government—none. You had given a commitment that you would fight for community health centres in Tasmania and you have delivered nothing new in preventive medicine—nothing at all.


What we have seen is a government that has denied the Australian people. As we get older, we need services and we need a commitment from a government with a plan. (Time expired)

Senator REYNOLDS
 (Western Australia) (15:11):  I too rise to take note of the ministers' answers on the very fine coalition government's 2017-18 budget. I commend them for it. I have to say that, in listening to Senator Polley then, all I could think of is that wonderful Monty Python's Life of Brian skit, 'What have the Romans ever given us?' She was exactly like that: 'What have they given us?' We have given health care, education, infrastructure—and the list goes on and on and on. The sad thing is—



Senator Polley interjecting—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order!




Senator REYNOLDS:
  I would like to say that I am astounded by the hypocrisy of those opposite, but, unfortunately, and very sadly, I am not. It has become par for the course in this chamber. It would have been farcical if it was not so serious for not only this generation but, at least, the next two generations, who will be paying back the debt that those opposite have incurred for this nation.


As every Australian household and every Australian mum and dad who look after their household budget know, if you want to spend more money you have three options. You increase your income—you take on another part-time job. But, in the case of the Australian taxpayers, we actually then have to increase taxes. So that is option 1. The second one is you borrow more money. The third is you actually have to increase taxes. They are the only three ways. We all know what those opposite do. They promise, promise, promise. With their hand on their hearts, they talk about compassion endlessly. They make promises, but the thing that they always fail to do is fund them. Promises are dirt cheap. They are politically populist and they are easy to do. But actually delivering—



Senator Cameron interjecting—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order!




Senator REYNOLDS:
  Promising and properly funding are what we do on this side. Despite all the 'Ministry of Truth's' alternative truths trotted out by those opposite, let us just go back and remind ourselves of the facts. In 1996, when Labor lost government, they left us and the Australian taxpayers with $96 billion worth of debt. That took the Howard-Castello government 10 years to pay off—10 years of prudent financial management to pay off. In fact, 21 April 2006 was actually the first ever debt-free day. We had very high hopes back then that that would then lead to future governments living within the national means and being fiscally responsible. Sadly, we all know what happened. In 2007, those opposite inherited—and Penny Wong was part of that—not only zero debt but money in the bank. We had money in the bank. We could actually set up the Future Fund.




Senator Duniam:
  What did you do with it?




Senator REYNOLDS:
  Exactly, Senator Duniam; what exactly did you do with it? You went on the most recklessly irresponsible spending spree, which will now leave Australians with at least $550 billion worth of debt—five times that that the previous Labor government had left us to pay off. And it took us 10 years to pay that off. Those opposite would have us continue borrowing or raising taxes, trading on the economic security of future Australians so that they can spend today. What have we heard from those opposite? They spend. In the three years that I have been in this place, I cannot recall those opposite ever once suggesting an alternative way of paying for funding and expenditure. Not only that, but we have tried many times in this place to put forward sensible proposals to reduce government expenditure, and what they do? They block, block and block. They do not engage in sensible negotiations to compromise to find a way forward. The people of Australia elected those opposite, as they did those on this side, to take hard decisions and do what is in the best interest of all Australians.


My apologies to George Orwell and his wonderful dystopian classic, but listening to those opposite talking on the budget, and listening to the interjections and to the senator previously, I keep thinking of the Ministry of Truth. Just because you say it does not make it true. Alternative truths have no place in this chamber. (Time expired)

",Senate,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Budget</title>,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS,11,1
"Singh, Sen Lisa",ALP,2017-05-11,"



Senator SINGH
 (Tasmania) (15:16):  I rise to take note of answers provided by the ministers to the opposition's questions during question time. I was going to start by stating the fact that there is no-one on the government side that is talking about debt, but we have just heard one senator. There is finally one senator in this place, Senator Reynolds, who is game enough to talk about debt. I give you full points, Senator Reynolds, for raising that big, ugly word, 'debt'. You are the only one in your government doing so. You know why no-one is raising it: because under this government, debt has blown out to half a trillion dollars. From what they started with in 2013 to where they are now is an incredibly dark, dark hole.


On that dark, dark hole, the government has tried to be really tricky. It has tried to be really tricky and really clever with this budget. It has been crawling around in the dark for some time. Finally, it has decided to turn on the light and adopt Labor's approach for fairness. But, in doing so, they have tried their best to copy us, and they have failed. They have failed dismally. It fails the fairness test miserably. It fails on health. It fails to implement the Medicare freeze—in fact, Medicare cuts will stay in place for three years. On top of that, veterans' health has been cut as well. It fails in education. University students will pay more for their degrees, and pay earlier. University funding is down 2.5 per cent. It rips $22 billion out of schools compared to Labor's original Gonski deal. It fails on housing affordability, one of the most crucial issues facing our country. Instead, property investors will still get more government assistance than first-home buyers. It fails our economy, because growth is down, employment is down, wages are down and jobs are forecast to be down by 95,000.


The only thing that is up is that nasty word that Senator Reynolds was willing to talk about: debt. The debt is up. The deficit is up. In fact, the deficit is 10 times bigger than the Liberals' first budget predicted. It is so bad, this budget—despite them trying to gild it as something that is fair—that during the question time that we just had the government's own senators could only get the gumption to ask two questions on the budget. Two questions! This is the day after. Here we are, the day after, with the big fanfare of fairness, and they have hit the wall already. They could only ask two questions on the budget. That is how good this budget is. That is how fair this budget is. That is how much they want to go out there and sell this budget. The reason they do not want to go out there and sell it is because they do not believe in fairness. They do not believe in fairness and they never have. I do not think there has ever been a time that I have agreed with Andrew Bolt, but today there is going to be a breakthrough! I have to agree with these words in Andrew Bolt's column today:


Turnbull is plagued by seeming a stand-for-nothing guy who blathers.


Andrew Bolt has summed up Turnbull in that sentence, because he does stand for nothing. We do have, unfortunately, a Prime Minister who stands for nothing.


The Liberal Party stands for nothing so much that it has tried to backflip on some of its fundamental ideological policies by introducing new taxes. At the same time, it has held onto some of them by, of course, ensuring it gets rid of taxes for the rich. We still end up with that old Liberal mentality of letting the rich pay little tax and attacking those on a low income. How on earth can you call a budget fair when you are attacking some of the lowest-income Australians and letting the rich get off scot-free?

"Duniam, Sen Jonathon",LP,2017-05-11,"



Senator DUNIAM
 (Tasmania) (15:21):  It is great to be able to contribute to this debate. I have to start by pointing out that today, of course, we expect to see the opposition leader hand down his response to the budget in the other place. I very much look forward to seeing what is in that document. Is it going to be the answer to all the criticisms that have been levelled at the government and everything critics think we have done wrong? I doubt it. I do not think many people listening at home today are going to be surprised to learn that opposition senators are criticising a government budget. I do not think anyone is surprised that nothing we do is right in the opposition's eyes. But, sadly, that is the coloured view they have and we just have to deal with that.


In taking note of the answers that we have provided, it is important to reflect on some of the questions that were asked. As Senator Cormann's first answer pointed out, this is not really about the substance of the budget; this is not really about ensuring that Australians get the best deal out of budget management by a government. This is all about juvenile student politics—'gotcha' moments, 'How much is this figure?' and trying to get people on those little points. Instead, it is important to focus on the substance.


I take issue with points made by the two previous opposition speakers, Senator Polley and Senator Singh, that things have all gone down—things are bad. Hang on, what about the NDIS? Australia is a great country where we want to look after everyone. We want everyone to have the right to live a fulsome and whole life. The cynical question asked by Senator Wong, trying to link tax concessions for business—that they seem to be terming 'the big end of town'—as being paid for by the Medicare levy, when the point was made that the levy, which comes into effect in two years time, is going to fund the NDIS to support our most vulnerable. It was a cynical and disappointing move. I think Australians will understand that that is what that levy will do.


To Senator Polley's point in her contribution suggesting that the state of Tasmania missed out in the budget, I urge her to have a look at the budget yet again and look at the points where we have been funded. It is ridiculous for Senator Polley to suggest that, because those things were not new announcements on budget night—despite the fact that they were in the budget and funded in the budget—they do not count. She is saying to the people of the northwest coast that their $730 million-funded Mersey Community Hospital is not important; it was not a coup for them. The certainty that they now have in having 10 years of funding from the Commonwealth government to support this vital piece of health infrastructure is not important, because it was not new in the budget.


Then you look at other infrastructure funding in Tasmania: Midland Highway upgrades from Epping Forest to Powranna—$19 million this year; Midland Highway safety works from Mangalore to Bagdad—$20 million; Midland Highway work south of St Peters Pass to Tunbridge—$10 million; Midland Highway upgrade of Perth link roads—$25 million. And Senator Polley says to this chamber that there is nothing in the budget for Tasmania? What are those numbers? I do not understand what she is missing here. There is the freight rail revitalisation for Tasmania, which is $12.85 million. And the list goes on.


Indeed, on the issue of schools funding in Tasmania, the point has been made by me and others in this chamber before that, under the deal that the others claim is a cut—a cut to their imaginary money—Tasmanian schools in all sectors, government, Catholic and independent, in 2017 received the highest per student funding of any jurisdiction in the country, except for the Northern Territory. And then in 2027, by the time we get to the end of the deal, the same three sectors will also continue to receive the highest funding per student, except for the Northern Territory.


To suggest that Tasmania has got the raw end of the stick here and has not done well out of the budget is just completely wrong. I urge Labor senators from Tasmania, rather than trying to come in here and score political points, to actually go and read the budget and be honest with the Tasmanian people about what is in there for them, including the Mersey Community Hospital, the NDIS funding and the improved school funding for our state. I think that is what people expect—for you to be constructive. 


As I said, I look forward to the alternative budget and all of those mentions of Tasmania and all the money for Tasmania that is going to be in the alternative budget.

"Watt, Sen Murray",ALP,2017-05-11,"



Senator WATT
 (Queensland) (15:26):  Before I move to discussing the effect of the budget in Central Queensland, I would just like to correct one thing out of question time. Senator Brandis, in answer to a question from Senator Bilyk, continued to maintain this myth from government that there has been no cut to funding under their school funding arrangements. I would like to table part of the government's own document, which was released when they made their announcement, which says very clearly that compared to Labor's arrangements the government's package represents a saving of $22.3 billion over 10 years—otherwise known as a $22 billion cut.


What I would mostly like to talk about today is yet another dramatic failure from arguably the biggest failure in the House of Representatives, and that is the member for Capricornia, Michelle Landry. This is the member of parliament who was so irrelevant to her own government that she was kept in the dark over the election announcements the government made about the Shoalwater Bay Defence land expansion and the need to compulsorily acquire properties to go ahead with that. She has been a complete failure on jobs, and we are seeing increasing levels of unemployment and jobs walking out the door in Central Queensland, without any action from her. This week's federal budget is yet another gross failure from an incompetent member of parliament who does not deserve to be here.


Many people will be aware that recently Rockhampton experienced another flood, its fourth flood in the last decade. I was up there during the flood and saw the damage for myself. As a result of that, the opposition leader, Bill Shorten, made a very firm commitment that was backed by Jason Clare, our shadow minister for northern Australia, the other day. We are putting $25 million on the table to help construct this levee and to make sure that Rockhampton does not have to go through these floods over and over again.


You would think that a competent local member would get behind this and would actually be in the ear of her Prime Minister and her Treasurer, demanding money for this flood levee and threatening to cross the floor. You would think she would do whatever it took to get the money for her community. But instead all we are seeing from Michelle Landry, the member for Capricornia, is just more pathetic excuses and more dithering as to why she cannot get the job done.


There was another incredibly embarrassing failure from her in Rockhampton's The Morning Bulletintoday. When asked about the levee, she said that there is a lot of contention over this, as many people outside of Depot Hill, one of the flooded suburbs, have concerns about the levee. But, when she was asked for a figure of how many people outside of Depot Hill have concerns, Ms Landry did not offer a number or an answer. That is because she is making it up as she goes along. Then she stuck to her line that full community support is needed before she is going to back a flood levee to protect her own constituents from flooding. But the article goes on to say that, unfortunately, Michelle Landry was not able to clarify what constituted full support. Is it 100 per cent? Is it 95 per cent? Is it  90 per cent? What about these locals and businesses in Rockhampton who have to go through floods, every couple of years at the moment, and have an incompetent local member who cannot get through the door to see her Prime Minister and her Treasurer to demand funding for her electorate?


At the end of the article Ms Landry desperately did not want to talk about the levee any longer, so she tried to put up the fact that funds had been provided to build the Yeppen bridge, which is a critical piece of infrastructure I have travelled on myself, and ensure that Rockhampton during these floods remained connected to Queensland for the very first time. The only problem with this, Ms Landry, is that it actually was not your government that got this done. Ms Landry is pointing to the Yeppen bridge, which was commenced and funded by the last federal Labor government. So not only is she incapable of actually getting money from her own government to build a flood levy; she has to walk away and talk about past federal Labor government achievements to try to detract attention.


It is no surprise that she keeps pointing to federal Labor commitments in her electorate. In the long list of projects she tried to pass off as being new projects that she managed to win in this budget she had in there a couple of projects that again were funded and commenced by the former federal Labor government. While Michelle Landry has been the member for Capricornia, this government has done so little to build infrastructure in her own area that she has to desperately try to pass off infrastructure that was provided by the last federal Labor government years ago.


Michelle Landry is like a dodgy used-car dealer who has an old, beaten up lemon of a car that no-one wants to buy anymore. She is dusting off the rust, winding back the odometer and trying to present it as a new car. There is not one new project in the list of projects that Michelle Landry has put forward as her great achievements in this year's budget. Instead, she has got yet another regional growth fund when we have already got three or four different funds operating for Central Queensland and none of them have actually spent any money or provided any jobs. Michelle Landry is not up to the job. (Time expired)

Senator LINES
 (Western Australia—Deputy President and Chair of Committees) (15:37):  by leave—I present the report of the parliamentary event organised by the Inter-Parliamentary Union and the UN Women at the 61st session of the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women, 'Empowering parliaments to empower women; making the economy work for women', which was held in New York in March 2017. I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the report.


Leave granted.




Senator LINES:
  I move:


That the Senate take note of the document.


In March of this year, I attended a two-day forum organised by the Inter-Parliamentary Union and the UN Women at the 61st session of the UN Commission on the Status of Women. I represented the President of the Senate, and I have just presented my report.


The forum explored the concept of how we empower parliaments to empower women and how we make the economy work for women. The forum was well represented and provided the opportunity for many countries to report on the status of women. Delegates from across the world engaged in discussion and debate on the issues of and solutions to women's economic empowerment.


The stark reality for women across the globe is that we continue to struggle, bearing the burden of unpaid work in caring for children and elderly parents, or heading up families as the major breadwinner. Women across the world continue to earn significantly less than men, are underemployed and continue to bear the brunt of domestic and family violence, and sexual harassment at work and elsewhere.


On women's economic empowerment, Chidi King, Director of the Equality Department of the International Trade Union Confederation, said:


For the majority of the world's women, having a job is no guarantee of sufficient income to meet the most basic needs.


Gender based pay gaps continue, as does occupational workplace segregation. Unfortunately and persistently, Australia has a highly gender-segregated workforce, and our gender pay gap has stubbornly hovered around 19 per cent for the past two decades. This means that, without positive action and intervention, we will continue to trap young women still at school into a lifetime of lost earnings and opportunities.


In my state of Western Australia, the pay gap is a whopping 23.9 per cent. Some people say this can be attributed to the mining boom. That of course is a myth. The gap was there before and during the boom and remains there after the mining boom has long gone. It has historical links and industrial links, particularly related to the industrial laws which enabled employers in Western Australia, under the Court Liberal government, to offer rates of pay lower than the awards. Overnight, we saw rates of pay, penalty rates and hours of work fall in sectors where women predominantly work. Women caught in a gender-segregated workforce lost pay—mostly around $3 an hour—and the gap that was exacerbated then remains today.


Across the globe, this workforce segregation is replicated, as women are concentrated in domestic work, health, aged care, child care, hotel work, retail, cleaning and so on. Women are less likely to be in regular paid employment. This lack of decent work, along with retrenchment, privatisation and outsourcing of public service, the promotion of export processing zones and the enormous growth in supply chains, now the dominant mode of global trade, has increased pressure on women. Women are migrating for work, and they work in the informal economy.


In Australia we have seen open slather in some sectors of our economy, led particularly by unscrupulous labour-hire companies, with overseas workers getting ripped off and franchise companies such as 7-Eleven ripping workers off over and over again. Certainly in the Senate's visa worker inquiry, which I chaired, we saw evidence of labour supply chains going right back to the home countries from which exploited workers were drawn.


Internationally, we pin our hopes on the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. This is an opportunity to address persistent gender inequalities at work and at home and to lift up women's economic empowerment. It reaffirms the universal consensus on the crucial importance of gender equality and its important contribution to the achievement of at least 17 of the Sustainable Development Goals.


In Australia, from 2008 to 2013, we had a Women's Budget Statement. Who would have thought that, after such a long period of time, this important statement—a statement made and tabled in the Australian parliament—would be scrapped? But that is exactly what Prime Minister Abbott did. This statement was dropped in 2013, and, despite Prime Minister Turnbull claiming to be a supporter of women, he too has failed. At this point, the Women's Budget Statement remains in the bin.


There are many areas where the Turnbull government is failing women, but two which have international significance are worth mentioning in the context of the report I have just tabled. Since 2013, under the Liberal government, Australia has slipped from 19th to 46 place in the Global gender gap report. Our international development funding for family planning services in developing countries has fallen from $46 million in 2013-14, when Labor was last in government, to under $35 million in 2014-15 and just $17 million in 2015-16. This is truly shameful, as one way out of poverty for women is to be able to control their own reproduction and fertility. Australia is a wealthy, healthy country with a stable democracy. Not only do we need to focus on and do more to erase the gender pay gap and gender segregation in our own country; we need to play our role in a positive way on the national stage.

Senator DI NATALE
 (Victoria—Leader of the Australian Greens) (16:00):  I move:


That items 1 and 4 of Schedule 1 of the Therapeutic Goods and Other Legislation Amendment (Narcotic Drugs) Regulation 2016, made under the Crimes Act 1914 and the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989, be disallowed.


I am moving this disallowance not for the Australian Greens but for those many, many patients who have life-threatening illnesses and are undergoing intolerable suffering—patients who have cancers, brain tumours, uncontrolled epilepsy, multiple sclerosis and suffering from debilitating spasms; patients who are undergoing chemotherapy and have intractable nausea and vomiting; patients who are suffering from excruciating chronic pain; and all of those people who need some level of relief for which traditional or conventional medicines are not helping and for which medicinal cannabis has been demonstrated scientifically to provide some significant relief. I am calling on all sides of the chamber to come together now to show these Australians who have been dealt a cruel blow when it comes to their health that this parliament respects them enough to allow them the same rights of access to effective medications as to any other medications. 


It is budget week. We have heard a lot from both of the major parties about their level of commitment to health and I just hope that they are not hollow words, that what we will see with this disallowance motion is real support for those people who have terminal illnesses and who require the assistance that only medicinal cannabis can provide to them. It should be a no-brainer. Why? All this disallowance does is restore the existing rights of patients who by definition are suffering from a life-threatening condition to access the medicines they need to ease some of their pain smoothly and rapidly. Should someone be suffering from a terminal illness, there is a special scheme that allows them to get medicines into their hands quickly. 


This disallowance motion makes two simple changes to the Therapeutic Goods and Other Legislation Amendment (Narcotic Drugs) Regulation 2016 to restore the rights of terminally ill patients to access medicinal cannabis products through category A of the TGA's special access scheme and through personal importation. Let me condense that into English. It means that there is a special category A through the TGA that says that, if you have a life-threatening illness, you can actually go to your doctor and your doctor will make sure you get this drug in your hands to help you. It is a special pathway for people with a terminal illness. It also relates to importation. If you have a terminal illness and you get access to medicinal cannabis while you are travelling overseas, you can actually bring it into Australia. Again, we would think that both of those things are no-brainers. 


We are talking about people who have life-threatening illnesses, as determined by their doctor. They still need to go to a doctor to get this medication in their hands. This is not some pathway that bypasses the medical profession. Indeed, it is through the medical profession that access is made available. The special access scheme of the TGA is designed to provide a pathway for Australians to access treatments that might not be registered here in Australia. If you desperately need to get access to medicinal cannabis and it may not be registered in your state at this time for the condition that you have, you can get that medication through your doctor. Again, I emphasise that it is through a doctor. It allows doctors the freedom to prescribe the most appropriate treatments to their patients even when that treatment is not available in this country. 


There are two tiers of the special access scheme. There is category A and category B, and they have different levels of regulation associated with them, and it depends a bit on the condition of the patient. I want to stress again that the condition of the patient is strictly defined in the special access scheme. If you are eligible under category A, the definition for eligibility is:


… persons who are seriously ill with a condition from which death is reasonably likely to occur within a matter of months, or from which premature death is reasonably likely to occur in the absence of early treatment.


Again, one would think that is a no-brainer.


This government stands up and heralds the progress we have made with medicinal cannabis, but they have been dragged there kicking and screaming, it must be said. But we Greens drafted private members' legislation and were assured by the government that if we worked with them, they would provide access to patients. We did that in good faith, so I am hopeful that they will now say that this scheme is available to patients. Why is it that we would have a double standard? Why is it that we would have category A, which is basically a standard that says: if you go to a doctor and there is a drug not available here in Australia and you are suffering from a terminal illness and the drug is not registered in Australia, you can have it as long as it is not medicinal cannabis. If we do not support this disallowance, that is what we are saying. We are seeing to patients: 'You have a terminal illness, but you cannot get access to your drug. We know it is going to help you, and you can bring it here to Australia, but just make sure it is not medicinal cannabis.' You are either serious about this stuff or you are not. You either recognise that medicinal cannabis is evidence-based treatment for a range of conditions and you make it available to people for those conditions.


For Australians, the special access scheme allows their doctor to prescribe them treatments that they believe will be of benefit to ease their suffering and to do so based on the recognition that time is of the essence. For example, let us talk about some of the stories. Let us talk about Dan Haslam. He was a young man who suffered from a very severe form of cancer. He was 21 years old. He got cancer and underwent chemotherapy. He found he could not tolerate it and spent days afterwards, head down in a bucket, vomiting because of the severe nausea associated with the drugs he was taking. He tried all the conventional drugs that are used to treat nausea. Then someone suggested medicinal cannabis and he got rapid relief with the drug. What should we say to somebody who might be in that position who cannot access the drug? Should they not be able to access medicinal cannabis through the category A scheme? I just simply do not believe anybody would think that was appropriate.


I think sometimes it is too easy here in this chamber to forget that the decisions we make have a material impact on the lives of everyday people. Let me tell you about Lindsay, an 18-year-old boy from Queensland. He has refractory epilepsy, which means it is epilepsy which just does not respond to many of the different drugs that are given. Some of them make people very drowsy and some have a whole range of other side effects. Along with his epilepsy, he has chronic pain and nausea as result of a brain tumour. Lindsay was the first Australian patient approved for medicinal cannabis in Australia, when it was still schedule 9—that is, when it was not available through a regulated TGA process. He also got a serious benefit from his nausea. He actually got some appetite, and we know that many of the people who have cancer lose their appetite and lose weight, and that contributes to the downward spiral. The medicinal cannabis helped his nausea and appetite and he got some strength back. 


But the applications for him to get the drug have taken months and months. It was 19 months in the first instance to get access to medicinal cannabis, and the supply is patchy. He has periods of poor health and he simply just cannot get access to the drugs he needs. Lindsay and his courageous mother, Lanai, have been fighting for years not just with the tremendously challenging condition of his health and because of his brain tumour but also with our punitive, opaque and unnecessarily overburdened regulatory system.


We have the coalition who says they want to cut red tape. Well, this is red tape they should be prepared to get the chainsaw out for and rip to shreds. This red tape is stopping a medication that relieves suffering getting into the hands those who need it.


I would say to you that you cannot, and should not, in all good faith vote against this disallowance motion, which would make sure that people like Lindsay are able to access the drug when they need it. Or people like Jason, who was 40 when he died last month from his brain tumour. He was diagnosed in 1986; he went through chemotherapy, surgery and radiation treatment. He suffered severe brain damage and was cared for dutifully by his mother, Janell, until his death. He could not complete his chemo because his weight dropped to 20 kilograms—and he was an adult.


Medicinal cannabis gave him relief so that he got his appetite back and could eat a little. It relieved some of his pain and gave him some quality of life in his final years. But Jason died having to access medicinal cannabis illegally, because the pathways to access it were far too onerous and far too difficult. To use the language of the government, there was far too much red tape. His mother said after his death that her only regret was not allowing him to use medicinal cannabis in her home—because, in her words, she was deadset opposed to illicit drugs. Yet she saw the relief these treatments gave her son and said she would defend his use to anyone.


Access through category A meant that people like Jason—and, indeed, people like Lindsay—could go and see their doctor and, if they were not able to get medicinal cannabis through the pathways approved by this government or by state jurisdictions, there is a mechanism for those people suffering from terminal illness to be able to get the drug in their hands when they need it. I cannot understand how any of my fellow senators here in this place would not be moved by these stories and cannot see that their opposition to this simple change would improve the lives of those dying Australians.


I understand Senator Hinch wants to say a few words, so I will truncate my speech so that he has the opportunity do so. But let me end with the words of one of the advocates of medicinal cannabis, someone called Lanai, an advocate and mother to Lindsay, who asked me to pass on this message to you. She said:


In the life of a patient with a life-threatening illness, like my son Lindsay, one day waiting for a medicine is a day too long. Lindsay has been waiting now since the start of this year and he is suffering seizures again. If this was your child, would you want to wait, or would you think that this government can act now and make sure that patients like Lindsay can get the drug when they need it?


I am calling on all members of this chamber to do the right thing, to stand up for Australian patients and to make sure that today you do something that is good and something that is decent.

This is a complex issue, and neither of the options before us strikes a perfect balance between access for patients who have legitimate clinical need and protection of the broader community. But, on balance, Labor will support this motion to disallow the government's regulation on category A. We are hopeful this will give medical cannabis advocacy groups and clinicians time and space to craft an agreed way forward. In the meantime, terminally ill patients will have access to a therapy that can ease their suffering, and Labor will monitor the rollout of any evidence of abuse of category A.

I met a woman whose child had like 900 or a thousand convulsions and, when they started taking cannabis oil, they stopped spasming. I talked to a man with brain damage who is taking cannabis oil daily. We had a funny moment there because he said he has invested in the company that is now listed in Victoria. They are making moves in Victoria. They are getting some medical cannabis. These people are not criminals. There should be an amnesty on all parents who have been charged with criminal offences for trying to ease their children's suffering and especially for terminally ill people—

Let me tell you about Lindsay, an 18-year-old boy from Queensland. He has refractory epilepsy, which means it is epilepsy which just does not respond to many of the different drugs that are given. Some of them make people very drowsy and some have a whole range of other side effects. Along with his epilepsy, he has chronic pain and nausea as result of a brain tumour. Lindsay was the first Australian patient approved for medicinal cannabis in Australia, when it was still schedule 9—that is, when it was not available through a regulated TGA process. He also got a serious benefit from his nausea. He actually got some appetite, and we know that many of the people who have cancer lose their appetite and lose weight, and that contributes to the downward spiral. The medicinal cannabis helped his nausea and appetite and he got some strength back. 


But the applications for him to get the drug have taken months and months. It was 19 months in the first instance to get access to medicinal cannabis, and the supply is patchy. He has periods of poor health and he simply just cannot get access to the drugs he needs. Lindsay and his courageous mother, Lanai, have been fighting for years not just with the tremendously challenging condition of his health and because of his brain tumour but also with our punitive, opaque and unnecessarily overburdened regulatory system.


We have the coalition who says they want to cut red tape. Well, this is red tape they should be prepared to get the chainsaw out for and rip to shreds. This red tape is stopping a medication that relieves suffering getting into the hands those who need it.


I would say to you that you cannot, and should not, in all good faith vote against this disallowance motion, which would make sure that people like Lindsay are able to access the drug when they need it. Or people like Jason, who was 40 when he died last month from his brain tumour. He was diagnosed in 1986; he went through chemotherapy, surgery and radiation treatment. He suffered severe brain damage and was cared for dutifully by his mother, Janell, until his death. He could not complete his chemo because his weight dropped to 20 kilograms—and he was an adult.


Medicinal cannabis gave him relief so that he got his appetite back and could eat a little. It relieved some of his pain and gave him some quality of life in his final years. But Jason died having to access medicinal cannabis illegally, because the pathways to access it were far too onerous and far too difficult. To use the language of the government, there was far too much red tape. His mother said after his death that her only regret was not allowing him to use medicinal cannabis in her home—because, in her words, she was deadset opposed to illicit drugs. Yet she saw the relief these treatments gave her son and said she would defend his use to anyone.


Access through category A meant that people like Jason—and, indeed, people like Lindsay—could go and see their doctor and, if they were not able to get medicinal cannabis through the pathways approved by this government or by state jurisdictions, there is a mechanism for those people suffering from terminal illness to be able to get the drug in their hands when they need it. I cannot understand how any of my fellow senators here in this place would not be moved by these stories and cannot see that their opposition to this simple change would improve the lives of those dying Australians.


I understand Senator Hinch wants to say a few words, so I will truncate my speech so that he has the opportunity do so. But let me end with the words of one of the advocates of medicinal cannabis, someone called Lanai, an advocate and mother to Lindsay, who asked me to pass on this message to you. She said:


In the life of a patient with a life-threatening illness, like my son Lindsay, one day waiting for a medicine is a day too long. Lindsay has been waiting now since the start of this year and he is suffering seizures again. If this was your child, would you want to wait, or would you think that this government can act now and make sure that patients like Lindsay can get the drug when they need it?


I am calling on all members of this chamber to do the right thing, to stand up for Australian patients and to make sure that today you do something that is good and something that is decent.

Senator POLLEY
 (Tasmania) (16:13):  In respect of the time, and to allow others to make a contribution, I will keep my remarks very short. This is a complex issue, and neither of the options before us strikes a perfect balance between access for patients who have legitimate clinical need and protection of the broader community. But, on balance, Labor will support this motion to disallow the government's regulation on category A. We are hopeful this will give medical cannabis advocacy groups and clinicians time and space to craft an agreed way forward. In the meantime, terminally ill patients will have access to a therapy that can ease their suffering, and Labor will monitor the rollout of any evidence of abuse of category A.

Senator HINCH
 (Victoria) (16:14):  I support Senator Di Natale on this. He mentioned that sometimes in this place we forget the effects we have on everyday people. I saw everyday people with these medical conditions at the MardiGrass at Nimbin last weekend—I saw hundreds of them. Thousands of people were there. I met a man who had done ten months jail last year for getting cannabis oil for a family friend's baby. I met a woman whose child had like 900 or a thousand convulsions and, when they started taking cannabis oil, they stopped spasming. I talked to a man with brain damage who is taking cannabis oil daily. We had a funny moment there because he said he has invested in the company that is now listed in Victoria. They are making moves in Victoria. They are getting some medical cannabis. These people are not criminals. There should be an amnesty on all parents who have been charged with criminal offences for trying to ease their children's suffering and especially for terminally ill people—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  The time for debate on this matter has expired. The question is that the disallowance motion moved by Senator Di Natale be agreed to.

Senator BACK
 (Western Australia) (16:23):  I wish to contribute to this debate, having been an active member of this committee. Can I, firstly, place on record the appreciation of all the senators for the effort undertaken by the secretary and her staff in the way this matter has been dealt with. There is a bit of an unusual outcome, Mr President, in the sense that the report to the Senate is a report that deals in six chapters with the actual facts that were presented to the committee in relation to this particular matter. It will be seen, now that it has been tabled, that there have been no recommendations come forward to the Senate as a result of this inquiry. When you scrutinise the outcome of this particular inquiry, you will see that each of, I think, three of four groups of senators have in fact put in additional comments. I speak then on behalf of Senator Reynolds, Senator Gallacher and me. The additional comments conclude with 1.102, in which we say:


We support oil and gas exploration in the Great Australian Bight subject to continued strong oversight by NOPSEMA. 


There are many, many reasons why we have drawn that conclusion. Can I join with Senator Whish-Wilson and others in making the point of just how vitally important the Great Australian Bight is as one of our marine areas around the Australian coastline. It is the fact that there must be tremendously regulated circumstances in place for any companies that might want to explore or extract product in the Great Australian Bight. But that is no different to other marine areas around Australia. Our own North West Shelf has a highly developed offshore oil and gas industry. Indeed, speaking of whales, because southern right whales have been mentioned by many people in submissions and evidence to the committee, is it a fact that the humpback whale is very active up and down the Western Australian coastline? In fact its numbers have increased significantly over time. It is also a fact that under the management of then Premier Barnett that Camden Sound was declared, what I believe, to be the largest whale sanctuary in the world. 


What it proves is that, with excellence, diligence and oversight of a very competent body, such as NOPSEMA, it is possible to meet both sets of objectives, those being to protect the marine environment and to be able to explore, exploit and, hopefully, extract hydrocarbons. Why is it that the Great Australian Bight has been identified as a prospective area? CSIRO many years ago came to the realisation that the Great Australian Bight is an entirely prospective area. It has challenges—it has deep water—but companies these days, as I believe Santos and Murphy Oil indicated to us, are perfectly competent and comfortable with drilling down to some 4,300 metres. 


People talk about adverse weather conditions. Those of us who know a little about yachting and boating conditions in the Bass Strait know that they are also very harsh conditions, but we also know that for 40 years there has been extraction of hydrocarbons in the Bass Strait. That particular project has not only provided energy, for the state of Victoria particularly, but generated some 50,000 jobs and contributed some $200 billion to GDP in the Bass Strait alone.


I speak of the North West Shelf. Already there is oil and gas extraction by companies like Woodside. Increasingly into the future, it will be Chevron, but we know that Shell and ExxonMobil and others are involved. Off the North West Shelf we have already seen some $60 billion of export revenue, some $70 billion of contribution to GDP and more than $5 billion of return to the federal government by way of taxes.


Why is it so important that we are looking to these locations for extraction? Australia now imports around 80 per cent of its crude, which is then refined into petroleum products. Beside the fact that that is costing us some $34 billion a year, we will move to the stage relatively soon, probably by about 2026 or 2027, when we do not have any oil here. The only oil we are going to have will be condensate that comes off as an offshoot of the LNG processing. 


The other disturbing fact, as was pointed out to us by the International Energy Agency, is that Australia is now down to less than 45 days of product—in January, I think, we were down to about 39 days. People say, 'Can't we add either the refined or crude product coming in from overseas?' The answer is, no, we cannot. When you look at the two main areas from which we derive crude coming into this country, it is either through the South China Sea or the Strait of Hormuz between Iran and the United Arab Emirates. Neither of them are regarded as being safe locations. We know that there is product in the Great Australian Bight. We know that NOPSEMA is an excellent overseer. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (16:32):  I have already made a few brief comments on this bill, the Native Title Amendment (Indigenous Land Use Agreements) Bill 2017, and I want to curtail my remarks because I think it is very important that this bill is voted on this afternoon so that we can bring certainty to the native title holders, certainty to land title groups right across Australia, certainty to the Adani proposals for mines in Central Queensland, certainty to the future prospects for jobs for workers and certainty to the Queensland government about the revenue streams that will flow once these issues are dealt with.


I took part in the debate as Chair of the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee, which conducted an inquiry into this legislation. I want to thank all of those who made submissions and all of those who appeared before the committee—and there were a lot of them—to give their evidence. We heard from all sides of the argument, and I think everyone had a very fair hearing. I particularly want to thank the secretariat of the committee, who, as always, did a wonderful job in assisting with the organisation of the hearings and the preparation of the final report. And I thank all senators on the committee for their cooperation. The committee was able to make a unanimous recommendation that the bill be passed, subject to some amendments which have been accepted by the government. The Attorney, in consultation with Senator Dodson and others, has refined the amendment we are dealing with today.


I will digress very slightly to something that was said in a debate on this topic earlier today. Senator McCarthy, unfortunately, misrepresented what I had said in my earlier speech about future amendments to this bill. Everyone acknowledges that there do have to be new amendments, but they are not being dealt with at the moment. This was specifically in relation to the McGlade decision. That was clear to everyone. Sometime in the future, at the Attorney's direction, there will be consultations, there will be draft bills issued and there will be amendments that the government will work with Indigenous spokesmen and stakeholders on to ensure that the new amendments are correct.


Finally, I make a plea. Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk, the Labor Premier of Queensland, I plead with you: please, pick up the phone and ring the four Queensland Labor senators. Ring them now. They are, in case you have forgotten, Premier, Senator Ketter, Senator Moore, Senator Chisholm and Senator Watt. You should have their phone numbers. Please ring them as representatives of Queensland and say that you, along with the federal government, along with Indigenous people and along with the workers in Central and North Queensland who do not have a job, are desperate to get this bill through the parliament. If that needs sitting tomorrow, as the government has proposed, can you please, Premier Palaszczuk, ask the Labor senators from Queensland, who are supposed to be helping Queensland, to give up their long weekend and get their colleagues in the Senate to sit tomorrow, on Friday, so that we can deal with this bill in a full eight hours of debate and get it passed? Everyone agrees it should be passed. I think it is essential that it should be done. Please, Premier Palaszczuk, ring your Queensland Labor senators and ask them to get off their bums, actually do the work and get this bill passed.

"Moore, Sen Claire",ALP,2017-05-11,"



Senator MOORE
 (Queensland) (16:37):  I am not going to respond to Senator Macdonald's last statement. He keeps making these statements across the chamber and it does not add to the quality of this debate. We have had a number of senators talk about the history of this piece of legislation. We know that the Native Title Amendment (Indigenous Land Use Agreements) Bill before us is an amendment bill. It was introduced by the government in the other place early this year—15 February. That was the first time that this bill appeared in this parliament. It amends the original Native Title Act to resolve the uncertainty that was created by the decision of the full Federal Court in what we have heard many times was McGlade v Native Title Registrar. That decision was handed down on 2 February this year.


All of us in this place understand the importance to our community and to our culture of the native title legislation. In fact, some of us remember exactly where we were when the original legislation was passed in 1993. In the community in which I was working at the time, we were waiting to hear what was going to happen after that extraordinarily long debate, which is probably still one of the longest debates in this place. Finally, the parliament in Australia ensured that there was native title legislation in our community. It is a very important piece of groundbreaking native title legislation.


Before us, we have an amendment to that and that must have fulsome and true consideration. There should not be, by any sense of urgency, a push in this place to rush things through. Having said that, I think that we are doing the right thing. We are, through the parliament, considering the legislation after the process of it being introduced. It came into the Senate after a bit of a flurry in getting the Senate Selection of Bills Committee to ensure that we had a hearing on the piece of legislation. That was an essential part of the process. The Senate did its job. The Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee reviewed the legislation and heard from people and organisations that gave up their time. With their professionalism, their knowledge and experience, they came to the Senate to give us their views on the legislation.


There have been a number of contributions in both this debate and in questions earlier today which may have seemed to indicate that at that Senate inquiry there was a unanimous view put forward that every person who came to that inquiry agreed that this amendment bill needed to be passed and to be passed urgently. Well, that is not true. As with most Senate inquiries, in which I have been involved, there was a wide range of opinion brought to the Senate committee. The Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee brought down its report, reflecting a wide range of views. But, as we have been told in previous contributions, the Labor senators, Senator Dodson and Senator Pratt, actually accepted that, on the basis of the evidence, because of the specifics of the McGlade decision and how they had impacted on native title, there was a need to ensure that there was a response from parliament to stop any uncertainty or confusion.


However, as we have heard from other contributions, this was only step 1 of the process. There was a need for further discussion. We have heard how Senator Dodson, Senator McCarthy and Mr Dreyfus were able to be involved in future discussions. Only then did more amendments appear. I understand that the latest amendment that is part of this discussion only appeared in parliament yesterday. So it is not such a straightforward process as some would make us believe.


In terms of what caused the legislation to be before us, we know that following the bringing down of the Keating legislation, the Native Title Act in 1993, we actually enshrined in legislation the decision of the High Court of Australia in Mabo v Queensland—my state—which upheld that the doctrine of terra nullius did not apply when there were already inhabitants present. Again, the importance to our community of the High Court decision followed by the response to that decision by our parliament must always be kept front of any discussion that we have about amending the legislation.


To make it clear—and I am actually quoting now from evidence and discussions that were put into the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee: following the Mabo decision, any Indigenous land rights which had not been extinguished by the Crown continued to exist in Australia. Since 1993, the Native Title Act has enabled the continued recognition and protection of Indigenous land rights. 


It is Labor's view—and it has been clearly enunciated by previous speakers from among Labour senators—that any changes to the Native Title Act must be properly considered and consulted on with Indigenous and Torres Strait Islander communities. That is a key component of our commitment to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities—no decision that impacts on their culture, their land rights and, in particular, this process that talks about the whole future of their relationship with land can ever be taken without full and proper consultation. That is something that this parliament should enshrine in the processes they put in place.


The Native Title Act provides a legislative process for native title groups to negotiate with other parties to form voluntary agreements in relation to the use of land and waters, referred to as Indigenous land use agreements—ILUAs, which people use as a shorthand way of defining these agreements. That was defined very clearly for us in the evidence that came to the committee. Currently, under section 24CD of the act, all persons of the native title group must be parties to an area ILUA. If there is a registered native title claimant for the purposes of the act, the native title group consists of that registered native title claimant. A registered native title claimant is defined again in the act under section 253 as:


… a person or persons whose name or names appear in an entry on the Register of Native Title Claims …


This enables a person or persons to enter into agreements as authorised by the native title group. The McGlade decision found that an area ILUA could not be registered unless all members of the registered native title claimant had signed the area ILUA, including members of the group who may have died. This ruling overturned the decision that had been current and on which a range of decisions had been made—the ruling of QGC Pty Ltd v Bygrave (No. 2) [2010], which found that an area ILUA could be registered if it had been signed by at least one member of the registered native title claimant group.


Post McGlade, the only alternative available to a registered native title claimant group is to re-authorise a new applicant and make an application under section 66B of the act to remove any member of the group who refused to sign. Stakeholders have indicated that this process can impose high costs on registered native title claimants and cause delays. There was significant evidence to the committee that this could cause confusion and worry in a community if they had to go through the whole process again of registering and then waiting for the process to go through the courts. The evidence that came to us was that consideration needed to be given to improving the amendments in the legislation that we are debating today in the parliament.


The McGlade decision has potentially far-reaching implications for approximately 126 existing registered ILUAs made over the past seven years in reliance on the decision in Bygrave. These decisions had been made, discussed in the communities and then registered on the Register of Native Title Claims. They had been finalised in good faith, and subsequent decisions about rights to the use of land and the opportunities that existed in communities had been made based on that agreement. These ILUAs include agreements concerning very large areas of land across Australia, including ILUAs made with respect to national parks, agricultural ventures and mining ventures.


This bill responds to the McGlade decision by amending the Native Title Act so that any area ILUA which was authorised and registered prior to the McGlade decision will be valid, despite not being signed by all members of the registered native title claimant group. We have been advised by the government that this change to the law will ensure the validity of approximately 126 registered ILUAs that were negotiated in good faith by native title holders with land users on the basis of the law, as it was clearly understood to be. The amendments that we are debating will also enable the registration of area ILUAs that were lodged for registration prior to the McGlade decision, despite not having been signed by all members of the registered native title claimant group. Again, advice from the government is that this will apply to a further eight ILUAs.


This was the information on which discussions during the meetings of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, as well as subsequent discussions in later weeks, were based. It was also the basis on which the Labor senators originally agreed to accept and support this native title amendment bill. But, subsequent to that, another series of amendments have come before the parliament which have been proposed to consider the situation of the Cape York Land Council. These amendments would extend the bill to also validate area ILUAs that could otherwise be rendered invalid if successfully challenged in the Federal Court on the basis that they were not signed by any registered native title claimant. This is another complication and, in terms of the principle, there is still the situation that we need to make quite clear so that people fully understand their rights and fully understand the implications of the decisions that we are making in the parliament. But that information was not available to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee when they met. It was not available to people who were looking at what was going on in the parliament until this week. I think this creates a sense of urgency and it was not effectively discussed and understood before the last period of discussion. Despite that, Labor have listened to the arguments put around the situation with the Cape York Land Council and their particular leases in that area. It is my understanding that we have agreed to approve that process as well. But this reinforces the concerns that have been raised by people in the community about the need for full consultation and understanding of the process.


I accept that we will never be able to fully please every person who has some ownership in this case. There will be differences of opinion. We see that and we must acknowledge that. But that almost gives greater cause for the processes that are in place, how we are proceeding and the basis on which we are proceeding to be adequately explained and understood. My concern is that, if we do not actually fully commit to that principle and understand the sensitivities, it could impact not just on this case but on cases into the future. So, on the basis of the evidence before us that has come from our consideration of this particular bill today, we believe that there have been cases made for the urgency and the need to ensure that there is no confusion in the community or in the various property and business processes that are taking place through agreements that were made prior to McGlade. We understand the need for that. But at the same time I think we have to make very clear our concerns about any perception that this has been rushed and any perception that people have not had their rights and their culture fully understood, accepted and respected. We need to make a commitment that we understand the concerns that have been raised about consultation and that any future action this parliament takes will respond to those sensitivities and to the understanding that full consultation will take place, because this is unfinished business. We know that there will continue to be further need for changes and amendments to the native title legislation.


As we know, when Labor's current shadow Attorney-General, Mr Dreyfus, was the Attorney-General he did refer issues to do with native title legislation to the Australian Law Commission to fully consider where we are now with this legislation and the changes that will have to take place into the future. Certainly, that particular law report now needs to be fully considered by government. There must be much further discussion in this place and a clear process put in place for how we will enshrine the consultative process into the future. We need to make sure that there is trust in the way the parliament will respond to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. That was the intent of the 1993 process. It was the intent of the High Court decision that there be a clear understanding of and commitment to the principles of native title legislation—of true ownership of land. In any discussions about native title in the future we absolutely need to ensure that trust is there and that there is an understanding that we will put in place appropriate and agreed consultation processes. If we do not do that, we will be destroying the history and the challenge of native title. If we do not do that, we will not be fulfilling the extraordinary work that was put in place by the Mabo process and the Mabo family, then and now, who continue, in many ways, to be the actual custodians of the native title legislation.


At this time, Labor are supporting the legislation, but we say that we can do the processes better, and we must do them better. Anyone who has listened to the contribution made by Senator Dodson would understand the way in which we can do this better. I know that Senator McCarthy will be making the same comments in the future as she has made today about what we must do. I think this should be one of the processes that comes out of today's debate: looking at today's legislation and the amendments, which we are supporting, but learning from the process to ensure that this negotiation, this discussion, cannot be rushed.


We need to ensure that consultation takes place. We do not need to have cracks across this chamber saying that the process of having full debate in this place is determined by whether senators want to have a long weekend or not. That does no honour to the person who makes those comments, and it certainly does not reflect appropriate discussion in this Senate. No-one owns morality. No-one owns best practice. But we can do better than exchanging barbs in that way.


What we must do in the parliament is look at legislation, listen to the people who have knowledge, experience and ownership and then balance the arguments here, openly debate the process and move forward, bringing people together rather than laying down laws upon them from outside. And if we do that we will continue the message of Mabo. We will continue the message of the Keating legislation from 1993, and we will enshrine true native title in this community together rather than divided.

"Smith, Sen Dean",LP,2017-05-11,"



Senator SMITH
 (Western Australia—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (16:56):  It is a pleasure to make a contribution to this important piece of legislation, the Native Title Amendment (Indigenous Land Use Agreements) Bill 2017, this evening. It is a piece of legislation that has significance for every Australian. By way of history, in 1992 the High Court of Australia handed down a historical decision in the Mabo v Queensland case, recognising that the common law of Australia recognise rights and interests to land held by Indigenous people under their traditional laws and customs. The Mabo and Wik decisions and the subsequent Native Title Act 1993 were salient points in the history of this nation and the changing relationship between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians.


For over 24 years the act has served Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities well, until 2 February this year, when the Federal Court handed down the McGlade v Native Title Registrar decision, which has invalidated land use agreements across the country. It has also seen the $1.3 billion Western Australian South West land use agreement with the Noongar people, which included a benefits package with annual payments of $50 million into a Noongar future fund over 12 years and 320,000 hectares of land handed over to Noongar ownership, shelved. This decision of the Federal Court has created uncertainty throughout the native title sector, especially over the status of Indigenous Land Use Agreements, or ILUAs. It means that ILUAs without the signatures of all registered native title claimant members, including members who are deceased, cannot be registered. Simply, this means that if a single member of the registered native title group withholds their consent or dies before authorising it, the agreement cannot be registered. This also means that the only alternative to the native title claim group is to re-authorise a new applicant and make a new application under section 66B of the act, removing the member or members of the registered group who refused to sign.


This is an unnecessary and unacceptable barrier on the native title system. It is a barrier for native title stakeholders, imposing high costs for claim groups, which often have limited resources, as well as delays for claimants and third parties. It raises considerable uncertainty for all parties doing business on native title land, especially in my home state of Western Australia. Pastoralists, mining companies, oil and gas companies, tourism operators, fishing and pearling businesses, and local government authorities are all left with a high degree of uncertainty over their existing and future native title land use agreements. This is primarily because native title has a greater impact on Western Australia than on any other Australian jurisdiction. Western Australia is exposed to the responsibilities of native title more than any other territory or state in the Commonwealth. Approximately 85 per cent of the state of Western Australia is subject to either a native title claim or has already received a Federal Court of Australia native title determination that recognises the existence of native title rights and interests.


The sheer size of these determinations accounts for over 50 per cent of the total national land area. There are 79 currently filed native title claims in Western Australia, on top of 60 native title determinations. This compares with just 277 outstanding claims and 316 determinations nationally. Western Australia also grants the highest number of land and mineral licences and titles in Australia, the majority of which must comply with the future acts regime of the Native Title Act.


For those unaware, a future act is an act done after 1 January 1994 which affects native title. A future act can be any proposed activity or development on land or waters that has the potential to affect native title by extinguishing it or by creating interests that are inconsistent with the existence or exercise of native title. Other than the issue of the goods and services tax, the most significant state federal financial issue facing Western Australia is native title determinations, especially future acts. This is a $1 billion plus issue for the future of Western Australia.


This is because, in my home state of Western Australia, the most common future acts are the proposed grants of mining or land titles by the Department of Mines and Petroleum and the Department of Lands. It is because in Western Australia all native title claims are determined in the Federal Court, with the WA state government as first respondent. The preferred outcome for all native title claims is that they be resolved through mediation rather than litigation, utilising ILUAs, voluntary agreements primarily about access, which are registered and held by the National Native Title Tribunal and bind all persons who hold native title to the agreement, whether they are parties or not.


The importance of ILUAs in the native title system cannot be understated. An ILUA may address issues of access, compensation, extinguishment and coexistence. An ILUA may be made separately from the formal native title process, form a part of that process or pave the way for a native title determination. An ILUA does not extinguish native title but may, by agreement, allow for the surrender of native title. Most importantly, an ILUA can address past and intermediate acts as well as future acts. It may also replace the future act process entirely.


The Federal Court's decision of 2 February this year has far-reaching implications for the approximately 150 existing Indigenous land use agreements that have been made under the Native Title Act, most of them made in the past seven years. In addition to the implications for agreements made with the Noongar people in WA's southwest, it also has far-reaching implications for future land agreements that are currently under negotiation, not just in Western Australia but across every state and territory. Correcting this level of uncertainty has motivated the government to respond quickly and offer a remedy to ensure that all of these agreements have the status that is expected by those registered native title groups and communities that have entered into them.


This is a legislative response that will secure existing agreements which have been registered on or before 2 February this year but do not comply with the Federal Court's decision on McGlade. They will clarify who must be a party to an area ILUA in the future, unless the claim group determines otherwise. These are important changes. Most importantly, they do not alter the intent of the Native Title Act. They give certainty in the Commonwealth legislation to the agreements that have already been struck. They give certainty not only to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people but also to all parties who have entered into the agreements, so that they can plan the way forward as agreed and honour those commitments.


The source of native title rights and interests is the traditional laws and customs of the native title holders. This means that the nature of native title rights and interests varies from community to community. This is also why native title can coexist with other forms of land title such as pastoral leases but is extinguished by others such as freehold. However, there are fundamental differences between land rights and native title. Land rights are rights created by the Australian state or territory governments. Land rights usually comprise a grant or a freehold or perpetual lease title given to Indigenous Australians. By contrast, native title arises as a result of the recognition, under Australian common law, of pre-existing Indigenous rights and interests according to traditional laws and customs.


It is extraordinary that, even for a moment, the Labor Party and the Greens would have objected to passing this bill. It is extraordinary but perhaps not unexpected, and I will tell you why. For all their talk about working to make the native title system better, fairer and more transparent, the Labor Party continue to fall short. It was a Labor Attorney-General who removed funding for native title respondents, a move that significantly impacted on native title determinations at the time, not just in WA but also in Queensland and in New South Wales. It was a Labor Prime Minister who, in 2001, advised the WA state government that it would no longer honour the 1994 agreement made by then Labor Prime Minister Paul Keating, the architect of the original Native Title Act, and that the Commonwealth would bear the lion's share of the burden for compensating for native title by funding up to 75 per cent of the compensation costs arising from the validation of past acts on determined native title lands. It is the Labor Party who today, again, is playing games with the passage of a bill that will protect the validity of ILUAs and the integrity of the native title process.


This bill is yet another example of how the government is addressing, not ignoring, the deficiencies of our native title regime. As a senator for Western Australia, I support the bill and look forward to playing my part in working with colleagues to ensure that our native title framework operates in a manner that is fair and provides certainty to all parties across all states and territories.

"Waters, Sen Larissa",AG,2017-05-11,"



Senator WATERS
 (Queensland—Co-Deputy Leader of the Australian Greens) (17:05):  I rise to speak on the Native Title Amendment (Indigenous Land Use Agreements) Bill 2017, which is also known as the bill to ram through the Adani coalmine against the wishes of the local Wangan and Jagalingou people. It is known as the bill to give certainty to big miners whilst subjugating the rights of our First Australians.


First, I go to the process. As we know, this bill was rushed through the House of Representatives about five seconds after the court case found that many of these ILUAs are invalid because not all of the native title claimants and registered claimants have ticked off on them. That was an eminently sensible decision by one of our courts. Of course, this government does not like the fact that that casts some doubt on the ability of the big miners to ride roughshod over not just our land but the rights of Indigenous people whose land it was and still is.


We have concerns about the time frame and the fact that this was rushed through not only the House but then a very hasty Senate committee process. As the record will show, we Greens sought to extend out the report date for inquiry but, sadly, we were not supported by the Senate to do that. The upshot of that was that submitters did not have enough time to prepare their submissions and we only had one hearing. Everyone would accept that native title as a body of law is incredibly complicated. It is also an issue where it is incredibly important that we get it right. We have a legacy in this country of abominable decisions when it comes to recognising and respecting our First Australians. This native title bill is regularly criticised for being a poor construct which ill fits with the rights that still exist and should be legally recognised as still existing. So to be rushing through a bodgied up amendment at the last minute to an already complex area of law is bad practice, but to do that to favour a big mining company to open up one of the biggest coalmines in the world to further trash the climate and the Reef is utterly unforgivable. Those are our concerns with the process.


There is a lot of opinion about this bill. Clearly, Aboriginal people do not speak with one voice and, clearly, we should not seek to speak for them, which is another matter I will go into. But the other issue we have is that there has not been enough consultation on the effect of these proposed changes. I have personally met with traditional owners particularly from that Wangan and Jagalingou group who are deeply opposed to ramming through these changes to our native title laws. Adrian Burragubba and his niece Murrawah Johnson have been campaigning for reforms to the native title system, as have many other traditional owners in Queensland I have had occasion to meet with. They have been campaigning for their rights to be properly respected. Instead, there has been a litany of frankly dodgy practice around the signing of this ILUA. I have had lengthy briefings with Adrian where he has explained to me how the mining company has bussed up people who are not even from the local area to stack the meetings.




Senator Canavan interjecting
—






Senator WATERS:
  Can I ask that you call the minister to order, please, Mr Acting Deputy President Gallacher.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Gallacher
):  Order on my right!




Senator WATERS:
  So they have been bussing in people who do not genuinely represent the Wangan and Jagalingou mob. As a result, an ILUA has been signed that does not reflect the wishes of that mob. Is it any wonder that the government wants to preference the needs and wishes of a big mining company ahead of reaching a genuine consensus and a genuine free, prior and informed consent arrangement with our First Australians?


Our laws do not enshrine the requirement for free, prior and informed consent. Internationally we have that obligation, but there have been no steps whatsoever taken to put that into our domestic laws. This is a real blight that we should be attending to fix as a matter of urgency, but, no, that would of course make it more difficult for the big mining companies. So you will not see that out of this government, and you probably will not see it out of the opposition either.


It is pretty clear that this bill is a sop to Adani, and the relevant minister admitted as much earlier today. He really belled the cat in that Adani have leant on the government, they have leant on the state government and they have demanded certainty—the audacity of them demanding certainty when this is and always will be Indigenous land—and now the government is saying, 'Oh, you want us to jump? How far would you like us to jump?' and are ramming through these laws. We saw the Queensland Premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, head off to India in the last few weeks and do a deal with the head of the Adani Group and assure him that it would all be settled, that it would be fine and that she would sort it out. They have rolled out the red carpet for this company. It is a shame that they have done no such thing when it comes to the First Australians in Queensland.


Of course, hot on the heels of the Queensland Premier was none other than the Prime Minister himself, who also went over to India in a big sop to Adani and its company group. He also said, 'We'll sort it out; don't you worry about that, mate. We will trash the native title rights and we will fix this for you so that you can build one of the largest coalmines in the world on Indigenous land. We don't care if the local mob don't support it. We've got some signatures on a bit of paper from the wrong people, but we don't care; we will use the law to abuse the process and make sure that your donations keep flowing to us and that you can rip out the guts from our land.'


It is really clear that the impacts of this mine would completely trash the significance and specialty of that land, both for non-Indigenous people and also, importantly, for the Wangan and Yagalingu people. They are deeply concerned about the impacts on groundwater and the impacts on their dreaming sites. They have taken me powerfully through some of the dreaming stories of that land, and it is moving and something that should be respected. Instead, this government is saying that it wants to simply roll out the red carpet even more for a big mining company and it does not give a damn about the rights of the Wangan and Yagalingu people, who are desperate to have their voices heard in the native title process and to have their rights respected. But, as we have seen, the native title process itself has been a construct that, from the word go, was a compromise to suit the white fella. And now we have some amendments which will make it even more convenient for the mining companies and even less of a genuine system to recognise the prior existing rights of Indigenous people. It is an absolute abomination, in my view.


Moving to the impacts of this bill: if this is passed—and we will fight it—it will retrospectively validate those ILUAs which a court has found to be dodgy, to be not properly signed, because not enough of the relevant traditional owners signed on to them to make them valid ILUAs. So the government want to retrospectively validate an agreement to facilitate a big mining company. Often they come in here and try to say that they are doyens of the law and that they do not like retrospectivity. There is a principle against retrospectivity in lawmaking, because it changes things after the fact. You are not meant to do it—in plain language—but this government do not care, because, again, Adani has said, 'Jump' and the government have said, 'How high?' So they want to retrospectively validate these dodgy ILUAs and subjugate the rights of the Wangan and Yagalingu people.


This mine is probably the best example of the worst and most appalling way that the big parties are working for the interests of big mining companies, and the big corporates generally, ahead of the interests of ordinary people. It is no surprise and it is no wonder that Australians think that our system is broken and that our economic system is rigged against everyday people. This is the same system that lets the greedy bankers rip off everyday people with the full protection of politicians—although we note with pleasure that the banking levy, a partial adoption of Greens policy, has been proposed in the budget. This is the same system that would let Adani take unlimited groundwater from our state, which is 90 per cent in drought. Nobody else gets free water, but this mega-multinational mining company is going to get free groundwater in a state that is 90 per cent in drought.


This is the same system that wants to give a billion dollars of public money to that very same company, as a concessional loan. It will cost the budget—and we have sought to establish that in estimates—tens of millions of dollars to give this concessional loan to a company led by a billionaire, who should not need the support. Adani has got a complex corporate web of companies. If it cannot even organise itself to fund its own project, why is the taxpayer being asked to put up their hand and provide public money for this project?


On that point, I want to pick Labor up for trying to walk both sides of the fence. They keep saying that if this project stacks up then it should get NAIF funding. Well, the whole point of the NAIF funding is that it can only fund projects that do not stack up commercially. So I am afraid that Labor's rhetoric is utterly inconsistent when it comes to its pathetically divided approach on this enormous mega-mine.


One wonders why the big mining companies, and Adani in particular, have such influence over both sides of politics and both levels of government, and one needs to look no further than the political donations that are made by the fossil fuel companies to both sides of politics. At last count it was $3.7 million over three years that the fossil fuel sector—that is, big coal and big gas—have given to the Liberals, to the Labor Party and to the National Party. That is $3.7 million to run their election campaigns, as they desperately try to cling to power. And then they buckle on implementing their principles once they get into power, but that is beside the point. These donations are incredibly generous, and it is very clear that they are having the impact of policies that are designed to benefit the big corporates and to sacrifice the environment and to ignore the interests of ordinary community members.


So that is why there is the powerful movement that has sprung up in opposition to this mine. It is a David and Goliath battle. You have got the big miners and the big corporates generally. You have got their big donations. You have got the well-connected lobbyists—the former politicians who now work for those very same mining companies, or their former staffers. Again, it is a revolving door when it comes to the fossil fuel sector; one minute they are in this place making decisions; the next, they are promised a cushy job and they are out working for the industry, and back and forth it goes. I have spoken at length in this chamber about that previously—about the absolutely sordid links between the fossil fuel sector and the parliament, and the fact that it is no wonder that we get poor decisions out of this place when they are so impossibly hocked to the industry.


So one would think that this is a David and Goliath battle that people-power might not win. But people-power will win this because ordinary Australians do not want to see Indigenous rights trashed. They do not want to see our Reef further cooked by turbocharging climate change, like this mega-mine would do. They do not want to see a billion dollars of taxpayers' money given to a multinational company that does not need the help—and when that money could be so desperately better spent in other areas, and when they have not even had a chance to have a say on how that money should be spent. Many people in the community whom I speak to in Queensland are horrified when they hear that this project might get a billion dollars of public money, because, they say, 'I was never asked whether that was what my community wanted. We want better schools. We want better hospitals. We want some renewable energy jobs. We do not want a billion dollars being given to this dog of a project that will not employ anywhere near as many people as they claim it will.' And the company has admitted that—it acknowledges that it is not going to be 10,000 jobs. It might be 1,464, but who knows? We will have to wait and see. Of course, they are all FIFO jobs.


And we have seen the impact of the mining boom-and-bust cycle. Look at Gladstone. That poor town is now thoroughly destitute after the boom. I remember going to Gladstone five years ago; you could not get a hotel room. And now, of course, there are an awful lot of empty properties, because that is what happens when you get a mining boom-and-bust cycle. It puts communities through the washing machine, and they end up worse off because rates of violence, and domestic violence in particular, skyrocket; the cost of living skyrockets; and then the miners up and leave town, and the community is left with nothing. They have just ridden roughshod over that community, and I do not want that to happen to other communities in Queensland.


We have also seen in Queensland the resurgence of black lung, which coalminers are now suffering. We thought that that disease, pneumoconiosis, as it is known, was stamped out decades ago. But it is back. So these are not the sorts of jobs that you would want anyone to be working in, because people are now dying from them. Why this government and the state government thinks that the only possible job that can be created in regional Queensland is a coal job just shows an absolute lack of imagination and an absolute lack of understanding that we are now in this century. We have other options. Clean energy can do the job technologically and, if we hurry up then we will not get further behind the world.


Again, it comes back to those donations. It must be that is why the big mining companies have so much sway over both sides of politics, and it is why that is all the jobs they can think of—jobs that are short term, that will not last, that are subject to that boom and bust cycle, that are killing its workers and, importantly, that are threatening the reef itself and the 70,000 jobs that rely on the reef remaining healthy.


I have been to the reef many a time, and it made a huge impact on me. It is an absolutely magnificent place. If anyone has not had the joy of experiencing it, I would encourage them to do so. But it is under threat. We have already seen it being slammed with the two worst coral-bleaching episodes in its ancient history, the worst ever in the last two years, two successive years. Never before has the reef suffered such bleaching and never before has it happened in back-to-back years.


The scientists are being crystal clear about this. They could not be clearer. Terry Hughes and others of his ilk have been pleading and begging with decision makers at all levels of government saying: 'We cannot have more coal in the system. It is a choice between new coal or the reef. The reef can't take it anymore.' It has been falling on deaf ears in this place. Indeed, when my colleague, Senator Peter Whish-Wilson, asked a question in the last sitting which pointed to Terry Hughes' desperate despair at the future of this reef that he loves, and so many other people love, he was ridiculed and mocked and offered a hanky. Come on, this is the federal parliament of Australia. Surely we can do better than that. We are talking about the future of an organism that can be seen from space, that will outlive and outlast all of us unless this mob continues to trash it by handing free money to big mining companies to line their own pockets with profits and then trash the climate for the rest of us and for future generations to look after. That is why this bill is so important. It is not only about Indigenous rights and the future of where we want to take the economy; it is also about what we want to do to this planet.


I have mentioned before that the red carpet has been rolled out for this company, and I want to go through precisely what state Labor have done. They have given a water licence with unlimited and free groundwater for the Adani Carmichael coalmine. They have offered Adani a royalty holiday. So not only do this company have the privilege of a billion dollars of public money that they will probably be awarded under this government; they are not even going to have to pay for the privilege. And here is the catch: the Queensland government is not even telling us the details of this royalty holiday. They will not say how long it is going to be for and they will not admit how much money Queenslanders will forego because the government is giving this company a free ride. What an absolute joke!


They have also created a special loophole for Adani so that there are no appeals available to the community against the water licence. Again, nobody else gets that sort of special treatment. Nobody else says: 'The processes don't apply to you. You can have this free pass. We'll make sure the community can't exercise the rights that they would otherwise have. She'll be right, mate.' Queensland Labor and, of course, this government here at the federal level as well, have approved the mine at every stage and at every level. Queensland Labor have now actively lobbied for federal funding for this project after they went to our state election saying they would save the reef, and people desperately wanted them to; they wanted to believe that. They said they would not put a cent of public money into the project and it had to stand on its own two feet. They had also earlier said, through their own Treasury officials, that this was an unbankable project.


And so what a surprise when, now that they are in government, they are actively lobbying for that federal money, that taxpayer money, to be given to this project! Interestingly, they have a veto power—it is not really being spoken about much. The Queensland government can veto the $1 billion that NAF might approve and probably will approve and give to Adani—and we would be urging them to do so, to stand firm on what were clear election commitments that they made, that the community supported because the community loves the reef and wants to see it protected and not trashed for the sake of a few extra dollars in a billionaire's back pocket.


It is pretty clear the processes are being rigged with vested interests. I have talked about the enormous amounts of donations, and that is probably why they are greasing the palms of the process that is happening here. But I want to also remind federal Labor that they are not without power here. If Mr Bill Shorten—who, frankly, has been trying to walk two sides of the road on this one—simply picked a side and said today or tomorrow that he would review the environmental approvals for the Adani coalmine because of the information that has come to light since those approvals were handed out, because of the litany of examples of environmental destruction in various different countries across the world, then that would create enough pressure, I believe, for the company to abandon this project. They know they have got a terrible track record of environmental destruction. They have been taken to court in their home country at least once and have been convicted of destroying mangroves and misoperating a port. What is the reaction here in Australia? Queensland Labor puts them in charge of a port, gives them a 99-year lease and says, 'She'll be right.' 


The Wangan and Jagalingou people are standing strong against this mine, and they are standing strong against having their rights complete subjugated by this bill, which would retrospectively validate an ILUA that does not reflect their wishes. We are standing with them. We are standing with the 70,000 people who want the reef protected and who want their jobs protected, and we are standing for positive job creation for regional Queensland that will last and will not trash the reef.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Native Title Amendment (Indigenous Land Use Agreements) Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,20,1
"McCarthy, Sen Malarndirri",ALP,2017-05-11,"



Senator McCARTHY
 (Northern Territory) (17:25): I rise to speak about an uncomfortable truth, because that is what the whole process leading into this debate has been about—and continues to be about—in relation to native title. It is an uncomfortable truth disguised as legislation. It is an uncomfortable truth disguised in urgent amendments. It is an uncomfortable truth that is tucked away behind legal speak—heard but not understood. Even here, in the house of the people, this truth remains uncomfortable. Why? Because it is the symbolic and deeper truth about our country—the unfinished, unspoken business of black and white Australia. 


Twenty-five years ago Eddie Mabo said no. He did not want to remain part of an uncomfortable truth tucked away, hidden. He did not want to be reassured with numbing advice that his legal options were impossible. He did not believe that his truth of being a strong Meriam man of the Murray Islands in the Torres Strait, nor his people's richness in historical past and resilience in the present, should be silent. But many around him did. They wanted to stay complicit in the silence. It was comfortable and easier than change.


This house of the people also stayed silent, as did most Australians, but the conscience of the great spirits of this beautiful land we all call home moved in the heart of one man and in the lives of his fellow plaintiffs, Reverend David Passi, Celuia Mapoo Salee, Sam Passi and James Rice. Like any family, there was, no doubt, division in Eddie Mabo's family and in his clan groups in the islands—bitter divisions, not least of which centred on the authority to make decisions about everyday life on Murray Island, about who could hunt where for the food that was needed to feed families or whose role it was to take the lead in ceremonies sacred to their people. It is human nature to have conflict. It takes a spiritual nature to pursue peace through such conflict.


There was friction in the understanding of legal doctrine and further separation of whose legal advice was the better to follow. Who could interpret the law in such a way as to dare challenge the centuries old law, the doctrine of terra nullius? Eddie Mabo did. His challenge and win in the High Court resulted in the Native Title Act.


Fast forward 25 years and the Noongar challenge in the Federal Court sees the Senate here today debating amendments in relation to the McGlade decision. While an important victory for some Noongar families—and I commend those families—it has created uncertainty for others. In fact there is uncertainty in the future of more than 100 Indigenous land use agreements, ILUAs, that we know of. I seek leave to table the 126 ILUAs that the federal government has failed to provide information to the Senate on.


Leave granted.




Senator McCARTHY:
  The job of the Senate is to scrutinise the possible impacts of that decision in this amended piece of legislation. A one-day Senate inquiry hearing, over a few weeks, is not a long time for examination, despite the best experienced people on that inquiry—I know my colleague Senator Pat Dodson has advocated strongly and passionately, within this fraught process, for the rights of native title holders. It is most regrettable that further time was not given to allow even conversations with the parties involved in the over 100 Indigenous land use agreements to see if they understand the ramifications of the McGlade decision and even this amendment before the Senate. I might add that, in the full routine of what this process has been so far, I have just received notice of another amendment, or the removal of an amendment, which just goes to show that this government has no idea and can give no confidence to this Senate or to the Australian people, and certainly not to the first nations people, that it has their best interests at heart.


There are many questions that remain unanswered, such as: how many ILUAs were registered prior to the Bygrave decision of 2010 which might be affected by the McGlade decision; what steps have been taken to identify and audit these agreements; how long would it take to identify and audit these agreements; and are there any other native title agreements—including the right-to-negotiate agreements concluded under section 31 of the Native Title Act and ILUAs registered prior to the Bygrave decision—that might be impacted by McGlade? Cape York Land Council is the only one that I am aware of that has done an audit of its agreements, and that is only because Senator Pat Dodson forced the government to meet with native title holders; otherwise, we would not have even known about Cape York's issue. And that is just one land council amongst a dozen land councils across this country and certainly hundreds, if not thousands, of native title applicants and custodians across the country.


It begs the question: have other Aboriginal land councils and native title representative bodies done audits? Can they confidently say there are no issues? Can the Attorney-General say with any confidence that we will not be here in the future with further amendments required as a consequence of these changes not being properly scrutinised or thoroughly consulted about with traditional owners right across the country? While the government has stated time and time again that this is not about Adani but about certainty for parties to native title agreements, Labor has supported the amendments on that basis—that they will bring certainty for native title groups, government and industry. However, there is more than a suggestion that this is not just about certainty for native title agreements. In the Senate committee inquiry into this legislation, former coalition MP Ian Macfarlane, who is now the CEO of the Queensland Resources Council, advised the committee that there may be another category of native title agreement. The CEO of the Queensland Resources Council advised the committee that there may be another category of native title agreement affected by McGlade which is not rectified by this amending legislation. These are agreements negotiated under the right-to-negotiate provisions of the Native Title Act.


These are enormously significant agreements, underpinning some of the largest resource projects in Australia. If what Mr Macfarlane advised the committee is correct, then there may be potentially hundreds of other native title agreements, and hence major resource projects, in doubt due to McGlade. The Attorney-General is aware of this issue. Indeed, Mr Macfarlane said he had spoken with him about that matter. But, despite the lack of certainty about these agreements, the government has not seen fit to address them in this amending legislation. They have been totally ignored.


I ask then: what about the certainty for the native title groups who are parties to those agreements negotiated under the right-to-negotiate provisions of the Native Title Act? What about the certainty, for that matter, for industry and government with respect to these projects? I find it curious that the government views it as urgent that ILUAs be given certainty but that some of the biggest resource projects in Australia, negotiated under the right-to-negotiate provisions of the Native Title Act, should not. And I wonder: in the two months since the Senate committee, why hasn't the government done the work to identify all classes of agreements affected by McGlade, including both ILUAs and the right-to-negotiate agreements?


These contradictions lead me to doubt whether this is really about certainty for all native title groups and parties. If these amendments truly were about certainty for all parties to native title agreements, surely the government would have seen fit to amend it.


On 30 June last year, the Federal Court of Australia handed down a judgement in a case of incredible significance for my Yanyuwa family in the Gulf of Carpentaria. Justice Mansfield, in one of his last judgements, found that exclusive native title still existed in Borroloola and was held by the Rrumburriya people, of which I am a member. He also found that, for the first time in the Northern Territory, the Rrumburriya people have, among their bundle of native title rights, the right to trade for commercial purposes. Now, although we have never described it in this way, the right to trade is something that we Yanyuwa people have always known forms part of our long cultural tradition. We have traded with other neighbouring clans and the Macassan visitors from Indonesia for many generations. But, although we have known this, it has taken this long to have it recognised by an Australian court.


While it was a moment of great celebration for my families, this success comes with a number of caveats. The native title system is uniquely difficult to understand and navigate, let me tell you. Native title claimants must endure endless meetings and interrogations in order to prove that they still have traditional laws and customs. Court processes requiring the filing of service of legal documents are completely alien to many Indigenous people, and sometimes the lawyers themselves have difficulty communicating the complex legal concepts underpinning the Native Title Act. One of the parts of this at times impenetrable native title system concerns the authorisation and execution process for Indigenous land use agreements, the processes of which are the subject of this current bill. Adding to this complexity is the fact that the system, which adjudicates on the very identity of Indigenous people and our legal rights, has its central power in institutions that are located far away, in the Commonwealth parliament in Canberra and in the highest courts in the land. Thus, there is no doubt in my mind that the native title system, despite all it can bring, can also cause alienation for the Indigenous people who it is said to assist.


Given the complexity of the native title system that Aboriginal people are forced to navigate, the profound impact on Aboriginal people's legal identities and rights of this system, and the remote location of the institutions that can affect these legal identities and rights, it is a matter of great sadness to me that these amendments have always been rushed and always come at the last minute. Of all the laws in Australia, the Native Title Act is meant to go some way to remedying the past dispossession suffered by Indigenous people. On this basis, it should never, ever be amended in haste. Amendments should always be thoroughly debated and consulted about, particularly with the Indigenous people who will be the most affected. The government, and in particular Senator Brandis, has failed to give native title legislation and, by extension, native title holders proper consideration and respect in this shabby process. The behaviour of the government has been shameful, secretive, cynical and arrogant.


There has been little recognition of the significant and long-term impacts these amendments will have on native title holders and the rights they fought so hard to have recognised. This government failed to consult properly with native title holders until they were dragged by Senator Pat Dodson to do so. The government were very selective in whom they decided to talk to and they have been even more selective in whom they decided to listen to in this mess of a process, which was created by them in their haste to force through flawed policy as a matter of political expediency.


Senators, traditional owners are your constituents. How many of you have asked them about this amendment? If I asked the traditional owners in the Northern Territory or even closer to home—if I ask the Yanyuwa traditional owners—who are also Native Title claimants, 'What does this legislation amendment mean to you?' they would probably say, 'I don't know. I need more information,' or, in Yanyuwa language, ngarna kudardi—'I don't know.'


The Senate might like to think it is up to the native title rep bodies or even the land councils. The government did not think that. But it is up to the senators to reach out to their Indigenous constituents. With over 100 Indigenous land use agreements across the country and 76 senators who represent this country, how many of you have even asked if any of the native title applicants in one of those ILUAs are in your constituency? How many of you have asked whether your constituents might need to know what is being debated in the Senate today? Do they agree? Do they understand why? Do you? If not, then how can we in the Senate, the house of the people, speak with confidence that this unexamined approach to amending the Native Title Act will end uncertainty? It is an act that requires at least a symbolic sacredness and respect because of the deeper truth that enabled its birth from the first nations people of Australia and our system of laws and beliefs, to attempt to build a future with the Westminster system of laws and beliefs.


To those families who brought us here today due to the McGlade decision—Mingli Wanjurri McGlade, Mervyn Eades, Naomi Smith and Aunty Margaret Culbong: I sincerely wish you well in the days ahead. To all those impacted by the McGlade decision, on all sides: may you find some comfort in knowing that this parliament acknowledges the strength of your struggles; keep believing in the impossible. Eddie Mabo did. I acknowledge his wife, Bonita, and daughter Gail Mabo, especially as we come close to the 25th anniversary of the High Court decision. Thank you for your guidance to me on this journey here today. I will keep believing that one day the uncomfortable truth will be a respected truth.


On behalf of the opposition, I move the amendment circulated in my name, on sheet 8150:


At the end of the motion, add: ""but the Senate expresses its disappointment with the regrettable way in which the Government has managed the process for consultation on the changes contained in the bill, which has been a source of unnecessary angst, confusion and delay"".

"Hanson-Young, Sen Sarah",AG,2017-05-11,"



Senator HANSON-YOUNG
 (South Australia) (17:42):  I rise this afternoon to add my comments to this debate on the Native Title Amendment (Indigenous Land Use Agreements) Bill 2017. Firstly, to contribute to the comments made previously by Senator Siewert and Senator Waters, it is a disgrace how the government has handled this piece of legislation in this place. It is an absolute exploitation of the fundamental issue of land rights in this country, again, with Indigenous people simply being used and abused when it suits the government. We all know why there was a suspension of standing orders earlier today by the Leader of the Government in the Senate to try to bring on this bill and ram it through this house tonight. That, of course, is because the government are more interested in the rights of mining companies than they are in the rights of Indigenous people. 


There are fundamental issues with the bill. We know we need to consider it in proper detail. Instead, all the government gives a damn about is giving a free pass to the mega coal company Adani. It is not even an Australian company. It is a dodgy, corrupt company based in India that is already under excessive investigation for corruption, money laundering, tax evasion—the list goes on. Why on earth are we seeing our parliament hijacked by a dodgy company like this, via the government of the day, just so that the company can get their project up off the ground? And let us not forget it is with the help of $1 billion of Australian taxpayers' money, offered up at mates rates by the Turnbull government.


It is absolutely appalling to see our parliament hijacked by such a corrupt, dodgy coal company. It proves just how much this government really is in the pocket of the fossil fuel industry. What on earth is Senator Canavan getting out of his continual advocacy in this place for the Adani project?




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Whish-Wilson
):  A point of order, Senator Canavan?




Senator Canavan:
  I usually let the imputations of a generic nature that regularly emanate from that corner of the chamber go without comment—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  That is debating the point. Address me.




Senator Canavan:
  But my point of order is that that is an imputation against a specific senator, and I ask that Senator Hanson-Young withdraw it.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  I will just take some advice on that, Senator Canavan. Senator Hanson-Young, it might help the Senate and the Chair if you withdraw that comment.




Senator HANSON-YOUNG:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, I will withdraw the comment. I still ask: what is the arrangement for the special mates rates deal that the government is giving this foreign company to not just exploit the land on which they want to run their project but put the entire challenge of our dealing with climate change at risk? One of the biggest problems with this project is that Australia will never be able to reach its weak targets, if the proposed amount of coal is dug out of the ground and burnt. If this project were to go ahead, we might as well say goodbye to climate action.


Why on earth does this company need a billion-dollar leg-up from the Australian taxpayer, if it is a good project anyway? It is because no-one else will bankroll them. The executives at Adani are desperate to get the final approvals done by the federal government. Of course, the Queensland state Labor government have done their bit to help this company every step of the way, and now we have, rushing through this parliament, the desperation of this company. Every time the minister stands up he says nothing about Australians; it is all about the big overseas company Adani. It is as if he is more the minister for Adani than he is the minister for Queenslanders or, indeed, Australians at large.


You have to question what on earth is really going on, because this government and particular ministers are so obsessed in relation to this project and with helping out this dodgy, corrupt company, who are going to burn our planet to a crisp if they are able to get this amount of coal out of the ground. We know that the coalition and, in particular, the National Party are absolutely in the pocket of the fossil fuel industry. They do not give two hoots about tackling climate change. They do not really give a damn about the limited amount of jobs that this company is going to create. We know that it is not as many as they claim, because in court they were found to have been lying.


That is not what they are obsessed about, because it does not make any sense. It is, of course, that this government and members of the government are absolutely in the pocket of the big fossil fuel corporations. These big fossil fuel companies, whether it be Adani, BP or Chevron, think they run this place. They think that they have every right to get bills voted on when they want to get their projects ticked off in their time frame—and they are happy to take the government handouts and leg-ups whenever they can as well. Tax rorts, handouts, cheap loans, mates rates—it goes on and on. The fossil fuel companies, those big multinational corporations, love to think they run this place. When are we going to start talking about the people's rights and land rights, not mining rights? When are we going to have that conversation in this place?


While I am at it, when we talk about those in the pocket of Adani, those doing everything they can to hand out a billion-dollar mates rates loan to this big company at the expense of funding schools or medical facilities in Queensland, you have to wonder what is going on inside the Labor Party as well. They are talking out of both sides of their mouth on this issue, and they absolutely know it. You have the Queensland government selling out their own people, and you have the federal Labor Party not knowing what to do. They are absolutely split on this issue. When is the Labor Party going to start standing up for proper action on climate change and staring down these climate criminals in these multinational companies? When are they going to have the guts to do that? Even just earlier today, we saw the Labor Party in this place not being able to sign off on a decent report about the risk of BP drilling for oil in the Great Australian Bight. We had a South Australian senator from the Labor Party cross the floor and sign off on a report with the Liberals to protect the interests of Chevron. You might wonder why on earth the Labor Party would get themselves into such a mess that you have one senator saying that Chevron and BP should have the right to drill for oil and the others—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Whish-Wilson
):  Is there a point of order, Senator Williams?




Senator Williams:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, what happens in committees in privacy should be kept private. Is that a position you would consider?




Senator HANSON-YOUNG:
  It is tabled.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  I was listening very carefully, Senator Williams. My reading of it was that Senator Hanson-Young, in respect of the signing of a committee document, was talking in a proverbial sense. I do not think she said it in a literal sense.




Senator HANSON-YOUNG:
  How interesting that people in this place are so tetchy about what really goes on behind the scenes. But it is not behind the scenes, because we have a South Australian Labor senator signing on to the report with two Liberal senators to say that it is A-OK to drill for oil and gas in the Great Australian Bight—cuddling up to the fossil fuel industry all over again. Isn't it interesting that Chevron, the big multinational company that wants to drill for oil and gas in the Great Australian Bight, donated money to the South Australian Labor Party within days of the hearing into that particular issue by the Senate committee? Isn't that interesting! People listening to this debate could obviously draw their own conclusions about why that particular South Australian senator had to sign on to a report that supported Chevron being able to drill for oil, but I think it is appalling. I think it is absolutely sickening to see the level of influence and corruption from the fossil fuel industry in this country creeping into every nook and cranny of how this Senate operates, from dictating when we debate bills, what time we will debate bills, to now dictating who will sign on to reports or not. This fossil fuel industry cannot continue to dominate what goes on in here.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator McAllister, I think I know what the point of order will be, but please make it.




Senator McAllister:
  I make the point that Senator Hanson-Young has cast a very serious aspersion on the motivations of one of our colleagues here in the Senate. I think it is contrary to the standing orders, and I ask you to ask her to retract it.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  I would agree with that. Please withdraw that comment, Senator Hanson-Young.




Senator HANSON-YOUNG:
  I will withdraw that. I simply point out that Chevron donated money to the South Australian Labor Party within a day of the hearing where South Australian senators sat in a hearing on an issue of the Great Australian Bight and allowing Chevron to drill for oil or not. It is extraordinary that, at a time when we should be cleaning up politics in this country, we see the government bending over backwards to help Adani, and we see the Labor Party incapable of getting their act together to stare down the crooks in the fossil fuel industry—the climate criminals who are going to fry this planet.

"McAllister, Sen Jenny",ALP,2017-05-11,"



Senator McALLISTER
 (New South Wales—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (17:54):  I thought I might talk about the bill before us! Labor has a long history with native title in this country. It was Labor, under Whitlam, who returned traditional lands in the Northern Territory to the Gurindji people, with the Prime Minister famously pouring sand into Vincent Lingiari's hands. It was Labor, under Keating, that introduced the Native Title Act in the wake of the historic Mabo ruling. And I do not say this to boast; I do not think any Australian could argue that as a nation our relationships with our first peoples have been without shortcomings or without error. I say it because Labor have a deep and enduring relationship with native title. It is something that we care about, it is something that we take seriously, it is something that we wish to protect, and it is this history and this perspective on the significance of native title and its seriousness as an issue that have guided every decision we have sought to take in relation to the bill before us. 


The integrity of the native title system is the only consideration that has been front of mind for the participants in negotiations around this bill, the Native Title Amendment (Indigenous Land Use Agreements) Bill 2017. This is the reason we are providing support to this bill. The recent McGlade decision by the Federal Court does have the potential to throw the entire future of our native title system into uncertainty. This is a real problem, and it needs to be solved. It is disappointing that this is not the approach that has been taken by others in this place.


The Greens political party do not have a policy position on this bill; they have a political strategy. They have been trying to tie these native title changes to Adani ever since the challenges related to the McGlade case first presented. Senator Siewert, back in February this year, said:


The news that Attorney General Brandis will hurriedly push through changes to the Native Title Act smacks of knee jerk reaction to a significant situation because they want to protect the Adani coal mine project …


There have been numerous comments from the member for Melbourne all this week. All this week, we have heard about it in this chamber. Senator Waters said on Tuesday:


No means no, yet this government is completely deaf to them, such that we now have a bill to ram through a reduction in native title rights just so the Adani mine can get up. 


Senator Siewert did it again today, during the debate on suspending standing orders. These statements are highly irresponsible. In characterising the Labor Party's position as being associated with Adani, the Greens political party have been highly irresponsible and entirely incorrect. This bill is not about Adani, and Labor's approach is not about Adani. Our approach has been about addressing a real problem that has presented.


The McGlade decision found that an Indigenous land use agreement for a particular area could not be registered unless all members of the registered native title claimant group were parties to the agreement. Whilst people may wish to deny this, this throws up huge logistical problems. If left unanswered, it means that more than 100 Indigenous land use agreements could be invalid. These are agreements that were negotiated in good faith by native title holders with land users on the basis of the law as it was then understood. They concern very large areas of land across Australia, including national parks, agricultural ventures and mining ventures. I had the very good fortune to attend the signing of an ILUA, probably about a decade ago, in relation to a national park in New South Wales and to see how very, very significant it was to the three women who had been fighting for that agreement to come into force for more than a decade. These agreements provide long-term benefits to communities and they fund services that are important to those communities.


In essence, this bill responds to the uncertainty in that decision. It amends the Native Title Act so that any Indigenous land use agreement which was authorised and registered prior to the decision will be valid, even if it was not signed by all members of the claimant group. Labor is supporting changes to the legislation only to the extent that they will restore the law to the status quo, as it was before the McGlade decision.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2017-05-11,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (16:32):  I have already made a few brief comments on this bill, the Native Title Amendment (Indigenous Land Use Agreements) Bill 2017, and I want to curtail my remarks because I think it is very important that this bill is voted on this afternoon so that we can bring certainty to the native title holders, certainty to land title groups right across Australia, certainty to the Adani proposals for mines in Central Queensland, certainty to the future prospects for jobs for workers and certainty to the Queensland government about the revenue streams that will flow once these issues are dealt with.


I took part in the debate as Chair of the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee, which conducted an inquiry into this legislation. I want to thank all of those who made submissions and all of those who appeared before the committee—and there were a lot of them—to give their evidence. We heard from all sides of the argument, and I think everyone had a very fair hearing. I particularly want to thank the secretariat of the committee, who, as always, did a wonderful job in assisting with the organisation of the hearings and the preparation of the final report. And I thank all senators on the committee for their cooperation. The committee was able to make a unanimous recommendation that the bill be passed, subject to some amendments which have been accepted by the government. The Attorney, in consultation with Senator Dodson and others, has refined the amendment we are dealing with today.


I will digress very slightly to something that was said in a debate on this topic earlier today. Senator McCarthy, unfortunately, misrepresented what I had said in my earlier speech about future amendments to this bill. Everyone acknowledges that there do have to be new amendments, but they are not being dealt with at the moment. This was specifically in relation to the McGlade decision. That was clear to everyone. Sometime in the future, at the Attorney's direction, there will be consultations, there will be draft bills issued and there will be amendments that the government will work with Indigenous spokesmen and stakeholders on to ensure that the new amendments are correct.


Finally, I make a plea. Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk, the Labor Premier of Queensland, I plead with you: please, pick up the phone and ring the four Queensland Labor senators. Ring them now. They are, in case you have forgotten, Premier, Senator Ketter, Senator Moore, Senator Chisholm and Senator Watt. You should have their phone numbers. Please ring them as representatives of Queensland and say that you, along with the federal government, along with Indigenous people and along with the workers in Central and North Queensland who do not have a job, are desperate to get this bill through the parliament. If that needs sitting tomorrow, as the government has proposed, can you please, Premier Palaszczuk, ask the Labor senators from Queensland, who are supposed to be helping Queensland, to give up their long weekend and get their colleagues in the Senate to sit tomorrow, on Friday, so that we can deal with this bill in a full eight hours of debate and get it passed? Everyone agrees it should be passed. I think it is essential that it should be done. Please, Premier Palaszczuk, ring your Queensland Labor senators and ask them to get off their bums, actually do the work and get this bill passed.

"Moore, Sen Claire",ALP,2017-05-11,"



Senator MOORE
 (Queensland) (16:37):  I am not going to respond to Senator Macdonald's last statement. He keeps making these statements across the chamber and it does not add to the quality of this debate. We have had a number of senators talk about the history of this piece of legislation. We know that the Native Title Amendment (Indigenous Land Use Agreements) Bill before us is an amendment bill. It was introduced by the government in the other place early this year—15 February. That was the first time that this bill appeared in this parliament. It amends the original Native Title Act to resolve the uncertainty that was created by the decision of the full Federal Court in what we have heard many times was McGlade v Native Title Registrar. That decision was handed down on 2 February this year.


All of us in this place understand the importance to our community and to our culture of the native title legislation. In fact, some of us remember exactly where we were when the original legislation was passed in 1993. In the community in which I was working at the time, we were waiting to hear what was going to happen after that extraordinarily long debate, which is probably still one of the longest debates in this place. Finally, the parliament in Australia ensured that there was native title legislation in our community. It is a very important piece of groundbreaking native title legislation.


Before us, we have an amendment to that and that must have fulsome and true consideration. There should not be, by any sense of urgency, a push in this place to rush things through. Having said that, I think that we are doing the right thing. We are, through the parliament, considering the legislation after the process of it being introduced. It came into the Senate after a bit of a flurry in getting the Senate Selection of Bills Committee to ensure that we had a hearing on the piece of legislation. That was an essential part of the process. The Senate did its job. The Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee reviewed the legislation and heard from people and organisations that gave up their time. With their professionalism, their knowledge and experience, they came to the Senate to give us their views on the legislation.


There have been a number of contributions in both this debate and in questions earlier today which may have seemed to indicate that at that Senate inquiry there was a unanimous view put forward that every person who came to that inquiry agreed that this amendment bill needed to be passed and to be passed urgently. Well, that is not true. As with most Senate inquiries, in which I have been involved, there was a wide range of opinion brought to the Senate committee. The Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee brought down its report, reflecting a wide range of views. But, as we have been told in previous contributions, the Labor senators, Senator Dodson and Senator Pratt, actually accepted that, on the basis of the evidence, because of the specifics of the McGlade decision and how they had impacted on native title, there was a need to ensure that there was a response from parliament to stop any uncertainty or confusion.


However, as we have heard from other contributions, this was only step 1 of the process. There was a need for further discussion. We have heard how Senator Dodson, Senator McCarthy and Mr Dreyfus were able to be involved in future discussions. Only then did more amendments appear. I understand that the latest amendment that is part of this discussion only appeared in parliament yesterday. So it is not such a straightforward process as some would make us believe.


In terms of what caused the legislation to be before us, we know that following the bringing down of the Keating legislation, the Native Title Act in 1993, we actually enshrined in legislation the decision of the High Court of Australia in Mabo v Queensland—my state—which upheld that the doctrine of terra nullius did not apply when there were already inhabitants present. Again, the importance to our community of the High Court decision followed by the response to that decision by our parliament must always be kept front of any discussion that we have about amending the legislation.


To make it clear—and I am actually quoting now from evidence and discussions that were put into the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee: following the Mabo decision, any Indigenous land rights which had not been extinguished by the Crown continued to exist in Australia. Since 1993, the Native Title Act has enabled the continued recognition and protection of Indigenous land rights. 


It is Labor's view—and it has been clearly enunciated by previous speakers from among Labour senators—that any changes to the Native Title Act must be properly considered and consulted on with Indigenous and Torres Strait Islander communities. That is a key component of our commitment to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities—no decision that impacts on their culture, their land rights and, in particular, this process that talks about the whole future of their relationship with land can ever be taken without full and proper consultation. That is something that this parliament should enshrine in the processes they put in place.


The Native Title Act provides a legislative process for native title groups to negotiate with other parties to form voluntary agreements in relation to the use of land and waters, referred to as Indigenous land use agreements—ILUAs, which people use as a shorthand way of defining these agreements. That was defined very clearly for us in the evidence that came to the committee. Currently, under section 24CD of the act, all persons of the native title group must be parties to an area ILUA. If there is a registered native title claimant for the purposes of the act, the native title group consists of that registered native title claimant. A registered native title claimant is defined again in the act under section 253 as:


… a person or persons whose name or names appear in an entry on the Register of Native Title Claims …


This enables a person or persons to enter into agreements as authorised by the native title group. The McGlade decision found that an area ILUA could not be registered unless all members of the registered native title claimant had signed the area ILUA, including members of the group who may have died. This ruling overturned the decision that had been current and on which a range of decisions had been made—the ruling of QGC Pty Ltd v Bygrave (No. 2) [2010], which found that an area ILUA could be registered if it had been signed by at least one member of the registered native title claimant group.


Post McGlade, the only alternative available to a registered native title claimant group is to re-authorise a new applicant and make an application under section 66B of the act to remove any member of the group who refused to sign. Stakeholders have indicated that this process can impose high costs on registered native title claimants and cause delays. There was significant evidence to the committee that this could cause confusion and worry in a community if they had to go through the whole process again of registering and then waiting for the process to go through the courts. The evidence that came to us was that consideration needed to be given to improving the amendments in the legislation that we are debating today in the parliament.


The McGlade decision has potentially far-reaching implications for approximately 126 existing registered ILUAs made over the past seven years in reliance on the decision in Bygrave. These decisions had been made, discussed in the communities and then registered on the Register of Native Title Claims. They had been finalised in good faith, and subsequent decisions about rights to the use of land and the opportunities that existed in communities had been made based on that agreement. These ILUAs include agreements concerning very large areas of land across Australia, including ILUAs made with respect to national parks, agricultural ventures and mining ventures.


This bill responds to the McGlade decision by amending the Native Title Act so that any area ILUA which was authorised and registered prior to the McGlade decision will be valid, despite not being signed by all members of the registered native title claimant group. We have been advised by the government that this change to the law will ensure the validity of approximately 126 registered ILUAs that were negotiated in good faith by native title holders with land users on the basis of the law, as it was clearly understood to be. The amendments that we are debating will also enable the registration of area ILUAs that were lodged for registration prior to the McGlade decision, despite not having been signed by all members of the registered native title claimant group. Again, advice from the government is that this will apply to a further eight ILUAs.


This was the information on which discussions during the meetings of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, as well as subsequent discussions in later weeks, were based. It was also the basis on which the Labor senators originally agreed to accept and support this native title amendment bill. But, subsequent to that, another series of amendments have come before the parliament which have been proposed to consider the situation of the Cape York Land Council. These amendments would extend the bill to also validate area ILUAs that could otherwise be rendered invalid if successfully challenged in the Federal Court on the basis that they were not signed by any registered native title claimant. This is another complication and, in terms of the principle, there is still the situation that we need to make quite clear so that people fully understand their rights and fully understand the implications of the decisions that we are making in the parliament. But that information was not available to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee when they met. It was not available to people who were looking at what was going on in the parliament until this week. I think this creates a sense of urgency and it was not effectively discussed and understood before the last period of discussion. Despite that, Labor have listened to the arguments put around the situation with the Cape York Land Council and their particular leases in that area. It is my understanding that we have agreed to approve that process as well. But this reinforces the concerns that have been raised by people in the community about the need for full consultation and understanding of the process.


I accept that we will never be able to fully please every person who has some ownership in this case. There will be differences of opinion. We see that and we must acknowledge that. But that almost gives greater cause for the processes that are in place, how we are proceeding and the basis on which we are proceeding to be adequately explained and understood. My concern is that, if we do not actually fully commit to that principle and understand the sensitivities, it could impact not just on this case but on cases into the future. So, on the basis of the evidence before us that has come from our consideration of this particular bill today, we believe that there have been cases made for the urgency and the need to ensure that there is no confusion in the community or in the various property and business processes that are taking place through agreements that were made prior to McGlade. We understand the need for that. But at the same time I think we have to make very clear our concerns about any perception that this has been rushed and any perception that people have not had their rights and their culture fully understood, accepted and respected. We need to make a commitment that we understand the concerns that have been raised about consultation and that any future action this parliament takes will respond to those sensitivities and to the understanding that full consultation will take place, because this is unfinished business. We know that there will continue to be further need for changes and amendments to the native title legislation.


As we know, when Labor's current shadow Attorney-General, Mr Dreyfus, was the Attorney-General he did refer issues to do with native title legislation to the Australian Law Commission to fully consider where we are now with this legislation and the changes that will have to take place into the future. Certainly, that particular law report now needs to be fully considered by government. There must be much further discussion in this place and a clear process put in place for how we will enshrine the consultative process into the future. We need to make sure that there is trust in the way the parliament will respond to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. That was the intent of the 1993 process. It was the intent of the High Court decision that there be a clear understanding of and commitment to the principles of native title legislation—of true ownership of land. In any discussions about native title in the future we absolutely need to ensure that trust is there and that there is an understanding that we will put in place appropriate and agreed consultation processes. If we do not do that, we will be destroying the history and the challenge of native title. If we do not do that, we will not be fulfilling the extraordinary work that was put in place by the Mabo process and the Mabo family, then and now, who continue, in many ways, to be the actual custodians of the native title legislation.


At this time, Labor are supporting the legislation, but we say that we can do the processes better, and we must do them better. Anyone who has listened to the contribution made by Senator Dodson would understand the way in which we can do this better. I know that Senator McCarthy will be making the same comments in the future as she has made today about what we must do. I think this should be one of the processes that comes out of today's debate: looking at today's legislation and the amendments, which we are supporting, but learning from the process to ensure that this negotiation, this discussion, cannot be rushed.


We need to ensure that consultation takes place. We do not need to have cracks across this chamber saying that the process of having full debate in this place is determined by whether senators want to have a long weekend or not. That does no honour to the person who makes those comments, and it certainly does not reflect appropriate discussion in this Senate. No-one owns morality. No-one owns best practice. But we can do better than exchanging barbs in that way.


What we must do in the parliament is look at legislation, listen to the people who have knowledge, experience and ownership and then balance the arguments here, openly debate the process and move forward, bringing people together rather than laying down laws upon them from outside. And if we do that we will continue the message of Mabo. We will continue the message of the Keating legislation from 1993, and we will enshrine true native title in this community together rather than divided.

Senator SMITH
 (Western Australia—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (16:56):  It is a pleasure to make a contribution to this important piece of legislation, the Native Title Amendment (Indigenous Land Use Agreements) Bill 2017, this evening. It is a piece of legislation that has significance for every Australian. By way of history, in 1992 the High Court of Australia handed down a historical decision in the Mabo v Queensland case, recognising that the common law of Australia recognise rights and interests to land held by Indigenous people under their traditional laws and customs. The Mabo and Wik decisions and the subsequent Native Title Act 1993 were salient points in the history of this nation and the changing relationship between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians.


For over 24 years the act has served Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities well, until 2 February this year, when the Federal Court handed down the McGlade v Native Title Registrar decision, which has invalidated land use agreements across the country. It has also seen the $1.3 billion Western Australian South West land use agreement with the Noongar people, which included a benefits package with annual payments of $50 million into a Noongar future fund over 12 years and 320,000 hectares of land handed over to Noongar ownership, shelved. This decision of the Federal Court has created uncertainty throughout the native title sector, especially over the status of Indigenous Land Use Agreements, or ILUAs. It means that ILUAs without the signatures of all registered native title claimant members, including members who are deceased, cannot be registered. Simply, this means that if a single member of the registered native title group withholds their consent or dies before authorising it, the agreement cannot be registered. This also means that the only alternative to the native title claim group is to re-authorise a new applicant and make a new application under section 66B of the act, removing the member or members of the registered group who refused to sign.


This is an unnecessary and unacceptable barrier on the native title system. It is a barrier for native title stakeholders, imposing high costs for claim groups, which often have limited resources, as well as delays for claimants and third parties. It raises considerable uncertainty for all parties doing business on native title land, especially in my home state of Western Australia. Pastoralists, mining companies, oil and gas companies, tourism operators, fishing and pearling businesses, and local government authorities are all left with a high degree of uncertainty over their existing and future native title land use agreements. This is primarily because native title has a greater impact on Western Australia than on any other Australian jurisdiction. Western Australia is exposed to the responsibilities of native title more than any other territory or state in the Commonwealth. Approximately 85 per cent of the state of Western Australia is subject to either a native title claim or has already received a Federal Court of Australia native title determination that recognises the existence of native title rights and interests.


The sheer size of these determinations accounts for over 50 per cent of the total national land area. There are 79 currently filed native title claims in Western Australia, on top of 60 native title determinations. This compares with just 277 outstanding claims and 316 determinations nationally. Western Australia also grants the highest number of land and mineral licences and titles in Australia, the majority of which must comply with the future acts regime of the Native Title Act.


For those unaware, a future act is an act done after 1 January 1994 which affects native title. A future act can be any proposed activity or development on land or waters that has the potential to affect native title by extinguishing it or by creating interests that are inconsistent with the existence or exercise of native title. Other than the issue of the goods and services tax, the most significant state federal financial issue facing Western Australia is native title determinations, especially future acts. This is a $1 billion plus issue for the future of Western Australia.


This is because, in my home state of Western Australia, the most common future acts are the proposed grants of mining or land titles by the Department of Mines and Petroleum and the Department of Lands. It is because in Western Australia all native title claims are determined in the Federal Court, with the WA state government as first respondent. The preferred outcome for all native title claims is that they be resolved through mediation rather than litigation, utilising ILUAs, voluntary agreements primarily about access, which are registered and held by the National Native Title Tribunal and bind all persons who hold native title to the agreement, whether they are parties or not.


The importance of ILUAs in the native title system cannot be understated. An ILUA may address issues of access, compensation, extinguishment and coexistence. An ILUA may be made separately from the formal native title process, form a part of that process or pave the way for a native title determination. An ILUA does not extinguish native title but may, by agreement, allow for the surrender of native title. Most importantly, an ILUA can address past and intermediate acts as well as future acts. It may also replace the future act process entirely.


The Federal Court's decision of 2 February this year has far-reaching implications for the approximately 150 existing Indigenous land use agreements that have been made under the Native Title Act, most of them made in the past seven years. In addition to the implications for agreements made with the Noongar people in WA's southwest, it also has far-reaching implications for future land agreements that are currently under negotiation, not just in Western Australia but across every state and territory. Correcting this level of uncertainty has motivated the government to respond quickly and offer a remedy to ensure that all of these agreements have the status that is expected by those registered native title groups and communities that have entered into them.


This is a legislative response that will secure existing agreements which have been registered on or before 2 February this year but do not comply with the Federal Court's decision on McGlade. They will clarify who must be a party to an area ILUA in the future, unless the claim group determines otherwise. These are important changes. Most importantly, they do not alter the intent of the Native Title Act. They give certainty in the Commonwealth legislation to the agreements that have already been struck. They give certainty not only to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people but also to all parties who have entered into the agreements, so that they can plan the way forward as agreed and honour those commitments.


The source of native title rights and interests is the traditional laws and customs of the native title holders. This means that the nature of native title rights and interests varies from community to community. This is also why native title can coexist with other forms of land title such as pastoral leases but is extinguished by others such as freehold. However, there are fundamental differences between land rights and native title. Land rights are rights created by the Australian state or territory governments. Land rights usually comprise a grant or a freehold or perpetual lease title given to Indigenous Australians. By contrast, native title arises as a result of the recognition, under Australian common law, of pre-existing Indigenous rights and interests according to traditional laws and customs.


It is extraordinary that, even for a moment, the Labor Party and the Greens would have objected to passing this bill. It is extraordinary but perhaps not unexpected, and I will tell you why. For all their talk about working to make the native title system better, fairer and more transparent, the Labor Party continue to fall short. It was a Labor Attorney-General who removed funding for native title respondents, a move that significantly impacted on native title determinations at the time, not just in WA but also in Queensland and in New South Wales. It was a Labor Prime Minister who, in 2001, advised the WA state government that it would no longer honour the 1994 agreement made by then Labor Prime Minister Paul Keating, the architect of the original Native Title Act, and that the Commonwealth would bear the lion's share of the burden for compensating for native title by funding up to 75 per cent of the compensation costs arising from the validation of past acts on determined native title lands. It is the Labor Party who today, again, is playing games with the passage of a bill that will protect the validity of ILUAs and the integrity of the native title process.


This bill is yet another example of how the government is addressing, not ignoring, the deficiencies of our native title regime. As a senator for Western Australia, I support the bill and look forward to playing my part in working with colleagues to ensure that our native title framework operates in a manner that is fair and provides certainty to all parties across all states and territories.

Senator WATERS
 (Queensland—Co-Deputy Leader of the Australian Greens) (17:05):  I rise to speak on the Native Title Amendment (Indigenous Land Use Agreements) Bill 2017, which is also known as the bill to ram through the Adani coalmine against the wishes of the local Wangan and Jagalingou people. It is known as the bill to give certainty to big miners whilst subjugating the rights of our First Australians.


First, I go to the process. As we know, this bill was rushed through the House of Representatives about five seconds after the court case found that many of these ILUAs are invalid because not all of the native title claimants and registered claimants have ticked off on them. That was an eminently sensible decision by one of our courts. Of course, this government does not like the fact that that casts some doubt on the ability of the big miners to ride roughshod over not just our land but the rights of Indigenous people whose land it was and still is.


We have concerns about the time frame and the fact that this was rushed through not only the House but then a very hasty Senate committee process. As the record will show, we Greens sought to extend out the report date for inquiry but, sadly, we were not supported by the Senate to do that. The upshot of that was that submitters did not have enough time to prepare their submissions and we only had one hearing. Everyone would accept that native title as a body of law is incredibly complicated. It is also an issue where it is incredibly important that we get it right. We have a legacy in this country of abominable decisions when it comes to recognising and respecting our First Australians. This native title bill is regularly criticised for being a poor construct which ill fits with the rights that still exist and should be legally recognised as still existing. So to be rushing through a bodgied up amendment at the last minute to an already complex area of law is bad practice, but to do that to favour a big mining company to open up one of the biggest coalmines in the world to further trash the climate and the Reef is utterly unforgivable. Those are our concerns with the process.


There is a lot of opinion about this bill. Clearly, Aboriginal people do not speak with one voice and, clearly, we should not seek to speak for them, which is another matter I will go into. But the other issue we have is that there has not been enough consultation on the effect of these proposed changes. I have personally met with traditional owners particularly from that Wangan and Jagalingou group who are deeply opposed to ramming through these changes to our native title laws. Adrian Burragubba and his niece Murrawah Johnson have been campaigning for reforms to the native title system, as have many other traditional owners in Queensland I have had occasion to meet with. They have been campaigning for their rights to be properly respected. Instead, there has been a litany of frankly dodgy practice around the signing of this ILUA. I have had lengthy briefings with Adrian where he has explained to me how the mining company has bussed up people who are not even from the local area to stack the meetings.




Senator Canavan interjecting
—






Senator WATERS:
  Can I ask that you call the minister to order, please, Mr Acting Deputy President Gallacher.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Gallacher
):  Order on my right!




Senator WATERS:
  So they have been bussing in people who do not genuinely represent the Wangan and Jagalingou mob. As a result, an ILUA has been signed that does not reflect the wishes of that mob. Is it any wonder that the government wants to preference the needs and wishes of a big mining company ahead of reaching a genuine consensus and a genuine free, prior and informed consent arrangement with our First Australians?


Our laws do not enshrine the requirement for free, prior and informed consent. Internationally we have that obligation, but there have been no steps whatsoever taken to put that into our domestic laws. This is a real blight that we should be attending to fix as a matter of urgency, but, no, that would of course make it more difficult for the big mining companies. So you will not see that out of this government, and you probably will not see it out of the opposition either.


It is pretty clear that this bill is a sop to Adani, and the relevant minister admitted as much earlier today. He really belled the cat in that Adani have leant on the government, they have leant on the state government and they have demanded certainty—the audacity of them demanding certainty when this is and always will be Indigenous land—and now the government is saying, 'Oh, you want us to jump? How far would you like us to jump?' and are ramming through these laws. We saw the Queensland Premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, head off to India in the last few weeks and do a deal with the head of the Adani Group and assure him that it would all be settled, that it would be fine and that she would sort it out. They have rolled out the red carpet for this company. It is a shame that they have done no such thing when it comes to the First Australians in Queensland.


Of course, hot on the heels of the Queensland Premier was none other than the Prime Minister himself, who also went over to India in a big sop to Adani and its company group. He also said, 'We'll sort it out; don't you worry about that, mate. We will trash the native title rights and we will fix this for you so that you can build one of the largest coalmines in the world on Indigenous land. We don't care if the local mob don't support it. We've got some signatures on a bit of paper from the wrong people, but we don't care; we will use the law to abuse the process and make sure that your donations keep flowing to us and that you can rip out the guts from our land.'


It is really clear that the impacts of this mine would completely trash the significance and specialty of that land, both for non-Indigenous people and also, importantly, for the Wangan and Yagalingu people. They are deeply concerned about the impacts on groundwater and the impacts on their dreaming sites. They have taken me powerfully through some of the dreaming stories of that land, and it is moving and something that should be respected. Instead, this government is saying that it wants to simply roll out the red carpet even more for a big mining company and it does not give a damn about the rights of the Wangan and Yagalingu people, who are desperate to have their voices heard in the native title process and to have their rights respected. But, as we have seen, the native title process itself has been a construct that, from the word go, was a compromise to suit the white fella. And now we have some amendments which will make it even more convenient for the mining companies and even less of a genuine system to recognise the prior existing rights of Indigenous people. It is an absolute abomination, in my view.


Moving to the impacts of this bill: if this is passed—and we will fight it—it will retrospectively validate those ILUAs which a court has found to be dodgy, to be not properly signed, because not enough of the relevant traditional owners signed on to them to make them valid ILUAs. So the government want to retrospectively validate an agreement to facilitate a big mining company. Often they come in here and try to say that they are doyens of the law and that they do not like retrospectivity. There is a principle against retrospectivity in lawmaking, because it changes things after the fact. You are not meant to do it—in plain language—but this government do not care, because, again, Adani has said, 'Jump' and the government have said, 'How high?' So they want to retrospectively validate these dodgy ILUAs and subjugate the rights of the Wangan and Yagalingu people.


This mine is probably the best example of the worst and most appalling way that the big parties are working for the interests of big mining companies, and the big corporates generally, ahead of the interests of ordinary people. It is no surprise and it is no wonder that Australians think that our system is broken and that our economic system is rigged against everyday people. This is the same system that lets the greedy bankers rip off everyday people with the full protection of politicians—although we note with pleasure that the banking levy, a partial adoption of Greens policy, has been proposed in the budget. This is the same system that would let Adani take unlimited groundwater from our state, which is 90 per cent in drought. Nobody else gets free water, but this mega-multinational mining company is going to get free groundwater in a state that is 90 per cent in drought.


This is the same system that wants to give a billion dollars of public money to that very same company, as a concessional loan. It will cost the budget—and we have sought to establish that in estimates—tens of millions of dollars to give this concessional loan to a company led by a billionaire, who should not need the support. Adani has got a complex corporate web of companies. If it cannot even organise itself to fund its own project, why is the taxpayer being asked to put up their hand and provide public money for this project?


On that point, I want to pick Labor up for trying to walk both sides of the fence. They keep saying that if this project stacks up then it should get NAIF funding. Well, the whole point of the NAIF funding is that it can only fund projects that do not stack up commercially. So I am afraid that Labor's rhetoric is utterly inconsistent when it comes to its pathetically divided approach on this enormous mega-mine.


One wonders why the big mining companies, and Adani in particular, have such influence over both sides of politics and both levels of government, and one needs to look no further than the political donations that are made by the fossil fuel companies to both sides of politics. At last count it was $3.7 million over three years that the fossil fuel sector—that is, big coal and big gas—have given to the Liberals, to the Labor Party and to the National Party. That is $3.7 million to run their election campaigns, as they desperately try to cling to power. And then they buckle on implementing their principles once they get into power, but that is beside the point. These donations are incredibly generous, and it is very clear that they are having the impact of policies that are designed to benefit the big corporates and to sacrifice the environment and to ignore the interests of ordinary community members.


So that is why there is the powerful movement that has sprung up in opposition to this mine. It is a David and Goliath battle. You have got the big miners and the big corporates generally. You have got their big donations. You have got the well-connected lobbyists—the former politicians who now work for those very same mining companies, or their former staffers. Again, it is a revolving door when it comes to the fossil fuel sector; one minute they are in this place making decisions; the next, they are promised a cushy job and they are out working for the industry, and back and forth it goes. I have spoken at length in this chamber about that previously—about the absolutely sordid links between the fossil fuel sector and the parliament, and the fact that it is no wonder that we get poor decisions out of this place when they are so impossibly hocked to the industry.


So one would think that this is a David and Goliath battle that people-power might not win. But people-power will win this because ordinary Australians do not want to see Indigenous rights trashed. They do not want to see our Reef further cooked by turbocharging climate change, like this mega-mine would do. They do not want to see a billion dollars of taxpayers' money given to a multinational company that does not need the help—and when that money could be so desperately better spent in other areas, and when they have not even had a chance to have a say on how that money should be spent. Many people in the community whom I speak to in Queensland are horrified when they hear that this project might get a billion dollars of public money, because, they say, 'I was never asked whether that was what my community wanted. We want better schools. We want better hospitals. We want some renewable energy jobs. We do not want a billion dollars being given to this dog of a project that will not employ anywhere near as many people as they claim it will.' And the company has admitted that—it acknowledges that it is not going to be 10,000 jobs. It might be 1,464, but who knows? We will have to wait and see. Of course, they are all FIFO jobs.


And we have seen the impact of the mining boom-and-bust cycle. Look at Gladstone. That poor town is now thoroughly destitute after the boom. I remember going to Gladstone five years ago; you could not get a hotel room. And now, of course, there are an awful lot of empty properties, because that is what happens when you get a mining boom-and-bust cycle. It puts communities through the washing machine, and they end up worse off because rates of violence, and domestic violence in particular, skyrocket; the cost of living skyrockets; and then the miners up and leave town, and the community is left with nothing. They have just ridden roughshod over that community, and I do not want that to happen to other communities in Queensland.


We have also seen in Queensland the resurgence of black lung, which coalminers are now suffering. We thought that that disease, pneumoconiosis, as it is known, was stamped out decades ago. But it is back. So these are not the sorts of jobs that you would want anyone to be working in, because people are now dying from them. Why this government and the state government thinks that the only possible job that can be created in regional Queensland is a coal job just shows an absolute lack of imagination and an absolute lack of understanding that we are now in this century. We have other options. Clean energy can do the job technologically and, if we hurry up then we will not get further behind the world.


Again, it comes back to those donations. It must be that is why the big mining companies have so much sway over both sides of politics, and it is why that is all the jobs they can think of—jobs that are short term, that will not last, that are subject to that boom and bust cycle, that are killing its workers and, importantly, that are threatening the reef itself and the 70,000 jobs that rely on the reef remaining healthy.


I have been to the reef many a time, and it made a huge impact on me. It is an absolutely magnificent place. If anyone has not had the joy of experiencing it, I would encourage them to do so. But it is under threat. We have already seen it being slammed with the two worst coral-bleaching episodes in its ancient history, the worst ever in the last two years, two successive years. Never before has the reef suffered such bleaching and never before has it happened in back-to-back years.


The scientists are being crystal clear about this. They could not be clearer. Terry Hughes and others of his ilk have been pleading and begging with decision makers at all levels of government saying: 'We cannot have more coal in the system. It is a choice between new coal or the reef. The reef can't take it anymore.' It has been falling on deaf ears in this place. Indeed, when my colleague, Senator Peter Whish-Wilson, asked a question in the last sitting which pointed to Terry Hughes' desperate despair at the future of this reef that he loves, and so many other people love, he was ridiculed and mocked and offered a hanky. Come on, this is the federal parliament of Australia. Surely we can do better than that. We are talking about the future of an organism that can be seen from space, that will outlive and outlast all of us unless this mob continues to trash it by handing free money to big mining companies to line their own pockets with profits and then trash the climate for the rest of us and for future generations to look after. That is why this bill is so important. It is not only about Indigenous rights and the future of where we want to take the economy; it is also about what we want to do to this planet.


I have mentioned before that the red carpet has been rolled out for this company, and I want to go through precisely what state Labor have done. They have given a water licence with unlimited and free groundwater for the Adani Carmichael coalmine. They have offered Adani a royalty holiday. So not only do this company have the privilege of a billion dollars of public money that they will probably be awarded under this government; they are not even going to have to pay for the privilege. And here is the catch: the Queensland government is not even telling us the details of this royalty holiday. They will not say how long it is going to be for and they will not admit how much money Queenslanders will forego because the government is giving this company a free ride. What an absolute joke!


They have also created a special loophole for Adani so that there are no appeals available to the community against the water licence. Again, nobody else gets that sort of special treatment. Nobody else says: 'The processes don't apply to you. You can have this free pass. We'll make sure the community can't exercise the rights that they would otherwise have. She'll be right, mate.' Queensland Labor and, of course, this government here at the federal level as well, have approved the mine at every stage and at every level. Queensland Labor have now actively lobbied for federal funding for this project after they went to our state election saying they would save the reef, and people desperately wanted them to; they wanted to believe that. They said they would not put a cent of public money into the project and it had to stand on its own two feet. They had also earlier said, through their own Treasury officials, that this was an unbankable project.


And so what a surprise when, now that they are in government, they are actively lobbying for that federal money, that taxpayer money, to be given to this project! Interestingly, they have a veto power—it is not really being spoken about much. The Queensland government can veto the $1 billion that NAF might approve and probably will approve and give to Adani—and we would be urging them to do so, to stand firm on what were clear election commitments that they made, that the community supported because the community loves the reef and wants to see it protected and not trashed for the sake of a few extra dollars in a billionaire's back pocket.


It is pretty clear the processes are being rigged with vested interests. I have talked about the enormous amounts of donations, and that is probably why they are greasing the palms of the process that is happening here. But I want to also remind federal Labor that they are not without power here. If Mr Bill Shorten—who, frankly, has been trying to walk two sides of the road on this one—simply picked a side and said today or tomorrow that he would review the environmental approvals for the Adani coalmine because of the information that has come to light since those approvals were handed out, because of the litany of examples of environmental destruction in various different countries across the world, then that would create enough pressure, I believe, for the company to abandon this project. They know they have got a terrible track record of environmental destruction. They have been taken to court in their home country at least once and have been convicted of destroying mangroves and misoperating a port. What is the reaction here in Australia? Queensland Labor puts them in charge of a port, gives them a 99-year lease and says, 'She'll be right.' 


The Wangan and Jagalingou people are standing strong against this mine, and they are standing strong against having their rights complete subjugated by this bill, which would retrospectively validate an ILUA that does not reflect their wishes. We are standing with them. We are standing with the 70,000 people who want the reef protected and who want their jobs protected, and we are standing for positive job creation for regional Queensland that will last and will not trash the reef.

"McCarthy, Sen Malarndirri",ALP,2017-05-11,"



Senator McCARTHY
 (Northern Territory) (17:25): I rise to speak about an uncomfortable truth, because that is what the whole process leading into this debate has been about—and continues to be about—in relation to native title. It is an uncomfortable truth disguised as legislation. It is an uncomfortable truth disguised in urgent amendments. It is an uncomfortable truth that is tucked away behind legal speak—heard but not understood. Even here, in the house of the people, this truth remains uncomfortable. Why? Because it is the symbolic and deeper truth about our country—the unfinished, unspoken business of black and white Australia. 


Twenty-five years ago Eddie Mabo said no. He did not want to remain part of an uncomfortable truth tucked away, hidden. He did not want to be reassured with numbing advice that his legal options were impossible. He did not believe that his truth of being a strong Meriam man of the Murray Islands in the Torres Strait, nor his people's richness in historical past and resilience in the present, should be silent. But many around him did. They wanted to stay complicit in the silence. It was comfortable and easier than change.


This house of the people also stayed silent, as did most Australians, but the conscience of the great spirits of this beautiful land we all call home moved in the heart of one man and in the lives of his fellow plaintiffs, Reverend David Passi, Celuia Mapoo Salee, Sam Passi and James Rice. Like any family, there was, no doubt, division in Eddie Mabo's family and in his clan groups in the islands—bitter divisions, not least of which centred on the authority to make decisions about everyday life on Murray Island, about who could hunt where for the food that was needed to feed families or whose role it was to take the lead in ceremonies sacred to their people. It is human nature to have conflict. It takes a spiritual nature to pursue peace through such conflict.


There was friction in the understanding of legal doctrine and further separation of whose legal advice was the better to follow. Who could interpret the law in such a way as to dare challenge the centuries old law, the doctrine of terra nullius? Eddie Mabo did. His challenge and win in the High Court resulted in the Native Title Act.


Fast forward 25 years and the Noongar challenge in the Federal Court sees the Senate here today debating amendments in relation to the McGlade decision. While an important victory for some Noongar families—and I commend those families—it has created uncertainty for others. In fact there is uncertainty in the future of more than 100 Indigenous land use agreements, ILUAs, that we know of. I seek leave to table the 126 ILUAs that the federal government has failed to provide information to the Senate on.


Leave granted.




Senator McCARTHY:
  The job of the Senate is to scrutinise the possible impacts of that decision in this amended piece of legislation. A one-day Senate inquiry hearing, over a few weeks, is not a long time for examination, despite the best experienced people on that inquiry—I know my colleague Senator Pat Dodson has advocated strongly and passionately, within this fraught process, for the rights of native title holders. It is most regrettable that further time was not given to allow even conversations with the parties involved in the over 100 Indigenous land use agreements to see if they understand the ramifications of the McGlade decision and even this amendment before the Senate. I might add that, in the full routine of what this process has been so far, I have just received notice of another amendment, or the removal of an amendment, which just goes to show that this government has no idea and can give no confidence to this Senate or to the Australian people, and certainly not to the first nations people, that it has their best interests at heart.


There are many questions that remain unanswered, such as: how many ILUAs were registered prior to the Bygrave decision of 2010 which might be affected by the McGlade decision; what steps have been taken to identify and audit these agreements; how long would it take to identify and audit these agreements; and are there any other native title agreements—including the right-to-negotiate agreements concluded under section 31 of the Native Title Act and ILUAs registered prior to the Bygrave decision—that might be impacted by McGlade? Cape York Land Council is the only one that I am aware of that has done an audit of its agreements, and that is only because Senator Pat Dodson forced the government to meet with native title holders; otherwise, we would not have even known about Cape York's issue. And that is just one land council amongst a dozen land councils across this country and certainly hundreds, if not thousands, of native title applicants and custodians across the country.


It begs the question: have other Aboriginal land councils and native title representative bodies done audits? Can they confidently say there are no issues? Can the Attorney-General say with any confidence that we will not be here in the future with further amendments required as a consequence of these changes not being properly scrutinised or thoroughly consulted about with traditional owners right across the country? While the government has stated time and time again that this is not about Adani but about certainty for parties to native title agreements, Labor has supported the amendments on that basis—that they will bring certainty for native title groups, government and industry. However, there is more than a suggestion that this is not just about certainty for native title agreements. In the Senate committee inquiry into this legislation, former coalition MP Ian Macfarlane, who is now the CEO of the Queensland Resources Council, advised the committee that there may be another category of native title agreement. The CEO of the Queensland Resources Council advised the committee that there may be another category of native title agreement affected by McGlade which is not rectified by this amending legislation. These are agreements negotiated under the right-to-negotiate provisions of the Native Title Act.


These are enormously significant agreements, underpinning some of the largest resource projects in Australia. If what Mr Macfarlane advised the committee is correct, then there may be potentially hundreds of other native title agreements, and hence major resource projects, in doubt due to McGlade. The Attorney-General is aware of this issue. Indeed, Mr Macfarlane said he had spoken with him about that matter. But, despite the lack of certainty about these agreements, the government has not seen fit to address them in this amending legislation. They have been totally ignored.


I ask then: what about the certainty for the native title groups who are parties to those agreements negotiated under the right-to-negotiate provisions of the Native Title Act? What about the certainty, for that matter, for industry and government with respect to these projects? I find it curious that the government views it as urgent that ILUAs be given certainty but that some of the biggest resource projects in Australia, negotiated under the right-to-negotiate provisions of the Native Title Act, should not. And I wonder: in the two months since the Senate committee, why hasn't the government done the work to identify all classes of agreements affected by McGlade, including both ILUAs and the right-to-negotiate agreements?


These contradictions lead me to doubt whether this is really about certainty for all native title groups and parties. If these amendments truly were about certainty for all parties to native title agreements, surely the government would have seen fit to amend it.


On 30 June last year, the Federal Court of Australia handed down a judgement in a case of incredible significance for my Yanyuwa family in the Gulf of Carpentaria. Justice Mansfield, in one of his last judgements, found that exclusive native title still existed in Borroloola and was held by the Rrumburriya people, of which I am a member. He also found that, for the first time in the Northern Territory, the Rrumburriya people have, among their bundle of native title rights, the right to trade for commercial purposes. Now, although we have never described it in this way, the right to trade is something that we Yanyuwa people have always known forms part of our long cultural tradition. We have traded with other neighbouring clans and the Macassan visitors from Indonesia for many generations. But, although we have known this, it has taken this long to have it recognised by an Australian court.


While it was a moment of great celebration for my families, this success comes with a number of caveats. The native title system is uniquely difficult to understand and navigate, let me tell you. Native title claimants must endure endless meetings and interrogations in order to prove that they still have traditional laws and customs. Court processes requiring the filing of service of legal documents are completely alien to many Indigenous people, and sometimes the lawyers themselves have difficulty communicating the complex legal concepts underpinning the Native Title Act. One of the parts of this at times impenetrable native title system concerns the authorisation and execution process for Indigenous land use agreements, the processes of which are the subject of this current bill. Adding to this complexity is the fact that the system, which adjudicates on the very identity of Indigenous people and our legal rights, has its central power in institutions that are located far away, in the Commonwealth parliament in Canberra and in the highest courts in the land. Thus, there is no doubt in my mind that the native title system, despite all it can bring, can also cause alienation for the Indigenous people who it is said to assist.


Given the complexity of the native title system that Aboriginal people are forced to navigate, the profound impact on Aboriginal people's legal identities and rights of this system, and the remote location of the institutions that can affect these legal identities and rights, it is a matter of great sadness to me that these amendments have always been rushed and always come at the last minute. Of all the laws in Australia, the Native Title Act is meant to go some way to remedying the past dispossession suffered by Indigenous people. On this basis, it should never, ever be amended in haste. Amendments should always be thoroughly debated and consulted about, particularly with the Indigenous people who will be the most affected. The government, and in particular Senator Brandis, has failed to give native title legislation and, by extension, native title holders proper consideration and respect in this shabby process. The behaviour of the government has been shameful, secretive, cynical and arrogant.


There has been little recognition of the significant and long-term impacts these amendments will have on native title holders and the rights they fought so hard to have recognised. This government failed to consult properly with native title holders until they were dragged by Senator Pat Dodson to do so. The government were very selective in whom they decided to talk to and they have been even more selective in whom they decided to listen to in this mess of a process, which was created by them in their haste to force through flawed policy as a matter of political expediency.


Senators, traditional owners are your constituents. How many of you have asked them about this amendment? If I asked the traditional owners in the Northern Territory or even closer to home—if I ask the Yanyuwa traditional owners—who are also Native Title claimants, 'What does this legislation amendment mean to you?' they would probably say, 'I don't know. I need more information,' or, in Yanyuwa language, ngarna kudardi—'I don't know.'


The Senate might like to think it is up to the native title rep bodies or even the land councils. The government did not think that. But it is up to the senators to reach out to their Indigenous constituents. With over 100 Indigenous land use agreements across the country and 76 senators who represent this country, how many of you have even asked if any of the native title applicants in one of those ILUAs are in your constituency? How many of you have asked whether your constituents might need to know what is being debated in the Senate today? Do they agree? Do they understand why? Do you? If not, then how can we in the Senate, the house of the people, speak with confidence that this unexamined approach to amending the Native Title Act will end uncertainty? It is an act that requires at least a symbolic sacredness and respect because of the deeper truth that enabled its birth from the first nations people of Australia and our system of laws and beliefs, to attempt to build a future with the Westminster system of laws and beliefs.


To those families who brought us here today due to the McGlade decision—Mingli Wanjurri McGlade, Mervyn Eades, Naomi Smith and Aunty Margaret Culbong: I sincerely wish you well in the days ahead. To all those impacted by the McGlade decision, on all sides: may you find some comfort in knowing that this parliament acknowledges the strength of your struggles; keep believing in the impossible. Eddie Mabo did. I acknowledge his wife, Bonita, and daughter Gail Mabo, especially as we come close to the 25th anniversary of the High Court decision. Thank you for your guidance to me on this journey here today. I will keep believing that one day the uncomfortable truth will be a respected truth.


On behalf of the opposition, I move the amendment circulated in my name, on sheet 8150:


At the end of the motion, add: ""but the Senate expresses its disappointment with the regrettable way in which the Government has managed the process for consultation on the changes contained in the bill, which has been a source of unnecessary angst, confusion and delay"".

"Hanson-Young, Sen Sarah",AG,2017-05-11,"



Senator HANSON-YOUNG
 (South Australia) (17:42):  I rise this afternoon to add my comments to this debate on the Native Title Amendment (Indigenous Land Use Agreements) Bill 2017. Firstly, to contribute to the comments made previously by Senator Siewert and Senator Waters, it is a disgrace how the government has handled this piece of legislation in this place. It is an absolute exploitation of the fundamental issue of land rights in this country, again, with Indigenous people simply being used and abused when it suits the government. We all know why there was a suspension of standing orders earlier today by the Leader of the Government in the Senate to try to bring on this bill and ram it through this house tonight. That, of course, is because the government are more interested in the rights of mining companies than they are in the rights of Indigenous people. 


There are fundamental issues with the bill. We know we need to consider it in proper detail. Instead, all the government gives a damn about is giving a free pass to the mega coal company Adani. It is not even an Australian company. It is a dodgy, corrupt company based in India that is already under excessive investigation for corruption, money laundering, tax evasion—the list goes on. Why on earth are we seeing our parliament hijacked by a dodgy company like this, via the government of the day, just so that the company can get their project up off the ground? And let us not forget it is with the help of $1 billion of Australian taxpayers' money, offered up at mates rates by the Turnbull government.


It is absolutely appalling to see our parliament hijacked by such a corrupt, dodgy coal company. It proves just how much this government really is in the pocket of the fossil fuel industry. What on earth is Senator Canavan getting out of his continual advocacy in this place for the Adani project?




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Whish-Wilson
):  A point of order, Senator Canavan?




Senator Canavan:
  I usually let the imputations of a generic nature that regularly emanate from that corner of the chamber go without comment—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  That is debating the point. Address me.




Senator Canavan:
  But my point of order is that that is an imputation against a specific senator, and I ask that Senator Hanson-Young withdraw it.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  I will just take some advice on that, Senator Canavan. Senator Hanson-Young, it might help the Senate and the Chair if you withdraw that comment.




Senator HANSON-YOUNG:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, I will withdraw the comment. I still ask: what is the arrangement for the special mates rates deal that the government is giving this foreign company to not just exploit the land on which they want to run their project but put the entire challenge of our dealing with climate change at risk? One of the biggest problems with this project is that Australia will never be able to reach its weak targets, if the proposed amount of coal is dug out of the ground and burnt. If this project were to go ahead, we might as well say goodbye to climate action.


Why on earth does this company need a billion-dollar leg-up from the Australian taxpayer, if it is a good project anyway? It is because no-one else will bankroll them. The executives at Adani are desperate to get the final approvals done by the federal government. Of course, the Queensland state Labor government have done their bit to help this company every step of the way, and now we have, rushing through this parliament, the desperation of this company. Every time the minister stands up he says nothing about Australians; it is all about the big overseas company Adani. It is as if he is more the minister for Adani than he is the minister for Queenslanders or, indeed, Australians at large.


You have to question what on earth is really going on, because this government and particular ministers are so obsessed in relation to this project and with helping out this dodgy, corrupt company, who are going to burn our planet to a crisp if they are able to get this amount of coal out of the ground. We know that the coalition and, in particular, the National Party are absolutely in the pocket of the fossil fuel industry. They do not give two hoots about tackling climate change. They do not really give a damn about the limited amount of jobs that this company is going to create. We know that it is not as many as they claim, because in court they were found to have been lying.


That is not what they are obsessed about, because it does not make any sense. It is, of course, that this government and members of the government are absolutely in the pocket of the big fossil fuel corporations. These big fossil fuel companies, whether it be Adani, BP or Chevron, think they run this place. They think that they have every right to get bills voted on when they want to get their projects ticked off in their time frame—and they are happy to take the government handouts and leg-ups whenever they can as well. Tax rorts, handouts, cheap loans, mates rates—it goes on and on. The fossil fuel companies, those big multinational corporations, love to think they run this place. When are we going to start talking about the people's rights and land rights, not mining rights? When are we going to have that conversation in this place?


While I am at it, when we talk about those in the pocket of Adani, those doing everything they can to hand out a billion-dollar mates rates loan to this big company at the expense of funding schools or medical facilities in Queensland, you have to wonder what is going on inside the Labor Party as well. They are talking out of both sides of their mouth on this issue, and they absolutely know it. You have the Queensland government selling out their own people, and you have the federal Labor Party not knowing what to do. They are absolutely split on this issue. When is the Labor Party going to start standing up for proper action on climate change and staring down these climate criminals in these multinational companies? When are they going to have the guts to do that? Even just earlier today, we saw the Labor Party in this place not being able to sign off on a decent report about the risk of BP drilling for oil in the Great Australian Bight. We had a South Australian senator from the Labor Party cross the floor and sign off on a report with the Liberals to protect the interests of Chevron. You might wonder why on earth the Labor Party would get themselves into such a mess that you have one senator saying that Chevron and BP should have the right to drill for oil and the others—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Whish-Wilson
):  Is there a point of order, Senator Williams?




Senator Williams:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, what happens in committees in privacy should be kept private. Is that a position you would consider?




Senator HANSON-YOUNG:
  It is tabled.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  I was listening very carefully, Senator Williams. My reading of it was that Senator Hanson-Young, in respect of the signing of a committee document, was talking in a proverbial sense. I do not think she said it in a literal sense.




Senator HANSON-YOUNG:
  How interesting that people in this place are so tetchy about what really goes on behind the scenes. But it is not behind the scenes, because we have a South Australian Labor senator signing on to the report with two Liberal senators to say that it is A-OK to drill for oil and gas in the Great Australian Bight—cuddling up to the fossil fuel industry all over again. Isn't it interesting that Chevron, the big multinational company that wants to drill for oil and gas in the Great Australian Bight, donated money to the South Australian Labor Party within days of the hearing into that particular issue by the Senate committee? Isn't that interesting! People listening to this debate could obviously draw their own conclusions about why that particular South Australian senator had to sign on to a report that supported Chevron being able to drill for oil, but I think it is appalling. I think it is absolutely sickening to see the level of influence and corruption from the fossil fuel industry in this country creeping into every nook and cranny of how this Senate operates, from dictating when we debate bills, what time we will debate bills, to now dictating who will sign on to reports or not. This fossil fuel industry cannot continue to dominate what goes on in here.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator McAllister, I think I know what the point of order will be, but please make it.




Senator McAllister:
  I make the point that Senator Hanson-Young has cast a very serious aspersion on the motivations of one of our colleagues here in the Senate. I think it is contrary to the standing orders, and I ask you to ask her to retract it.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  I would agree with that. Please withdraw that comment, Senator Hanson-Young.




Senator HANSON-YOUNG:
  I will withdraw that. I simply point out that Chevron donated money to the South Australian Labor Party within a day of the hearing where South Australian senators sat in a hearing on an issue of the Great Australian Bight and allowing Chevron to drill for oil or not. It is extraordinary that, at a time when we should be cleaning up politics in this country, we see the government bending over backwards to help Adani, and we see the Labor Party incapable of getting their act together to stare down the crooks in the fossil fuel industry—the climate criminals who are going to fry this planet.

"McAllister, Sen Jenny",ALP,2017-05-11,"



Senator McALLISTER
 (New South Wales—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (17:54):  I thought I might talk about the bill before us! Labor has a long history with native title in this country. It was Labor, under Whitlam, who returned traditional lands in the Northern Territory to the Gurindji people, with the Prime Minister famously pouring sand into Vincent Lingiari's hands. It was Labor, under Keating, that introduced the Native Title Act in the wake of the historic Mabo ruling. And I do not say this to boast; I do not think any Australian could argue that as a nation our relationships with our first peoples have been without shortcomings or without error. I say it because Labor have a deep and enduring relationship with native title. It is something that we care about, it is something that we take seriously, it is something that we wish to protect, and it is this history and this perspective on the significance of native title and its seriousness as an issue that have guided every decision we have sought to take in relation to the bill before us. 


The integrity of the native title system is the only consideration that has been front of mind for the participants in negotiations around this bill, the Native Title Amendment (Indigenous Land Use Agreements) Bill 2017. This is the reason we are providing support to this bill. The recent McGlade decision by the Federal Court does have the potential to throw the entire future of our native title system into uncertainty. This is a real problem, and it needs to be solved. It is disappointing that this is not the approach that has been taken by others in this place.


The Greens political party do not have a policy position on this bill; they have a political strategy. They have been trying to tie these native title changes to Adani ever since the challenges related to the McGlade case first presented. Senator Siewert, back in February this year, said:


The news that Attorney General Brandis will hurriedly push through changes to the Native Title Act smacks of knee jerk reaction to a significant situation because they want to protect the Adani coal mine project …


There have been numerous comments from the member for Melbourne all this week. All this week, we have heard about it in this chamber. Senator Waters said on Tuesday:


No means no, yet this government is completely deaf to them, such that we now have a bill to ram through a reduction in native title rights just so the Adani mine can get up. 


Senator Siewert did it again today, during the debate on suspending standing orders. These statements are highly irresponsible. In characterising the Labor Party's position as being associated with Adani, the Greens political party have been highly irresponsible and entirely incorrect. This bill is not about Adani, and Labor's approach is not about Adani. Our approach has been about addressing a real problem that has presented.


The McGlade decision found that an Indigenous land use agreement for a particular area could not be registered unless all members of the registered native title claimant group were parties to the agreement. Whilst people may wish to deny this, this throws up huge logistical problems. If left unanswered, it means that more than 100 Indigenous land use agreements could be invalid. These are agreements that were negotiated in good faith by native title holders with land users on the basis of the law as it was then understood. They concern very large areas of land across Australia, including national parks, agricultural ventures and mining ventures. I had the very good fortune to attend the signing of an ILUA, probably about a decade ago, in relation to a national park in New South Wales and to see how very, very significant it was to the three women who had been fighting for that agreement to come into force for more than a decade. These agreements provide long-term benefits to communities and they fund services that are important to those communities.


In essence, this bill responds to the uncertainty in that decision. It amends the Native Title Act so that any Indigenous land use agreement which was authorised and registered prior to the decision will be valid, even if it was not signed by all members of the claimant group. Labor is supporting changes to the legislation only to the extent that they will restore the law to the status quo, as it was before the McGlade decision.

Senator O'SULLIVAN
 (Queensland) (22:26):  I rise tonight to respond to a very clumsy, lacklustre and impotent attempt by a colleague in this place today to cast aspersions on the good work and character of another politician in this parliament. The speech delivered can only be characterised as a clumsy and juvenile attempt—and will only be remembered as being delivered by a desperate individual, a failed politician himself—to damage the outstanding credentials of the federal member for Capricornia, the truly outstanding coalition warrior, Michelle Landry. It is a matter of public record that Michelle Landry and her parliamentary colleague Luke Howarth, the member for Petrie, are credited with delivering the Turnbull coalition government to office. So that makes this attempt by a colleague in this chamber, Senator Watt, even grubbier, in my view. 



Senator Watt claimed in his speech earlier today that Capricornia MP Michelle Landry is 'arguably the biggest failure in the House of Representatives'. Before we get on to Michelle Landry's performance as the member for Capricornia, let's just take a couple of minutes to compare the records of these two politicians. In the case of Senator Watts, except for a short period of time, he has been nestled in the breast of the public purse for his entire adult life. His first failure came when he took on the job as the chief of staff to Premier Bligh—and we all know what happened there. It resulted in the most catastrophic Labor loss in the history of this nation—losing 40 seats in my home state of Queensland. What contribution did Senator Watts make to that? Well, he actually had to lift heavier than any of his colleagues in his attempt to enter the parliament. He was successful in the seat of Everton, but he took a 9.2 per cent hit to the holding of that seat—the biggest in that election. Then, of course, not satisfied with his failure there, he went on to lose the seat for the first time in 40 years. The seat was held for 40 years by Labor, and he took another hit of 14.5 per cent. He took it from being one of Labor's safest seats in the state of Queensland and handed it over to us. It is now one of the safest seats we hold. This is the legacy of Watts. What did he do then? He had to find a way to make his way into this place. This is a man who in this place often champions the support of Labor in the regions. He even said so to the Daily Mercury:


I think it's important Labor geographically spreads, that's why I'm setting up my office on the Gold Coast.


You can get a light rail ride for $6.70 to the Gold Coast. It is hardly regarded as the regions and certainly not a region like that represented by the great Michelle Landry. What did he do? How did he make his way back? Labor had, accidentally, only one senator in the state of Queensland in the regions, and that was Jan McLucas in the seat of Cairns. You have heard me say in this place that poor Jan threw her legs over the side of the bed one day and sat up and looked down and her head was still on the pillow, because Labor took it off and replaced her with Senator Watts. Dear, oh, dear! I do not know even where to start. Before you lose the recent memory of Senator Watts's performance as a failed politician, let's have a look at Michelle Landry. What did she do?



The PRESIDENT:  Senator Moore, a point of order.




Senator Moore:
  I hate to interrupt the flow of Senator O'Sullivan's diatribe. It will just be useful if he used Senator Watt's own name in his statement.



The PRESIDENT:  Thank you. That is a good point. I advise all senators that it is a timely reminder to always use the correct title of people not only in this chamber but also the other chamber.




Senator O'SULLIVAN:
  Knocking the 's' off means that there is not more than one of them—so Senator Watt. What we have now is Michelle Landry. She wrested the seat of Capricornia out of the grasp of Labor. It is one of the crown seats of the Labor movement. Do you know how Labor is? It is Labor that left a convicted paedophile as the member for the state seat embedded in Capricornia. He got elected. And then they went on to make him the opposition leader. This is how Labor in this area is. She took it off them not once but twice. For the first time in 50 years, this woman held that seat and returned it into our government twice. They were still riding horses around the main street of Rockhampton when that was last done. 


In case I run out of time—because this is going to take me a couple of hours to get through, but I am sure there will be further opportunities for me to finish—let's have a look: this woman has delivered into the region of Central Queensland in the seat of Capricornia $550 million worth of funding. It is on the public record and in the budget papers. What has Senator Watt put into the place? That would be zero. She got $166 million to fix the Eton range, $38 million to replace five country bridges near Mackay and Isaac, $1.1 million for Mackay Regional Council in funding to fix the intersection of Horse and Jockey Road and $8.5 million to engineer two overtaking lanes. Let me take a breath. She got $7.9 million for the new north- and south-bound overtaking lanes on the Bruce Highway, $190 million for future defence infrastructure for Capricornia, $10 million for the Yeppoon beachfront, $7 million for Rockhampton riverbank precinct and $2.3 million for the Capricorn rescue chopper. How many things has Senator Watt delivered for the seat of Capricornia? That would be none. And, just as we are attempting—and Michelle Landry is leading the charge—to put the Adani mine into Central Queensland, he voted in this place, along with his Queensland Senate colleagues, to knock it on the head. He voted to close coalmining in Queensland. He was not satisfied that, when he worked for Bligh as her chief of staff, they eroded 14,000 jobs from this part of the world that Michelle Landry is reinstating with this phenomenal effort that she has done to bring funding into the area.


There is $2.3 million for the Capricorn Helicopter Rescue Service. That'll be there for Senator Watt when he needs to be rescued at the next election! There is $136 million to floodproof Bruce Highway in Rockhampton. There is $300,000 to Meals on Wheels when he is next unemployed, because it will only be a matter of time. There is $3 million for 16 Green Army projects and $2.7 million for Beef Australia. Given the time, I have no capacity to get through the pages and pages articulating this $550 million.


This is a bloke who should have given this some thought. He did not even need to go around and get the library to do some of this; he can Google most of this. He should have given this some thought before he made this attack on this woman. I promise him this: he can come in here as frequently as he likes to attack my colleague and the colleague of the Nationals and the coalition. He can come in here every day. For every five minutes he does, I will do 10, and I have not even started on him. This was a grubby speech. It needs to be stopped. If he wants to take it, he can take it outside. If he wants to fight us, I will go with him up into Central Queensland. I made the offer to Labor today. I will take him into the public bar of the Black Nugget Hotel, and he can tell them what he has done and what he is doing for their jobs in Central Queensland. I tell you what: Michelle Landry is in and out of there all the time. She is much respected and much respected to win a Labor seat and then hold it for the first time in 50 years. For her to be maligned by a man who has failed at every political effort he has made since he came onto the public teat some 15 years ago is, I think, a grubby attempt. He should be ashamed of himself. It was a clumsy effort. It was a juvenile effort. He needs to be encouraged not to do it again.
