"Christensen, George, MP",Nats,2014-07-14,"



Mr CHRISTENSEN
 (Dawson—The Nationals Deputy Whip) (10:08):  On behalf of the Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs, I wish to make to make a statement regarding the progress of the committee's inquiry into the child support program. I rise to inform the House about the committee's inquiry into the child support program. The committee launched the inquiry in April this year, follow referral by the Minister for Social Services. The inquiry is considering methods for dealing with arrears and overpayments, the flexibility of the system, the alignment with family assistance, the links with Family Court decisions and ensuring outcomes are in the best interests of the child, particularly where there is conflict.


When we commenced the inquiry we carefully designed a community engagement strategy to ensure that we could gather evidence from a range of people in a sensitive way. The child support program assists people in some very difficult stages of life and we wanted to engage with these people without causing additional stress or anxiety. As part of the strategy we created an anonymous online questionnaire, which has been very successful. It takes about 20 minutes to complete and asks people a range of questions about their experiences.


So far over 10½ thousand people have completed the questionnaire. If each person takes roughly 20 minutes, that is over 3½ thousand hours of time collectively given to the inquiry by members of the public. That is an outstanding response to the inquiry. We will use the questionnaire results to guide the inquiry and our final report and we have already released two snapshots of questionnaire responses. The theme of the first snapshot was negotiation and the second was flexibility. We will publish more snapshots as the inquiry continues.


We have published over 50 submissions and we will publish more later this week. Many individuals have prepared submissions to the inquiry and all published submissions are on our website. Members may notice that many submissions have been published with names withheld. We have done this to get as much as possible on the public record without breaching the privacy of individuals and their families. We have also received a large amount of correspondence where people have provided more detail on their personal experiences.


We are now in the middle of our public hearing program. We started our hearings in Canberra and then had a full day of public hearings in Sydney. In Sydney we also held a community statements session and 16 individuals spoke to us about how they think the child support program could be improved. On Thursday this week we will hold our third hearing here in Parliament House and on Friday we will have full day of hearings and community statements in Melbourne. After Melbourne we will travel to other cities for hearings. We will travel to regional centres including Newcastle, Mackay and Ballarat.


I would like to thank the Australian community for its contribution to the inquiry. The child support program deals with tough issues and many people have a difficult story to tell us. Almost everyone who has written or spoken to us has tried to focus on the bigger picture. As well as telling us about their personal experiences, they have clearly thought about how the program could work better for everyone, especially for children, who are the ultimate purpose of the child support program.


Finally I would like to thank my deputy chair, the member for Newcastle, and all other committee members for their work in the inquiry. I would also like to thank the indefatigable staff at the secretariat for their assistance in this. I look forward to giving the House a further update later this year. With those words, I present a copy of the statement.

Mr CHRISTENSEN
 (Dawson—The Nationals Deputy Whip) (10:13):  On behalf of the Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs, I present the committee's report entitled Eyes in the sky: inquiry into drones and the regulation of air safety and privacy, together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the committee.


Report made a parliamentary paper in accordance with standing order 39(e).




Mr CHRISTENSEN:
  by leave—Australia's remotely piloted aircraft or 'drone' industry is growing rapidly. Increasing numbers of consumers are buying and using drones, and they already play a role in a range of Australian industries, from journalism, cinematography, policing and emergency services, to agriculture, mining and scientific research. They come in a huge range of shapes and sizes, from large fixed-wing craft that look and behave much like aeroplanes right down to tiny multi-rotor helicopters weighing less than a kilogram. Drones are able to do jobs that were previously impossible, and they can reduce the cost—and the risk—of many dull, dirty or dangerous jobs.


However, like any new technology, drones can be misused. They can pose a safety risk to other aircraft or to people and property on the ground, and the cameras and sensors they carry can be used to invade someone's privacy. The challenge we face is to realise the potential of this innovative technology while protecting against its risks.


This report has surveyed the emerging issues around drone use and has examined the adequacy of Australia's existing regulatory framework. At a series of hearings and roundtables the committee heard from air safety regulators about the importance of allowing drone technology to mature so that the risk to people and property is minimised; and from privacy experts about the complexities and gaps in Australia's privacy laws which make it difficult to protect against privacy invasive drone use. 


The committee heard that drones are already being used in unsafe and potentially invasive ways. There have been a number of near misses and safety incidents arising from illegal drone use in the last year, and Australian farmers have reported that drones are being used by activist groups to take footage of their property without permission. The recommendations in this report are intended to serve as a starting point for an ongoing process of reform and adjustment to Australia's privacy and air safety regimes. The committee has recommended that the government simplify what is a complex web of privacy and surveillance laws so that members of the public and drone operators alike can more easily understand the law. At the same time, the committee has recommended that the government consider introducing legislation to protect Australians from intrusions into their private seclusion and to provide a more reliable remedy for those whose privacy has been breached. The committee notes that the Civil Aviation Safety Authority is currently reviewing the air safety regulations relating to drones in response to rapid developments in drone technology and a surge in the number of drone users.


In light of its proposed changes, the committee takes the view that CASA's proposals strike an appropriate balance between minimising safety risks on the one hand and facilitating the development of Australia's drone industry on the other. Drones are an emerging technology that will bring substantial benefits to a wide range of Australian industries. Drones will help many Australian businesses lower costs, increase productivity and reduce risk. However, the privacy and safety issues arising from expanding use of drones will require sustained attention in years to come to protect Australians from malicious drone use while giving this dynamic new industry the room it needs to grow.


I would like to thank again the deputy chair and member for Newcastle and all members of the committee for their work in this inquiry, not to mention the secretariat. As an aside, can I mention that Peter Pullen from the secretariat has assisted greatly in developing the draft and the final work that has come before this chamber. I believe that that is the first that he has done for the parliament. Congratulations to him—it is a very fine report.

"Claydon, Sharon, MP",ALP,2014-07-14,"



Ms CLAYDON
 (Newcastle) (10:17):  I rise to speak also on the Social Policy and Legal Affairs Committee's first report to this 44th Parliament entitled Eyes in the sky: inquiry into drones and the regulation of the safety and privacy. Firstly, as deputy chair of the committee, I wish to commend the chair, the member for Dawson, and committee members for their work throughout this inquiry. I want to especially acknowledge the secretariat's contribution. I also want to say thank you to the all-important witnesses that provided evidence and it took time to demonstrate the capability of drone technology.


The remote piloted aircraft, RPA, or drone industry in Australia and other parts of the world is certainly booming. Private and commercial use of RPAs has proliferated as technology advances, costs reduce and usability improves. Relevant Australian legislation around the use of RPAs has not kept pace with the industry, and, as this inquiry has found, proactive measures need to be taken to protect commercial and recreational users and members of the public. The inquiry found that there are many current and potential uses of drone technology that could bring benefit to Australia, including their use by emergency services. 


With this expanded application and use, however, come a number of safety and privacy concerns. A number of safety risks concerning drones were raised by the Civil Aviation Safety Authority—chiefly, build quality of drones, including electrical componentry; and safe integration of drones into Australian airspace. CASA's Director of Aviation Safety, Mr John McCormick, told the committee that there is a risk of interference with other vehicles, interference with other aircraft, and possibly of crashing in public areas. This circumstance was evidenced earlier this year in my electorate of Newcastle where a rescue helicopter was forced to take evasive action to avoid colliding with an unidentified drone.


While control of the space is already legislated, the committee recommends that CASA broaden future consultation processes to include industry and recreational users from a non-aviation background. Future consultations should identify and seek comment from peak bodies in the industry where RPA use is likely to expand, such as real estate, photography, media and agriculture, amongst others.


RPAs also pose a potentially serious threat to Australian's privacy. Through application, RPAs can intrude on the privacy of individuals or businesses either deliberately through surveillance activities or inadvertently in the course of activities like aerial photography, traffic monitoring or search and rescue. And, as device capability improves and units become cheaper, government agencies, companies and individuals will be provided with a very cost-effective mechanism to observe and collect information on Australians, potentially without knowledge or consent. The Privacy Act does offer some substantial protections in certain circumstances, but there are a number of situations where it may not protect Australians against the invasive use of drones. A lack of uniform laws across state boundaries was highlighted as a particular issue of concern, as was the method for individuals to redress potential privacy breaches. These issues are not unique to the use of RPAs. However, as capability improves and drone use increases, further tests of the privacy regime are likely. In his address to the committee the privacy commissioner, Timothy Pilgrim, said:


With such a new technology the question comes down to how its use is going to be regulated. What are the ways in which you can be regulated so that we can still achieve the benefits that technology can bring at the same time as making sure that people have a right of recourse or remedy if they believe the privacy has been invaded by misuse of these technologies?


The committee recommends a number of measures to improve privacy laws in Australia. Of particular importance, the committee recommends that in considering the time and extent of privacy protection to be afforded, the government consider giving effect to the Australian Law Reform Commission's proposal for the creation of a tort of serious invasion of privacy or include alternate measures to achieve similar outcomes with respect to invasive technologies, including remotely piloted aircraft.


The committee puts forward six very sensible recommendations to address concerns regarding air safety and privacy around the use of RPAs in Australia. I commend the committee's report to the House and look forward to the government's response.



The SPEAKER:  The time allotted for statements on this report has expired. Does the member for Dawson wish to move a motion in connection with the report to enable it to be debated on a later occasion?




Mr Christensen:
  Yes, I do. I move:


That the House take note of the report.



The SPEAKER:  In accordance with standing order 39, the debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting.

Mr ALBANESE
 (Grayndler) (10:31):  I move:


That this House:


(1) condemns:


(a) the decision by the Government to freeze indexation of Financial Assistance Grants to local governments across Australia;


(b) the resulting cuts to local government funding of $925 million over the next four years, affecting every council in Australia; and


(c) the failure of the:


   (i) Minister for Infrastructure and Regional Development to protect this critical funding to local governments across Australia; and


   (ii) National Party to stand up against the cuts on behalf of regional and remote councils, which are affected most by the freeze;


(2) notes:


(a) Financial Assistance Grants are used by every local government in Australia to maintain local roads and deliver critical community services;


(b) the Government’s indexation freeze represents cuts of $925 million to local governments in every town and city over the next four years;


(c) regional and remote councils will be most affected by the cuts, with larger service areas and more kilometres of roads to maintain per ratepayer;


(d) the viability of some regional and remote councils may be compromised as a result of the cuts;


(e) the pressure now on councils to increase council rates or cut services due to the cuts; and


(f) within six years, the value of the cuts will be greater than the entire Roads to Recovery budget; and


(3) calls upon the Government to:


(a) listen to local government concerns about the impact of freezing indexation of Financial Assistance Grants on local roads and community services; and


(b) immediately reverse the decision to freeze indexation of Financial Assistance Grants to local government over the next three years.


A sudden and significant change in government revenue can spell disaster for a government. It is something the previous Labor government learned firsthand after 2009, when the worst global financial upheaval since the Great Depression slashed government revenues across the board. Such a funding difficulty is about to befall the local councils of this nation, courtesy of the Prime Minister's decision to freeze financial assistance grants for the next three years and make that change permanent. Many will be forced to slash spending on road maintenance and other services, with implications for road safety, particularly in rural and regional areas.


This financial assistance grants decision represents a $925 million hammer blow to financial positions of councils across the nation. While all councils are affected, those that will bear the greatest burden are small councils in rural and regional areas, which on some reports rely on financial assistance grants for up to half of their annual income.


I moved the motion before us today because I want those opposite to reconsider this foolish decision. I want those opposite to talk to the mayors and shire presidents in their electorates and hear firsthand about the impact of this cut. I want to hear from those opposite, particularly from the Nationals, whose constituents will be most affected, about how on earth they could possibly support this budget move.


Before I go further, let me give you a real-life example that cuts to the heart of this issue. On 16 June the Mayor of Greater Geraldton, Ian Carpenter, told the ABC's AM program that he was worried about the effect of this decision on 15 small local government areas outside Geraldton. Mayor Carpenter said:


They'll become unsustainable. It's a very, very serious problem and I can't stress that enough. To take away the indexation is just crazy.


It is just crazy, Mayor Carpenter said, and he was right. He could not be any clearer, and his comments are being echoed around the nation by mayors of all political colours.


Councils now have three options, none of them attractive: increase rates, slash services or increase borrowing. Increased rates will place further pressure on family budgets. A reduction in services is likely to occur in road services and maintenance in particular, with real consequences, particularly in the bush. Last month's national assembly of the Australian Local Government Association was concerned enough to pass an urgent motion calling on the government to reverse its decision.


These cuts are also coming at a time when the government is already hitting local government with other budget measures. The head of the Local Government Association of Queensland, Greg Hallam, noted after the budget that the change came with the reintroduction of indexation of fuel excise—another move that will impact disproportionately on residents of rural and regional areas. Mr Hallam is right, but he left out another budget measure that will hurt councils—that is, the Prime Minister's move to claw back funding for states and local governments by ending the federal government's contribution to the cost of providing rates discounts to pensioners.


So in fact it is a triple whammy. Just as this Prime Minister is piling cut after cut upon Australian families in areas like health, education, pensions and child care, he is also piling cut after cut onto councils. When you pile up the cumulative effect of all three, it is clear the councils of Australia are paying a higher price than they should for this Prime Minister's political agenda.


In Queensland the Bundaberg Shire Council in the electorate of Hinkler has revealed that the decision on FAGs will turn what is expected to be a modest surplus this year into a $5 million deficit because of the decision to stop paying them money in advance. This comes on top of the fact that the Prime Minister also cut the money that was allocated to local government to every council area through the Regional Development Australia Fund when they came to office. It comes on top of the disbandment of the Urban Policy Forum and the Australian Council of Local Government and on top of their abandonment of constitutional recognition of local government, which had the support of the then shadow minister Barnaby Joyce but the bipartisanship of which the Liberal and National parties walked away from prior to the last election.


I am asking this parliament to send the Prime Minister a very clear message on financial assistance grants. That message is: think again. I commend the motion to the House.

"Tehan, Dan, MP",LP,2014-07-14,"



Mr TEHAN
 (Wannon) (10:36):  In this discussion we are having here this morning it is wonderful to see the shadow minister in here pleading on behalf of councils, but what he failed to mention is the reason why we are here. The reason why we are here is that the shadow minister as a cabinet minister in the last government saw this nation rack up levels of debt that we have never seen. We saw a government spend money at record levels like it had never been spent. What happened at the last election which the shadow minister does not seem to understand is the Australian people voted with their feet to let the reckless spending stop. They put a mature government in place to ensure that we could get the nation's finances back under control. This government has started this process.


As part of that process we have had to make some tough decisions and we have asked everyone to do their little bit. As difficult as it may be, we have had to ask local government to do their bit. I say to the shadow minister that I have explained that to all the mayors in my electorate, and they understand the mess that we have been left. They understand that everyone has to do their little bit. Sure, they would have preferred if we had not made the decisions that we have had to, but they understand that the burden needed to be shared.


But what we have also done—and this will be a benefit to local government—that the shadow minister did not mention is give them savings as a result of the abolition of the carbon tax, which also hit their budgets. Hopefully, by the end of today there will be positive news for our local governments, with the carbon tax having been abolished and savings going back to council as a result of that measure.


We also have announced payments to the most important pieces of infrastructure that we have in local government areas: our road network. They are significant announcements for our road networks, including an extra $350 million to the popular Roads to Recovery Program. As a matter of fact, I do not think in country Australia there is a more popular program than the Roads to Recovery Program. In 2015-16 an additional $350 million will go to local government areas.


We are also announcing an extra $100 million in both 2015-16 and 2016-17 for the Black Spot Programme. Not only are we announcing that additional $100 million in each of those financial years; there is a change in the criteria which will make it easier for those local governments in regional and rural areas to get access to that funding. The criteria had been skewed more and more to assisting those local government areas that were in outer metropolitan areas. So we have rebalanced the way we look at that program to make it more beneficial and easier for local governments in regional and rural areas to get that funding.


We have also announced $300 million in the Bridges Renewal Program. That is an additional $300 million in this new program which will go to regional and rural local government areas to help them renew bridges—wooden bridges that need fixing to make sure that the more modern heavy transport will be able to use those bridges, which will be productivity enhancing not only for those local government areas but for the nation as a whole. So those three key mechanisms to deliver more money into local government areas for road and bridges infrastructure are absolutely vital to those local government areas.


We wish that we did not have to make the decision we had to with regard to freezing the FAGs, but we have done it because it was needed. All I can say to those opposite: the only reason we did it was because of your poor financial management. (Time expired)

"Collins, Julie, MP",ALP,2014-07-14,"



Ms COLLINS
 (Franklin) (10:41):  Financial assistance grants to councils are very, very important indeed. The councils know this. I think they would be very disappointed with the last speaker who came in here and said, 'Oh, yeah, we don't really want to do this, but it's all Labor's fault.' I do not see how it can be when they are bringing in at least a $22 billion Paid Parental Leave scheme whilst they are cutting important money from councils that councils are using on roads, bridges and on other programs in their communities for the elderly, young kids, youth workers—a whole range of important programs out there in the community. They are cutting those at the expense of introducing a $22 billion Paid Parental Leave scheme. It just doesn't add up. To come in here and blame Labor for their decision to cut almost $1 billion out of local government over four years just shows that they have the wrong priorities.


What is even more concerning about this decision is that they did not consult with councils before they did it. They did not consult with councils at all before making this decision. Then, of course, they did not tell councils until budget night, when many councils across the country had already locked in their budgets. As we heard from the former shadow minister, it has left councils in a very precarious position indeed whether having to make some very, very tough decisions—decisions to cut services, to cut staff, to increase their borrowings or to put up the rates that bit further. We know, of course, that that will impact on every household right across the country. Every household right across the country will be affected by this government's decision to cut financial assistance grants, to cut almost $1 billion over four years out of local government. We should not be surprised by this, because they are true to form. They have been cutting money from local councils with their RDAF round 5 funding—$250 million ripped out of councils right across the country. This is, indeed, very concerning for councils. It is so concerning that the Australian Local Government Association has actually written to all their mayors saying how concerned they are about it. In fact, they are saying that they $925 million in Financial Assistance Grants reductions by 2017-18 will continue beyond that date, because, of course, the base level of FAGs will be permanently reduced by over 12 per cent. So it is not just going to affect councils over the next four years but this freeze in indexation is going to affect the councils for decades to come.


We had the previous member talk about the Roads to Recovery funding. ALGA had something to say about that, too. They said that by 2018-19, when the current extension of the Roads to Recovery is due to end, the loss of the Financial Assistance Grants will be equivalent to 95 per cent of the Roads to Recovery funding. Almost the entire value of the Roads to Recovery program will be lost by this one measure in freezing the indexation under the Financial Assistance Grants. So to come out here and say, 'But that is all okay because we've got Roads to Recovery.' It is not okay. Councils do not think it is okay and councils right across the country are saying it is not okay. It is not okay to have this cut on councils right across the country, affecting every household in the country with reduced services, increased rates or increased borrowings by their local government association.


Councils have already cut staff—in fact, they did it two weeks ago—because they did not know about this decision from the federal government, because, as I said, there was no consultation. We already have people who are unemployed because of this government's decision which came with no notice whatsoever to councils. Every council across the country had already been talking about their future budgets, and now they have to adjust them for the next four years, because this government gave them no notice whatsoever of this cut.


Of course, this is true to form, because the government did not really support recognition of local government that was going to be put in the referendum last year. They came in here and voted for it, but then they changed their position on it. Clearly, they have cut money to local government. They do not support local government as a legitimate third tier of government—the level of government that is closest to the people and deals on a daily basis with people's most urgent needs. They should be ashamed of themselves for this cut—this cut of almost $1 billion over four years that will hurt families right across the country. Councils across the country are furious about this. They have been writing to me and other opposition members about how concerned they are about this funding cut. It is not okay to come into this place and say, 'It's all Labor's fault,' because it is not. Labor did not make the decision to cut this money; we would not have made this decision; and we certainly would not— (Time expired)

Mr COULTON
 (Parkes—The Nationals Chief Whip) (10:46):  I, too, rise to speak on the motion brought to the House by the member for Grayndler. Before I start my comments, I might make mention of comments made by the previous speaker, particularly about the constitutional recognition of local government. The reason that that did not get up in the last term was the shambolic state of the government of that time. I was on the committee that looked into that and I can tell you that the coalition were in favour of constitutional recognition of local government. As a former mayor, I know better than most about that; the former minister was frustrated in not having enough time for that discussion to take place. At the critical moment, in one of the Rudd-Gillard changeovers—when there were mass sackings and the minister was sacked by the then Prime Minister—the referendum had absolutely no hope at all. We need to get our facts straight here: the reason it did not get up was the shambolic nature of the previous government.


I am also surprised that the previous speaker, the member for a regional area in Tasmania and a mother, would be opposed to a paid parental leave scheme that was going to be beneficial to mothers in her electorate who work in small businesses and on farms. I thought that supporting mothers into the workforce was something that the Labor Party actually supported; I did not realise it was something they opposed. 


We need to talk about why we are at this point. Why did the government have to freeze the financial assistance grants to local government in the budget? If you look around Australia you will see the reasons: the amount of money that was squandered over the previous six years starting with the BER program. I have a school at Louth on the Darling River in the western part of my electorate which now has a classroom for each student—four students, four classrooms. They had four students, and the previous government bought them each a classroom. I guess they are the envy of other schools, but it would have been nice if they had spent that money in other areas. I have a builder in Moree who is owed $642,000 because of the mismanagement of that BER program. He is not likely to get his money. What has that done for the regional economy?


How about we talk about what the live cattle trade has done for regional Australia? The devastation that has caused to the finances of communities across regional Australia. The shadow minister has the hide to come in here and put this motion about what this government is doing to local government. 


I might say that the coalition government next year will be doubling Roads to Recovery to those councils. In many of my councils that will actually have a positive net effect over the FAGs grants. We will be removing the carbon tax. Despite the fact that the Labor Party says they support the removal of the carbon tax, they do not seem to understand you actually have to vote for it in the Senate if you want something to be repealed. You cannot go out before an election and say, 'We support the repeal of the carbon tax; we don't believe in a carbon tax.'




Ms Brodtmann:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I wonder about the relevance of what the member is saying with regard to the motion we actually have in front of us. If you could bring it back to the Financial Assistance Grants package, that would be terrific.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Mitchell
):  There is no point of order.




Mr COULTON:
  I thank the member for Canberra for her interjection. Just so we are perfectly clear: the relevance of my comments is the absolute squandering and irresponsible demolition of the Australian government's budget by the previous, Labor government. It has meant that this government has to make some tough decisions to get the budget back in line. That is the relevance of what I am saying here. I am pointing out the absolute stupidity of some of the programs that the previous government put in place. It was bad for regional Australia and squandered the money that was there.


I also say that next year we will fund $200 million a year that regional communities will be able to tap into for programs that will boost the economies of their area. The member for Grayndler has hide to bring this motion in. It is completely wrong.

"Husic, Ed, MP",ALP,2014-07-14,"



Mr HUSIC
 (Chifley) (10:51):  You know the coalition is in trouble when on a resolution that discusses how the federal budget will impact on their local communities they have to talk about live exports and carbon tax. They know better than most—particularly if they have represented councils and are now in this chamber—the world of grief they are going to hit when those councils are squeezed and squeezed hard by this unprovoked decision of the Abbott government.


In modern financial terms, $900 million rolls off the tongue too quickly; but, when you talk to councils around the nation and say to them that you are going to rip $925 million from them, you find out in real terms what this means. Many local government bodies are already operating under heavy pressure. There is little or no fat in their operation, so you could imagine their surprise when they discovered in council chambers across the country when they were briefed that they would have their funds cut by the Abbott government—a cut inflicted when the Abbott government cruelly decided to freeze indexation on financial assistance grants.


What is disappointing yet not surprising is the way the Abbott government steamrolls its way through these decisions. You only have to ask the AMA if they were consulted about the GP tax. Of course they were not. Ask pensioners whether or not they were consulted about the brutal impacts of the budget. Of course not. In fact, they were told by the Prime Minister that there would be no changes to pensions. Ask motorists if they were given any warning that fuel tax indexation would return. There was none. What is ironic is the Abbott government has halted indexation for the funding of councils but has reintroduced indexation to help itself to the pockets and purses of Australian motorists. Under the guise of trying to respond to a self-manufactured 'budget emergency', the Prime Minister and the Treasurer—I cannot actually remember him anymore, because you never see him these days—have both been caught breaking promises, triggering protest across the country.


One of the farthest reaching yet not heavily advertised impacts of these broken promises was to freeze this grant indexation. The grants are not there for giggles; they are there for a reason. Rate payers look to their local council for the basics: libraries, parks, waste management, recreation facilities and roads—the vital bones of every thriving community—and the councils cannot always attend to these responsibilities on their own. They need the backing of state and federal government, which is why the financial assistance grants are provided. They are provided from a federal level to help councils undertake those things they could not undertake on their own. The Abbott government has told councils after they have done their sums and their budgets that they can no longer expect help in the form of that indexation. It is disgraceful from a government that said it would be a no-surprises government.


We have already seen the howling of state governments resulting from an $80 billion cut to hospitals and schools. New South Wales Premier Mike Baird has described it as 'a kick in the guts'. Now local governments are objecting. That is obviously because councils were not consulted at all about the indexation freeze and they had already put together their budgets for 2014-15, and then had this land in their laps.


The fallout for councils is that they have little choice other than to increase rates, cut services, increase borrowings or do a combination of all three—which is a horrifying prospect. It is a classic example of the Abbott government's twisted priorities that—as the member for Franklin pointed out—they can introduce a paid parental leave scheme which will see $50,000 handed out to the well-off but that people in remote parts of the country who depend on their council to provide services will be affected.


My local council in Blacktown—one of the biggest in New South Wales—estimates that it will lose $4.7 million over three years. This is a council that has already shut pools, is looking to privatise child care, is looking to cut back on its infrastructure spend and, importantly, has just announced an increase to council rates. In fact, last week it ratified a 5.3 per cent council rate increase. The Liberal-Independent council in Blacktown was so torn by this that the Independent, who is part of that coalition, voted against the rate increases. Imagine what it is going to be like when this $4.7 million hits this council on top of what they are already doing. I am genuinely concerned about the impact that will have on people in our area who have already seen one lot of rate rises, who are going to see more and who are potentially going to see an even harsher cutting of services at a time when they need it most. It is a disgraceful display of arrogance by this government to cut funds to councils that need this money to do the work required in local communities across the country.

Mr EWEN JONES
 (Herbert) (10:56):  I am very pleased to speak on this motion. You always know that it is serious when the member for Grayndler comes in here and does not plagiarise lines from a movie. I would have thought that Weekend at Bernie's IIwould have been a good start—you know, Albo, you're still dead. But I will compliment him on his choice of ties. It is a great colour for today. The member for Reid, I and the member for Grayndler are all wearing royal purple.


While I understand the misapprehension, the anguish and the feigned indignation from the member for Grayndler and others who have spoken on this, we went to the last election promising a series of things. We promised to axe the carbon tax—hopefully that will happen today; we promised to stop the boats and, pretty much, that has happened; we promised to build the roads of the 21st century, and you have seen our infrastructure program—we are getting on with business; and the last thing that we promised was to fix the budget mess. This is part of it, but this plays into two of the three major issues that we have to do with the federation white paper and the taxation white paper still to come.


The problem I find, when it comes to local government funding and funding agreements between state and federal, is that we tend to see that where the federal government comes in other levels of government can actually exit that space. We find that the federal government is backfilling and funding in these areas. Until we get that flow of funding correct and right, what you will see is that the more that the federal government puts in the less other governments will. I think when we get the federation white paper and we bring that down—when we sort out how COAG is supposed to work, what we are supposed to do in this space, where local government fits and how we get those things going—we will be better off. I note that in my electorate of Herbert the federal government has done a great job. We have brought road projects through such as the fixing of Dalrymple Road, the Ring Road and Vantassel Street. All these things are coming through from infrastructure spending.


The other issue I would like to bring up is not so much the funding but how we get value for funding. I was in Charters Towers with Senator Arthur Sinodinos. A local council there told us—and I do not know it for fact as I have not seen the paperwork—that they had a road project which they costed at $9 million. Because it was above the limit they had to go to national tender. A national tenderer won it at a cost of $27 million. They flew in their crew, they drove in their camp and they drove in their plant and equipment. The local council got their piece of road fixed at a cost of $27 million, $18 million more than they would have done it for themselves—and not even the pie shop got a lick out of it. 


At the moment in Townsville there is a $120 million project underway, the joint logistics hub. It was brought forward under the previous Labor government. Baulderstone, the contractor, won the tender fair and square through the tender process as it stands. Their major subcontractor is Shamrock Civil Engineering, who are also a Brisbane based firm. Whilst the federal government can stand back and be very proud that we have $120 million of infrastructure going into the Townsville area, very few local tradesmen and very few local businesses are going to get a lick. The Hungry Jack's across the road is doing very well. They are even putting on more staff to cope with the blokes coming across the road. The pie van is doing okay there as well. But no local business, no local construction firm and no local contractors are getting a go at this money. 


For us in the regions to get the full benefits we want to see from our infrastructure spend, the money wash through our economies. I am not saying we have to be protectionist on behalf of the regions and I am not saying that we should go for more expensive tenders or anything like that. The issue is how the tenders are structured between state and federal governments—that is what we need to address to allow that money to be spent correctly in the regions. There is an old saying that no public servant ever lost his job by awarding a job to John Holland, Teece or a company like that. If they give the job to a local contractor and something goes wrong, the answer is obvious: the big guys did not get it. What we have to do, through this Federation white paper, is look at how the tenders are structured. We need to make sure that, when we do infrastructure in our regions, when we do spend money—whether it be the $925 million they say has been cut or through fiscally responsible decisions—we look at the way this money is spent in our communities. Everyone would be upset if a Chinese firm were given a major project in Sydney. I do not see why we in the regions should be second-class citizens. I thank the House.

"MacTiernan, Alannah, MP",ALP,2014-07-14,"



Ms MacTIERNAN
 (Perth) (11:01):  Local government in Western Australia will be losing $102.4 million as a result of this great surprise. We have been told by the Prime Minister, Mr Abbott, that this is the budget the community voted for. I can tell you that local government throughout Western Australia do not believe that they voted for this budget. There was no indication whatsoever that their funding would be cut. 


There is a structure in place so that when political parties contest elections they have a clear indication of the state of the budget. So this idea that, after you come into parliament, you suddenly have no idea what the state of the budget is—and that that justifies you making all of these fundamental changes—is just complete rubbish. The state of the budget was absolutely known by the coalition before the election. Yet they made no mention of these really quite profound changes that are going to affect communities in Western Australia across the board—and which will have a particularly significant impact on small rural communities. 


There are a number of communities that are dependent on these Financial Assistance Grants for 30 per cent or more of their local government income. These include Derby-West Kimberley, Dalwallinju, Karijini and Upper Gascoyne. Then there are places like Mount Marshall, Mukinbudin, Murchison and Koorda, all of which are dependent on Financial Assistance Grants for 50 per cent or more of their income. These grants play a very significant role in these communities. Quite understandably, then, the shires in these regional areas are immensely concerned about what has happened. Greg Powell, the CEO of the Shire of Merredin, had this to say:


Rural and remote communities are, in many cases, already struggling with declining populations, drought and other detrimental socio-economic factors. Placing the expectation on the local community to either cover the shortfall in funds or accept a decline in services is grossly unfair given that our local residents have already paid taxes to the Federal Government and expect an adequate level of that revenue to be returned to Councils to provide local services and infrastructure …


Mr Webster, the CEO of the Shire of Wagin, has said:


A decision like what has occurred will either increase shire rates & charges or reduce the services to the communities. It will also have a long term impact on programs that local government often undertake from these funds for their communities.


The impact is not confined only to those rural areas. It will also affect shires like Swan and Bayswater in my electorate. Francesca Lefante, who is the CEO of the City of Bayswater, had this to say:


The failure to index the FAGs will mean the City of Bayswater’s ability to provide services, such as libraries and family-oriented community facilities, will be put under great pressure as we struggle to meet the needs of a growing and ageing population. This is a blow for local communities already bearing the brunt of greatly increased charges for utilities and cuts to services in the areas of health, education and seniors’ concessions.


We have heard some interesting commentary today. The previous speaker, the member for Herbert—who at least did speak about local government and not about ties and live exports—even contested whether or not these Financial Assistance Grants were something that should be provided by the federal government. Financial Assistance Grants were first introduced in the mid-1970s by the Whitlam government. This was the first time the Commonwealth had ever directly recognised local government. The formula was then reset by the Keating government in the mid-1990s. The grants are a very clear recognition that the majority of taxation accrues to the federal government and that there must be a fair sharing of this revenue. The suggestion from the member for Herbert that the government may be looking at walking away from this is remarkable. (Time expired)

"Gillespie, David, MP",Nats,2014-07-14,"



Dr GILLESPIE
 (Lyne) (11:07):  I rise to speak against this motion opposing the government's decision to freeze indexation of Financial Assistance Grants to local governments across Australia. As you and everyone in this House well knows, we have a huge accumulated federal deficit which needs to be addressed, and these changes to local government grants are a responsible reaction to that. But people are being selective about where these freezes are occurring, and the outcome of that, because they are being taken in isolation. At the same time as these indexation freezes were announced, an extra $350 million was put into the Roads to Recovery program and an extra $100 million, for two years in a row, was put into the Black Spots program. At the same time, $300 million was announced for the Bridges Renewal program, as well as $200 million for Heavy Vehicle Safety and Productivity improvements and $229 million to go into the national highway upgrade.


Why is this good for regional councils? The answer is that there is a distorted and disproportionate income differential between regional and metropolitan councils, and these changes to Roads to Recovery, Bridges Renewal and Black Spot funding benefit regional and rural councils more. Not all of the money in the FAGs is tied to roadwork, but with the Black Spot program and Roads to Recovery, we are getting funds tied to road building and road recovery activity, which is the biggest burden that these regional and rural councils—where the National Party has seats—have to face. To put things in perspective, the difference in population density makes a huge difference for metropolitan councils with rates and also developer contributions, as there is always more development going on in the metropolitan centres. The councils will have to make their own decisions on how they manage their money, but federal financial assistance grants are not their only source of income.


Some of my regional councils would love to be responsible for a total road area of 97 kilometres, which Strathfield Council has—whereas Port Macquarie has 1,312 kilometres to look after, without the rate base or developer contributions you see in Strathfield. It is of interest that Marrickville Council has a total of 216 kilometres, which ends up being 2.6 kilometres per thousand people, with a population density of 4,905 people per square kilometre—as opposed to Gloucester, which has something like 20 per square kilometre. So there is an inherent benefit to regional and rural councils through these changes, let alone in the Lyne electorate, where we have announced $17.5 million for Bucketts Way, between Gloucester and Taree, and all the councils in my area that have very large numbers—




Mr Baldwin:
  It should have been between Port Stephens and Taree.




Dr GILLESPIE:
  But the important bit that needs the work, as the member for Paterson understands, is between Gloucester and Taree—particularly down the Taree end. I am sure Gloucester Shire Council and Greater Taree City Council will welcome the $17.4 million they are getting for Bucketts Way, as well as the $10 million we have rolled over from an unsuccessful Northern Gateway project into the roads and bridges program so that Dickinson Bridge and other bridges in the area get the attention they deserve.




Mr Albanese:
  They took money off Taree.




Dr GILLESPIE:
  The member needs to remember that this is a delivery on things that were promised four and five years ago that were never delivered by the previous government.




Mr Albanese:
  Like the Pacific Highway.




Dr GILLESPIE:
  Yes—only $1.2 billion being spent on the Pacific Highway. (Time expired)

"Elliot, Justine, MP",ALP,2014-07-14,"



Mrs ELLIOT
 (Richmond) (11:12):  I rise today in support of the motion by the member for Grayndler, and I join with him in condemning the Abbott government in cutting the funding to local councils. In particular, I want to condemn the National Party for these cruel cuts. Indeed, the National Party should be ashamed of their slashing of vital funding for our local councils, especially in those regional and rural areas. These cuts will affect every shire council, city council and local government authority right across Australia, with the harshest cuts of all being the cuts to the Financial Assistance Grants. These cuts, combined with the government's cuts in funding for pensioner concessions, mean that local councils will be forced to either cut services or they may in fact be forced to increase rates to cover these funding cuts. Make no mistake about it—the Abbott government will be responsible for local councils being forced to raise their rates to cover these unfair cuts.


As we have heard, the Financial Assistance Grants are nothing new. They were originally introduced by a Labor government—the Whitlam government—back in 1974, because of the value of what local government contributes to our local communities. Whilst it is true that the role of local government is constantly changing and reflecting the needs and wishes of individual local communities, it is local governments that build and maintain local roads and provide important local services. That was why the Labor government introduced a way to help local governments to deliver these vital services by funding the local governments directly. Since its introduction the Financial Assistance Grants to local governments have been supported by the federal parliament in recognition of the role local government plays in the daily lives of the people of Australia. And this has held true until now.


It is this Abbott Liberal-National Party government that has taken an axe to the support we give to local governments, and they have done this through those cuts to the Financial Assistance Grants, and by ripping away the funding assistance that provides rates concessions for our senior citizens. This is an issue of huge concern for the elderly in my electorate, who are already struggling week-to-week and will now have their rates rebates reduced due to the Abbott government's cuts. And this is on top of their cuts to pensions—another surprise contained in the budget.


It is estimated that the decision to freeze Financial Assistance Grants will cost the local government sector $925 million by the 2017-18 financial year. This hurts every local community right across Australia, but it particularly hurts those smaller regional and rural councils. At its recent annual National General Assembly, the cuts to Financial Assistance Grants were considered by the Australian Local Government Association. They passed a motion that included the resolution:


Delegates of the 2014 National General Assembly, in recognition of the vital importance of the Financial Assistance Grants … to local government for the provision of equitable levels of local government services to all Australian communities, unanimously call on the Commonwealth Government to:


Restore indexation of Financial Assistance Grants in line with CPI and population growth immediately ...


At the same annual National General Assembly of the Australian Local Government Association, it was the Tweed Shire mayor, Barry Longland, from my electorate in Richmond, who successfully moved a motion that called for the immediate reversal of the decision to cease payments for rate concessions to local government. It stated:


That Delegates of the National General Assembly call on the Federal Government to reverse its decision to cease payments under the National Partnership Agreement on Certain Concessions for Pensioner Concession Cards and Senior Card Holders that will negatively impact on council budgets.


Right across Australia, local governments are pleading their case that they will be hurt by this federal government's decision to cut Financial Assistance Grants and funding for pensioner concessions.


In my electorate of Richmond, these matters have been raised by the local councils. Byron Shire Council have raised their very real concerns about the effect of the cuts to both the Financial Assistance Grants and the pensioner concessions. They estimate that these cuts will amount to $424,200 over the next four years. Similarly, Tweed Shire Council have raised their concerns about these cuts. They estimate it will cost the Tweed community more than $1.5 million over the next four years—a massive cut.


In fact, every council contained within my electorate of Richmond may have to consider cuts to some of their services or, indeed, increasing rates. It is expected that, in Richmond, the Ballina Shire Council, the Lismore City Council, the Byron Shire Council and the Tweed Shire Council stand to lose approximately $4 million over the next four years. This is going to hurt communities in Richmond and, as I say, it is going to mean that those councils may be forced to cut services or increase rates—and this all the fault of the Abbott government and their very cruel cuts. 


The people of the North Coast condemn these mean cuts to local governments, because they understand the significance of the services that local governments provide. I stand with my local community in opposing the Abbott government's—the Liberal-National Party government's—cruel cuts to local governments, and I call on them to reverse this decision immediately, because it will have devastating impacts on local councils, particularly those local councils in regional and rural areas. I especially condemn the National Party for the way in which they have completely abandoned the people of regional and rural Australia.

"Hunt, Greg, MP",LP,2014-07-14,"



Mr HUNT
 (Flinders—Minister for the Environment) (12:38):  I move:


That these bills be now read a second time.


Today the government introduces:


the Clean Energy Legislation (Carbon Tax Repeal) Bill 2014;


the Ozone Protection and Synthetic Greenhouse Gas (Import Levy) Amendment (Carbon Tax Repeal) Bill 2014;


the Ozone Protection and Synthetic Greenhouse Gas (Manufacture Levy) Amendment (Carbon Tax Repeal) Bill 2014;


the True Up Shortfall Levy (General) (Carbon Tax Repeal) Bill 2014;


the True Up Shortfall Levy (Excise) (Carbon Tax Repeal) Bill 2014;


the Customs Tariff Amendment (Carbon Tax Repeal) Bill 2014;


the Excise Tariff Amendment (Carbon Tax Repeal) Bill 2014; and


the Ozone Protection and Synthetic Greenhouse Gas (Import Levy) (Transitional Provisions) Bill 2014. 


The Australian people have already debated the carbon tax and they decided ten months ago on 7 September 2013 that they did not want:


higher electricity prices;


higher gas prices;


higher travel costs; or


higher food costs.


The Australian people did not want to support a measure that did not do the job, was not working and did not have a mandate. In short, the Australian people voted in the most express, clear and absolute way to ensure that they did not have and would not have a carbon tax, and they would have a government that will take real measures to reduce emissions, without a carbon tax.


The carbon tax increased the costs of everything it touched.


It punishes households, business, schools, hospitals, nursing homes, charities, churches, council swimming pools and community centres.


It hits each and every group and individual who use energy—and that was always its goal: to make electricity and gas more expensive. The purpose, the intention, the construct of a carbon tax is to increase the cost of living, most specifically the price of electricity and gas, for Australian families.


And that is why the Australian people voted to get rid of it.


The bills honour the coalition's commitment to the Australian people to scrap this tax.


It is now up to this parliament to show that it has listened to the Australian people.


We categorically accept the science of climate change. We categorically accept the need for action. But we categorically do not accept a system that fails to work, that does not achieve significant reductions and that comes at a significant cost. We are committed to a better way that actually reduces emissions and cleans up power stations, cleans up land fill and cleans up waste coal mine gas and reduces emissions by improving energy efficiency.


The bills today ensure that all elements of the carbon tax are abolished.


The main bill removes the carbon tax, and implements new powers for the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to ensure that cost savings are passed on to the Australian public, in full.


The other bills remove the imposition of the carbon tax on liquid fuels and synthetic greenhouse gases.


The bills also provide for the transitional arrangements to ensure a smooth transition out of the carbon tax in all its forms, and give the Clean Energy Regulator, the Australian Taxation Office, the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service and the Department of the Environment the powers they need to do this.


A cornerstone of the government's plan for a stronger economy built on lower taxes, less regulation and stronger businesses, whilst reducing emissions, is the repeal of the carbon tax.


The first impact of the repeal of the carbon tax will be on households whose overall costs will fall, according to Treasury modelling, by approximately $550 a year on average, compared with what it otherwise would have been.


Electricity bills will be around $200 lower this financial year without the carbon tax.


Gas bills will be around $70 lower this financial year without the carbon tax.


These are real savings that will help family budgets.


Only last week, we heard from a number of new Senators on the impact of the carbon tax on pensioners, on the cost of heating homes, on farmers' incomes and small business costs. I would note that Senator Joe Bullock was expressly elected on a campaign to terminate the carbon tax.


The people who voted for those senators expect them to act.


It is disappointing that families and small businesses are still paying $11 million a day in higher electricity prices due to the carbon tax.


Once the carbon tax is repealed, there will be savings to the family budgets with lower electricity and gas prices.


And these savings are already being confirmed.


In Queensland, the Queensland Competition Authority has said that typical household electricity bills are expected to fall by 8.5 per cent. In New South Wales, the Independent Pricing and Regulatory Tribunal has said that gas prices will be up to 9.2 per cent lower without the carbon tax. In Tasmania, the Office of the Tasmanian Economic Regulator has said that electricity prices will be 7.8 per cent lower with the removal of the carbon tax. In the ACT, the Independent Competition and Regulatory Commission has said that electricity prices will fall by 11.6 per cent without the carbon tax. Prices for groceries, for household items and for services will also fall because the price of power is embedded in every price in our economy where those prices have been added according to the rules which are set out in these bills.


The carbon tax will go, but the carbon tax compensation will stay so that every Australian should be better off. I repeat this message to the House and to the people of Australia: while the carbon tax will go, the carbon tax compensation will stay so that every Australian should be better off. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission has a wide-ranging arsenal of compliance powers to ensure businesses do not mislead their customers about the impacts of the carbon tax repeal. It has received $10 million in additional funding to take necessary enforcement action and also to inform businesses about their obligations and customers about their rights. Under the original version of the repeal bills, penalties of up to $1.1 million for corporations and $220,000 for individuals will apply where there are breaches. These penalties are retained. The ACCC has already issued over 560 requests for information from companies across the economy, including from the electricity, gas, refrigerants and aviation sectors.


As agreed with the Palmer United Party, I foreshadow and will move amendments during the consideration-in-detail stage of the bills to supplement the commission's ability to ensure that consumers benefit from the repeal of the carbon tax. The changes included in the bills are to ensure that suppliers of regulated goods—electricity, natural gas and bulk supplies of synthetic greenhouse gases—must pass on all cost savings. They impose a penalty on electricity and natural gas suppliers equal to 250 per cent of any cost savings they do not pass on. They require electricity and natural gas retailers and bulk importers of synthetic greenhouse gases to inform the ACCC and customers about how they are passing on the cost savings amounts of the savings.


The changes to the main repeal bill balance new compliance obligations with the need to ensure that household and business customers benefit. Already strong protections are being further strengthened. Businesses should be able to explain to customers how changes in their costs are flowing through to changes in their prices. For the purpose of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901, I confirm that the definition of 'electricity retailer' is limited to electricity retailers and electricity producers selling electricity into a wholesale electricity market or to a retailer. By agreement, this is not intended to override any pre-existing contracts. 


The cost of synthetic greenhouse gases was significantly impacted by the carbon tax. Bulk importers of synthetic greenhouse gas defined under s13A(2)(c) of the Ozone Protection and Synthetic Greenhouse Gas Management Act 1989 are covered by the new requirements. To minimise the cost of compliance, small imports of synthetic greenhouse gases such as imports of synthetic greenhouse gas contained in equipment such as fridges, cars and air-conditioners are not covered. The new provisions are confined to those sectors. I make that statement for the purpose of the Acts Interpretation Act. The bill already provides flexibility for the ACCC to expand the range of sectors covered should any significant concerns arise.


The government is confident that all businesses will do the right thing and pass on all the savings relating to carbon tax repeal. The government is aware that major electricity and gas retailers are already committed to providing this information to households and businesses on bills, inserts and through websites in any event. The carbon tax has been a $15 billion hit on the economy over two years. It is a $15 billion hit on jobs, a $15 billion burden on investment and a $15 billion slug to families, pensioners and small business owners, which they do not need because it simply does not do the job. These bills get rid of a tax which does not work, which is not doing the job and which is not achieving its outcome.


In moving these bills, I want to thank from the Department of the Environment, Simon Writer, who has worked tirelessly over recent weeks and months, the Acting Secretary, Mr Steven Kennedy, and able officers Joe Pryor, Kim Begbie and Josie Cleland. From the Office of Parliamentary Counsel, I wish to thank Mr Keith Byles and his team, and from the Department of the Treasury, Mr Hamish McDonald and his team, the Minister for Small Business and his outstanding staff and the outstanding staff of the Australian Government Solicitor. I also particularly wish to thank the extraordinary and patient Alex Caroly from my own office.


Ultimately, repealing the carbon tax will reduce the cost of living, make jobs more secure and improve the competitive position of our country. It will be replaced with a system which actually reduces emissions. Let us be absolutely clear: the Australian people have already voted on this carbon tax repeal bill. They are now waiting for members and senators to honour their commitments to abolish the tax and get the budget back into surplus. As the Prime Minister has said previously to the House: these bills are the government's bill to reduce the Australian people's bills—and so the government and I commend these bills to the parliament.

"Shorten, Bill, MP",ALP,2014-07-14,"



Mr SHORTEN
 (Maribyrnong—Leader of the Opposition) (12:51):  I rise to speak on the Clean Energy Legislation (Carbon Tax Repeal) Bill 2014 and related bills. In late 2009, this nation was on the verge of making a decision about which we could have been collectively proud. We could have made this parliament a place of inspiration, with a national response to climate change, supported by both government and opposition. It was a policy of both government and opposition that built upon the previous government's decision—a government not of our party—but consistent with the best practice in the world Indeed, this week is the seventh anniversary of Prime Minister Howard announcing his support for an emissions trading scheme.


Those debates in 2009 took our nation to a higher level. The myths, fears and uncertainties would be set aside, not just for the national interest but for all generations for all future time. But since that time the hope that we could develop a national commitment has been frittered away. For his part, our current Prime Minister wrested away the leadership of the Liberal party from the person who believed most in the evidence and the need for a response. For our part, we walked away from calling an election which the nation was entitled to have. We did the second best thing. We worked to achieve a national response, but we settled for second best, transforming the international pricing of carbon into a carbon tax. But we were right to have international pricing. We were right to support an emissions trading scheme. We were right to have climate change as a political priority of the previous government. We were right to establish the Climate Change Authority, the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and the Australian Renewable Energy Agency. We were right to back the renewable energy target. We were right to listen to the scientific world. We had a responsibility to work within the political realities to achieve the best national outcomes for the best international response. For this, Labor does not apologise. From this Labor does not resile. We are not sceptics. We believe the science. We understand that what is necessary is an effective international solution. In that international solution we aim for best practice, to be among the leaders, working with the progressive, continuously testing the facts. In that international solution we want practical outcomes, the best solutions, not just some vague promises. We would prefer to be part of a national consensus, but where we cannot we shall advocate our position. We want to nurture the debate. Last week's staggering display of this government's special blend of blustering arrogance and incompetence made one thing abundantly clear: only one party in Australia has a serious, substantial and credible climate change policy. That party is the Australian Labor Party.


There is no doubt that our earth is warming and our seas rising or that human kind is the cause. The United States Department of Energy has calculated that the burning of fossil fuels has caused some 1.3 trillion tonnes of CO2 to be released into the atmosphere and researchers from the Woods Hole centre have calculated that a further 0.7 trillion tonnes have been released as a consequence of deforestation and changes in land use. That is two trillion tonnes of heat-trapping greenhouse gas released into our atmosphere at a rate many times faster than the previous 800,000 years. Each of the last three decades has been warmer on average than any other in modern times and 13 of the 14 hottest years on record have occurred in the 21st century. Sea levels have risen by about 20 centimetres on average over the past century and the rate of increase has been much greater in recent decades. There is no evidence to refute any of this or any genuine scientific counterargument in the climate change debate. This is not 'absolute crap', Prime Minister; this is the inescapable truth.


If we do not act the consequences will be severe. It is predicted that we will endure more droughts, more bushfires, more floods, more storms and more extremes. Indeed, we are already seeing more extreme weather events influenced by the warming experienced so far. The damage to our coasts, our farmland, our forests and our animal life will be irretrievable and irreversible. In 2014 the question before this parliament, the question for our nation, the question for humanity is not whether we need to act on climate change; it is, as President Obama has said, 'whether we will have the courage to act before it's too late.' We must decide today whether Australia will step up and play our part, fulfilling our responsibility, doing our fair share, which means setting appropriate emissions targets and building the policy infrastructure to help us meet them. That is what Labor did.


Any serious policy solution to climate change must, sooner rather than later, include an emissions trading system. That is where the world is heading. Next year in Paris world leaders will gather to develop the next set of emissions goals, for 2030. Australia can choose: we can attend the conference proud that we are making our contribution to the global effort or we can slink in, embarrassed by our lethargy. We can go as a nation with an integrated, effective ETS or as a nation with no climate policy. The governments of the world, both progressive and conservative, are making their choice clear. Today, as I speak, 39 national and 29 subnational jurisdictions, accounting for almost a quarter of global greenhouse gas emissions, have implemented or are on track to implement carbon pricing instruments, including emissions trading schemes. Already the world's emissions trading schemes are valued at more than $30 billion. China's seven pilot emissions trading schemes alone cover quarter of a billion people. It is the second-largest carbon market in the world, second only to the European Union's. South Korea will introduce its ETS on 1 January 2015. Mexico put a price on carbon in 2013. The European union has had an ETS four years, and many European countries have applied their own carbon pricing on top of the European system, including France in 2013. In the United States, Oregon and Washington they are exploring carbon-pricing options, and California, itself the world's eighth-largest economy, already has an ETS in place, as does New York and eight other states in the USA's Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative.


This growing international trend means that every year, more people are trading more emissions in more markets for more money—and we can today vote for our economy to be part of this. We can vote for a flexible and viable ETS, compared to heavy regulation and intervention. We can vote for an ETS that does not just favour renewable energy; it favours all low-emissions energy. Labor's ETS provides an added commercial incentive for better carbon capture and storage, for natural gas and for clean coal, delivering more benefits for Australian industries. And Labor's ETS is ready to link to the world's biggest emissions trading market, the European Union. Mr Deputy Speaker, our world is moving forward on climate change. If Australia goes backwards, we will be going alone. Nations on every continent are taking new action and creating new economic opportunities for their people. World leaders recognise what former Republican, US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, recently called 'the profound economic risks of doing nothing'. Paulson, a powerful conservative, has said that waiting for more information before acting is not conservative; it is taking a very radical risk.


This Prime Minister of ours is no leader. He is incapable of identifying the risks and costs of inaction. He is sleepwalking his way into a major climate policy disaster—a disaster for the Australian economy, and for our environment; a disaster that guarantees that for ever, Tony Abbott will be remembered as an environmental vandal. While the Prime Minister dithers over his dodgy deals with the crossbench, Labor policies continue to deliver economic and environmental benefits. Since we put a price on pollution two years ago, emissions in the energy sector—the main sector covered by the carbon tax—have dropped by 10.4 per cent. Since the Renewable Energy Target was introduced, $18 billion has flowed into Australia's renewable energy sector. Under Labor, wind power generation tripled. The number of jobs in the renewable energy sector tripled. And the number of Australian households with rooftop solar panels has increased, from under 7½ thousand to almost 1.2 million. Abolishing the RET will put Australia out of step with the rest of the world and it will cut us off from the next wave of international investment in clean energy. Already—after nine months of this government talking down the RET, and lying about its impact—Australia has slipped from fourth to eighth on Ernst and Young's renewable energy country attractiveness index. Australia is one of 144 countries in the world with a set of renewable targets, and Labor believes that we should be leading the world as a supplier of clean energy.


If we are strategic—if we are smart—Australia can power our future prosperity with solar, wind, geothermal and tidal energy. This is not just about taking advantage of our country's natural gifts; the sunlight that bathes our continent or the waves that break upon our coastline. It means Australian researchers, Australian scientists and Australian investors leading innovation and creating economic growth by developing new energy technology and boosting energy efficiency. This is precisely what the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and the Australian Renewable Energy Agency are helping to achieve. The CEFC is a productive and profitable enterprise, generating genuine value for taxpayer money. By leveraging private sector investment and low-emissions technology, the CEFC steps up to help Australian start-ups capitalise and commercialise ideas. Last year, every dollar the CEFC invested generated $2.90 of private sector investment—yet this government is so blinded by its ideology that it seeks to abolish this organisation. The government wants to get rid of ARENA too. Right now, ARENA leads the way in supporting Australian environmental innovation and investing in Australian genius. ARENA provides funding for institutions like the University of New South Wales School of Photovoltaic and Renewable Energy Engineering, which has for the past three decades set multiple world records for silicon solar cell efficiency. Alumni and researchers from this Australian institution manage some of the world's largest solar energy companies. ARENA grants are also supporting Australian researchers investigating new and more efficient energy sources—tidal energy in Portland; algae as a biofuel in Townsville, Parkville and Whyalla; solar thermal energy storage in Newcastle; and geothermal energy in the Cooper Basin. The Climate Change Authority has been doing its important job well, providing authoritative, transparent information and policy advice—as does the Productivity Commission, and as does the Reserve Bank. There is only one reason the Prime Minister wants to abolish the Climate Change Authority—because it tells the truth.


Labor's climate change policy was shaped by scientific and economic experts. We enhanced the Renewable Energy Target. We created the Climate Change Authority, the CEFC and ARENA because we are determined to fight climate change on every inch of ground, with every weapon in Australia's intellectual, economic and policy arsenal. Labor has built for Australia the architecture for reducing our emissions in the most efficient and most economically responsible way possible. Each of our policy elements works in partnership with the others to deliver the best outcome—a market-based mechanism for tackling pollution: an ETS that guarantees the lowest costs for Australian businesses and for Australian families. An ETS delivers business certainty. It positions Australia to maximise economic benefits from the growing global trend of pricing pollution. And it puts Australia on the crest of a wave of unprecedented new market opportunities in clean energy and green technology, giving Australia innovation, and giving Australian ideas the chance to thrive. The parliament can vote for Labor's emission trading scheme today. The intricate, carefully calibrated design work has been done. The international compatibility is assured. Labor's ETS is legislated. It is ready to go.


But this Liberal Party, this once great party of the free market and free enterprise, wants no part of this market solution. They want to tear down everything that has been built. They want to replace it with an amateur, ill-conceived, centralist, Soviet style voucher system that will give the nation's biggest polluters great wads of taxpayer money to keep polluting. The logic is baffling. The hypocrisy is staggering. This Liberal Party—the party that, through the GP tax, wants to put a price signal in place to stop Australian pensioners and low- and middle-income earners from seeing their doctor—rejects the need for a price signal on pollution that will determine the health of our planet. They believe in a market to punish the sick and the vulnerable, but they will not support one that helps the Earth. They turn their backs on the free market and the settled science in favour of Tea Party economics and crackpot pseudoscience.


Make no mistake, this destructive policy will cost Australia dearly in the future. It will cost our country more and will achieve less. Direct Action is a policy designed solely for the Prime Minister's personal core constituency: the flat earth society! It is a policy concocted purely to appease the ragtag militia of the internet trolls, the cranky radio shock jocks and the extreme columnists. The ideologues and demagogues have held the climate change debate hostage for too long. Direct action is, as the minister for communications said in a more honest time, nothing but a policy fig leaf. It proves yet again that this is a most ignorant government, driven by nothing but its book-burning instincts and its tattered ideology.


Above all, the Prime Minister's climate policy vacuum is a grievous failure of leadership that shows that our Prime Minister lacks faith in the Australian people. He does not understand Australians nor does he respect them. On climate change, as with this budget, we see the harmful division between this government's mean and narrow view and our generous and decent Australian society. Australians are bigger, better and braver than this awkward, divisive, backward-looking government. They deserve better than this Prime Minister's lectures and lies. They deserve a government that represents their moderate, informed views on climate change; not one that delivers pre-Enlightenment, science-sledging nonsense. Australians are smart enough to grasp the inevitability of change. They are up for the hard decisions. They can participate in mature debates about the future of our environment and the future of our economy. Unlike this Prime Minister, Australians can look beyond self-interest and see the national and global interest.


Today, the parliament has a choice: we can enter the history books as the generation that ignored the perils of climate change; we can be marked down as the generation that surrendered to the selfish, shouting clamour of vested interests; or we can guarantee that Australia does its fair share to deal with this global problem. This parliament can vote for an emissions trading scheme that puts Australia in step with the rest of the world. Today, I give Australians this promise: Labor will always fight for serious, credible climate change policy. We will never surrender to this Prime Minister's bullying denialism and his government's extremism.


Sadly, we have run out of time to deal with climate change. The decisions made by us, the elected representatives of the people, over these final six years of this critical decade for climate action will have an irrevocable impact on the quality of life for future generations. We all have choices in history, and some are more than important than others. Today, we can embrace the extreme risk of doing nothing, and when, in the future, it is proved wrong, the costs will not be measured by a rye laugh of those opposite, an embarrassed smile or a belated and sincere expression of regret. No apology will suffice. It will be forever remembered as your greatest voting folly. There is no mistake greater. There is no blunder more serious. It is inexplicable. It is unjustifiable, not because we were responsible but because we did not accept our responsibility in this parliament.


If we embrace the risk of doing something, then we shall take our place in the progressive world supported by a society that saw this issue as political but above politics. This parliament has choices. Each of us here knows that the political process can be exciting and exhilarating. We all know that it can be cruel and exacting. On this side of the House, we know that on the other side of the House and in the other house in this place there are people of character and commitment no less convinced than we are of the severity of the problem. But, for Labor, we will reach for the higher ground, always and constantly. In the blink of an eye of Earth's history, we have seen climate change that is staggering and frightening. In the blink of an eye that responds, let there be no tears for humanity.

"McNamara, Karen, MP",LP,2014-07-14,"



Mrs McNAMARA
 (Dobell) (13:13):  I welcome the reintroduction of the carbon tax repeal legislation and so do the Australian people, who have waited far too long to see the end of this jobs-destroying toxic tax.


On 7 September 2013, the Australian people overwhelmingly elected a new government that was committed to stopping the boats, repairing Labor's debt and deficit disaster, building the infrastructure for the 21st century and, above all else, repealing Labor's carbon tax. The Australian people have good reason to be angry with the actions of the members opposite. Ever since the then prime minister, Julia Gillard, spoke these words before the 2010 federal election, 'There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead,' Labor has deceived the Australian people. Again, before the 2013 federal election, the Australian people were told by those opposite that the carbon tax had been terminated. Australians were told that:


The government has decided to terminate the carbon tax to help the cost-of-living pressures for families and to reduce costs for small businesses.


Those were not the words of the now Prime Minister Tony Abbott; they were the words of former Labor Prime Minister Kevin Rudd. He went on to say that terminating the carbon tax was 'the fiscally responsible thing to do'.


Following the election, the truth was abundantly clear. Labor never had any intention of terminating the carbon tax. The will of the Australian people has been blatantly ignored by members opposite. Every member of this parliament, excluding the Greens, was elected on the basis that the carbon tax would be repealed. Why is it that Labor have repeatedly joined forces with the Greens in both the House and the Senate to deny the Australian public what they overwhelmingly voted for?


Labor's commitment to repealing the carbon tax was as genuine as their commitment to delivering a budget surplus. Labor have now had 10 months to be true to their word and terminate the carbon tax, but they have repeatedly failed to be true to their word since losing government. Not only have they failed to keep their word; they have also failed to honour the wishes of the Australian people. Members opposite are, without a shadow of a doubt, government change deniers. As a result of Labor's actions, the carbon tax is still standing.


Only two weeks ago, the world's largest carbon tax got even bigger, rising from $24.15 to $25.40 per tonne. As a result of Labor's actions, every time ordinary Australians turn on the light, the heater or the toaster, they are paying more. As a result of Labor's actions, electricity prices across Australia are continuing to unnecessarily rise. Every day the carbon tax stays in place it is costing Australians $11 million. Since last Thursday's vote in the Senate, Labor's actions have cost Australians $44 million. We are voting to scrap the carbon tax because it is the best way to take financial pressure off families as well as help the economy. It will save families, on average, $550 a year.


This toxic tax is hurting the households and businesses of Dobell. This is a fact, I know, because the people of Dobell are telling me daily of the impact the carbon tax has had on their power bills, adding to the cost of living. Repealing Labor's carbon tax will give relief to local businesses, which will mean more money to invest in local jobs and higher wages. The carbon tax is also impacting on local governments across Australia. As a result, residents are faced with higher rates and more costly utilities, such as water and waste removal.


Last Friday I toured Wyong Shire Council's Buttonderry Waste Management Facility. The Central Coast is rapidly growing and, on an annual basis, approximately 250,000 tonnes of waste is received at this facility. There is no alternative for Wyong Shire Council but to operate the waste facility. The ratepayers of Wyong Shire Council are already paying higher fees to use this facility—an increase of $22 in the last year alone. As a result of Labor's carbon tax, in the last financial year Wyong Shire Council had a carbon tax bill of $5 million. If Labor and the Greens have their way, this bill will continue to increase to over $10 million in the coming years. This is money that could be better spent on new roads, improving existing roads and being invested in much-needed infrastructure and local government services.


As a result of the actions of those opposite, small businesses in Dobell continue to be burdened by the carbon tax. A local smash repairer at Wyong has been paying an additional $400 per month for gas. He cannot pass this increase on to the end consumer because he is restricted to pricing regulated by insurers. A publican at North Wyong has seen his electricity and gas bills increase by $20,000 per year. The owner wants to employ more people but he simply cannot afford to. This is the harsh reality imposed on local small businesses—including butchers, greengrocers, bakers, smash repairers and restaurateurs—across Australia. Seventy-five thousand Australian businesses are affected by the carbon tax. These are the businesses that employ local people and are the backbone and driving force of many local economies, Dobell included.


The Central Coast is expected to grow by an additional 100,000 people by 2031. This will require more than 45,000 new jobs. This will be achieved by supporting local small businesses and by driving stronger economic growth and increased productivity, not by imposing unnecessary taxes. With Labor's job-destroying carbon tax, the difficulty of this task is painfully obvious. Thanks to Labor's carbon tax, there have been more small business closures in Dobell than anywhere else in New South Wales. I want to see Dobell known for the highest number of new business start-ups, not for the highest number of business closures. The damage caused by Labor's carbon tax is as clear as day. No matter what the Labor Party say, their actions demonstrate that they are totally committed to a carbon tax—be it Julia Gillard's $64 billion tax that cost Australian jobs or Kevin Rudd's $58 billion tax that cost Australian jobs.


On the former government's own figures, the carbon tax is set to increase sixfold between now and 2019. The carbon tax explains a lot about Labor's legacy to Australia—200,000 more people unemployed when they left office as compared to when they took office. We cannot afford to continue as we were. The time has now come for this parliament to put this toxic, job-destroying tax behind us. The time has now come to honour the will of the Australian people and to build a strong and prosperous economy for a safe and secure Australia.


The carbon tax is an environmental and economic failure. In its first full year of operation, the carbon tax saw an emissions reduction of 0.1 per cent, despite its $7.6 billion price tag. Over two years, the carbon tax has cost Australians $15.4 billion. In addition, domestic emissions under the carbon tax are projected to rise through  to 2020. The Australian Treasury indicates that removing the carbon tax now will leave average costs of living across all Australian households around $550 lower than they will otherwise be in 2014-15.


It is also estimated that retail electricity should be around nine per cent lower and retail gas prices around seven per cent lower than they would otherwise have been. Mr Rod Simms, Chair of the ACCC, has stated:


What went up will clearly come down when you take away the carbon tax.


The Independent Pricing and Regulatory Tribunal in New South Wales stated gas prices in New South Wales would be up to 9.2 per cent lower without the carbon tax. This means for the 37,000-plus families in Dobell that their average household electricity bills alone will be around $200 lower than they otherwise would have been in 2014-15 under Labor's carbon tax.


There is a better way. This government are committed to reducing Australia's emissions by five per cent by 2020 based on 2000 levels. We will achieve this through our Emissions Reduction Fund. It will reduce our emissions by five per cent without the damaging cost to businesses and households as a result of the carbon tax. Its sole focus is to find opportunities to drive emissions reductions.


The government's Green Army Program will see local communities directly benefit from practical, on-the-ground environmental projects. In Dobell we are proud of our natural environment, from our magnificent beaches and coastline to Tuggerah Lakes and our valleys. Our environment contributes to our quality of living. The government are committed to protecting and enhancing our natural environment. In addition to our Green Army projects we will deliver $3.3 million worth of real improvements to Tuggerah Lakes.


 The people of Dobell know a tax when they see one. They know when people are serious about improving the environment and when people are masquerading a great big new tax in the name of environmentalism. The people of Dobell, along with the people of Australia, voted to scrap this tax. This government was elected with a clear mandate to get rid of the carbon tax. With the carbon tax repealed, families, seniors, small businesses and local councils will benefit through lower costs in almost everything throughout our economy.


Members now have one last opportunity to be on the right side of history and to scrap this jobs-destroying tax. Labor can keep their word and stand up for households and businesses, as they promised to prior to the last election, and we as a parliament can come together and fulfil the desire of the Australian people. The time has come to remove the carbon tax. I commend these bills to the House.

"Butler, Mark, MP",ALP,2014-07-14,"



Mr BUTLER
 (Port Adelaide) (13:23):  I appreciate the opportunity to speak again on the Clean Energy Legislation (Carbon Tax Repeal) Bill 2014 and related bills, the third time that these bills have been presented by the government to this House. We got an opportunity during the suspension of sittings to talk about why we are debating this package of bills yet again. The chaos, the dysfunction and the shambles that was the Senate process last week was a window into the dysfunction of this government, into the complete inability and incapacity this Prime Minister has to conduct his government in a calm, methodical way, undertaking serious negotiations with crossbenchers, whether in this place or in the other place. 


Leaving that aside, what these bills will do yet again by the end of the week, if the government has its way, is present Australia with the position of having no meaningful policy on climate change whatsoever. The Prime Minister, the minister and backbenchers talk about these bills terminating the carbon tax, and they do that. The Labor Party went to the election in September last year saying that it also supported the termination of the carbon tax. That is not the issue between both sides of this chamber. The issue is what replaces it, if anything. 


Our objection to these bills rests on the fact that this government intends to replace it with nothing. Not only is the carbon tax to be terminated; if these bills pass both houses, we will see no cap on carbon pollution—no discipline, no rigour whatsoever on the amount of carbon pollution produced in Australia. We will see no market mechanism whatsoever to deal with climate change. As the Leader of the Opposition said, those opposite argue that a market mechanism is the right way to stop people who are sick from going to the doctor, bringing down Medicare costs; but they will not introduce a market mechanism on climate change. We will see no legislated short-term target for carbon pollution reduction. The five per cent reduction target for 2020 will go. It will presumably, maybe, remain a slip of paper in the desk drawer of the Minister for the Environment or the Prime Minister, but there will be no legal mechanism to implement Australia's international obligations. There will certainly be no longer term target, as in the current legislation—the 2050 target that Australia signed on to, apparently with the support of the then opposition, the now government, to reduce carbon pollution by 2050. Again, there will be no such commitment by Australia anymore. 


As has been said on many, many occasions, the government seem hell-bent on destroying every single independent strong voice, whether it is on climate change or any other area of policy. They will abolish the Climate Change Authority, following the abolition of the Climate Commission. The government cannot stand the idea that there would be strong independent voices advising the parliament and, much more importantly, advising the Australian community on difficult, complex, highly contested areas of public policy—in this case, climate change.


In the very short time that remains before we move to 90-second statements, I want to talk about the Labor Party's amendments. The amendments that I intend to move during consideration in detail have been circulated. I cannot say the same thing about the government's amendments, which it has cooked up in a deal with the Palmer United Party, to indicate to business quite which sectors will be covered by the price pass-through arrangements that will be put in place for the ACCC to police. We do not know what the form of the amendments is that will enable Australian households to know which price reductions the Prime Minister talked about up hill and down dale across the country for the last three years he is willing to stand by in this parliament. The member for Sturt has come in and curtailed debate. He has curtailed and guillotined the debate that this House can have on a critically important amendment we have not even seen yet. We do not know which businesses will be covered. We do not know what price reductions the Prime Minister is willing to stand by. 


In contrast with that, the Labor Party has been steadfast in this area since before the election campaign. The amendments that I will move today, which have been circulated, are exactly the same amendments that we circulated as an exposure draft while we were still in government.  They are exactly the same amendments that I moved in December, that I moved only a few weeks ago when the government was trying on a second occasion to get these bills through the parliament. They are amendments that would move to put in place, as quickly as possible, an emissions trading scheme—the type of scheme, as the Leader of the Opposition only a short time ago said, we see in our oldest trading partners: France, the United Kingdom, Germany, many parts of North America including California and a number of the north-eastern states, and also provinces of Canada 


But perhaps more importantly, increasingly we see it in our own region. In China, the seventh emissions trading scheme started only a couple of weeks ago. In a few months time South Korea, our third-largest export partner, will start an emissions trading scheme, on 1 January 2015.


Our amendments are clear. Our position has been constant. Our position has been transparent. This government's position in this area remains utterly chaotic.

Mr WATTS
 (Gellibrand) (13:30):  I rise to speak about the Abbott government's continuing disdain for science in Australia. I recently received an open letter from the leadership of the Royal Australian Chemical Institute addressed to the Prime Minister and the Treasurer. The letter expressed concern at the impact of the Abbott government's budget on science in Australia. In particular, the letter noted the impact of the government's massive hikes in university fees and student debt costs on Australian scientists, particularly research scientists. The Royal Australian Chemical Institute notes in its letter that adding interest to student debt doubly penalises research scientists:


Research Higher Degree students already make a significant financial sacrifice by committing to a further 3-to-4 years' university education beyond their undergraduate study.


… so RHD graduates are typically in their mid-20s before they have the opportunity to earn an income appropriate to their level of training and expertise.


And they go on to say that the changes as a result:


… can only further discourage prospective RHD students from following a career path towards innovation.


It would be imperative for the minister for science to take swift action to allay the fears of these research scientists—except that of course there is no such minister under the Abbott government.


We on this side of the House take science seriously. We do not sacrifice it for the sake of political convenience. When in government Labor increased science and research funding to new record levels. There is still more to be done, however, and that is why Bill Shorten, as Labor leader, has taken on science as his special ministerial responsibility. Labor is doing this because we want to ensure that science does not lose its place among the nation's top priorities. Unlike those opposite, we will not sell out our nation's future by letting the flat-earthers in our society, including those on the benches opposite, sideline science in Australia.

Mr BUTLER
 (Port Adelaide) (15:15):  Madam Speaker, I rise to continue my remarks in this debate on the Clean Energy Legislation (Carbon Tax Repeal) Bill 2014 and related bills. Before the debate was interrupted by the 90-second statements, I was drawing attention to the claims made by the Prime Minister over the last three or four years—in his magical mystery tour around Australia in his high-vis jacket—explaining to Australians that to price carbon—to put a cap on carbon pollution—would act as a wrecking ball through the Australian economy. He got sick of that metaphor and moved to talking about 'a cobra strike' to the Australian economy. At other times, it was to be 'a python squeeze' on the Australian economy; or that cities that we have known and loved for decades would literally disappear off the Australian map—Whyalla, a city in the iron triangle in South Australia and dear to my heart, would disappear, according to the Prime Minister; Gladstone was at mortal threat of disappearing from the map of Australia as well, in spite of having a pretty healthy economy last time I visited the town. This was a series of hysterical, mendacious claims made by the now Prime Minister while he was opposition leader, seeking to undermine a response to climate change. Falsehoods and overreach characterised this prime minister's hysterical, mendacious campaign. After last week's goings-on in the Senate, we are now seeing the falsehoods, the overreach and the chaos of last week all coming together in the debate in the House today.


There has been some focus by the opposition on the cost-of-living claims made by the Prime Minister over the last three years, because he was utterly definitive about that. He was utterly definitive about what the impact of a price on carbon would be on Australian households. We tried to test him on this today, but we tried in vain because the Prime Minister refused to repeat the guarantees that he gave over the last three years about just what businesses would have to pass on; and about what price reductions to which Australian households. We asked him about his earlier claim that the carbon tax would result in a $10 increase per week to the grocery bill of average Australian households—not a figure that we can find in any report, in any piece of advice, or in any claim made by an expert or a commentator. We asked the Prime Minister to repeat that claim, and to repeat his guarantee that the passage of these repeal bills would result in grocery bills going down by $10 per week for Australian households. And he can't—of course he can't, because Woolies has confirmed that those prices did not go up in the first place! Woolworths has confirmed that, and other retailers have confirmed it as well. It was a falsehood. It was overreach. And that is why the Prime Minister would not repeat the response.


The height of the farce was the Minister for Agriculture, who should know better, trying to scare Australian households—particularly the carnivores among them—that a leg of lamb would cost $100 under the carbon tax. Well, as the member for Charlton pointed out, today a leg of lamb, 2.2 kilograms, costs around $26. We asked the Prime Minister—and maybe the Minister for Agriculture had overreached, and it had not quite reached $100 dollars; but what would be the reduction by the end of this week, if these repeal bills go through? And again, the Prime Minister chose to duck the question—because he knows it was all a farce. It was all a falsehood. It was all overreach. It was all designed to stoke this political campaign to scare Australian households about a proper climate change response. He said that the carbon tax would result in a $6,000 increase in the price of a new house. When asked to guarantee that the price of a new house would come down by $6,000, in line with the promises he made before the election—that in repealing the carbon tax, what had gone up would automatically come down—of course he ducked the question, because to do otherwise would be to mislead this parliament. First, because the price of a new house did not go up by that amount and second, because it will not come down. He was asked to repeat his guarantee that farm costs would come down by $12,000 a year—and of course, he did not repeat that guarantee because—again—to do so would be to mislead this parliament. It was a falsehood then, it is a falsehood now, and he is not able to guarantee it.


As I said in the earlier part of this debate, before the 90-second statements, it would be nice—given that the member for Sturt is seeking to curtail this debate—if the parliament actually had before it the amendment that the government and the Palmer United Party have cobbled together to deal with these issues. But none of us have been given the courtesy of even seeing the amendment, so that we can make a decision about whether it deals with the concerns that have been raised with us by Australian households—given the promises the Prime Minister made—and are being raised with us by Australian businesses. By contrast, I have already circulated the amendments that I intend to move to this bill. They are the same amendments we exposed as a draft piece of legislation before the election; the same amendments I moved in this place in December; and the same amendments I moved in this place a few weeks ago to reflect—to a T—the Labor Party's election policy: that we support the termination of the carbon tax, but only on the condition that it is replaced by a meaningful climate change policy: an emissions trading scheme.


The member for Sturt might agree that Direct Action is a meaningful climate change response, but, along with the Prime Minister and the Minister for the Environment, you are about the only three people in Australia who share that view. For 4½ years that policy has been in the marketplace, and in that time not one single expert or commentator has come out and said that Direct Action is a serious climate change policy. Not one has said that it will achieve its stated objectives. Not one has said that it is anything close to worth the billions and billions of taxpayer dollars that this government intends to dole out—on behalf of people in the gallery, people listening around Australia—to people who pollute for a living to change the way they operate and to make changes that they were probably intending to make anyway.


The problem, at the end of the day, is that this Prime Minister and this government are stuck in the past. They concocted the Direct Action policy at a particular time in history, when this Prime Minister took the temptation dangled before him by Senator Minchin to take the leadership of the party provided that he turn his back on the election commitments he made as a candidate in the seat of Warringah at the 2007 election to support an emissions trading scheme put forward by John Howard. That was an ETS that had a wider scope than the ETS that I am proposing today in our amendments. The member for Warringah turned his back on that commitment, broke the promise he made to the people of Warringah, took the temptation dangled before him by Senator Minchin to become leader of this party. At least the Treasurer had the moral fortitude to resist that temptation, to stick by his principles and say that he would not take the leadership. He knew that a market-based mechanism is the best policy response to climate change. No-one has got up and denied that speculation. Not one person has done that.


The rest of the world has moved on. The Prime Minister might be stuck in 2009, in the aftermath of the Copenhagen conference, but the rest of the world has moved on. The United States has moved on. China has moved on. South Korea is moving to put in place an emissions trading scheme in only a matter of months. China started its seventh emissions trading scheme only a few weeks ago. The older schemes in that country are trading at a higher price than those on which the Labor emissions trading scheme would trade, according to Treasury advice. These bills shall only be accepted if Labor's emissions trading scheme amendment is also accepted by this House.



The SPEAKER:  Before I call any member, I wish to advise that in his speech the honourable member for Port Adelaide said that these were the same amendments that he had moved at the end of last year—I think he said December; I think they were November. In fact, they are not. They are the amendments that I ruled as not being in conformity with the standing orders. They were subsequently moved more recently with changes that brought them into conformity, but I think it is important that the record stands corrected.

"Palmer, Clive, MP",PUP,2014-07-14,"



Mr PALMER
 (Fairfax) (15:25):  I thought it might be helpful to set out important matters that happened in and around the Australian Senate for the public interest. During last Wednesday night, Palmer United senators considered a draft amendment for the repeal of the carbon tax. The draft amendment was one the government and the Palmer United team had negotiated. Based on advice the Palmer United senate team received on Wednesday night, the position to them was clear. It was not mandatory for any savings brought about by the repeal of the carbon tax to be passed on to consumers of natural gas and electricity; our senators required that there be a mandatory pass on. This is not what the Palmer United team wanted.


If Australian families, industries and citizens are not going to receive the reduction to their electricity and natural gas bills, the Palmer United Senate team resolved that it could not, in moral conscience, vote for the repeal of the carbon tax. Palmer United took a positive approach and re-drafted the amendment to the effect of delivering reductions to electricity and natural gas, and clarified this with the government, who were supportive of that action. So, the benefit of the repeal of the carbon tax is that it would deliver a real reduction to generators of electricity and producers of natural gas and to the consumers of those commodities.


Palmer United supports the bill and the amendment that will be brought forward in the detailed consideration of the bill. The amendment to that bill—proposed today, I believe, and to be moved by the government during the detailed consideration stage later today—will allow and guarantee a reduction in electricity and gas to all Australians and to all businesses. If such changes are not passed on to consumers and enterprises, any entity not doing so will be subject to 250 per cent of the cost savings that have not been passed on to the consumers. This requirement applies only to the suppliers of natural gas and electricity or a bulk SGG importer in respect of supply of synthetic greenhouse gases. These requirements affect fewer than 100 entities in Australia but impact upon the lives of 23 million Australians, who have suffered under the carbon tax for too long a period.


We stand today on the edge of time, and destiny is ours to grab for our nation. There can be no justification to removing the carbon tax if it does not improve the lives of our citizens. We must have a mandatory requirement that the price of energy be reduced by the savings from the removal of the carbon tax, which no longer has to be paid. We must mandate that the electricity and gas costs for Australian families, single mothers and pensioners must be reduced by the abolition of the carbon tax. There must be a reduction of the costs of energy to our industries and our businesses to ensure their competitiveness and bring down the cost of production and the cost of employing people so more jobs can be created, so more Australians may find satisfaction and direction in gainful employment. The cost of running our schools, our hospitals and our institutions must benefit from lower energy costs.


There is no justification for the carbon tax. The carbon tax sets the price of carbon at a far higher price than applies to the rest of the world. It is higher than the ETS in Europe and much higher than the ETS in New Zealand. We must stand on the right side of history, and the right side of history is standing up for the Australian people, for their livelihood and for their future.


Climate change is a global problem, and it needs a global solution. Australian families cannot bear the responsibility for this matter for the whole world, when Australian trading partners fail to act and are not united on the issue. For Australia to act alone and impose a tax on carbon at this time has only placed a tax on jobs and discouraged investments. The cost of energy for all Australians shows a lack of confidence in our community for investment and growth to allow our business to employ more people and to allow economic stimulation to be undertaken.



Mr Sukkar interjecting—




Mr PALMER:
  I was a member of the party over there four years ago. I said it then. This is so we can have more economic revenue and more revenue for government. More revenue will mean more resources for the government, which will mean more hospitals, more schools and a rising standard of living.


If the day comes that our major trading partners of China, the United States of America, the European Union, Japan and Korea set up an ETS then they will know that Australia is also serious about an ETS because our senators plan to move in the Senate an ETS dependent upon our trading partners also acting in that regard. It has been said that when our trading partners set up an emissions trading scheme they will require that their trading partners, including Australia, exporting to their countries pay an emissions trading tax upon the import of those products if their governments do not have an environmental trading scheme. In these circumstances, if Australia does not have an emissions trading scheme, Australia's exporters will be paying a tax to another country instead of to Australia.


Australia needs all the revenue it can get to meet the hopes and aspirations of the people of this country and the people of the world. The world is constantly changing and our ability to adapt to change and to keep an open mind on issues which affect all of us is what really matters. It is not about the Labor way or the Liberal way; it is the right way that is important for Australia and the world.


True to our promise to the Australian people at the last election, Palmer United senators will vote in the Senate to abolish the carbon tax. In so doing, Palmer United senators will support the initiatives that the government will foreshadow later on today in the consideration in detail of the bill. Removal of the carbon tax requires that all producers of energy in this country are required by law to pass on to all consumers of energy the savings from the repeal of the carbon tax. Action by Palmer United senators will make Australian industries more competitive internationally and the lives of our people more manageable.


Carbon tax, as I have said, is an arbitrary tax. It sets a price, as we know, far above the level of the international price of carbon. It disadvantages all Australians and it must be repealed. To introduce an increase in excise and indexation is, in our view, not the answer. If New Zealand can join the international community, why can't Australia? Acting alone, Australia cannot change the world or climate change. We must not act just ourselves as an isolated island where our carbon share is less than one per cent of the world's emissions. We must think of the global situation and a global solution not just ourselves but for all our children and all the children of the world not just in our time but for all time.


Time waits for no man. The challenges we face are not easy but face them we must—and face them we can together. Climate change must have a global solution. There are moves around the world. Many countries are failing to act because they are unsure of how this issue will be dealt with by other nations. Australia has the opportunity to set the standard. We can act as a catalyst for the whole world and set a fair framework which the world can follow. In understanding climate change, we must remain ever vigilant and aware that Australia is part of an international community and, more importantly, of what the global community can do together to make the lives of those who inhabit this planet more secure. Together we can achieve the extraordinary. President Obama of the United States has shown great leadership in encouraging all countries to act on an emissions trading scheme.


In voting for the abolition of the carbon tax, Palmer United senators will move later on in the week to establish an emissions trading scheme which would only become effective once Australia's main trading partners also take action to establish such a scheme. These actions must be set based on the actions of our leading trading partners—China, the United States of America, the European Union, India, Japan and Korea. We need to ensure that the jobs and enterprises of all Australians will not be disadvantaged.


We in Palmer United encourage all members of this country to support the government in their initiative to ensure that the benefits from the abolition of the carbon tax flow on to our industries and to our people. The world will know once we act that they can be sure that Australia will respond to a global emissions trading scheme that promotes international trade and prosperity.


As John Kennedy said many years ago:


For, in the final analysis, our most basic common link is that we all inhabit this small planet. We all breathe the same air. We all cherish our children's future. And we are all mortal.


When truth triumphs over injustice everyone is a winner. The inconvenient truth is a truth that what we must face together—not alone and isolated on an island but together as a united international community that can bring about real change. 


The Palmer United Party's role in the Senate is to keep faith with the Australian people. Listening is one of the most important things we can do in this place and in the Senate. By listening we can learn from others and make changes before change changes us. As Australians we must put the interests of our people before our own individual interests and the interests of all people of the world ahead of all else.


As has been said, we need an open mind. This is called for by the need for a better mutual understanding and mutual respect. An open mind will enable us to have an objective and realistic understanding of each other. We can discover not only what divides us but what we have in common. We have more in common in the common future that binds us together. At least we can see to it that the differences will not result in clashes and confrontation. An open mind will also enable us to be more appreciative, accommodating and supportive of each other's concerns and priorities.


Despite all the talk about climate change in the world, we are still a developing world with a huge population and we still face various problems of unbalanced development, poverty and environmental degradation. We seek a better world for Australia and for all citizens of the world so that one day man can be what he was meant to be: free and independent.


The abolition of the carbon tax is the first step in allowing Australian enterprises to compete, increase exports, employ more people and, more importantly, allow Australians to pay lower electricity and gas prices and relieve some of the pressures that have been placed on families right across this nation. That is why Palmer United took a stand in the Senate—to ensure that all Australians would be dealt with fairly by the abolition of the carbon tax.

"Laundy, Craig, MP",LP,2014-07-14,"



Mr LAUNDY
 (Reid) (15:36):  I rise to my feet to talk on the amendments that the Minister for the Environment is moving. I cannot help but notice that on Monday afternoons we do not have matters of public importance debates. They are on Tuesdays and Thursdays. But, to my way of thinking, this is a matter of public importance. This is a position that was taken to the election. As much as those opposite would like to argue that they terminated the carbon tax pre-election and replaced it with an ETS, that policy was resoundingly defeated at the election. The Minister for the Environment, the Prime Minister and the government today have a solid mandate—have always had a solid mandate—to repeal this tax. 


I note that I follow the member for Fairfax, because my background is in the business world, not the political world. My point of difference with those opposite is that I understand the role this tax has played in the last six years in my electorate of Reid as it has filtered through every line item in the expenses of every P&L of every local business, and that is the part that those opposite just do not get. I exclude from that the member for Indi and the member for Fairfax, because they have run businesses. They understand that a business has a revenue side and an expense side to its P&L. They understand that, through the GFC, consumer confidence was shot to pieces. People sat on their hands and saved at six times the rate they did under the Howard government. At the same time, with the introduction of the carbon tax, you had the ratcheting up on the expense side of every line item that this fed into. Every small and medium sized business in my electorate of Reid and right throughout Australia was hit with a double whammy. 


Small and medium sized business, which we never talk about in this chamber as much as we should, employee 70 per cent of the people in this country. They have been and will always be the engine room of the economy. At a time when they needed us, we turned around and whacked them with a tax that filtered through every line in the expense side of the P&L. Traditionally when a business is hit with increasing costs it will increase its prices to maintain its margin. In accounting terms it is EBITDA. Due to this double whammy it was in the unique position where not only could it not do that; in most instances it had to decrease its prices. What do small and medium sized businesses do, as they have always done in times of controversy? They augment their business model. 


What have been missed in this chamber are the flow-on effects that this tax has had in the real world. Not enough people in this chamber come from the real world. Their background is not in business. What happened in the streets of Reid—through Auburn, through Homebush, through Flemington, through Concord, through Five Dock, through Wareemba and through Drummoyne—is that business changed the way they operated. They did it, as they have always done, in two major ways. They augmented their trading hours or, in the case of family businesses—which are the vast majority of small businesses—they increased the hours that they worked themselves, cut casual wages and started augmenting their trading hours. These things feed in. Here is the vicious circle which businesses in Reid and throughout Australia have operated in for the last six years. 


We argue about youth unemployment in this country. Everyone, on both sides, thinks this is an issue that we must confront. And they are right. But here is the kicker. Casual employment has and will always be the entree for university students and young people to find a career. In the streets of Reid it has dried up. On the western side of my electorate youth unemployment is running at 20 per cent. One in five 18- to 24-year-olds cannot find a job. Here is a light bulb moment. Why don't we get out of the expense side of the P&L of businesses and restore some profitability so that they might then put on some staff? That is what is being missed. 


Australia has been built on the back of cheap power. It has been our competitive advantage. Our pay and conditions have been derived as a result. Every 1 July, based on business profitability, we have a minimum wage increase. If businesses are not profitable, we will not get that. We are seeing that now, with real wage decreases. I cannot believe that anyone could stand up in this chamber and argue to the contrary. We need to help business, not hurt it. 


It was a breath of fresh air when the member for Mallee, in his 90-second statement, spoke of some innovative environmental businesses in his electorate. Last Friday I sat with one such business in my electorate, Suntech, at Sydney Olympic Park. They are the smarts for the Chinese solar energy business. The carbon tax is not important to them. What is important, in my humble opinion, from my commercial background, is how this will be attacked commercially. They told me that storage is the key. The University of New South Wales and the University of Queensland are leading the world in this space. 




Mr Bandt:
  You are cutting funding to ARENA!




Mr LAUNDY:
  I say to the member for Melbourne that what happens is that commercial enterprise enters the frame—not government, not legislation, not taxation and not regulation. Private enterprise enters the space. This is what we have and will continue to see. 


Vector, a power company in New Zealand, are running an amazing trial—financing techniques. No-one has even spoken about them in this chamber. In the not-too-distant future, as storage capacity and lifetime increases, we will see companies like GE and Macquarie Bank, which have entered this space in substantial quantities, offer financing packages so that the daily fee for having solar, thermal, fuel cell technology, wind—whatever it may be—will beat the price of day-to-day electricity. It is the same theory that the carbon tax and the ETS apply to but it is happening through a market mechanism that is not an ETS. 


Economists love markets; that is true. They also love textbooks. I was an economist before spending 23 years in business. I know that in the real world you do not live and operate in a textbook. Has anyone mentioned the market manipulation of the ETS program in Europe? No, they have not. It is convenient not to. How many economists would it take to change a light bulb? The answer is no answer—they pay someone to do it. They do not operate in the real world. They hire an electrician. People in the real world, the small-business operators, try to change the light bulb themselves. I just find it so frustrating. I have no doubt I will be followed by the member for Melbourne, who will espouse ideology to me. Che sera sera, because I come from the real world; I come from the world of family business.


The member for Fairfax spoke on the amendments that are being moved, and I would like to touch on those, because the Minister for the Environment spoke to those in his opening speech. The $1.1 million penalty will be included in the original bill's complementary amendments. The amendments ensure large supplies of regulated goods—electricity, natural gas, synthetic greenhouse gases. They must pass on their cost savings. They impose a penalty on electricity and natural gas suppliers equal to 250 per cent of any cost savings they do not pass on. They require electricity and natural gas retailers of bulk imports of synthetic greenhouse gases to inform the ACCC and customers of how they are passing on the cost savings.


The amendments are currently being finalised and will be moved this afternoon. But they are all aimed at one thing: getting out of the expense side of not only small, medium and big business—business irrespective of size—but getting out of the expense side of the family home. In just the same way that small business operates with budgetary constraints in mind, so do family homes. And the families in Reid have spoken loud and clear. They spoke at the election. They spoke to me in the lead-up to the election and they have spoken to me post-election. Whilst I said at the start of this speech that there is no MPI today but how important this was—and I have made comment in this chamber before that some of the behaviour here at times reminds me of kindergarten—that MPI space between 3.20 and 4.30 every afternoon reminds me a lot of kindergarten, because it is a time when fairy tales are told. It is a time when history is rewritten.


The history is clear—the history and the impost on business irrespective of size, in the electorate of Reid and right across Australia. The jury is in. Irrespective of what those opposite want to stand and argue—that yes, they are still terminating the carbon tax and want to move to an ETS—that was the policy they took to the last election. That was the policy resoundly dismissed and defeated at the last election. To argue any differently is quite simply political spin. I rise today to commend the minister and speak in support of this bill, and I look forward to the political groundhog day that we have had since 9 September last year finally coming to an end, when this is hopefully passed in the Senate, so that we can get out of the expense side of business irrespective of size and households in my electorate and right around Australia.

Ms PLIBERSEK
 (Sydney—Deputy Leader of the Opposition) (15:47):  It amazes me that as I rise to my feet today to speak on the carbon tax repeal legislation we still do not actually have a written copy of the government's amendments before us. I think that is symbolic of the chaotic way the government is handling this most important issue. I agree with the member for Reid on one thing: this is a most important issue, because we know for sure and certain, as sure as we can be, that carbon pollution is happening, that it is causing climate change. We are as sure as we can be about any scientific fact. In fact, someone recently compared it to the fact that there are still some people who would say that smoking does not cause cancer, but it is really not the sort of risk any sensible person would take. It is the same thing here.




Mr Sukkar:
  That is rubbish. That is a disgraceful argument.




Ms PLIBERSEK:
  We have some guy up there—I do not know who he is—saying that this is rubbish. The vast majority of the world's scientists agree that climate change is real, that it is being caused by humans and that it is being caused by carbon pollution. One other thing we know for sure and certain is that the cost of not acting today will be borne by future generations, and it will be borne at a much higher rate than the cost of reasonable mitigation strategies today. We are leaving for our children not just an environmental disaster but the economic cost of dealing with that environmental disaster. And we have a responsibility, not just because we as parents and grandparents consider the sort of world that we want to leave our children but because, per capita, Australians are one of the greatest emitters of carbon pollution in the world. We have a responsibility to be part of global action to reduce the risk of dangerous climate change.


Labor has always been consistent about the need to act on this. Back in the day, John Howard was also committed to action on climate change. In fact, we had both John Howard and Kevin Rudd going to the 2007 election saying that they would introduce an emissions trading scheme, because climate change is real, it is happening, and we need to do something about it. And that is what we have been working on since 2007: a real, fair dinkum scheme that will actually reduce carbon emissions over time. Our carbon pollution reduction scheme—the first one that was negotiated between Kevin Rudd as Prime Minister and Malcolm Turnbull as Leader of the Opposition back in the day—would have done that. It would have achieved that. Unfortunately the member for Wentworth, the Minister for Communications, who is actually a believer in climate change and someone who is prepared to stand by and have the courage of his convictions and not be weathervane on this issue, was defeated by just one vote by his own caucus. And the rest, as they say, is history. The Greens went on to help. The Tony-Abbott-led Liberal Party actually blocked that very important motion.




Mr Bandt:
  And you were so keen to go ahead with it and get our support!




Ms PLIBERSEK:
  We now have the Green interjecting, trying to defend the indefensible. You know that if you had agreed to that legislation we would have an emissions trading scheme in place now that would already be acting to reduce carbon pollution. We would not be having this debate today, and the member for Melbourne knows that.


We are already seeing the effects, the beginnings of climate change around the globe. We are seeing it in Australia, in extreme weather events more frequent and more extreme. The last 13 years of this century were the hottest years on record. We are seeing hotter days, higher sea levels, and more severe storms, droughts and fires. We are seeing all of that. In Australia it is costing us already, but have a thought for our neighbours as well, those Pacific Island nations that are actually making plans to remove their whole population when their nation becomes uninhabitable. Think about what is happening not just to us in Australia but also in our region.


What is even more frustrating about this debate that we are having today is that we actually have a scheme in place and it is working to reduce carbon emissions. We are the only country in the world that has a scheme that is already operating and in place, and we are turning our backs on it. We are walking away from it and we are going backwards on our scheme. We are going to that place under the stewardship of the so-called Minister for the Environment, who wrote his honours thesis about how a market mechanism would be the best way to handle climate change. We are going—




Mr Hunt:
  No, I did not.




Ms PLIBERSEK:
  You did not write your thesis on climate change and market mechanisms?




Mr Hunt:
  No, I did not. It was on market mechanisms and pollution.




Ms PLIBERSEK:
  On markets and pollution—that is good! The so-called Minister for the Environment is saying that markets are the best way to deal with pollution, but just not in the case of carbon pollution. We actually have a scheme at the moment that levies big polluters. It takes money from big polluters and uses that money for climate change mitigation, reducing the effects on families—



Mr Hunt interjecting—




Mr Sukkar:
  No, it does not. It takes money from households.




Ms PLIBERSEK:
  Mr Acting Deputy Speaker, I cannot get a sentence out with these interjections.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Craig Kelly
):  Order! The Minister for the Environment should not interject.




Ms PLIBERSEK:
  And that other guy as well.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The next time he interjects, I will happily pull him up.




Mr Sukkar:
  Do not be rattled, just look at your notes!




Ms PLIBERSEK:
  I am not rattled, I would just like to—



Mr Sukkar interjecting—




Ms PLIBERSEK:
  I do not even know who he is.



Mr Chester interjecting—




Ms PLIBERSEK:
  You don't either, do you?



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  All members in the chamber should not be interjecting.




Ms PLIBERSEK:
  We are going to be the only country in the world that is actually walking away from a scheme that is working and going to a scheme that no economist, no environmentalist and nobody else in the world actually thinks will work to effectively bring down carbon pollution and mitigate against the dangers of climate change. We now have some of our biggest trading partners all moving in one direction and we are moving back in the other direction.


Today, 39 national and 23 sub-national jurisdictions—accounting for almost a quarter of global greenhouse gas emissions—have implemented or are moving to implement carbon pricing instruments, including emissions trading schemes. We had the Treasurer earlier today talking about China. I have been to China recently, too. I spoke to the same person that he says he spoke to, who told me that they hope to move from their seven very large emissions trading pilot schemes in China at the moment to a national scheme by the end of the decade. We have got our most major trading partner, China; 39 national jurisdictions and 23 sub-national jurisdictions moving this way.


In the United States just recently, there was a very significant step towards tackling climate change with President Obama announcing a 30 per cent reduction in carbon dioxide emissions from power plants by 2030, compared with 2005 levels. Yes, he has faced domestic roadblocks from the Tea Party mates of those opposite, but he is moving around those to implement strict new carbon dioxide emissions caps on power plants in the United States. That comes on top of the 2011 strict fuel efficiency standards for new vehicles and the other measures, like last year's Environmental Protection Agency declaration that new coal-fired plants may not emit more than 1,100 pounds of carbon dioxide per megawatt hour, which has the effect of the ending the building of new dirty coal-fired power stations in the United States.


There are very significant moves from our major trading partners. When you are talking about our major trading partners, it is not just China and the United States. Look at the government's conservative friends in the United Kingdom and in Germany. When the Prime Minister was in 'Canadia' earlier this year, he said:


There is no sign that trading schemes are increasingly being adopted. If anything trading schemes are being discarded not adopted.


Yet, his own friends—conservative governments in the United Kingdom and Germany—are amongst those in the forefront of adopting strict and successful programs to reduce carbon emissions.


Emissions trading schemes are in place across Europe, as I said earlier, and in some states of the United States, in Canada, in New Zealand, in Australia and in Japan. South Korea will have a scheme beginning in 2015—so the beginning of next year—which is legislated already. In these places it is not just a nutty left-wing conspiracy to destroy the industrial state, as the Prime Minister seems to imply at times. You actually have conservatives like Lord Deben in the UK calling our move away from an emissions trading scheme 'reckless'. He said it was 'deeply shaming'. He said:


It’s a … deeply retrograde step … There has been a notable reduction in emissions and businesses have not found it to be the imposition that they said it would be.


This is a man who served in Margaret Thatcher's government. This is no radical. He is a man who served in Margaret Thatcher's government.


We had the US Secretary of the Treasury, Henry Paulson, saying last month that Australia would be making a huge mistake in dropping the ETS. Again, he is no radical. We have had more Australian economists than I could poke a stick at saying the same. AMP Capital's chief economist, Shane Oliver, said:


… it was hard to say the carbon tax had had any negative macro–economic impacts on Australia such as on growth and employment.


Ross Garnaut has said in a newly published interview today that:


There’s no doubt that Australia is out of step. First of all, out of step for not dealing more strongly with the issue of climate change—you can reduce emissions and play your full part in an international effort without a market-based mechanism, it’s just that the alternatives are more expensive, more difficult, and less certain to deliver good results than an emissions trading scheme or broadly based carbon pricing in other forms.


Across the world we have major economies, major trading partners, moving in one direction and we are moving from that place backwards. We are retreating from action on climate change.


The benefit of an emissions trading scheme is that you put in place a cap on carbon pollution and then people trade within that cap to find the least-cost way of remaining under it. Even if those opposite do not believe what the vast majority of scientists around the world believe, why do they think it is a bad thing to reduce air pollution in Australia? Can anyone explain to me why we do not let people dump whatever they want in rivers, why we do not let people dump whatever they want on the side of the street, and yet we do not want to limit the carbon pollution we are putting into the atmosphere? I have never heard from those opposite why it is a bad idea to limit the amount of pollution going into our atmosphere.


I said earlier that this is a scheme that is working. In the very short time that this scheme has been in place, Australia's wind capacity has trebled. More than a million households have had solar panels installed, up from fewer than 7,500 under Prime Minister Howard. Employment in the renewable energy industry has more than doubled, to over 24,000 people. Has there been the python squeeze; has it wiped Whyalla off the map; has it led to $100 legs of lamb? None of the disastrous predictions have come true. In fact, 160,000 jobs were created in the first year. The economy continued to grow at 2½ per cent, and inflation remained low. Pollution in the National Electricity Market decreased by seven per cent, and renewable power generation as a share of the National Electricity Market increased by 25 per cent. We have a scheme that is working, and we should move to the next phase of that scheme—a proper emissions trading scheme with a floating price—but we do need to take real action on reducing carbon pollution because the environmental and economic debt we are leaving our children through inaction is completely unacceptable.

"Wicks, Lucy, MP",LP,2014-07-14,"



Mrs WICKS
 (Robertson) (16:02):  I am pleased to rise in support of the carbon tax repeal legislation, because the repeal of the carbon tax is a core commitment that we made to the people of my electorate of Robertson in the lead-up to the last election. Day after day, month after month and for more than a year prior to September 2013 I spoke with tens of thousands of people in my electorate who told me emphatically that they did not want a carbon tax. We had signatures from thousands of people who were prepared to put their name to a petition to see this toxic tax axed. I met with people in their homes in Green Point, Point Frederick, East Gosford, Kariong and Point Clare; in cafes at Erina, Woy Woy, Gosford and Terrigal; on street corners at Umina, Avoca Beach and Kincumber; and in people's local businesses right across the coast. The overwhelming response from people on the Central Coast was that they did not want a carbon tax—a carbon tax that before the 2010 election we were told would not be implemented. But after the election, all of a sudden, it was. The people on the Central Coast told me that the overwhelming reason for their determination to see the carbon tax scrapped was the impact on their cost of living, especially their electricity and gas bills, and the impact on jobs. The cost of living and the need for more local jobs in my electorate are two important concerns and today I am proud to stand in this chamber and say to the people of my electorate that through these bills the coalition government will lower your bills.


I will never forget the stories of some of the householders I spoke with following the implementation of this toxic tax. A nurse I spoke with at Woy Woy was concerned about the wellbeing of her 80-something-year-old mother, who was refusing to turn on the heater at night in the middle of winter because she could not afford the electricity bills. There was the retired gentleman I doorknocked in Umina who spoke of his concern that, should the cost of electricity continue to rise, he would be forced to consider selling his home just to pay his bills. Pensioners are crying out for the carbon tax to be scrapped, and I am pleased to note that age pensioners will significantly benefit from the carbon tax being scrapped—they will keep the Clean Energy Supplement and, furthermore, the pension will continue to increase twice a year as it always has.


I will always remember the story of a local business on the peninsula who told me they were forced to choose between paying the carbon tax on their electricity bill or letting go one of their part-time or casual workers. Such is the impact of this tax. That is why we are committed to abolishing the carbon tax and why we will not stop until that is done—this government takes its election commitments seriously. Our commitments reflect what the Australian people voted for—what people on the Central Coast voted for—and our absolute awareness of this $550 a year hit on households. It is not just a hit on households; it is also a massive hit on local businesses. Central Coast New South Wales Business Chamber Regional Manager Daniel Farmer told me that the carbon tax simply is not fair. He said that small business is the backbone of the Central Coast's economy, and it is not fair for them to have to pay increased costs for services such as electricity, distribution and resources. I have heard Daniel describe the carbon tax several times as a slap in the face and yet another surcharge that small businesses are forced to pay. The President of the Peninsula Chamber of Commerce, Matthew Wales, told me that his chamber has always endorsed abolishing the carbon tax because it has a direct impact on electricity prices which in turn affect small businesses and their competitiveness in the market place. This is particularly important on the peninsula, where a majority of businesses are small and medium enterprises.


The owner of Starship Cruises, based in Gosford, Alan Draper said his maintenance costs are soaring because the cost of producing parts and even the cost of servicing has gone up, thanks to the impact of higher electricity costs for businesses and manufacturing industry since the implementation of the carbon tax. Another local business owner, Beau Woodley, who owns Central Coast Plastering Service, has described the increase in cost to buy the materials he needs as 'dramatic'. Mr Woodley already has significant running costs, and the carbon tax has become a burden. In his words, he will rest easier at night once the carbon tax has gone. The owner of a business in West Gosford, Packaging Plus, Greg Howell, told me that electricity bills have significantly increased since the introduction of the carbon tax. It is now more expensive to run his business and he too wants this toxic tax gone. The impact of the carbon tax is also being felt by local real estate agents. Kerrie Ryan, the owner of Ray White at Killcare is apprehensive about future annual increases in the carbon tax and how this will affect bills—that is, unless we scrap the tax. This is why I am so pleased to support the carbon tax repeal legislation now before the House.


Labor's carbon tax has already caused $15.4 billion worth of damage to the Australian economy in its first two years of operation. And, as Kerrie Ryan from Ray White Killcare feared, from this month the carbon tax is expected to rise by more than five per cent from $24.15 to $25.40 per tonne. This hike will put even more pressure on families and businesses. The carbon tax means higher electricity prices, more jobs at risk and damage to Australia's international competitiveness. What is worse is that members on the opposite side know this. Even though they know this, the former Member for Robertson—now a Labor senator in the other place—has voted to keep the carbon tax, despite all the evidence to the contrary that the people of the Central Coast want it scrapped. Labor has another chance to support for repeal of the carbon tax and vote in favour of lower electricity prices for Australian families. Today I call on Labor to stop standing in the way of much needed relief for families on the Central Coast.


Treasury modelling has shown that the removal of the carbon tax in 2014-15 will reduce average costs for households by around $550 a year. It is estimated that retail electricity should be around nine per cent lower and retail gas prices around seven per cent lower. On this basis, a household's average electricity bills will be around $200 lower than they otherwise would be and average gas bills will be around $70 lower. The termination of the carbon tax will reduce the consumer price index by around 0.7 percentage points. And business compliance costs are expected to fall by around $87.6 million per annum as a consequence of repealing the carbon tax.


The question people have been asking me over the past few months, and particularly over the last couple of weeks, when I am out and about buying a coffee in Gosford, or speaking with small businesses in Umina, or greeting commuters at Woy Woy station, or having a cup of tea or coffee with local residents at one of the regular community morning teas that we hold across my electorate—in Copacobana, Tascott, Terrigal or Ettalong—is always the same: 'Why won't Labor get out of the way?' The carbon tax just does not do what Labor and the Greens claimed it would do. In its first year, the carbon tax raised $7.6 billion but emissions were almost unchanged. Looking ahead, domestic emissions are projected not to fall, as those on the other side of the House claim as the reason they are clinging to this toxic tax, but in actual fact to rise to rise under the carbon tax—from 560 million tonnes in 2010 to 621 million tonnes in 2020.


This is a tax that impacts on the lowest income earners in our society, but it does not do the job it was supposed to do. The coalition government has a plan and is firmly committed to reducing Australia's emissions. We are determined to meet our target of being at five per cent below 2000 levels by 2020. To achieve this, our Direct Action program will see us plant more trees, capture more carbon in soils and clean up power stations. We are proposing to invest some $2.5 billion in practical measures to help the environment and not to harm our economy in the process.


I have been out on the ground in places like Copacabana, Macmasters Beach and Erina Creek, working with local community groups to help clean up our environment. Some of these areas may benefit under the coalition's Green Army program. The Green Army will be Australia's largest-ever team supporting environmental action across the country, building to 15,000 young Australians by 2018. I do not support the carbon tax because it has done nothing to help our environment, but it has done a lot to hurt our economy. It has resulted in a tax that reaches deep into the pockets of families on the Central Coast and takes out $550 a year. It is a direct hit on local businesses and it is a hit on local jobs and local job opportunities on the Central Coast.


When the carbon tax is scrapped, the price for groceries, for household items and for services should also fall because the price of power is embedded in every price in our economy. When the price of power comes down, the ACCC will be ready to ensure that these price cuts are passed on. I support the carbon tax repeal legislation because people in my electorate of Robertson are demanding that we scrap the carbon tax. These amendments, and I understand they have been circulated, will ensure there is no doubt as to what they cover—gas, electricity and synthetic greenhouse gas bulk importers. In addition to the $1.1 million penalty in the original bills, some complementary amendments will be included. As the Minister for the Environment outlined in the House earlier in this debate, the amendments are designed to ensure large suppliers of regulated goods, electricity, natural gas and synthetic greenhouse gases must pass on all cost savings. They will impose a penalty on electricity and natural gas suppliers equal to 250 per cent of any cost savings they do not pass on. They require electricity and natural gas retailers and bulk importers of synthetic greenhouse gases to inform the ACCC and customers about how they are passing on cost savings. Businesses should be able to explain to customers how changes in their costs are flowing through to changes in their prices. The government is aware that major electricity and gas retailers are already committed to providing this information to households and businesses on bills, inserts and websites.


In conclusion, I restate that this government is determined to repeal the carbon tax. Every day the carbon tax stays in place costs Australians $11 million on their power bills. We are voting to scrap the carbon tax because that is the best way to take pressure off families, particularly families on the Central Coast, as well as help the economy. I commend these bills to the House.

"Bandt, Adam, MP",AG,2014-07-14,"



Mr BANDT
 (Melbourne) (16:15):  This is parliament's asbestos moment. This is parliament's tobacco moment. This is the moment when we have all the facts at our fingertips and have to make a decision about whether to act. When we look back on this moment, we will see this as the point when we knew that the way we had been doing things was no longer sustainable. This is the point when we decide whether we let the large companies that are making a lot of money out of hurting people and hurting the planet keep going—or whether we do the right thing by the community and by our children.


Australia for many years has been powered by coal. Our electricity networks are really a series of copper lines out to coalmines. This has been the story for a good part of two centuries—not because a group of people sat around and worked out how they could do the most damage to the society. It happened because for many years we here in Australia thought, as did the rest of the world, that you could dig up coal and burn it for free. We thought that it was, to use the terminology of the last century—still repeated by this government—a 'cheap source of energy'. 


But what we are realising—what we have now known for at least a couple of decades and probably longer—is that, when you dig up fossil fuels and burn them, you put pollution into the atmosphere. It is basic physics. When you put pollution into the atmosphere, if you do it on a worldwide scale and if you do it long enough, you start to change the planet's temperature. The greenhouse effect, as it used to be called, kicks in. We have been put on notice that, as surely as night follows day, if we keep burning fossil fuels,, we will heat the planet up. What is incontrovertible is that, since the beginning of the industrial era, we collectively as a species, despite all the amazing things we have done, have heated the planet by about 0.8 of a degree. What we also know—because the scientists have been telling us until they reach the point of despair—is that, even if we turned off all pollution in the world tomorrow, lags in the climate system mean that we will still have heated up the planet by about another 0.7 or 0.8 of a degree, so we are up to close to about 1.6 degrees. 


That 1.6 degrees might not sound like a lot, but the thing is that the planet is not like this room, where you can turn the thermostat up and down and adjust the temperature. The planet is more like the human body, where you have a narrow range of temperatures within which your body can be safe. If your body gets too hot or too cold, the doctor might not be able to tell you exactly which organ will fail and might not be able to tell you exactly how sick you will get, but any doctor will tell you that you do not want to go there and that you want to stay within the safe range. The planet has a safe range and the scientists, again, have been telling us until they are blue in the face that we cannot heat this planet by more than about two degrees without running the risk of runaway climate change—and that means that things might start happening that we can no longer control.


In the Arctic, for example, not only will the ice sheet start melting faster but feedback loops may kick in. If you shrink the expanse of white, resulting in more dark space, more heat will be absorbed from the sun—because white surfaces reflect light energy while dark surfaces absorb it and heat up. That means the ocean will heat up and the ice will melt even quicker—and so the feedback loop kicks in. The scientists tell us that we may not be able to stop these kinds of feedback loops and that, if we want a better than even chance of staying safe, we should stay below the two-degree guardrail. 


As I have just said, however, we know that we are already at about 1.6 or 1.7 degrees of warming. That means that the decisions we make within the next couple of decades are crucial. That is why the Climate Commission called this 'the critical decade'. They are saying that it is not free to pollute—fossil fuels are not a cheap source of energy. It comes at a massive cost to the planet and to the people on the planet. 


You have two choices when faced with that. You either say to the big polluters in this country and elsewhere, 'We are now going to make you pay for the cost, or at least part of the cost, of the pollution you are putting into the atmosphere that affects our health and affects our way of life.' That is the approach that currently exists. The alternative is to do what the government is proposing, which is to say, 'Tell you what: instead of the big polluters paying the government and the government giving half that money to households, we will make households pay—so we can give money to the big polluters to keep on polluting.' That is the absurd choice we are being faced with with this set of bills that the government wants to rush through this parliament today. After the election in 2010, we the Greens were in the position to secure action on global warming. Working together with the then Labor government and other members of the crossbench, we put a price on pollution. In addition, we secured things that had never been secured before in this country—a Clean Energy Finance Corporation that would put $10 billion into cleaner, renewable energy in this country, so that Australia could become a renewable energy powerhouse and would have something to sell to the rest of the world in 15 years time that was not just coal and gas, but was clean energy technology.


We secured ARENA—$3 billion to go into early stage research and development for solar and wind farms around this country—and we secured the Climate Change Authority, which would give this government independent advice about just how quickly we needed to act on global warming if we want to preserve the Australian way of life. Those things had never before been put on the table by any political party other than the Greens, and we secured them in 2010. I thank the previous Labor government for delivering on that, and I thank the members of the crossbench for working to deliver on that, because we did something that had not been done before. We had conservative country independents, progressive city independents, the Greens and Labor all on the same page, informed by experts and coming up with a way of putting a price on pollution and then putting the money into compensation for households and into developing clean energy in this country.


We are now at the point where it looks like some of that is going to go, but it also looks like some of it is going to stay. In that respect I want to note the Palmer United Party senators, who have agreed to keep those gains secured by the Greens—ARENA, the CEFC, the Climate Change Authority, and also the securing of the renewable energy target. That is very, very important; and I thank them for that. But I say to everyone in this chamber that there are two types of denial about climate change. There is denying the science, which is what our Prime Minister and most of this government is famous for. Then there is the denying of the consequences of the science. The thing about believing in climate change is that you cannot be half pregnant. Once you accept that global warming is real, then it means that we have to act—we have to act now if we want to make sure that we preserve the Australian way of life for the rest of us in this country, and everyone who comes after us. In that respect I say to Labor, to the extent that this forces you to go back to the drawing board: please break your bipartisan agreement with the coalition for an appalling five per cent emissions reduction—that is a death sentence. If you go to the next election saying that a five per cent cut in pollution is enough, you will be condemned, just as the coalition is being condemned.


The reality at the moment is that we have a government that is saying the science of climate change is 'absolute crap' and people can keep on polluting in the way they have been, and that has a five per cent emissions reduction target that is not even legally binding. You know it is not legally binding, and the Minister for the Environment knows it is not legally binding, because the government has said that if the money runs out they will not keep spending to reach five per cent—or happily we will reach three or four per cent, maybe. We know that in the face of that coming from this government, the two biggest threats to the Australian way of life are global warming and Tony Abbott, the Prime Minister. This Prime Minister is writing this country a prescription for more bushfires happening more often, more intense weather events, and more heatwaves.


I do not know about you, but I do not want to go on every Christmas holiday worrying about where the next bushfire is going to hit, or worrying about how many people are going to die from the heatwaves. But what we know—because the scientists employed by the government have told us over and over again—is that in Victoria, for example, unless we get global warming under control, we can expect to see something like the Black Saturday bushfires happening, on average, every two years. They tell us that Melbourne's climate will become like Cowra, and that they cannot find an analogous place on earth to describe what Darwin will be like under four degrees of warming, because that is what is in store.


We are doing this a very short period of time after scientists have also told us that they fear the West Antarctic ice sheet may be irreversibly melting. Faced with the biggest-ever threat to our way of life, our Prime Minister chooses a policy of appeasement. This is an appeasing government that is selling out our future and is one of the biggest threats to our way of life that we have seen. Ronald Reagan—hardly someone I quote often—said that the first duty of every government is to protect its people, but Tony Abbott, the Prime Minister, is failing in that duty, because he is giving Australians a prescription for a worse way of life.


In the summer accompanying the Black Saturday bushfires, more people died from the heatwaves than died in the bushfires themselves, and that is what we know is in store for us here in Australia. The vulnerable, the poor, the elderly—those who cannot afford to fit out their houses with air conditioning in the same way that others might be able to and whose health is already frail—are the ones who are going to suffer the most, thanks to this government. In recognition of the fact that, if we are to accept the science of climate change, we also have to accept the consequences of that science, I move the following amendment. I move:


That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:


""the House declines to give the bill a second reading and:


(1) notes that:


(a) the world is on track for 4 degrees of warming; and


(b) warming of less than 1 degree is already intensifying extreme -weather events in Australia and around the world with enormous costs to life and property; and


(2) calls on the Government to:


(a) protect the Australian people and environment from climate change by approving no new coal mines or extensions of existing mines, or new coal export terminals; and


(b) adopt a trajectory of 40-60% below 2000 levels by 2030 and net carbon zero by 2050 emissions reduction target in global negotiations for a 2015 treaty.""


In the last minute and a half, I want to talk about how, as many people would know, the science of climate change led me to quit my job and start running in elections. It was the understanding that we have a decade or two to turn the ship around or else we are in serious trouble, the understanding that global warming is already influencing the extreme weather that we are seeing, the understanding that we have just experienced the hottest year, the hottest month and the hottest day on record and the understanding that if you are under 30 in this world you have never experienced a March that is cooler than the average March or a January that is cooler than the average January. In other words, if you are under 30, you have never experienced a cooler than average month on this planet. It was in light of all of that that I started running in elections and got involved in politics. 


I feel incredibly proud to have achieved the laws that we are debating here today, some of which may be repealed but some of which may be kept. But this is not about me or really about any of us in here; it is about the rest of the country and all of those who are coming after us and whether we are prepared to be the next James Hardie or the next British American Tobacco— (Time expired)

"Wilkie, Andrew, MP",Ind.,2014-07-14,"



Mr WILKIE
 (Denison) (16:30):  I second the amendment moved by my colleague the member for Melbourne. I commend the member for Melbourne on his unflinching commitment to keep the pressure up in this place to do something about climate change. I urge the members of this House to embrace the amendment, because to do otherwise would be madness. Frankly, it is madness to be wanting to wind back strong action on climate change. It is madness to be wanting to take the price off carbon. I just do not get it. I do not see why the government is wanting to act in this way for any reason other than its political self-interest and trying to score political points in an important area of public policy. That can be the only explanation for the behaviour of this government, because every other way that you might approach the challenge in this area of public policy you reach the same conclusion. When you approach this issue from any other direction, you reach the conclusion that we must act on climate change and this includes first and foremost putting a price on carbon and keeping a price on carbon. This will ensure that the price on carbon sends a very strong signal to the markets that companies which pollute must clean up their act and a strong signal to consumers to stay away from products that are more expensive because they are based on polluting the climate and, instead, to go towards products and services that are cheaper because they are based on production techniques and ways of doing things that are better for the environment. 


I think one of the problems is that too many members on that side of the chamber, too many members of the government, will not admit—some will admit and others will not, although I suspect many of them admit it in their private conversations with their constituents—that they do not believe in climate change. They need to admit it: they are deniers. They do not believe that mankind is making the environment more dirty and that, because of it, we are helping to change the climate. Yes, the climate has changed over millennia for all sorts of reasons, but surely there can be no doubt that, in 2014, it is the behaviour of human kind that is accelerating the change in climate in bad and dangerous ways. 


The member for Melbourne has eloquently talked about extreme weather events and the fact that it is only a matter of time before catastrophic bushfires will be regular events, perhaps every couple of years. Yes, with some of the effects of climate change, a rich, lucky and fortunate country like Australia will be able to adapt but what about less developed countries, less rich countries—countries in our region? They do not have the riches and the know-how that we have. We could move entire cities if we had to; but they cannot. They will die—and they will die in droves—from the effects of climate change. Because of the effects of climate change and its cost to us in Australia, we have to do something about it. But perhaps a greater moral imperative is to do something about it so as to help those less fortunate people than ourselves, who are less well equipped to do something about climate change. 


I do not get why so many members of the government just do not believe in climate change. There is an overwhelming consensus amongst the very best minds in the world that the climate is changing on account of human kind and that we must change the way we do business. Members of the government do not seem to understand that this is not just a problem now. In some ways, the bigger problem will be in the future and the world that we will leave to our children, their children and their children. In fact, climate change is one of the most dramatic examples of intergenerational social injustice that you could possibly comprehend. What right do we have? We have no right to leave the world knowingly in a worse state than when we found it. As the father of a seven-year-old and a five-year-old, I want to be able to look them in the eye—and I cannot fathom why members of the government are not wanting to look their children and their grandchildren in the eye; surely, they want to look them in the eye—and say: 'When push came to shove and we had the opportunity in this place to do something about climate change, we did something. We acted.' How are the members of the government going to look their kids and grand-kids in the eye and say that they were the government that took the price off carbon and left it to future generations to deal with the problems of climate change—and a greater problem it will be. 


We must take a leadership position in this place and make the tough decisions. We as a nation must take a leadership position on the global stage. While the percentage of global pollution that comes from Australia is but a proportion of global pollution, it would not even matter if it were zero pollution: there would still be the moral imperative for us to take a leadership role on the global stage. 


I do not know what Robert Menzies would think about what has happened to the Liberal Party, and I will associate the Country Party, now The Nationals, with that comment. Even if you did not agree with the Liberal Party of the Menzies era, it was still a great party. There might have been policies which people disagreed with, but it was still a great party. What has the Liberal Party now become? It is the party of invading Iraq and of sending asylum seekers back to the authorities from which they claim to be fleeing. It is now the party that would dismantle the monumental reform of the 43rd Parliament to put a price on carbon—and a monumental and difficult reform it was. History will show that the decision by the 43rd Parliament to put a price on carbon was one of the greatest political achievements of any government in any parliament since Federation. So too will history record that in removing the price on carbon the government in the 44th Parliament made one of the greatest blunders of any government.


There is a lot of talk in here about the economy. How about we start talking about the environment? How about we start talking about society? How about we start talking about the public interest and the interests of our kids, their kids and those who will follow them? If we started talking about the environment, about the community and about the future for our kids, maybe people in this place would have a different response, instead of just talking just about the economy. Yes, it does cost to make the world a better place. That is a cost that we should be prepared to pay. What right do we have to say that the price is too much now but will not be too much for our kids in the future? We do not have that right, particularly when the costs we are leaving our kids will be so much greater at a time of unknown economic circumstances. We do not know what capacity they will have to pay the bill we are going to leave them. They may have much reduced capacity to pay the bill we are leaving them. We have no right to leave them that bill, because we and the people who came before us ran up this tab. We have a moral obligation to pay the bill now and pay it while it is affordable. And it is affordable. Yes, we are looking at a system that sends price signals and makes some things more expensive. I am not going to shy away from that; I am not going to dodge that. That is the whole point of putting a price on carbon—making dirty things dearer, making clean things cheaper, steering businesses towards doing things more cleanly, steering consumers towards buying things that are produced more cleanly. Yes, electricity and gas become a little bit dearer. It is no wonder, then, that we are seeing so much movement towards renewables, technologies that are becoming cheaper. That is the whole point. We should be celebrating, not demonising, the achievements of the 43rd Parliament. We really should be.


Where does this leave our senators? I have nothing personal against the Liberal or Palmer United senators for Tasmania. They are all good people in their own way. But I disagree with them on this; I disagree with them very, very strongly. In doing away with the price on carbon, Tasmanian senators are not acting in my state's best interest. It is well remarked upon by now that doing away with the price on carbon will cost Hydro in my state $70 billion a year and hundreds of jobs. That is a fact. Do not look at me with a funny, quizzical look, Member for Corangamite. It is a fact. Getting rid of the carbon price will cost my state dearly. This is another good example of where senators need to stand up for their state and not let their chain be yanked by their political party. If the Liberal and Palmer United Party senators stood up for Tasmania, then all 12 senators—Liberal, Palmer, Labor and the Greens—would be voting against the repeal of a price on carbon. But they will not. They will allow their chains to be yanked by their party masters. That is a serious failure of the Senate.


I have been very, very alarmed in recent days to hear and see the comments of some corporations in this country that they will not pass on any reduction in price from the abolition of the price on carbon. I read just yesterday that Qantas and Jetstar are saying that there will be no price reduction. Heavens! They were some of the first companies to say that the price would go through the roof. They had better pass on any savings that come from the abolition of a price on carbon. A comment was made in question time that, I think it was, Woolworths was saying that there was no real extra cost then, so there will not be any reductions in prices now. That had better not be the case, because I will be out the front on the barricades steering consumers towards those companies that act honestly and ethically and do genuinely pass on any reductions in price coming from the abolition of the price on carbon. Let the market judge those companies that do not pass on any reductions in prices coming from these developments. To that end, the Palmer United Party attempt to at least hold some companies to account is in principle a good idea. I hope, Minister, that the government will keep a close eye on all operators in the market to ensure that they all genuinely pass on to the consumer any reduction in the cost of production.


This is a very, very sad day in this place. It is a repeat of the very sad day we had when this legislation went through the House previously. It all comes down to crass politics. There are enough good men and women in the government, people of sharp mind and good heart, who understand the importance of putting a price on carbon not just for the environment but for the community, for our kids and for the economy, because it will help prepare us for the future global economy, because all our trading partners are moving or have moved to put a price on carbon.


It disappoints me greatly that they are prepared to put the delivery of a three-word slogan during an election campaign and what was ultimately just a strategy to destruct the previous government ahead of the public interest, ahead of the economy and certainly ahead of the environment. That is a terrible failure of governments in this country, that any party would be prepared to do that.


Again, I make the point: I just do not get it. I do not know why people would do that. I do not know why people would not understand the science. But what about those who do understand science? As a speaker made the point earlier, even if they do not believe the science about climate change, surely they understand that it is a good idea to help clean up the environment? I think it was the member for Sydney who said that we do not let people put sludge in the river or drop litter by the roadside so why is it okay to pump pollution into the atmosphere? Why can we not put politics aside for a moment? I do not get it, other than to understand that in this area of public policy this government is failing us terribly. And let the record show that. Let the record show for a long time to come which government and which members voted to put a price on carbon. And that the record show which members are now working to overturn it.


At least I will be able, and I know that the member for Melbourne will be able, to look at the next generation in the eye—




Ms MacTiernan:
  As will we!




Mr WILKIE:
  And the members of the Labor Party, and good on you! The Labor Party has been  good on this, and I applaud them. I do not applaud them for everything but I will certainly applaud them for this.


At least we can look our kids and their kids in the eye and we can see that when the pressure was on we did the right thing.

Ms HENDERSON
 (Corangamite) (16:46):  I rise to speak on the Clean Energy Legislation (Carbon Tax Repeal) Bill 2014 and related bills this afternoon. We, as a government, are determined to repeal the carbon tax. In my electorate of Corangamite, throughout the Geelong region and across our nation, this is an insidious tax. It is a tax on jobs, a tax on agriculture and, particularly, a tax on manufacturing. The carbon tax represents a $1.1 billion-hit on manufacturing each and every year. So far, the carbon tax has cost our nation some $15.4 billion over two years. I refer to the contribution that we have just heard in the House made by the member for Denison. He did express concern about the cost on our children and our grandchildren. I say to the member for Denison and I say to those opposite: we are concerned about the cost that this tax is causing to our economy. We are concerned about the way in which the previous Labor government drove up the debt and the deficit. We are adamant that as a government we are determined to wind back and to tackle the irresponsible spending under the previous government.




Mr Bandt:
  This raises money!




Ms HENDERSON:
  You can sit there and laugh, member for Melbourne! You think it is funny! But it is not funny—the cost of living for many people in my electorate and across the nation is a really serious issue. As we have spoken about today and for many days since our election, and before that, the carbon tax is costing every family $550 a year on average. That is no laughing matter, because for many people in my electorate and across the nation a nine per cent increase in electricity and a seven per cent increase in gas actually mean a lot.


It actually makes a big difference for low-income households. It actually means that elderly people—the vulnerable—are sitting there not knowing whether to turn the heater on or off because of the cost of their power. This may be a laughing matter to you but for many people the cost of living is a really serious issue. In my electorate it is a particularly serious issue, given some of the—




Mr Wilkie:
  Mr Acting Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I was definitely not laughing; I had a most serious look on my face. I would be appalled if anyone listening to that speech or reading the Hansard would think that I would laugh at that! These are very serious matters.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Vasta
):  I thank the member for Denison. The member for Corangamite has the call.




Ms HENDERSON:
  Members opposite have spoken about the compensation package they offered when in government—a compensation package that we are keeping—




Mr Wilkie:
  Mr Acting Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I would be grateful if the member for Corangamite withdrew that comment about me laughing. I was not laughing.




Ms HENDERSON:
  Mr Acting Deputy Speaker, I will not withdraw that comment because the member for Denison was laughing. I am sorry, that is not a correct—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member for Corangamite has the call. She will be heard in silence. There will be no points of order. Let the member for Corangamite finish her speech, please.




Ms HENDERSON:
  We have heard today members opposite talking about the compensation package offered when in government—




Mr Wilkie:
  That was a bold-faced lie!



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member for Denison has other means of addressing that, not in the middle of her speech.




Ms HENDERSON:
  This is a compensation package that we are keeping whilst repealing the carbon tax. But one of the many flaws with Labours carbon tax was that it forgot small business. It forgot about the costs imposed on small business through higher electricity and gas prices—butchers, bakers, grocers. Of course, let's face it, Labor forgot about small business generally—519,000 jobs were lost in small business over the six years that Labor was in power.


It forgot about our manufacturers, as I mentioned. There was a $1.1 billion-hit on manufacturing. In my electorate of Corangamite just consider the case of Boral, then—now known as Blue Circle Southern Cement in Waurn Ponds. Under the previous Labor government 90 people at Boral lost their jobs. While there were various cost pressures on Boral, the carbon tax ensured that Boral was less competitive on the international market. The cost of making clinker was driven higher by some 18 per cent because of the carbon tax, and now we see Blue Circle Southern Cement importing clinker and only 20 or so employees remaining at this production facility.


Labor also forgot about our farmers, and particularly our dairy farmers. Let's look at the cost imposed on dairying as a result of the carbon tax. It has driven up the cost of power for our dairy farmers by between $5,000 and $7,000 a year. Many of the dairy farmers in my electorate and across south-west Victoria simply cannot afford that cost hike and that has placed real pressures on such an important industry. Labor forgot about the likes of Bulla ice-cream, one of Colac's most successful local manufacturers. It forgot about the likes of Murray Goulburn, which is currently paying $14 million a year in carbon tax, and Fonterra, which is paying a carbon tax bill of around $7 million a year. I note that some 130 people lost their jobs at Fonterra just outside Colac about 18 months ago.


Let us not forget what Labor's policy is. If Labor was still in power, we would have seen a carbon tax on diesel fuel which would see the cost of off-road diesel rise by 6.5c a litre. That would be a direct hit on mining and manufacturing. Again, that is bad for business, it is bad for jobs and it is bad for our international competitiveness.


In question time today we heard from the member for Port Adelaide, who boasted about how he had terminated the carbon tax—how Labor had terminated the carbon tax and, as a result of doing that, they were going to be addressing cost of living pressures on ordinary Australian families. This is a great example of Labor saying one thing before the election and another, entirely different, thing after the election. Time and time again we see members opposite supporting the carbon tax. This is hypocrisy at its very worst.


It was disappointing to hear from the member for Melbourne today and some of his rhetoric in portraying our party as one that does not believe in climate change.




Mr Watts:
  You don't!




Ms HENDERSON:
  This is fundamentally untrue.




Mr Watts:
  Is it absolute crap?




Ms HENDERSON:
  The coalition government has a very strong commitment to combating climate change. There is a strong commitment to renewable energy.



Opposition members interjecting—




Ms HENDERSON:
  There, again, we see laughter—




Mr Watts:
  We're laughing at you!




Ms HENDERSON:
  from the member from Melbourne. It really is disappointing.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Order! The member for Corangamite has the call.




Ms HENDERSON:
  It was actually the coalition under John Howard that introduced the renewable energy target which has done so much to drive investment in renewable energy. We are very proud of what we have done, but there is a better way than a jobs-destroying carbon tax. I want particularly to make reference to what we are doing to drive down carbon emissions.


We have a very strong commitment to reduce carbon emissions by five per cent below 2000 levels by the year 2020. The government will reach its target through direct action with the Emissions Reduction Fund as its centrepiece. Our plan is to efficiently and effectively source low-cost emissions reduction and improve Australia's environment. This is a $2.55 billion commitment to our environment—to driving down carbon emissions. It has been opposed by those opposite.




Mr Watts:
  That's a lot of magic beans!



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Order! The member for Gellibrand will let the member for Corangamite speak in silence.




Ms HENDERSON:
  Through the Emissions Reduction Fund we will provide incentives for abatement activities across the Australian economy, rather than by pushing up prices in the hope of making electricity unaffordable. The Emissions Reduction Fund will support projects such as upgrading commercial buildings for energy efficiency; improving energy efficiency elsewhere in homes and industrial facilities; reducing electricity generation emissions; capturing landfill gas; reducing waste coalmine gas; reforesting and revegetating marginal lands; improving Australia's agricultural soils; upgrading vehicles and improving transport logistics; and managing fires in savanna grasslands. Countries around the world, as the Minister for the Environment discussed in his second reading speech a number of weeks ago, are implementing the schemes which work best for them. In Australia, we will introduce the scheme that works best for Australia—not one that is going to be a $15.4 billion hit to the Australian economy.


At the moment in my electorate of Corangamite, and across the Geelong region, manufacturing is under particular pressure. Part of that is because of the cost of electricity. We must have the most competitive manufacturing sector we possibly can. I have spoken many times about the importance of advanced manufacturing and what our government is doing to invest in advanced manufacturing through our Geelong Region Innovation and Investment Fund, our growth fund, our strong investment in jobs and projects like the East West Link—another project that members opposite are opposing which will deliver in excess of 6,000 construction jobs. We cannot afford this toxic tax.


I want to make particular note of the member for Corio. Corio is an area which is particularly dependent on manufacturing and it is a poor reflection on the member for Corio's capacity to stand up for his electorate because he has remained silent on this tax. He has not stood up for his electorate; he has not stood up for manufacturing; he has not stood up for the many important employees and employers in his electorate and spoken out against this tax that he knows is driving up the cost of electricity and gas and really hurting manufacturers.


I am very proud to be speaking on these bills today. These are bills that will do much to improve Australia's economy and I commend these bills to the House.

Mr BUTLER
 (Port Adelaide) (17:16):  Earlier today I circulated amendments in the same format that they were circulated when this package of bills was last debated before the House. As the Speaker pointed out in some part during this debate, those amendments were in a different form to the amendments moved in December because of the particular standing order that the Speaker ruled on at that time in December, and I want to acknowledge the point the Speaker rightly made. It is worth making a few comments about an emissions trading scheme that has been moved. I move opposition amendments (1) to (4) to the Clean Energy Legislation (Carbon Tax Repeal) Bill 2014 together:

"Hunt, Greg, MP",LP,2014-07-14,"



Mr HUNT
 (Flinders—Minister for the Environment) (17:17):  The government is moving these amendments to provide greater clarity on how business should pass on all carbon tax repeal savings. We are doing it to make sure that there is no doubt that Australian families, Australian businesses and Australian pensioners will receive the full benefit of the carbon tax repeal. The amendment complements the already existing powers that the ACCC has been given by the government through the broader legislative repeal package. In particular, the amendments moved here include guarantees that large retailers of regulated goods, electricity and natural gas, and bulk importers of synthetic greenhouse gases must pass on all cost savings. They introduce a penalty on electricity and natural gas retailers and bulk importers of synthetic greenhouse gases equal to 250 per cent of any cost savings they do not pass on, and they require electricity and natural gas retailers and bulk importers of synthetic greenhouse gases to inform the ACCC and customers as to how they are passing on cost savings.


The amendments will ensure there is no doubt as to who is covered by the obligations regarding electricity, gas and synthetic greenhouse gas bulk importers. The changes to the bill balance new compliance obligations with the need to ensure that household and business customers benefit. They are a light touch approach, but they carry with them an extra capacity. Businesses should be able to explain to customers how changes in their costs are flowing through to changes in their prices. The government is aware that major electricity and gas retailers are already committed to providing this information to households and businesses on bills, inserts and websites.


For the purposes of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901, I confirm that the definition of electricity retailer is limited to electricity retailers and electricity producers selling electricity into a wholesale electricity market to a retailer. By agreement, this is not intended to override any pre-existing contract. For the purposes of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901, I also confirm that bulk importers of synthetic greenhouse gas defined under section 13A(2)(c) of the Ozone Protection and Synthetic Greenhouse Gas Management Act 1989 are covered by the new requirements. The cost of synthetic greenhouse gases was significantly impacted by the carbon tax; therefore, to minimise the cost of compliance, small imports of synthetic greenhouse gases—such as imports of synthetic greenhouse gas contained in equipment such as refrigerators, cars and air conditioners—are not covered.


In finishing this debate for the government, I wish to make two points. Firstly, I wish to think the ACCC, which I have not previously thanked, as a professional, independent organisation led by Rod Sims and Brenton Philp. They have provided invaluable impartial and professional policy advice. Secondly, I want to take a different tack to what has characterised much of this debate. There is much agreement across this chamber and across this parliament and much goodwill about reducing emissions, and we should always remember that the commitment on both sides of this chamber is to reduce emissions in the lowest cost way. We disagree on the mechanisms—we have voted on the mechanisms, the community has voted on the mechanisms—but the intention is clear: to reduce our emissions, but to find a way that does it which is cost-effective and which is effective in actually reducing those emissions. For all of these reasons, I commend the bills and I commend the amendments to the House.

"Butler, Mark, MP",ALP,2014-07-14,"



Mr BUTLER
 (Port Adelaide) (17:21):  I will make some remarks about the government's amendments, which we have only been able to look at in the last hour or two. As I think was mentioned earlier in the debate, there has obviously been a deal of discussion about this over the past three or four days, since the debacle in the Senate last week. We are now a little bit clearer on quite how wide the scope of the guarantee of any price reductions that would flow from these repeal bills passing would be for Australian households—it is quite clear that it is a pretty narrow scope—and also on what the range of businesses would be who would be involved in the quite significant compliance obligations that are included in this deal that the government has now done with the Palmer United Party. 


What is clear looking at these amendments is that the legal obligations apply to a very limited number of businesses in the electricity, the gas and the SGG industries. That is fine, so far as it goes, and the opposition can indicate that we will be supporting these amendments. But let us be crystal clear about this: these amendments do not in any way come close to matching up to the claims made and the commitments given by the now Prime Minister when he was the Leader of the Opposition about what the impact of a carbon price mechanism would be, or was, in the grocery sector, in the airline sector, in the housing construction sector, in the farm sector and many others beside. They do not come close to matching those claims and they certainly do not do anything to deliver the commitment that the Prime Minister made in all of those sectors that what apparently went up—not that we accept that they did go up—would come down and that here would be enforcement mechanisms put in place to ensure that those prices came down.


We had a discussion about this in question time. Deputy Speaker Vasta, you would remember that the Prime Minister, when he was Leader of the Opposition, claimed that the carbon price mechanism would result in grocery bills going up by $10 per week—a claim not echoed or reflected in any other advice or modelling able to be found, but a claim made very clearly by that then Leader of the Opposition, along with a guarantee that these repeal bills would deliver a commensurate reduction in grocery bills. There is nothing in the amendments that in any way obliges Woolworths, Coles or any other retailer to deliver any price reduction whatsoever. There is nothing in the amendments that obliges an airline to deliver any price reduction, that obliges the housing industry to deliver the $6,000 reduction in new house prices that the Prime Minister again committed to in question time today. So we will support the amendments, but it must be clearly stated that the amendments do not reflect the hyperbole, the overreach, the hysterical claims and commitments made by this Prime Minister when he was the Leader of the Opposition. 


Given that this is the third time these bills have come through this House, I have had many an occasion to talk about Labor's ETS amendment. Every time we have occasion to debate this, the case for an emissions trading scheme becomes stronger because increasingly around the world this is being recognised as the best policy response to the challenge of climate change that exists. The combination of rigour around carbon pollution in the form of a legal cap that is calibrated to our international commitments around reducing carbon pollution along with a market mechanism—not a series of decisions made in the minister's office or the Prime Minister's office, but a true market mechanism where business works out the cheapest and most effective way to operate within this cap—is not only the mechanism that has been put in place for some years now in our oldest trading partners, like the United Kingdom, France, Germany and many parts of North America, such as California, many states in the north-east of the United States and Canadian provinces. We are also seeing it in our own region, most importantly in China, our largest trading partner. South Korea, our third-largest export partner, will be commencing a very significant national emissions trading scheme in only a matter of five or six months. 


This is the policy we took to the election. It is the right policy for Australia. It is pretty clear that it will not be carried by the parliament today, but the Labor Party is very clear: this is the type of response Australia will eventually come to—maybe not under this Prime Minister but under a more far-sighted one than we have today.

"Watts, Tim, MP",ALP,2014-07-14,"



Mr WATTS
 (Gellibrand) (17:26):  The amendments being considered before the House today are just further evidence of this government's shameful abrogation of its responsibility to future generations of Australians. The fact is Lord Deben, the former environment minister in the Thatcher government, has said:


I think future generations will ask ‘what did you do to stop the world being overwhelmed by climate change?’ Mr Abbott—


the Prime Minister—


will have to answer that and I don’t know how he can look children in the eye.


Nowhere is this more clearly seen than in the government's Direct Action plan. Of course, this is all we are left with in response to climate change, given the fact that Labor's amendments to establish an ETS—the same policy we took to the last election—will not be supported today. It is the whitest of white elephants, the most tepid of token efforts which will do nothing for climate change and cost the Australian people billions of dollars. 


After rolling his colleague Malcolm Turnbull as Liberal leader on the issue of climate change, the now Prime Minister realised he better have some sort of response to what President Obama has called one of the most significant long-term challenges, if not the most significant long-term challenge, that the planet faces. But, as so often happens, he spoke first and thought later. 


Rather than consulting widely with economists and environmental experts, he cobbled together a 1950s era policy and gave it a 1950s name—Direct Action. When released, the policy was widely condemned by economists and environmental groups as being both ineffective and expensive. It is worth reflecting in this debate on the comments at a time from the member for Wentworth about the policy farce that we are left with today. The member for Wentworth belled the cat in 2009 when he stated:


The Liberal Party is currently led by people whose conviction on climate change is that it is ""crap"" and you don't need to do anything about it. Any policy that is announced will simply be a con, an environmental fig leaf to cover a determination to do nothing.


Quite a contrast with the statements the Minister for the Environment made earlier!


The Abbott opposition did have three years to listen to the experts and the response that Direct Action received after it was initially announced. They had a chance to formulate a policy that may have actually been effective. Of course, they were not interested. They had their fig leaf on climate policy. They would hold onto it without shame even when it did less to cover up their climate cowardice than a pair of red Speedos. Unfortunately, it underwent very little change in the following three years. There was no research produced to demonstrate the policy's effectiveness; no modelling released to demonstrate the impact it would have on carbon emissions. Even Liberal backbenchers questioned its effectiveness, with Liberal MP Mal Washer claiming in May 2013, 'if we are not going to get a big environmental bang for our buck, then we ought not to do it'. The member for Tangney admitted at the same time that the Direct Action Plan was 'not optimal policy' and argued, 'I think there is room to manoeuvre, after the election, on direct action'. Sadly, the only manoeuvres we have seen recently have been with the Palmer United Party, and they have not been on the direct action policy.


As with many of Tony Abbott's signature policies, this criticism was not limited to the party floor. Liberals of all stripes came out against the policies, including the patron of many of those opposite and former Treasurer, Peter Costello, who criticised the affordability of the scheme. The Abbott government continued to ignore the strident criticism from both sides of the political plan, and stuck with its direct-action albatross. However, once the coalition won government, it was time to turn this afterthought of an election promise into a coherent government policy for combating climate change. During the implementation process we have seen not only the results of this shoddy policy but also its smokescreen effect—it has turned a small farming program, the Carbon Farming Initiative, into a showpiece of the coalition's climate change policy: the Emissions Reduction Fund. Even this fund is riddled with policy errors. It is a fund that is missing key elements as to how it will operate, such as how historical baselines are set and how credits are to be calculated. It is a fund that takes control of key aspects away from an independent body and gives that control to a very partisan minister—key aspects such as eligibility for the funds allocated, and the calculation of carbon credits. It is a fund that is not even clear about how much money it has to spend.


The most damning entitlement of this policy is that there are no binding caps whatsoever. The money spent under their direct action policy could be spent on magic beans, for all those opposite care. Magic beans do nothing to reduce our carbon emissions in this country but cost the taxpayer billions at the end of the day. The coalition's direct action policy is a poorly modelled piece of policy which has been roundly condemned by experts around the country. A senate inquiry into the Emissions Reduction Fund firmly recommended that the government not proceed with this unfortunate policy. Expert after expert in this inquiry reiterated how ineffective and expensive the scheme would be. Not one single expert called to the inquiry supported the government's plans, or expressed the belief that it would enable the government to reach its emissions reductions targets. Even the government's own department has expressed disbelief, and at a recent senate estimates hearing admitted that they are unable to confirm the policy will reach their targets—it just does not add up to a pile of magic beans, Mr Speaker.

"Bandt, Adam, MP",AG,2014-07-14,"



Mr BANDT
 (Melbourne) (17:32):  History will condemn this government; and I feel extraordinarily proud to have voted to keep the world-leading price on pollution that we have. I rise to speak on the Greens amendments to the Clean Energy Legislation (Carbon Tax Repeal) Amendment Bill 2014. Much of the debate so far on this bill and related bills has centred around the price on pollution, but there is one other aspect to this bill that deserves attention. ARENA, the Australian Renewable Energy Agency, is doing amazing work. If you ever wanted an example of 'direct action' in practice, it is ARENA.


ARENA is an organisation that was established at the Greens' request, under the previous arrangement reached with the Labor government, to ensure that $3 billion would be put aside to develop renewable energy in this country, especially that early-stage research. That agency now exists—at arm's length from a minister, so it cannot be politicised—and it is driving solar, wind and other forms of renewable energy in Australia. Of the initial $3-billion budget, $1.8 billion will be lost if this bill goes ahead—that is, $717 million over the next three years. Where is that money being spent? What are the kinds of things that ARENA is doing which will be at risk if the amendments I have moved to this bill are not passed? Well, just recently, researchers in New South Wales found a way to heat steam, using solar, to a point where that steam was able to drive turbines. What does that mean? It means that, if this technology is able to be proven and commercialised, existing coal-fired power stations could be run by solar—the existing turbines in those stations could be powered by steam produced by the sun. That is just one of ARENA's projects. There are 64 solar projects going on around the country: 14 bioenergy, 19 hybrid projects, six ocean and wave projects, and six geothermal projects—all being supported by ARENA.


Seventy per cent of ARENA funding has gone to regional and rural Australia. Members opposite who represent those regional and rural electorates where this money is going—and driving the shift to renewable energy, and actually making a difference—are about to cut $1.8 billion from their communities.


What ARENA is doing is the first stage in the chain: helping research into renewable technologies—things like storage, geothermal and solar— so that Australia can become a renewable energy world leader. And then, when those projects are proven to work, some of those projects can then go and get funding from the second stage—the Clean Energy Finance Corporation. What we have at the moment is, in fact, an ecosystem that supports the development and then the commercialisation of clean and renewable energies in this country. Whatever your ideological commitment to repealing the carbon tax—or however you want to put it—I do not think that people knew, at the election, that they were voting for ripping out $1.8 billion from solar and geothermal energy around this country. That is not what they voted for. That was not put up in lights in the coalition's policy.


Whatever one thinks about the other matters before us here today, I urge the House to support the amendments that will restore the funding to ARENA. We know now, because of a decision made by senators in the other place, that ARENA is going to stay. The government's efforts to repeal and abolish ARENA through separate legislation will not work. Given that ARENA is going to stay, we now need to give it back the funding that it was relying on—so that solar, geothermal and wave power in Australia can become world-leading.


I have had the privilege of meeting a number of people in the course of my time here. One of them was the climate adviser to the G8, and to Angela Merkel, who said: 'We Germans look at you Australians, and we cannot understand, with all your sun and your wind and your waves, why you are not leading the world in renewable energy.' Keep ARENA, and maybe we can.

Mr BUTLER
 (Port Adelaide) (15:15):  Madam Speaker, I rise to continue my remarks in this debate on the Clean Energy Legislation (Carbon Tax Repeal) Bill 2014 and related bills. Before the debate was interrupted by the 90-second statements, I was drawing attention to the claims made by the Prime Minister over the last three or four years—in his magical mystery tour around Australia in his high-vis jacket—explaining to Australians that to price carbon—to put a cap on carbon pollution—would act as a wrecking ball through the Australian economy. He got sick of that metaphor and moved to talking about 'a cobra strike' to the Australian economy. At other times, it was to be 'a python squeeze' on the Australian economy; or that cities that we have known and loved for decades would literally disappear off the Australian map—Whyalla, a city in the iron triangle in South Australia and dear to my heart, would disappear, according to the Prime Minister; Gladstone was at mortal threat of disappearing from the map of Australia as well, in spite of having a pretty healthy economy last time I visited the town. This was a series of hysterical, mendacious claims made by the now Prime Minister while he was opposition leader, seeking to undermine a response to climate change. Falsehoods and overreach characterised this prime minister's hysterical, mendacious campaign. After last week's goings-on in the Senate, we are now seeing the falsehoods, the overreach and the chaos of last week all coming together in the debate in the House today.


There has been some focus by the opposition on the cost-of-living claims made by the Prime Minister over the last three years, because he was utterly definitive about that. He was utterly definitive about what the impact of a price on carbon would be on Australian households. We tried to test him on this today, but we tried in vain because the Prime Minister refused to repeat the guarantees that he gave over the last three years about just what businesses would have to pass on; and about what price reductions to which Australian households. We asked him about his earlier claim that the carbon tax would result in a $10 increase per week to the grocery bill of average Australian households—not a figure that we can find in any report, in any piece of advice, or in any claim made by an expert or a commentator. We asked the Prime Minister to repeat that claim, and to repeat his guarantee that the passage of these repeal bills would result in grocery bills going down by $10 per week for Australian households. And he can't—of course he can't, because Woolies has confirmed that those prices did not go up in the first place! Woolworths has confirmed that, and other retailers have confirmed it as well. It was a falsehood. It was overreach. And that is why the Prime Minister would not repeat the response.


The height of the farce was the Minister for Agriculture, who should know better, trying to scare Australian households—particularly the carnivores among them—that a leg of lamb would cost $100 under the carbon tax. Well, as the member for Charlton pointed out, today a leg of lamb, 2.2 kilograms, costs around $26. We asked the Prime Minister—and maybe the Minister for Agriculture had overreached, and it had not quite reached $100 dollars; but what would be the reduction by the end of this week, if these repeal bills go through? And again, the Prime Minister chose to duck the question—because he knows it was all a farce. It was all a falsehood. It was all overreach. It was all designed to stoke this political campaign to scare Australian households about a proper climate change response. He said that the carbon tax would result in a $6,000 increase in the price of a new house. When asked to guarantee that the price of a new house would come down by $6,000, in line with the promises he made before the election—that in repealing the carbon tax, what had gone up would automatically come down—of course he ducked the question, because to do otherwise would be to mislead this parliament. First, because the price of a new house did not go up by that amount and second, because it will not come down. He was asked to repeat his guarantee that farm costs would come down by $12,000 a year—and of course, he did not repeat that guarantee because—again—to do so would be to mislead this parliament. It was a falsehood then, it is a falsehood now, and he is not able to guarantee it.


As I said in the earlier part of this debate, before the 90-second statements, it would be nice—given that the member for Sturt is seeking to curtail this debate—if the parliament actually had before it the amendment that the government and the Palmer United Party have cobbled together to deal with these issues. But none of us have been given the courtesy of even seeing the amendment, so that we can make a decision about whether it deals with the concerns that have been raised with us by Australian households—given the promises the Prime Minister made—and are being raised with us by Australian businesses. By contrast, I have already circulated the amendments that I intend to move to this bill. They are the same amendments we exposed as a draft piece of legislation before the election; the same amendments I moved in this place in December; and the same amendments I moved in this place a few weeks ago to reflect—to a T—the Labor Party's election policy: that we support the termination of the carbon tax, but only on the condition that it is replaced by a meaningful climate change policy: an emissions trading scheme.


The member for Sturt might agree that Direct Action is a meaningful climate change response, but, along with the Prime Minister and the Minister for the Environment, you are about the only three people in Australia who share that view. For 4½ years that policy has been in the marketplace, and in that time not one single expert or commentator has come out and said that Direct Action is a serious climate change policy. Not one has said that it will achieve its stated objectives. Not one has said that it is anything close to worth the billions and billions of taxpayer dollars that this government intends to dole out—on behalf of people in the gallery, people listening around Australia—to people who pollute for a living to change the way they operate and to make changes that they were probably intending to make anyway.


The problem, at the end of the day, is that this Prime Minister and this government are stuck in the past. They concocted the Direct Action policy at a particular time in history, when this Prime Minister took the temptation dangled before him by Senator Minchin to take the leadership of the party provided that he turn his back on the election commitments he made as a candidate in the seat of Warringah at the 2007 election to support an emissions trading scheme put forward by John Howard. That was an ETS that had a wider scope than the ETS that I am proposing today in our amendments. The member for Warringah turned his back on that commitment, broke the promise he made to the people of Warringah, took the temptation dangled before him by Senator Minchin to become leader of this party. At least the Treasurer had the moral fortitude to resist that temptation, to stick by his principles and say that he would not take the leadership. He knew that a market-based mechanism is the best policy response to climate change. No-one has got up and denied that speculation. Not one person has done that.


The rest of the world has moved on. The Prime Minister might be stuck in 2009, in the aftermath of the Copenhagen conference, but the rest of the world has moved on. The United States has moved on. China has moved on. South Korea is moving to put in place an emissions trading scheme in only a matter of months. China started its seventh emissions trading scheme only a few weeks ago. The older schemes in that country are trading at a higher price than those on which the Labor emissions trading scheme would trade, according to Treasury advice. These bills shall only be accepted if Labor's emissions trading scheme amendment is also accepted by this House.



The SPEAKER:  Before I call any member, I wish to advise that in his speech the honourable member for Port Adelaide said that these were the same amendments that he had moved at the end of last year—I think he said December; I think they were November. In fact, they are not. They are the amendments that I ruled as not being in conformity with the standing orders. They were subsequently moved more recently with changes that brought them into conformity, but I think it is important that the record stands corrected.

"Palmer, Clive, MP",PUP,2014-07-14,"



Mr PALMER
 (Fairfax) (15:25):  I thought it might be helpful to set out important matters that happened in and around the Australian Senate for the public interest. During last Wednesday night, Palmer United senators considered a draft amendment for the repeal of the carbon tax. The draft amendment was one the government and the Palmer United team had negotiated. Based on advice the Palmer United senate team received on Wednesday night, the position to them was clear. It was not mandatory for any savings brought about by the repeal of the carbon tax to be passed on to consumers of natural gas and electricity; our senators required that there be a mandatory pass on. This is not what the Palmer United team wanted.


If Australian families, industries and citizens are not going to receive the reduction to their electricity and natural gas bills, the Palmer United Senate team resolved that it could not, in moral conscience, vote for the repeal of the carbon tax. Palmer United took a positive approach and re-drafted the amendment to the effect of delivering reductions to electricity and natural gas, and clarified this with the government, who were supportive of that action. So, the benefit of the repeal of the carbon tax is that it would deliver a real reduction to generators of electricity and producers of natural gas and to the consumers of those commodities.


Palmer United supports the bill and the amendment that will be brought forward in the detailed consideration of the bill. The amendment to that bill—proposed today, I believe, and to be moved by the government during the detailed consideration stage later today—will allow and guarantee a reduction in electricity and gas to all Australians and to all businesses. If such changes are not passed on to consumers and enterprises, any entity not doing so will be subject to 250 per cent of the cost savings that have not been passed on to the consumers. This requirement applies only to the suppliers of natural gas and electricity or a bulk SGG importer in respect of supply of synthetic greenhouse gases. These requirements affect fewer than 100 entities in Australia but impact upon the lives of 23 million Australians, who have suffered under the carbon tax for too long a period.


We stand today on the edge of time, and destiny is ours to grab for our nation. There can be no justification to removing the carbon tax if it does not improve the lives of our citizens. We must have a mandatory requirement that the price of energy be reduced by the savings from the removal of the carbon tax, which no longer has to be paid. We must mandate that the electricity and gas costs for Australian families, single mothers and pensioners must be reduced by the abolition of the carbon tax. There must be a reduction of the costs of energy to our industries and our businesses to ensure their competitiveness and bring down the cost of production and the cost of employing people so more jobs can be created, so more Australians may find satisfaction and direction in gainful employment. The cost of running our schools, our hospitals and our institutions must benefit from lower energy costs.


There is no justification for the carbon tax. The carbon tax sets the price of carbon at a far higher price than applies to the rest of the world. It is higher than the ETS in Europe and much higher than the ETS in New Zealand. We must stand on the right side of history, and the right side of history is standing up for the Australian people, for their livelihood and for their future.


Climate change is a global problem, and it needs a global solution. Australian families cannot bear the responsibility for this matter for the whole world, when Australian trading partners fail to act and are not united on the issue. For Australia to act alone and impose a tax on carbon at this time has only placed a tax on jobs and discouraged investments. The cost of energy for all Australians shows a lack of confidence in our community for investment and growth to allow our business to employ more people and to allow economic stimulation to be undertaken.



Mr Sukkar interjecting—




Mr PALMER:
  I was a member of the party over there four years ago. I said it then. This is so we can have more economic revenue and more revenue for government. More revenue will mean more resources for the government, which will mean more hospitals, more schools and a rising standard of living.


If the day comes that our major trading partners of China, the United States of America, the European Union, Japan and Korea set up an ETS then they will know that Australia is also serious about an ETS because our senators plan to move in the Senate an ETS dependent upon our trading partners also acting in that regard. It has been said that when our trading partners set up an emissions trading scheme they will require that their trading partners, including Australia, exporting to their countries pay an emissions trading tax upon the import of those products if their governments do not have an environmental trading scheme. In these circumstances, if Australia does not have an emissions trading scheme, Australia's exporters will be paying a tax to another country instead of to Australia.


Australia needs all the revenue it can get to meet the hopes and aspirations of the people of this country and the people of the world. The world is constantly changing and our ability to adapt to change and to keep an open mind on issues which affect all of us is what really matters. It is not about the Labor way or the Liberal way; it is the right way that is important for Australia and the world.


True to our promise to the Australian people at the last election, Palmer United senators will vote in the Senate to abolish the carbon tax. In so doing, Palmer United senators will support the initiatives that the government will foreshadow later on today in the consideration in detail of the bill. Removal of the carbon tax requires that all producers of energy in this country are required by law to pass on to all consumers of energy the savings from the repeal of the carbon tax. Action by Palmer United senators will make Australian industries more competitive internationally and the lives of our people more manageable.


Carbon tax, as I have said, is an arbitrary tax. It sets a price, as we know, far above the level of the international price of carbon. It disadvantages all Australians and it must be repealed. To introduce an increase in excise and indexation is, in our view, not the answer. If New Zealand can join the international community, why can't Australia? Acting alone, Australia cannot change the world or climate change. We must not act just ourselves as an isolated island where our carbon share is less than one per cent of the world's emissions. We must think of the global situation and a global solution not just ourselves but for all our children and all the children of the world not just in our time but for all time.


Time waits for no man. The challenges we face are not easy but face them we must—and face them we can together. Climate change must have a global solution. There are moves around the world. Many countries are failing to act because they are unsure of how this issue will be dealt with by other nations. Australia has the opportunity to set the standard. We can act as a catalyst for the whole world and set a fair framework which the world can follow. In understanding climate change, we must remain ever vigilant and aware that Australia is part of an international community and, more importantly, of what the global community can do together to make the lives of those who inhabit this planet more secure. Together we can achieve the extraordinary. President Obama of the United States has shown great leadership in encouraging all countries to act on an emissions trading scheme.


In voting for the abolition of the carbon tax, Palmer United senators will move later on in the week to establish an emissions trading scheme which would only become effective once Australia's main trading partners also take action to establish such a scheme. These actions must be set based on the actions of our leading trading partners—China, the United States of America, the European Union, India, Japan and Korea. We need to ensure that the jobs and enterprises of all Australians will not be disadvantaged.


We in Palmer United encourage all members of this country to support the government in their initiative to ensure that the benefits from the abolition of the carbon tax flow on to our industries and to our people. The world will know once we act that they can be sure that Australia will respond to a global emissions trading scheme that promotes international trade and prosperity.


As John Kennedy said many years ago:


For, in the final analysis, our most basic common link is that we all inhabit this small planet. We all breathe the same air. We all cherish our children's future. And we are all mortal.


When truth triumphs over injustice everyone is a winner. The inconvenient truth is a truth that what we must face together—not alone and isolated on an island but together as a united international community that can bring about real change. 


The Palmer United Party's role in the Senate is to keep faith with the Australian people. Listening is one of the most important things we can do in this place and in the Senate. By listening we can learn from others and make changes before change changes us. As Australians we must put the interests of our people before our own individual interests and the interests of all people of the world ahead of all else.


As has been said, we need an open mind. This is called for by the need for a better mutual understanding and mutual respect. An open mind will enable us to have an objective and realistic understanding of each other. We can discover not only what divides us but what we have in common. We have more in common in the common future that binds us together. At least we can see to it that the differences will not result in clashes and confrontation. An open mind will also enable us to be more appreciative, accommodating and supportive of each other's concerns and priorities.


Despite all the talk about climate change in the world, we are still a developing world with a huge population and we still face various problems of unbalanced development, poverty and environmental degradation. We seek a better world for Australia and for all citizens of the world so that one day man can be what he was meant to be: free and independent.


The abolition of the carbon tax is the first step in allowing Australian enterprises to compete, increase exports, employ more people and, more importantly, allow Australians to pay lower electricity and gas prices and relieve some of the pressures that have been placed on families right across this nation. That is why Palmer United took a stand in the Senate—to ensure that all Australians would be dealt with fairly by the abolition of the carbon tax.

"Laundy, Craig, MP",LP,2014-07-14,"



Mr LAUNDY
 (Reid) (15:36):  I rise to my feet to talk on the amendments that the Minister for the Environment is moving. I cannot help but notice that on Monday afternoons we do not have matters of public importance debates. They are on Tuesdays and Thursdays. But, to my way of thinking, this is a matter of public importance. This is a position that was taken to the election. As much as those opposite would like to argue that they terminated the carbon tax pre-election and replaced it with an ETS, that policy was resoundingly defeated at the election. The Minister for the Environment, the Prime Minister and the government today have a solid mandate—have always had a solid mandate—to repeal this tax. 


I note that I follow the member for Fairfax, because my background is in the business world, not the political world. My point of difference with those opposite is that I understand the role this tax has played in the last six years in my electorate of Reid as it has filtered through every line item in the expenses of every P&L of every local business, and that is the part that those opposite just do not get. I exclude from that the member for Indi and the member for Fairfax, because they have run businesses. They understand that a business has a revenue side and an expense side to its P&L. They understand that, through the GFC, consumer confidence was shot to pieces. People sat on their hands and saved at six times the rate they did under the Howard government. At the same time, with the introduction of the carbon tax, you had the ratcheting up on the expense side of every line item that this fed into. Every small and medium sized business in my electorate of Reid and right throughout Australia was hit with a double whammy. 


Small and medium sized business, which we never talk about in this chamber as much as we should, employee 70 per cent of the people in this country. They have been and will always be the engine room of the economy. At a time when they needed us, we turned around and whacked them with a tax that filtered through every line in the expense side of the P&L. Traditionally when a business is hit with increasing costs it will increase its prices to maintain its margin. In accounting terms it is EBITDA. Due to this double whammy it was in the unique position where not only could it not do that; in most instances it had to decrease its prices. What do small and medium sized businesses do, as they have always done in times of controversy? They augment their business model. 


What have been missed in this chamber are the flow-on effects that this tax has had in the real world. Not enough people in this chamber come from the real world. Their background is not in business. What happened in the streets of Reid—through Auburn, through Homebush, through Flemington, through Concord, through Five Dock, through Wareemba and through Drummoyne—is that business changed the way they operated. They did it, as they have always done, in two major ways. They augmented their trading hours or, in the case of family businesses—which are the vast majority of small businesses—they increased the hours that they worked themselves, cut casual wages and started augmenting their trading hours. These things feed in. Here is the vicious circle which businesses in Reid and throughout Australia have operated in for the last six years. 


We argue about youth unemployment in this country. Everyone, on both sides, thinks this is an issue that we must confront. And they are right. But here is the kicker. Casual employment has and will always be the entree for university students and young people to find a career. In the streets of Reid it has dried up. On the western side of my electorate youth unemployment is running at 20 per cent. One in five 18- to 24-year-olds cannot find a job. Here is a light bulb moment. Why don't we get out of the expense side of the P&L of businesses and restore some profitability so that they might then put on some staff? That is what is being missed. 


Australia has been built on the back of cheap power. It has been our competitive advantage. Our pay and conditions have been derived as a result. Every 1 July, based on business profitability, we have a minimum wage increase. If businesses are not profitable, we will not get that. We are seeing that now, with real wage decreases. I cannot believe that anyone could stand up in this chamber and argue to the contrary. We need to help business, not hurt it. 


It was a breath of fresh air when the member for Mallee, in his 90-second statement, spoke of some innovative environmental businesses in his electorate. Last Friday I sat with one such business in my electorate, Suntech, at Sydney Olympic Park. They are the smarts for the Chinese solar energy business. The carbon tax is not important to them. What is important, in my humble opinion, from my commercial background, is how this will be attacked commercially. They told me that storage is the key. The University of New South Wales and the University of Queensland are leading the world in this space. 




Mr Bandt:
  You are cutting funding to ARENA!




Mr LAUNDY:
  I say to the member for Melbourne that what happens is that commercial enterprise enters the frame—not government, not legislation, not taxation and not regulation. Private enterprise enters the space. This is what we have and will continue to see. 


Vector, a power company in New Zealand, are running an amazing trial—financing techniques. No-one has even spoken about them in this chamber. In the not-too-distant future, as storage capacity and lifetime increases, we will see companies like GE and Macquarie Bank, which have entered this space in substantial quantities, offer financing packages so that the daily fee for having solar, thermal, fuel cell technology, wind—whatever it may be—will beat the price of day-to-day electricity. It is the same theory that the carbon tax and the ETS apply to but it is happening through a market mechanism that is not an ETS. 


Economists love markets; that is true. They also love textbooks. I was an economist before spending 23 years in business. I know that in the real world you do not live and operate in a textbook. Has anyone mentioned the market manipulation of the ETS program in Europe? No, they have not. It is convenient not to. How many economists would it take to change a light bulb? The answer is no answer—they pay someone to do it. They do not operate in the real world. They hire an electrician. People in the real world, the small-business operators, try to change the light bulb themselves. I just find it so frustrating. I have no doubt I will be followed by the member for Melbourne, who will espouse ideology to me. Che sera sera, because I come from the real world; I come from the world of family business.


The member for Fairfax spoke on the amendments that are being moved, and I would like to touch on those, because the Minister for the Environment spoke to those in his opening speech. The $1.1 million penalty will be included in the original bill's complementary amendments. The amendments ensure large supplies of regulated goods—electricity, natural gas, synthetic greenhouse gases. They must pass on their cost savings. They impose a penalty on electricity and natural gas suppliers equal to 250 per cent of any cost savings they do not pass on. They require electricity and natural gas retailers of bulk imports of synthetic greenhouse gases to inform the ACCC and customers of how they are passing on the cost savings.


The amendments are currently being finalised and will be moved this afternoon. But they are all aimed at one thing: getting out of the expense side of not only small, medium and big business—business irrespective of size—but getting out of the expense side of the family home. In just the same way that small business operates with budgetary constraints in mind, so do family homes. And the families in Reid have spoken loud and clear. They spoke at the election. They spoke to me in the lead-up to the election and they have spoken to me post-election. Whilst I said at the start of this speech that there is no MPI today but how important this was—and I have made comment in this chamber before that some of the behaviour here at times reminds me of kindergarten—that MPI space between 3.20 and 4.30 every afternoon reminds me a lot of kindergarten, because it is a time when fairy tales are told. It is a time when history is rewritten.


The history is clear—the history and the impost on business irrespective of size, in the electorate of Reid and right across Australia. The jury is in. Irrespective of what those opposite want to stand and argue—that yes, they are still terminating the carbon tax and want to move to an ETS—that was the policy they took to the last election. That was the policy resoundly dismissed and defeated at the last election. To argue any differently is quite simply political spin. I rise today to commend the minister and speak in support of this bill, and I look forward to the political groundhog day that we have had since 9 September last year finally coming to an end, when this is hopefully passed in the Senate, so that we can get out of the expense side of business irrespective of size and households in my electorate and right around Australia.

"Plibersek, Tanya, MP",ALP,2014-07-14,"



Ms PLIBERSEK
 (Sydney—Deputy Leader of the Opposition) (15:47):  It amazes me that as I rise to my feet today to speak on the carbon tax repeal legislation we still do not actually have a written copy of the government's amendments before us. I think that is symbolic of the chaotic way the government is handling this most important issue. I agree with the member for Reid on one thing: this is a most important issue, because we know for sure and certain, as sure as we can be, that carbon pollution is happening, that it is causing climate change. We are as sure as we can be about any scientific fact. In fact, someone recently compared it to the fact that there are still some people who would say that smoking does not cause cancer, but it is really not the sort of risk any sensible person would take. It is the same thing here.




Mr Sukkar:
  That is rubbish. That is a disgraceful argument.




Ms PLIBERSEK:
  We have some guy up there—I do not know who he is—saying that this is rubbish. The vast majority of the world's scientists agree that climate change is real, that it is being caused by humans and that it is being caused by carbon pollution. One other thing we know for sure and certain is that the cost of not acting today will be borne by future generations, and it will be borne at a much higher rate than the cost of reasonable mitigation strategies today. We are leaving for our children not just an environmental disaster but the economic cost of dealing with that environmental disaster. And we have a responsibility, not just because we as parents and grandparents consider the sort of world that we want to leave our children but because, per capita, Australians are one of the greatest emitters of carbon pollution in the world. We have a responsibility to be part of global action to reduce the risk of dangerous climate change.


Labor has always been consistent about the need to act on this. Back in the day, John Howard was also committed to action on climate change. In fact, we had both John Howard and Kevin Rudd going to the 2007 election saying that they would introduce an emissions trading scheme, because climate change is real, it is happening, and we need to do something about it. And that is what we have been working on since 2007: a real, fair dinkum scheme that will actually reduce carbon emissions over time. Our carbon pollution reduction scheme—the first one that was negotiated between Kevin Rudd as Prime Minister and Malcolm Turnbull as Leader of the Opposition back in the day—would have done that. It would have achieved that. Unfortunately the member for Wentworth, the Minister for Communications, who is actually a believer in climate change and someone who is prepared to stand by and have the courage of his convictions and not be weathervane on this issue, was defeated by just one vote by his own caucus. And the rest, as they say, is history. The Greens went on to help. The Tony-Abbott-led Liberal Party actually blocked that very important motion.




Mr Bandt:
  And you were so keen to go ahead with it and get our support!




Ms PLIBERSEK:
  We now have the Green interjecting, trying to defend the indefensible. You know that if you had agreed to that legislation we would have an emissions trading scheme in place now that would already be acting to reduce carbon pollution. We would not be having this debate today, and the member for Melbourne knows that.


We are already seeing the effects, the beginnings of climate change around the globe. We are seeing it in Australia, in extreme weather events more frequent and more extreme. The last 13 years of this century were the hottest years on record. We are seeing hotter days, higher sea levels, and more severe storms, droughts and fires. We are seeing all of that. In Australia it is costing us already, but have a thought for our neighbours as well, those Pacific Island nations that are actually making plans to remove their whole population when their nation becomes uninhabitable. Think about what is happening not just to us in Australia but also in our region.


What is even more frustrating about this debate that we are having today is that we actually have a scheme in place and it is working to reduce carbon emissions. We are the only country in the world that has a scheme that is already operating and in place, and we are turning our backs on it. We are walking away from it and we are going backwards on our scheme. We are going to that place under the stewardship of the so-called Minister for the Environment, who wrote his honours thesis about how a market mechanism would be the best way to handle climate change. We are going—




Mr Hunt:
  No, I did not.




Ms PLIBERSEK:
  You did not write your thesis on climate change and market mechanisms?




Mr Hunt:
  No, I did not. It was on market mechanisms and pollution.




Ms PLIBERSEK:
  On markets and pollution—that is good! The so-called Minister for the Environment is saying that markets are the best way to deal with pollution, but just not in the case of carbon pollution. We actually have a scheme at the moment that levies big polluters. It takes money from big polluters and uses that money for climate change mitigation, reducing the effects on families—



Mr Hunt interjecting—




Mr Sukkar:
  No, it does not. It takes money from households.




Ms PLIBERSEK:
  Mr Acting Deputy Speaker, I cannot get a sentence out with these interjections.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Craig Kelly
):  Order! The Minister for the Environment should not interject.




Ms PLIBERSEK:
  And that other guy as well.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The next time he interjects, I will happily pull him up.




Mr Sukkar:
  Do not be rattled, just look at your notes!




Ms PLIBERSEK:
  I am not rattled, I would just like to—



Mr Sukkar interjecting—




Ms PLIBERSEK:
  I do not even know who he is.



Mr Chester interjecting—




Ms PLIBERSEK:
  You don't either, do you?



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  All members in the chamber should not be interjecting.




Ms PLIBERSEK:
  We are going to be the only country in the world that is actually walking away from a scheme that is working and going to a scheme that no economist, no environmentalist and nobody else in the world actually thinks will work to effectively bring down carbon pollution and mitigate against the dangers of climate change. We now have some of our biggest trading partners all moving in one direction and we are moving back in the other direction.


Today, 39 national and 23 sub-national jurisdictions—accounting for almost a quarter of global greenhouse gas emissions—have implemented or are moving to implement carbon pricing instruments, including emissions trading schemes. We had the Treasurer earlier today talking about China. I have been to China recently, too. I spoke to the same person that he says he spoke to, who told me that they hope to move from their seven very large emissions trading pilot schemes in China at the moment to a national scheme by the end of the decade. We have got our most major trading partner, China; 39 national jurisdictions and 23 sub-national jurisdictions moving this way.


In the United States just recently, there was a very significant step towards tackling climate change with President Obama announcing a 30 per cent reduction in carbon dioxide emissions from power plants by 2030, compared with 2005 levels. Yes, he has faced domestic roadblocks from the Tea Party mates of those opposite, but he is moving around those to implement strict new carbon dioxide emissions caps on power plants in the United States. That comes on top of the 2011 strict fuel efficiency standards for new vehicles and the other measures, like last year's Environmental Protection Agency declaration that new coal-fired plants may not emit more than 1,100 pounds of carbon dioxide per megawatt hour, which has the effect of the ending the building of new dirty coal-fired power stations in the United States.


There are very significant moves from our major trading partners. When you are talking about our major trading partners, it is not just China and the United States. Look at the government's conservative friends in the United Kingdom and in Germany. When the Prime Minister was in 'Canadia' earlier this year, he said:


There is no sign that trading schemes are increasingly being adopted. If anything trading schemes are being discarded not adopted.


Yet, his own friends—conservative governments in the United Kingdom and Germany—are amongst those in the forefront of adopting strict and successful programs to reduce carbon emissions.


Emissions trading schemes are in place across Europe, as I said earlier, and in some states of the United States, in Canada, in New Zealand, in Australia and in Japan. South Korea will have a scheme beginning in 2015—so the beginning of next year—which is legislated already. In these places it is not just a nutty left-wing conspiracy to destroy the industrial state, as the Prime Minister seems to imply at times. You actually have conservatives like Lord Deben in the UK calling our move away from an emissions trading scheme 'reckless'. He said it was 'deeply shaming'. He said:


It’s a … deeply retrograde step … There has been a notable reduction in emissions and businesses have not found it to be the imposition that they said it would be.


This is a man who served in Margaret Thatcher's government. This is no radical. He is a man who served in Margaret Thatcher's government.


We had the US Secretary of the Treasury, Henry Paulson, saying last month that Australia would be making a huge mistake in dropping the ETS. Again, he is no radical. We have had more Australian economists than I could poke a stick at saying the same. AMP Capital's chief economist, Shane Oliver, said:


… it was hard to say the carbon tax had had any negative macro–economic impacts on Australia such as on growth and employment.


Ross Garnaut has said in a newly published interview today that:


There’s no doubt that Australia is out of step. First of all, out of step for not dealing more strongly with the issue of climate change—you can reduce emissions and play your full part in an international effort without a market-based mechanism, it’s just that the alternatives are more expensive, more difficult, and less certain to deliver good results than an emissions trading scheme or broadly based carbon pricing in other forms.


Across the world we have major economies, major trading partners, moving in one direction and we are moving from that place backwards. We are retreating from action on climate change.


The benefit of an emissions trading scheme is that you put in place a cap on carbon pollution and then people trade within that cap to find the least-cost way of remaining under it. Even if those opposite do not believe what the vast majority of scientists around the world believe, why do they think it is a bad thing to reduce air pollution in Australia? Can anyone explain to me why we do not let people dump whatever they want in rivers, why we do not let people dump whatever they want on the side of the street, and yet we do not want to limit the carbon pollution we are putting into the atmosphere? I have never heard from those opposite why it is a bad idea to limit the amount of pollution going into our atmosphere.


I said earlier that this is a scheme that is working. In the very short time that this scheme has been in place, Australia's wind capacity has trebled. More than a million households have had solar panels installed, up from fewer than 7,500 under Prime Minister Howard. Employment in the renewable energy industry has more than doubled, to over 24,000 people. Has there been the python squeeze; has it wiped Whyalla off the map; has it led to $100 legs of lamb? None of the disastrous predictions have come true. In fact, 160,000 jobs were created in the first year. The economy continued to grow at 2½ per cent, and inflation remained low. Pollution in the National Electricity Market decreased by seven per cent, and renewable power generation as a share of the National Electricity Market increased by 25 per cent. We have a scheme that is working, and we should move to the next phase of that scheme—a proper emissions trading scheme with a floating price—but we do need to take real action on reducing carbon pollution because the environmental and economic debt we are leaving our children through inaction is completely unacceptable.

"Wicks, Lucy, MP",LP,2014-07-14,"



Mrs WICKS
 (Robertson) (16:02):  I am pleased to rise in support of the carbon tax repeal legislation, because the repeal of the carbon tax is a core commitment that we made to the people of my electorate of Robertson in the lead-up to the last election. Day after day, month after month and for more than a year prior to September 2013 I spoke with tens of thousands of people in my electorate who told me emphatically that they did not want a carbon tax. We had signatures from thousands of people who were prepared to put their name to a petition to see this toxic tax axed. I met with people in their homes in Green Point, Point Frederick, East Gosford, Kariong and Point Clare; in cafes at Erina, Woy Woy, Gosford and Terrigal; on street corners at Umina, Avoca Beach and Kincumber; and in people's local businesses right across the coast. The overwhelming response from people on the Central Coast was that they did not want a carbon tax—a carbon tax that before the 2010 election we were told would not be implemented. But after the election, all of a sudden, it was. The people on the Central Coast told me that the overwhelming reason for their determination to see the carbon tax scrapped was the impact on their cost of living, especially their electricity and gas bills, and the impact on jobs. The cost of living and the need for more local jobs in my electorate are two important concerns and today I am proud to stand in this chamber and say to the people of my electorate that through these bills the coalition government will lower your bills.


I will never forget the stories of some of the householders I spoke with following the implementation of this toxic tax. A nurse I spoke with at Woy Woy was concerned about the wellbeing of her 80-something-year-old mother, who was refusing to turn on the heater at night in the middle of winter because she could not afford the electricity bills. There was the retired gentleman I doorknocked in Umina who spoke of his concern that, should the cost of electricity continue to rise, he would be forced to consider selling his home just to pay his bills. Pensioners are crying out for the carbon tax to be scrapped, and I am pleased to note that age pensioners will significantly benefit from the carbon tax being scrapped—they will keep the Clean Energy Supplement and, furthermore, the pension will continue to increase twice a year as it always has.


I will always remember the story of a local business on the peninsula who told me they were forced to choose between paying the carbon tax on their electricity bill or letting go one of their part-time or casual workers. Such is the impact of this tax. That is why we are committed to abolishing the carbon tax and why we will not stop until that is done—this government takes its election commitments seriously. Our commitments reflect what the Australian people voted for—what people on the Central Coast voted for—and our absolute awareness of this $550 a year hit on households. It is not just a hit on households; it is also a massive hit on local businesses. Central Coast New South Wales Business Chamber Regional Manager Daniel Farmer told me that the carbon tax simply is not fair. He said that small business is the backbone of the Central Coast's economy, and it is not fair for them to have to pay increased costs for services such as electricity, distribution and resources. I have heard Daniel describe the carbon tax several times as a slap in the face and yet another surcharge that small businesses are forced to pay. The President of the Peninsula Chamber of Commerce, Matthew Wales, told me that his chamber has always endorsed abolishing the carbon tax because it has a direct impact on electricity prices which in turn affect small businesses and their competitiveness in the market place. This is particularly important on the peninsula, where a majority of businesses are small and medium enterprises.


The owner of Starship Cruises, based in Gosford, Alan Draper said his maintenance costs are soaring because the cost of producing parts and even the cost of servicing has gone up, thanks to the impact of higher electricity costs for businesses and manufacturing industry since the implementation of the carbon tax. Another local business owner, Beau Woodley, who owns Central Coast Plastering Service, has described the increase in cost to buy the materials he needs as 'dramatic'. Mr Woodley already has significant running costs, and the carbon tax has become a burden. In his words, he will rest easier at night once the carbon tax has gone. The owner of a business in West Gosford, Packaging Plus, Greg Howell, told me that electricity bills have significantly increased since the introduction of the carbon tax. It is now more expensive to run his business and he too wants this toxic tax gone. The impact of the carbon tax is also being felt by local real estate agents. Kerrie Ryan, the owner of Ray White at Killcare is apprehensive about future annual increases in the carbon tax and how this will affect bills—that is, unless we scrap the tax. This is why I am so pleased to support the carbon tax repeal legislation now before the House.


Labor's carbon tax has already caused $15.4 billion worth of damage to the Australian economy in its first two years of operation. And, as Kerrie Ryan from Ray White Killcare feared, from this month the carbon tax is expected to rise by more than five per cent from $24.15 to $25.40 per tonne. This hike will put even more pressure on families and businesses. The carbon tax means higher electricity prices, more jobs at risk and damage to Australia's international competitiveness. What is worse is that members on the opposite side know this. Even though they know this, the former Member for Robertson—now a Labor senator in the other place—has voted to keep the carbon tax, despite all the evidence to the contrary that the people of the Central Coast want it scrapped. Labor has another chance to support for repeal of the carbon tax and vote in favour of lower electricity prices for Australian families. Today I call on Labor to stop standing in the way of much needed relief for families on the Central Coast.


Treasury modelling has shown that the removal of the carbon tax in 2014-15 will reduce average costs for households by around $550 a year. It is estimated that retail electricity should be around nine per cent lower and retail gas prices around seven per cent lower. On this basis, a household's average electricity bills will be around $200 lower than they otherwise would be and average gas bills will be around $70 lower. The termination of the carbon tax will reduce the consumer price index by around 0.7 percentage points. And business compliance costs are expected to fall by around $87.6 million per annum as a consequence of repealing the carbon tax.


The question people have been asking me over the past few months, and particularly over the last couple of weeks, when I am out and about buying a coffee in Gosford, or speaking with small businesses in Umina, or greeting commuters at Woy Woy station, or having a cup of tea or coffee with local residents at one of the regular community morning teas that we hold across my electorate—in Copacobana, Tascott, Terrigal or Ettalong—is always the same: 'Why won't Labor get out of the way?' The carbon tax just does not do what Labor and the Greens claimed it would do. In its first year, the carbon tax raised $7.6 billion but emissions were almost unchanged. Looking ahead, domestic emissions are projected not to fall, as those on the other side of the House claim as the reason they are clinging to this toxic tax, but in actual fact to rise to rise under the carbon tax—from 560 million tonnes in 2010 to 621 million tonnes in 2020.


This is a tax that impacts on the lowest income earners in our society, but it does not do the job it was supposed to do. The coalition government has a plan and is firmly committed to reducing Australia's emissions. We are determined to meet our target of being at five per cent below 2000 levels by 2020. To achieve this, our Direct Action program will see us plant more trees, capture more carbon in soils and clean up power stations. We are proposing to invest some $2.5 billion in practical measures to help the environment and not to harm our economy in the process.


I have been out on the ground in places like Copacabana, Macmasters Beach and Erina Creek, working with local community groups to help clean up our environment. Some of these areas may benefit under the coalition's Green Army program. The Green Army will be Australia's largest-ever team supporting environmental action across the country, building to 15,000 young Australians by 2018. I do not support the carbon tax because it has done nothing to help our environment, but it has done a lot to hurt our economy. It has resulted in a tax that reaches deep into the pockets of families on the Central Coast and takes out $550 a year. It is a direct hit on local businesses and it is a hit on local jobs and local job opportunities on the Central Coast.


When the carbon tax is scrapped, the price for groceries, for household items and for services should also fall because the price of power is embedded in every price in our economy. When the price of power comes down, the ACCC will be ready to ensure that these price cuts are passed on. I support the carbon tax repeal legislation because people in my electorate of Robertson are demanding that we scrap the carbon tax. These amendments, and I understand they have been circulated, will ensure there is no doubt as to what they cover—gas, electricity and synthetic greenhouse gas bulk importers. In addition to the $1.1 million penalty in the original bills, some complementary amendments will be included. As the Minister for the Environment outlined in the House earlier in this debate, the amendments are designed to ensure large suppliers of regulated goods, electricity, natural gas and synthetic greenhouse gases must pass on all cost savings. They will impose a penalty on electricity and natural gas suppliers equal to 250 per cent of any cost savings they do not pass on. They require electricity and natural gas retailers and bulk importers of synthetic greenhouse gases to inform the ACCC and customers about how they are passing on cost savings. Businesses should be able to explain to customers how changes in their costs are flowing through to changes in their prices. The government is aware that major electricity and gas retailers are already committed to providing this information to households and businesses on bills, inserts and websites.


In conclusion, I restate that this government is determined to repeal the carbon tax. Every day the carbon tax stays in place costs Australians $11 million on their power bills. We are voting to scrap the carbon tax because that is the best way to take pressure off families, particularly families on the Central Coast, as well as help the economy. I commend these bills to the House.

"Bandt, Adam, MP",AG,2014-07-14,"



Mr BANDT
 (Melbourne) (16:15):  This is parliament's asbestos moment. This is parliament's tobacco moment. This is the moment when we have all the facts at our fingertips and have to make a decision about whether to act. When we look back on this moment, we will see this as the point when we knew that the way we had been doing things was no longer sustainable. This is the point when we decide whether we let the large companies that are making a lot of money out of hurting people and hurting the planet keep going—or whether we do the right thing by the community and by our children.


Australia for many years has been powered by coal. Our electricity networks are really a series of copper lines out to coalmines. This has been the story for a good part of two centuries—not because a group of people sat around and worked out how they could do the most damage to the society. It happened because for many years we here in Australia thought, as did the rest of the world, that you could dig up coal and burn it for free. We thought that it was, to use the terminology of the last century—still repeated by this government—a 'cheap source of energy'. 


But what we are realising—what we have now known for at least a couple of decades and probably longer—is that, when you dig up fossil fuels and burn them, you put pollution into the atmosphere. It is basic physics. When you put pollution into the atmosphere, if you do it on a worldwide scale and if you do it long enough, you start to change the planet's temperature. The greenhouse effect, as it used to be called, kicks in. We have been put on notice that, as surely as night follows day, if we keep burning fossil fuels,, we will heat the planet up. What is incontrovertible is that, since the beginning of the industrial era, we collectively as a species, despite all the amazing things we have done, have heated the planet by about 0.8 of a degree. What we also know—because the scientists have been telling us until they reach the point of despair—is that, even if we turned off all pollution in the world tomorrow, lags in the climate system mean that we will still have heated up the planet by about another 0.7 or 0.8 of a degree, so we are up to close to about 1.6 degrees. 


That 1.6 degrees might not sound like a lot, but the thing is that the planet is not like this room, where you can turn the thermostat up and down and adjust the temperature. The planet is more like the human body, where you have a narrow range of temperatures within which your body can be safe. If your body gets too hot or too cold, the doctor might not be able to tell you exactly which organ will fail and might not be able to tell you exactly how sick you will get, but any doctor will tell you that you do not want to go there and that you want to stay within the safe range. The planet has a safe range and the scientists, again, have been telling us until they are blue in the face that we cannot heat this planet by more than about two degrees without running the risk of runaway climate change—and that means that things might start happening that we can no longer control.


In the Arctic, for example, not only will the ice sheet start melting faster but feedback loops may kick in. If you shrink the expanse of white, resulting in more dark space, more heat will be absorbed from the sun—because white surfaces reflect light energy while dark surfaces absorb it and heat up. That means the ocean will heat up and the ice will melt even quicker—and so the feedback loop kicks in. The scientists tell us that we may not be able to stop these kinds of feedback loops and that, if we want a better than even chance of staying safe, we should stay below the two-degree guardrail. 


As I have just said, however, we know that we are already at about 1.6 or 1.7 degrees of warming. That means that the decisions we make within the next couple of decades are crucial. That is why the Climate Commission called this 'the critical decade'. They are saying that it is not free to pollute—fossil fuels are not a cheap source of energy. It comes at a massive cost to the planet and to the people on the planet. 


You have two choices when faced with that. You either say to the big polluters in this country and elsewhere, 'We are now going to make you pay for the cost, or at least part of the cost, of the pollution you are putting into the atmosphere that affects our health and affects our way of life.' That is the approach that currently exists. The alternative is to do what the government is proposing, which is to say, 'Tell you what: instead of the big polluters paying the government and the government giving half that money to households, we will make households pay—so we can give money to the big polluters to keep on polluting.' That is the absurd choice we are being faced with with this set of bills that the government wants to rush through this parliament today. After the election in 2010, we the Greens were in the position to secure action on global warming. Working together with the then Labor government and other members of the crossbench, we put a price on pollution. In addition, we secured things that had never been secured before in this country—a Clean Energy Finance Corporation that would put $10 billion into cleaner, renewable energy in this country, so that Australia could become a renewable energy powerhouse and would have something to sell to the rest of the world in 15 years time that was not just coal and gas, but was clean energy technology.


We secured ARENA—$3 billion to go into early stage research and development for solar and wind farms around this country—and we secured the Climate Change Authority, which would give this government independent advice about just how quickly we needed to act on global warming if we want to preserve the Australian way of life. Those things had never before been put on the table by any political party other than the Greens, and we secured them in 2010. I thank the previous Labor government for delivering on that, and I thank the members of the crossbench for working to deliver on that, because we did something that had not been done before. We had conservative country independents, progressive city independents, the Greens and Labor all on the same page, informed by experts and coming up with a way of putting a price on pollution and then putting the money into compensation for households and into developing clean energy in this country.


We are now at the point where it looks like some of that is going to go, but it also looks like some of it is going to stay. In that respect I want to note the Palmer United Party senators, who have agreed to keep those gains secured by the Greens—ARENA, the CEFC, the Climate Change Authority, and also the securing of the renewable energy target. That is very, very important; and I thank them for that. But I say to everyone in this chamber that there are two types of denial about climate change. There is denying the science, which is what our Prime Minister and most of this government is famous for. Then there is the denying of the consequences of the science. The thing about believing in climate change is that you cannot be half pregnant. Once you accept that global warming is real, then it means that we have to act—we have to act now if we want to make sure that we preserve the Australian way of life for the rest of us in this country, and everyone who comes after us. In that respect I say to Labor, to the extent that this forces you to go back to the drawing board: please break your bipartisan agreement with the coalition for an appalling five per cent emissions reduction—that is a death sentence. If you go to the next election saying that a five per cent cut in pollution is enough, you will be condemned, just as the coalition is being condemned.


The reality at the moment is that we have a government that is saying the science of climate change is 'absolute crap' and people can keep on polluting in the way they have been, and that has a five per cent emissions reduction target that is not even legally binding. You know it is not legally binding, and the Minister for the Environment knows it is not legally binding, because the government has said that if the money runs out they will not keep spending to reach five per cent—or happily we will reach three or four per cent, maybe. We know that in the face of that coming from this government, the two biggest threats to the Australian way of life are global warming and Tony Abbott, the Prime Minister. This Prime Minister is writing this country a prescription for more bushfires happening more often, more intense weather events, and more heatwaves.


I do not know about you, but I do not want to go on every Christmas holiday worrying about where the next bushfire is going to hit, or worrying about how many people are going to die from the heatwaves. But what we know—because the scientists employed by the government have told us over and over again—is that in Victoria, for example, unless we get global warming under control, we can expect to see something like the Black Saturday bushfires happening, on average, every two years. They tell us that Melbourne's climate will become like Cowra, and that they cannot find an analogous place on earth to describe what Darwin will be like under four degrees of warming, because that is what is in store.


We are doing this a very short period of time after scientists have also told us that they fear the West Antarctic ice sheet may be irreversibly melting. Faced with the biggest-ever threat to our way of life, our Prime Minister chooses a policy of appeasement. This is an appeasing government that is selling out our future and is one of the biggest threats to our way of life that we have seen. Ronald Reagan—hardly someone I quote often—said that the first duty of every government is to protect its people, but Tony Abbott, the Prime Minister, is failing in that duty, because he is giving Australians a prescription for a worse way of life.


In the summer accompanying the Black Saturday bushfires, more people died from the heatwaves than died in the bushfires themselves, and that is what we know is in store for us here in Australia. The vulnerable, the poor, the elderly—those who cannot afford to fit out their houses with air conditioning in the same way that others might be able to and whose health is already frail—are the ones who are going to suffer the most, thanks to this government. In recognition of the fact that, if we are to accept the science of climate change, we also have to accept the consequences of that science, I move the following amendment. I move:


That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:


""the House declines to give the bill a second reading and:


(1) notes that:


(a) the world is on track for 4 degrees of warming; and


(b) warming of less than 1 degree is already intensifying extreme -weather events in Australia and around the world with enormous costs to life and property; and


(2) calls on the Government to:


(a) protect the Australian people and environment from climate change by approving no new coal mines or extensions of existing mines, or new coal export terminals; and


(b) adopt a trajectory of 40-60% below 2000 levels by 2030 and net carbon zero by 2050 emissions reduction target in global negotiations for a 2015 treaty.""


In the last minute and a half, I want to talk about how, as many people would know, the science of climate change led me to quit my job and start running in elections. It was the understanding that we have a decade or two to turn the ship around or else we are in serious trouble, the understanding that global warming is already influencing the extreme weather that we are seeing, the understanding that we have just experienced the hottest year, the hottest month and the hottest day on record and the understanding that if you are under 30 in this world you have never experienced a March that is cooler than the average March or a January that is cooler than the average January. In other words, if you are under 30, you have never experienced a cooler than average month on this planet. It was in light of all of that that I started running in elections and got involved in politics. 


I feel incredibly proud to have achieved the laws that we are debating here today, some of which may be repealed but some of which may be kept. But this is not about me or really about any of us in here; it is about the rest of the country and all of those who are coming after us and whether we are prepared to be the next James Hardie or the next British American Tobacco— (Time expired)

(

):  Is the amendment seconded? 

",HoR,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,19,2
"Wilkie, Andrew, MP",Ind.,2014-07-14,"



Mr WILKIE
 (Denison) (16:30):  I second the amendment moved by my colleague the member for Melbourne. I commend the member for Melbourne on his unflinching commitment to keep the pressure up in this place to do something about climate change. I urge the members of this House to embrace the amendment, because to do otherwise would be madness. Frankly, it is madness to be wanting to wind back strong action on climate change. It is madness to be wanting to take the price off carbon. I just do not get it. I do not see why the government is wanting to act in this way for any reason other than its political self-interest and trying to score political points in an important area of public policy. That can be the only explanation for the behaviour of this government, because every other way that you might approach the challenge in this area of public policy you reach the same conclusion. When you approach this issue from any other direction, you reach the conclusion that we must act on climate change and this includes first and foremost putting a price on carbon and keeping a price on carbon. This will ensure that the price on carbon sends a very strong signal to the markets that companies which pollute must clean up their act and a strong signal to consumers to stay away from products that are more expensive because they are based on polluting the climate and, instead, to go towards products and services that are cheaper because they are based on production techniques and ways of doing things that are better for the environment. 


I think one of the problems is that too many members on that side of the chamber, too many members of the government, will not admit—some will admit and others will not, although I suspect many of them admit it in their private conversations with their constituents—that they do not believe in climate change. They need to admit it: they are deniers. They do not believe that mankind is making the environment more dirty and that, because of it, we are helping to change the climate. Yes, the climate has changed over millennia for all sorts of reasons, but surely there can be no doubt that, in 2014, it is the behaviour of human kind that is accelerating the change in climate in bad and dangerous ways. 


The member for Melbourne has eloquently talked about extreme weather events and the fact that it is only a matter of time before catastrophic bushfires will be regular events, perhaps every couple of years. Yes, with some of the effects of climate change, a rich, lucky and fortunate country like Australia will be able to adapt but what about less developed countries, less rich countries—countries in our region? They do not have the riches and the know-how that we have. We could move entire cities if we had to; but they cannot. They will die—and they will die in droves—from the effects of climate change. Because of the effects of climate change and its cost to us in Australia, we have to do something about it. But perhaps a greater moral imperative is to do something about it so as to help those less fortunate people than ourselves, who are less well equipped to do something about climate change. 


I do not get why so many members of the government just do not believe in climate change. There is an overwhelming consensus amongst the very best minds in the world that the climate is changing on account of human kind and that we must change the way we do business. Members of the government do not seem to understand that this is not just a problem now. In some ways, the bigger problem will be in the future and the world that we will leave to our children, their children and their children. In fact, climate change is one of the most dramatic examples of intergenerational social injustice that you could possibly comprehend. What right do we have? We have no right to leave the world knowingly in a worse state than when we found it. As the father of a seven-year-old and a five-year-old, I want to be able to look them in the eye—and I cannot fathom why members of the government are not wanting to look their children and their grandchildren in the eye; surely, they want to look them in the eye—and say: 'When push came to shove and we had the opportunity in this place to do something about climate change, we did something. We acted.' How are the members of the government going to look their kids and grand-kids in the eye and say that they were the government that took the price off carbon and left it to future generations to deal with the problems of climate change—and a greater problem it will be. 


We must take a leadership position in this place and make the tough decisions. We as a nation must take a leadership position on the global stage. While the percentage of global pollution that comes from Australia is but a proportion of global pollution, it would not even matter if it were zero pollution: there would still be the moral imperative for us to take a leadership role on the global stage. 


I do not know what Robert Menzies would think about what has happened to the Liberal Party, and I will associate the Country Party, now The Nationals, with that comment. Even if you did not agree with the Liberal Party of the Menzies era, it was still a great party. There might have been policies which people disagreed with, but it was still a great party. What has the Liberal Party now become? It is the party of invading Iraq and of sending asylum seekers back to the authorities from which they claim to be fleeing. It is now the party that would dismantle the monumental reform of the 43rd Parliament to put a price on carbon—and a monumental and difficult reform it was. History will show that the decision by the 43rd Parliament to put a price on carbon was one of the greatest political achievements of any government in any parliament since Federation. So too will history record that in removing the price on carbon the government in the 44th Parliament made one of the greatest blunders of any government.


There is a lot of talk in here about the economy. How about we start talking about the environment? How about we start talking about society? How about we start talking about the public interest and the interests of our kids, their kids and those who will follow them? If we started talking about the environment, about the community and about the future for our kids, maybe people in this place would have a different response, instead of just talking just about the economy. Yes, it does cost to make the world a better place. That is a cost that we should be prepared to pay. What right do we have to say that the price is too much now but will not be too much for our kids in the future? We do not have that right, particularly when the costs we are leaving our kids will be so much greater at a time of unknown economic circumstances. We do not know what capacity they will have to pay the bill we are going to leave them. They may have much reduced capacity to pay the bill we are leaving them. We have no right to leave them that bill, because we and the people who came before us ran up this tab. We have a moral obligation to pay the bill now and pay it while it is affordable. And it is affordable. Yes, we are looking at a system that sends price signals and makes some things more expensive. I am not going to shy away from that; I am not going to dodge that. That is the whole point of putting a price on carbon—making dirty things dearer, making clean things cheaper, steering businesses towards doing things more cleanly, steering consumers towards buying things that are produced more cleanly. Yes, electricity and gas become a little bit dearer. It is no wonder, then, that we are seeing so much movement towards renewables, technologies that are becoming cheaper. That is the whole point. We should be celebrating, not demonising, the achievements of the 43rd Parliament. We really should be.


Where does this leave our senators? I have nothing personal against the Liberal or Palmer United senators for Tasmania. They are all good people in their own way. But I disagree with them on this; I disagree with them very, very strongly. In doing away with the price on carbon, Tasmanian senators are not acting in my state's best interest. It is well remarked upon by now that doing away with the price on carbon will cost Hydro in my state $70 billion a year and hundreds of jobs. That is a fact. Do not look at me with a funny, quizzical look, Member for Corangamite. It is a fact. Getting rid of the carbon price will cost my state dearly. This is another good example of where senators need to stand up for their state and not let their chain be yanked by their political party. If the Liberal and Palmer United Party senators stood up for Tasmania, then all 12 senators—Liberal, Palmer, Labor and the Greens—would be voting against the repeal of a price on carbon. But they will not. They will allow their chains to be yanked by their party masters. That is a serious failure of the Senate.


I have been very, very alarmed in recent days to hear and see the comments of some corporations in this country that they will not pass on any reduction in price from the abolition of the price on carbon. I read just yesterday that Qantas and Jetstar are saying that there will be no price reduction. Heavens! They were some of the first companies to say that the price would go through the roof. They had better pass on any savings that come from the abolition of a price on carbon. A comment was made in question time that, I think it was, Woolworths was saying that there was no real extra cost then, so there will not be any reductions in prices now. That had better not be the case, because I will be out the front on the barricades steering consumers towards those companies that act honestly and ethically and do genuinely pass on any reductions in price coming from the abolition of the price on carbon. Let the market judge those companies that do not pass on any reductions in prices coming from these developments. To that end, the Palmer United Party attempt to at least hold some companies to account is in principle a good idea. I hope, Minister, that the government will keep a close eye on all operators in the market to ensure that they all genuinely pass on to the consumer any reduction in the cost of production.


This is a very, very sad day in this place. It is a repeat of the very sad day we had when this legislation went through the House previously. It all comes down to crass politics. There are enough good men and women in the government, people of sharp mind and good heart, who understand the importance of putting a price on carbon not just for the environment but for the community, for our kids and for the economy, because it will help prepare us for the future global economy, because all our trading partners are moving or have moved to put a price on carbon.


It disappoints me greatly that they are prepared to put the delivery of a three-word slogan during an election campaign and what was ultimately just a strategy to destruct the previous government ahead of the public interest, ahead of the economy and certainly ahead of the environment. That is a terrible failure of governments in this country, that any party would be prepared to do that.


Again, I make the point: I just do not get it. I do not know why people would do that. I do not know why people would not understand the science. But what about those who do understand science? As a speaker made the point earlier, even if they do not believe the science about climate change, surely they understand that it is a good idea to help clean up the environment? I think it was the member for Sydney who said that we do not let people put sludge in the river or drop litter by the roadside so why is it okay to pump pollution into the atmosphere? Why can we not put politics aside for a moment? I do not get it, other than to understand that in this area of public policy this government is failing us terribly. And let the record show that. Let the record show for a long time to come which government and which members voted to put a price on carbon. And that the record show which members are now working to overturn it.


At least I will be able, and I know that the member for Melbourne will be able, to look at the next generation in the eye—




Ms MacTiernan:
  As will we!




Mr WILKIE:
  And the members of the Labor Party, and good on you! The Labor Party has been  good on this, and I applaud them. I do not applaud them for everything but I will certainly applaud them for this.


At least we can look our kids and their kids in the eye and we can see that when the pressure was on we did the right thing.

Ms HENDERSON
 (Corangamite) (16:46):  I rise to speak on the Clean Energy Legislation (Carbon Tax Repeal) Bill 2014 and related bills this afternoon. We, as a government, are determined to repeal the carbon tax. In my electorate of Corangamite, throughout the Geelong region and across our nation, this is an insidious tax. It is a tax on jobs, a tax on agriculture and, particularly, a tax on manufacturing. The carbon tax represents a $1.1 billion-hit on manufacturing each and every year. So far, the carbon tax has cost our nation some $15.4 billion over two years. I refer to the contribution that we have just heard in the House made by the member for Denison. He did express concern about the cost on our children and our grandchildren. I say to the member for Denison and I say to those opposite: we are concerned about the cost that this tax is causing to our economy. We are concerned about the way in which the previous Labor government drove up the debt and the deficit. We are adamant that as a government we are determined to wind back and to tackle the irresponsible spending under the previous government.




Mr Bandt:
  This raises money!




Ms HENDERSON:
  You can sit there and laugh, member for Melbourne! You think it is funny! But it is not funny—the cost of living for many people in my electorate and across the nation is a really serious issue. As we have spoken about today and for many days since our election, and before that, the carbon tax is costing every family $550 a year on average. That is no laughing matter, because for many people in my electorate and across the nation a nine per cent increase in electricity and a seven per cent increase in gas actually mean a lot.


It actually makes a big difference for low-income households. It actually means that elderly people—the vulnerable—are sitting there not knowing whether to turn the heater on or off because of the cost of their power. This may be a laughing matter to you but for many people the cost of living is a really serious issue. In my electorate it is a particularly serious issue, given some of the—




Mr Wilkie:
  Mr Acting Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I was definitely not laughing; I had a most serious look on my face. I would be appalled if anyone listening to that speech or reading the Hansard would think that I would laugh at that! These are very serious matters.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Vasta
):  I thank the member for Denison. The member for Corangamite has the call.




Ms HENDERSON:
  Members opposite have spoken about the compensation package they offered when in government—a compensation package that we are keeping—




Mr Wilkie:
  Mr Acting Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I would be grateful if the member for Corangamite withdrew that comment about me laughing. I was not laughing.




Ms HENDERSON:
  Mr Acting Deputy Speaker, I will not withdraw that comment because the member for Denison was laughing. I am sorry, that is not a correct—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member for Corangamite has the call. She will be heard in silence. There will be no points of order. Let the member for Corangamite finish her speech, please.




Ms HENDERSON:
  We have heard today members opposite talking about the compensation package offered when in government—




Mr Wilkie:
  That was a bold-faced lie!



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member for Denison has other means of addressing that, not in the middle of her speech.




Ms HENDERSON:
  This is a compensation package that we are keeping whilst repealing the carbon tax. But one of the many flaws with Labours carbon tax was that it forgot small business. It forgot about the costs imposed on small business through higher electricity and gas prices—butchers, bakers, grocers. Of course, let's face it, Labor forgot about small business generally—519,000 jobs were lost in small business over the six years that Labor was in power.


It forgot about our manufacturers, as I mentioned. There was a $1.1 billion-hit on manufacturing. In my electorate of Corangamite just consider the case of Boral, then—now known as Blue Circle Southern Cement in Waurn Ponds. Under the previous Labor government 90 people at Boral lost their jobs. While there were various cost pressures on Boral, the carbon tax ensured that Boral was less competitive on the international market. The cost of making clinker was driven higher by some 18 per cent because of the carbon tax, and now we see Blue Circle Southern Cement importing clinker and only 20 or so employees remaining at this production facility.


Labor also forgot about our farmers, and particularly our dairy farmers. Let's look at the cost imposed on dairying as a result of the carbon tax. It has driven up the cost of power for our dairy farmers by between $5,000 and $7,000 a year. Many of the dairy farmers in my electorate and across south-west Victoria simply cannot afford that cost hike and that has placed real pressures on such an important industry. Labor forgot about the likes of Bulla ice-cream, one of Colac's most successful local manufacturers. It forgot about the likes of Murray Goulburn, which is currently paying $14 million a year in carbon tax, and Fonterra, which is paying a carbon tax bill of around $7 million a year. I note that some 130 people lost their jobs at Fonterra just outside Colac about 18 months ago.


Let us not forget what Labor's policy is. If Labor was still in power, we would have seen a carbon tax on diesel fuel which would see the cost of off-road diesel rise by 6.5c a litre. That would be a direct hit on mining and manufacturing. Again, that is bad for business, it is bad for jobs and it is bad for our international competitiveness.


In question time today we heard from the member for Port Adelaide, who boasted about how he had terminated the carbon tax—how Labor had terminated the carbon tax and, as a result of doing that, they were going to be addressing cost of living pressures on ordinary Australian families. This is a great example of Labor saying one thing before the election and another, entirely different, thing after the election. Time and time again we see members opposite supporting the carbon tax. This is hypocrisy at its very worst.


It was disappointing to hear from the member for Melbourne today and some of his rhetoric in portraying our party as one that does not believe in climate change.




Mr Watts:
  You don't!




Ms HENDERSON:
  This is fundamentally untrue.




Mr Watts:
  Is it absolute crap?




Ms HENDERSON:
  The coalition government has a very strong commitment to combating climate change. There is a strong commitment to renewable energy.



Opposition members interjecting—




Ms HENDERSON:
  There, again, we see laughter—




Mr Watts:
  We're laughing at you!




Ms HENDERSON:
  from the member from Melbourne. It really is disappointing.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Order! The member for Corangamite has the call.




Ms HENDERSON:
  It was actually the coalition under John Howard that introduced the renewable energy target which has done so much to drive investment in renewable energy. We are very proud of what we have done, but there is a better way than a jobs-destroying carbon tax. I want particularly to make reference to what we are doing to drive down carbon emissions.


We have a very strong commitment to reduce carbon emissions by five per cent below 2000 levels by the year 2020. The government will reach its target through direct action with the Emissions Reduction Fund as its centrepiece. Our plan is to efficiently and effectively source low-cost emissions reduction and improve Australia's environment. This is a $2.55 billion commitment to our environment—to driving down carbon emissions. It has been opposed by those opposite.




Mr Watts:
  That's a lot of magic beans!



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Order! The member for Gellibrand will let the member for Corangamite speak in silence.




Ms HENDERSON:
  Through the Emissions Reduction Fund we will provide incentives for abatement activities across the Australian economy, rather than by pushing up prices in the hope of making electricity unaffordable. The Emissions Reduction Fund will support projects such as upgrading commercial buildings for energy efficiency; improving energy efficiency elsewhere in homes and industrial facilities; reducing electricity generation emissions; capturing landfill gas; reducing waste coalmine gas; reforesting and revegetating marginal lands; improving Australia's agricultural soils; upgrading vehicles and improving transport logistics; and managing fires in savanna grasslands. Countries around the world, as the Minister for the Environment discussed in his second reading speech a number of weeks ago, are implementing the schemes which work best for them. In Australia, we will introduce the scheme that works best for Australia—not one that is going to be a $15.4 billion hit to the Australian economy.


At the moment in my electorate of Corangamite, and across the Geelong region, manufacturing is under particular pressure. Part of that is because of the cost of electricity. We must have the most competitive manufacturing sector we possibly can. I have spoken many times about the importance of advanced manufacturing and what our government is doing to invest in advanced manufacturing through our Geelong Region Innovation and Investment Fund, our growth fund, our strong investment in jobs and projects like the East West Link—another project that members opposite are opposing which will deliver in excess of 6,000 construction jobs. We cannot afford this toxic tax.


I want to make particular note of the member for Corio. Corio is an area which is particularly dependent on manufacturing and it is a poor reflection on the member for Corio's capacity to stand up for his electorate because he has remained silent on this tax. He has not stood up for his electorate; he has not stood up for manufacturing; he has not stood up for the many important employees and employers in his electorate and spoken out against this tax that he knows is driving up the cost of electricity and gas and really hurting manufacturers.


I am very proud to be speaking on these bills today. These are bills that will do much to improve Australia's economy and I commend these bills to the House.

"Bandt, Adam, MP",AG,2014-07-14,"



Mr BANDT
 (Melbourne) (18:04):  I was making the point when this matter was last before the House that the government, when you look at the various pieces of legislation that they are putting forward and what is in the budget, is coming for people's rights at work indirectly this time around. They have learnt the lesson from the John Howard era of WorkChoices that if you come and attack people's rights at work they will fight back and they will turf you out. So now, this time, the government is coming at it in a far more sly fashion. As I mentioned last time, we are seeing legislation that will enable people who work to be paid in kind by the businesses that they work for. If you work at the fish and chips shop, expect now to be paid partly in fish and chips. You cannot pay your rent with that, you cannot pay your electricity bill with that, but that is no concern of the Prime Minister's.


And then we see this bill. It is said by the minister and by those who support it that this bill is about putting corporations and unions on an even footing and saying that organisations of workers should be treated in the same way as organisations that exist to make a profit. I will come back in a moment to the functions of registered organisations that make them very, very different from corporations. But let us just take that suggestion at face value for a moment. If the government was serious about saying that we are now going to regulate corporations in the same way as unions, then what flows from that? Firstly, I can tell you that unions are required under the Fair Work Act and other legislation to be democratic organisations, which means that the people who run those organisations have to be elected to those positions.


So, assuming that the government is right that now corporations are going to be treated the same way, it is going to come as a shock to most CEOs who have been appointed by their board to find out that now they are going to have to be elected, because presumably that is what this government thinks is fair. It is also going to come as a shock to everyone who has a proprietary limited company to learn that their accounts and their financial returns for every year are now going to be published on the internet, because that is what happens with registered organisations and unions at the moment. The standard of scrutiny over their accounts is well above that of someone who sets up a Pty Ltd company.


So if the government is truly serious about this, they will be requiring everyone who incorporates their small business to now not only elect the people who run it but also publish all of their information and their financial affairs on the internet. You understand that the government, of course, is not interested in that. The government is quite happy to let companies run their own race, but feels completely legitimate about coming in and saying to organisations that represent workers, 'We deserve the right to micromanage you in a way that we would never dream of doing to a private company, but we will impose the same penalties on you as we might on a publicly listed company.'


What the government fails completely to understand is that organisations of workers do not exist for the same purposes as businesses. That is where the whole argument behind this legislation falls down. Businesses exist for a purpose. They exist to make a profit. That is what they do and they are judged on that basis. Corporations law requires directors to act in the best interests of their shareholders and continue to make a profit. They are judged accordingly. Unions do not exist that reason. Unions exist to advance the interests of the people they represent.


I very much doubt that, apart from perhaps the odd member of the AMA, anyone on the government's side of the benches has ever been a member of a union. Had they been in a union, actually been involved in a union and understood what unions do, they would not be pursuing this bill. What they would understand is that there are many, many people who work in this country who do not know their rights. There are many people who work in this country who rely on someone to advise them about what they are entitled to, and who then rely on someone to go in and enforce that basic entitlement. That is the role of a union.


Before I came to this place, I worked for many years representing some of the lowest paid workers in this country and their unions. There are people in Melbourne working in garages, sheds or their own rooms who are making the clothes that you will find being sold on Bourke Street or Swanston Street for $200 or $300 and they are getting paid $3 an hour for it. These people do not have sick pay and they do not get annual leave. They are required to look after their own workers' compensation. They usually do not speak English as a first language. If they get injured, they have to look after themselves. They are so-called independent contractors, even though they are doing all the work of employees and of workers.


The only reason that these people are able to enjoy something approaching a decent income and quality of life—which most of us would take for granted—is because they have had a union that has gone in there and told them what their rights are and then gone out and advocated for them. They have had a union that has gone out and fought for changes to our workplace laws. The unions do not do that for their own benefit. They do it for the benefit of others, and they do not get a direct financial benefit from it. That is where unions—and employer organisations as well, because they participate in the industrial sphere with the aim of advancing the conditions of others—are fundamentally different from profit-making companies such as your BHP or your corner shop. It is why they should be treated differently.


I think anyone who has been in a union or has been involved in a union would condemn any union official who breaches that fundamental principle and who starts getting involved in union activity for their own personal benefit. The government is using that as a justification for this law, but I would say two things about that. Firstly, we have seen very clearly that the current laws work when it comes to finding those people and prosecuting them. If the current laws did not work, we would not have people now facing jail sentences. The current laws do work. Secondly, the suggestion that somehow the imposition of new penalties is somehow going to make life better for the people who these organisations are supposedly representing is just fanciful, because if this were a charity the government would be getting up and saying, 'This is red tape.' In fact, that is exactly what the government is saying when it comes to the charities regulator.


With the charities regulator, you have organisations saying, 'We would much rather have a one-stop shop so that we do not have to go to multiple places of regulation and so that everyone can be assured that we are doing the right thing.' The government says, 'No, no. We are going to take that away, because it is too much red tape.' Yet when it comes to unions, they are prepared to put the kinds of regulations and oversight on them that they would never dream of doing to businesses and that they are trying to unwind for charities. So why is the government doing it? It cannot be about better regulation or better governance. They are doing it simply because they know one fundamental fact: for many, many workers and for many people who do not have the time themselves to go out and defend their own interests, because they are just too busy making ends meet or living their own lives, they know that they have unions out there in this country that look after them.


The unions have fought for shorter working weeks in this country and have helped bring us the weekend. It is thanks to unions that we have the penalty rates in this country that mean that people who work unsociable hours get to have a decent income, in recognition of the fact that their family members and their friends might be out having a good time, catching up on the weekend, and yet the workers are stuck at work. Many people know that when they see annual leave loading on their pay slip it is not there because an employer decided, 'What a good idea, I will give it to you.' It was there because it was fought for.


That is why the government is introducing this legislation. It is to tie up workers and their unions in red tape so that they do not have time to go and advance the interests of the people that they are looking after. It is a transparent piece of legislation. The day that the government comes in and says, 'Yes, we are willing to make every private company and every public company subject to the same level of scrutiny, disclosure and democracy as a trade union,' is when I will start taking them seriously that they are interested in levelling the playing field. But they are not interested in that. This is just the wind-up for the attack on people's rights at work. We, on behalf of the Greens, will be having none of that. If someone breaches the law and if someone breaches fundamental principles and starts getting involved in a union for their own personal financial benefit, they deserve to have the book thrown at them. What we are seeing every day is that they will have the book thrown at them. There is no need for this legislation.

",HoR,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Amendment Bill 2014</title>,BILLS,21,1
"McNamara, Karen, MP",LP,2014-07-14,"



Mrs McNAMARA
 (Dobell) (18:15):  This government is committed to improving the fair work laws so we can build a more stable, fair and prosperous future for Australian workers, businesses and the economy. The measures in the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Amendment Bill are a key election commitment and deliver our pre-election policy for better accountability and transparency of registered organisations. There is no doubting the public's support for these measures, particularly in light of recent findings following the Fair Work investigation into the Health Services Union and the current royal commission into registered organisations. This government is determined to improve protection for members of registered organisations through the implementation of a comprehensive plan to enhance the government's accountability of registered organisations. Never again should the hardworking members of an organisation such as the HSU experience misappropriation of their funds towards an individual's personal gain. This is why we are reintroducing the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Amendment Bill. 


When Labor and the Greens combined to vote down this legislation, they demonstrated a refusal to support greater accountability and transparency for registered organisations. They have voted against improved protection for union members and have given the green light to further exploitation of honest union members by dishonest union officials. They have also voted against a clearer and simpler reporting framework that would assist both unions and employer associations to comply. While members opposite champion themselves as the defenders of Australian workers, they will be judged by their actions, not their rhetoric. The shadow minister for employment and workplace relations, the member for Gorton, said during his contribution to the original debate in the House:


… the opposition has no tolerance for corruption—none whatsoever—whether it be by union officials or officers of employer bodies. We support tough penalties for those who break the law. We support appropriate regulation for registered organisations, including a properly empowered regulator and consequences for those who do not follow the rules.


Yet the member for Gorton opposed this legislation and went as far as moving an amendment to deny a second reading on the grounds that the House would be ill advised to continue, having regard to the adverse impact of the creation of the Registered Organisations Commission on registered organisations, including unions and employer and employee groups.


There should be absolutely no question about the importance of this legislation. Until this parliament acts and supports this legislation, Australia will be denied a sufficiently robust system to tackle corruption within registered organisations. It is no longer tenable to argue that the present system is adequate to deal with or discourage the sort of behaviour brought to light by the investigation into the HSU. By rejecting this legislation the unholy Labor-Green alliance has given the green light to more of the same behaviour as demonstrated by the HSU, Craig Thomson and Michael Williamson.


This bill replicates the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Amendment Bill 2013, which was rejected by the Senate on 14 May 2014. However, the previous government's amendments to the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Amendment Act 2012 demonstrated that there was a need to increase financial accountability of registered organisations, strengthen investigative powers and increase penalties. But these changes were not adequate. In a submission to the Senate Standing Committee on Education, Employment and Workplace Relations inquiry into the registered organisations amendment legislation, the Australian Mines and Metals Association advised in reference to the former Labor government: 


… the changes the government has proposed are not tough enough to deliver the accountability that the members of those organisations are seeking 


The Institute of Public Affairs commented:


Further measures should be taken to strengthen the financial management and regulation of registered organisations, commensurate with their considerable financial resources.


This government agrees that the Labor government's amendments did not go far enough. This is why this bill strengthens reporting and disclosure obligations to align more closely with the Corporations Act, moves obligations from the rules of registered organisations to the face of the legislation, and provides the new Registered Organisations Commission greater scope to ensure that officers are complying with their obligations and greater powers to investigate when a member makes a complaint about a registered organisation. It is this government's view that registered organisations should be as accountable to their members as company directors are to their shareholders. Like companies, many registered organisations control assets worth millions of dollars, and we have seen members from the other side access these funds to aid their election campaigns. We want to see that these assets are administered properly and used to benefit members.


According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, in August 2012 1.8 million people were members of trade unions. As of 17 October 2013, there were 112 registered organisations listed with the Fair Work Commission. The majority of these registered organisations are not-for-profit and operate to serve the interests of their members. Some have additional arms or subsidiaries to the organisation that are not related to their status as a registered organisation, such as a for-profit training arm.


For the purpose of this debate, it is important that we acknowledge the financial strength of these registered organisations and demonstrate the level of responsibility assigned to their office bearers. Forty-five per cent of employer organisations and 73 per cent of employee organisations have net assets valued at over $2 million. These assets, and the functions of Registered Organisations, are to protect their members' interests by representing members in industrial matters and campaigning on policies that affect them, such as taxation, workplace relations and broader government policies. Naturally, in order to achieve their aims, registered organisations require funds to cover their direct operating costs, such as advertising and legal matters. These funds are obtained from membership fees, donations and other investments. Therefore, the trust placed in the officials of these registered organisations is high, and the membership deserves appropriate protections and recourse when their funds are misused.


Importantly, this bill introduces higher penalties for beaches of civil penalty provisions, some criminal penalties and stricter reporting and disclosure obligations that compare with those under the Corporations Act 2001. This bill increases penalties for a wide range of civil offences in order to create a real deterrence for wrongdoing by registered organisations and their officers. Serious breaches of an officer's duty, such as where an officer uses their position to obtain benefit for themselves or someone else, are criminal offences. The maximum penalty for these offences is $340,000 or five years imprisonment, or both. The civil penalties for serious contraventions will be $204,000 for an individual or $1,020,000 for a body corporate. Currently maximum penalties for serious offences are only $10,200 for individuals. These offences relate to officers and employees of registered organisations who fail to discharge duties in good faith and for a proper purpose. Criminal sanctions will also apply where an officer does not comply with the commissioner's new investigative powers.


A strong message needs to be sent to discourage wrongdoing by officers and to rebuild the confidence of members and the community. Stronger requirements for registered organisations and stronger penalties will only successfully combat corruption with a tough cop on the beat. This bill establishes the Registered Organisations Commission headed by the Registered Organisations Commissioner. The Registered Organisations Commission will be established within the Office of the Fair Work Ombudsman. Importantly, the commissioner will have independence in the exercise of their functions and powers to direct the staff of the commission. Significantly, the activities of the commission will be subject to the same oversight by the Commonwealth Ombudsman as Commonwealth agencies. This will ensure the appropriate level of transparency and public accountability. 


Whilst members opposite oppose these measures, members of the government have not forgotten why these measures are absolutely necessary. The limitations of the Fair Work Ombudsman were exposed through the investigation into the HSU. Members opposite defended the Fair Work Ombudsman, but it took far too long between the allegations first being raised and the eventual findings by the justice system—in total five years. It is clear that the investigations into the HSU by the Fair Work Commission took too long and questioned the Fair Work Commission's capacity to be an effective regulator of registered organisations.


The Registered Organisations Commission will ensure that allegations of wrongdoing are investigated quickly and efficiently. Its sole focus will be on rules relating to the accountability and transparency of registered organisations. Importantly this bill ensures a strong interaction between the Registered Organisations Commission and the Fair Work Commission. Transitional arrangements are included in the bill to ensure any ongoing matters being dealt with by the Fair Work Commission relating to registered organisations can be dealt with by the newly established Registered Organisations Commission. It is absolutely essential that the Registered Organisations Commissioner be able to share information with law enforcement agencies if they reasonably believe it is to appropriate to do so in the course of conducting their role.


This is in direct response to the recent investigation into the HSU, which exposed shortcomings when dealing with possible breaches of criminal laws. My electorate of Dobell, more than any other electorate, has witnessed firsthand the stench of this corruption within the trade union movement. The charges and allegations against the former Labor-turned-independent member for Dobell, Craig Thomson, along with ALP national president, Michael Williamson, exposed the vulnerability of the current registered organisation arrangements. So serious were the allegations stemming from the systemic rorting in the HSU, the breaches were investigated by both the Fair Work Commission and the Victorian Police.


The Fair Work Commission investigation into the HSU identified a total of 181 contraventions of the Registered Organisations Act and HSU rules by union officials and others. The claim against Mr Thomson included 37 alleged breaches of general duties imposed on officers of registered organisations and a further 25 alleged breaches of HSU rules. In addition to these findings, Mr Thomson was arrested in relation to more than 150 fraud related criminal charges, including allegations that his 2007 federal election campaign was partly funded by union money without authorisation. The magistrate found Mr Thomson guilty of using credit cards issued to him in his role as national secretary of the HSU between 2002 and 2007. Mr Thomson was found guilty of stealing HSU funds and obtaining a financial advantage by deception when he used the HSU credit card to pay for escort services, cigarettes, firewood, travel expenses for his previous wife and withdrawing nearly $10,000 in cash from ATMs.


The hard-working, honest members of registered organisations, such as the HSU, deserve better treatment from the people elected to represent their interests. They also deserve government support to stand by their side, and not by the side of dishonest union officials. If it was not for Mr Thomson and Mr Williams' high-profile involvement in the Australian Labor Party, one wonders if the truth of the matter would ever have been exposed. This government is of the firm belief that corruption and poor governance within Australia's trade union movement should be identified and stopped. This government's determination to stand up for honest union members is exemplified through the establishment of the Royal Commission into Trade Union Governance and Corruption. It is clear that the Australian people have become increasingly concerned about a range of revelations and allegations involving officials of industrial organisations benefiting from certain funds, which have been set up for purposes that are often unknown. In the words of former Prime Minister Julia Gillard:


It's common practice, indeed every union has what it refers to as a re-election fund, slush fund …


The royal commission will ensure that wrongdoing in the union movement is exposed and those responsible for illegal actions are held to account.


This government is serious about protecting workers and tackling a culture riddled with allegations of corruption, dodgy deals and secret funds. The time has come for this legislation to be supported; the rorts, the rackets and the rip-offs must end. Members of registered organisations must have their interests protected, and the community must have faith in our institutions. The only people who have anything to fear by these amendments are those who do the wrong thing. Members of registered organisations and the community have everything to gain. It is time for members opposite to stand with the government to ensure honest workers are not ripped off by dishonest union bosses. I commend this legislation to the House and I call on members opposite to do likewise.

"Owens, Julie, MP",ALP,2014-07-14,"



Ms OWENS
 (Parramatta) (18:29):  I will start by commenting on a couple of the things the member for Dobell covered in her speech on the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Amendment Bill 2014. Firstly, at the very beginning of her speech, she said that the fact that the opposition was not supporting the bill was an indication that the opposition supported some of the worst behaviour of a small number of union officials. That of course is not the truth. For the benefit of the member for Dobell: sometimes two people can see the same problem—and can even have equivalent views about the seriousness of the problem—but can disagree on the answer. I think that is what is happening in this House at the moment. I do not think there is anyone in this House, on either side, who believes that officials of registered organisations—be they representatives of unions or employers—should be able to get away with the kinds of behaviour we have seen in recent months from some people who had been elected or appointed to represent the interests of their members.


When we on this side look at the problem, however, we disagree with the answer the government has put forward. We disagree for a number of reasons. Firstly, the member for Dobell herself said that she was seeking to ensure that officials of registered organisations were held to account in the same way those in corporations were. But this bill goes much further than that. The penalties imposed on officials of registered organisations exceed those imposed for equivalent corporate crimes. So this bill does not match the penalties for registered organisations with those for corporations; it in fact goes further for registered organisations—much further.


The other interesting part of the member for Dobell's speech was when she listed the outcomes of the inquiries into the HSU case involving Mr Thomson. She talked about the Fair Work inquiry. She talked about the 181 breaches of registered organisation rules and HSU rules—and about the penalties imposed. In doing so, she in fact she described how effective the current regime was in dealing with the HSU case. While she was putting all that forward as an indication of why you should change the rules, it actually demonstrates that those rules worked. A person has been appropriately investigated, breaches have been found and penalties have been applied—a jail sentence has been handed down. That demonstrates an extremely effective piece of regulation that did its job very well.


It is not really necessary to state this, because I think everybody in this House would agree, but none of us have any tolerance for corrupt union officials or for corrupt officers of employer bodies. Nobody in this House has a tolerance for that. I have no tolerance for people who offer bribes to union officials or for those who receive them. I do not make the distinction that one side is better than the other. When the government talks about corrupt union officials, I would feel more comfortable if it also occasionally mentioned the people who offered or received the bribes—or the businesses that engaged bikie gangs to collect their debts or to bully union officials. There are many aspects surrounding this issue of union corruption that we are not talking about. Again, I would feel more confident that the government was seriously concerned about corruption if the debate dealt also with those who interact with union officials.


Unlike many of those on the other side, I am a great supporter of the union movement, although I do not myself come from the union movement. I did work for a registered organisation, but it was an employer body. I ran the Australian Independent Record Labels Association for nearly seven years. It represented almost all—about 80 per cent by the end of my time there—of the independent labels in Australia. We worked to level the playing field. We did the kinds of deals and bulk agreements needed to level the playing field between the small end of the industry and the very large players. It was a great occupation to have. It was one of the best jobs in the country.


So my background, my perspective, is that of a person who represented employers, not workers. Yet I have been a union member all of my life—because I think they are incredibly important organisations. In many ways the work the union movement has done for over a century has helped to create a ballast in our economy that perhaps those on the opposite side of this chamber do not appreciate—the permanent secure work that so many people enjoyed for so long and the working conditions in our public service, in our public hospitals and in our fire brigades. Secure, stable jobs create a ballast. As a result of the efforts of the union movement, when there is great volatility in the economy, there remains a substantial group of workers who feel secure. That group is less likely to stop spending as quickly as others stop spending and they are more likely to start spending again a little earlier. That helps to smooth out some of the bumps, some of the volatility, in the economy. 


For over a century, unions have worked to help provide real opportunities for family life—the 38-hour week, weekends, days off, extra rostered days off, four weeks annual leave, family leave et cetera. These things allow people to spend time with their family. Even more importantly than that, perhaps, unions have helped ensure that work requirements are planned in advance—so families can know what time they will be able to spend together. All of these things help create ballast in our economy as well. They help to create stable families, families who have savings, who plan, who accumulate assets and who have a greater chance of staying together.


So behind all the to-and-fro in this House about whether unions are good or bad—and we know the government do not like any worker who belongs to a union; they do not like the maritime workers, they do not like the construction workers and they do not like manufacturing workers, because they are unionised—




Mr Robert:
  On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker: the standing orders do not allow a member to impugn the motives of other members. That includes impugning the motives of all members of the government. For the member for Parramatta to say, 'The government does not like any worker', is impugning our motives and should be withdrawn.




Ms OWENS:
  I withdraw.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Broadbent
):  The member has withdrawn.




Ms OWENS:
  It is interesting to watch the government's lack of support for industries such as the manufacturing sector, the construction sector, the maritime sector; to see the extraordinary lack of support for those areas of work. But underneath that to and fro, I think there really should be a recognition in this House that over many, many years the union movement has done an extraordinary job in providing a way of life that in many ways Australians have now take for granted. An incredible effort over many decades went into that.


The Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Amendment Bill 2014 is a reintroduction of a previous bill with some amendments that came from the Senate legislative committee report, but there are still a number of problems with it from this side of the House. It establishes the Registered Organisations Commission and amends the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act. The Registered Organisations Commission will be headed by a registered organisations commissioner with greater investigative powers than those available to the general manager of the Fair Work Commission. It also modifies disclosure requirements to make them more onerous, no doubt, including higher penalties for civil contraventions, and it introduces criminal offences in respect of officers' duties that are modelled on but also exceed those found in the Corporations Act. So it increases the red tape burden, makes the disclosure requirements considerably more onerous and raises the penalties to a higher level than those found in the Corporations Act. While one of the rationales for this bill is to make those penalties even, it actually increases the penalties beyond those of the Corporations Act.


Registered organisations play a fundamental role in Australia's workplace relations systems, whether they be registered organisations that represent employers or employees. They also represent their members before industrial tribunals and courts and work with governments on policy matters ranging from employment issues to economic and social policy. They are incredibly important, but they are not corporations—they are elected in many cases, and appointed in some others. People in various positions are not remunerated in the same way that corporations are, and they are often volunteers, as well. They are not corporations, and to impose penalties that are higher than those for for-profit organisations is quite extraordinary, and we cannot support that.


We do support appropriate regulation for registered organisations, including properly empowered regulators and consequences for those who do not follow the rules. This side of the House is committed to ensuring financial accountability by unions and employer organisations, and that is why in 2012 we toughened the laws to improve financial transparency and disclosure by registered organisations to their members. That original law was enacted by Tony Abbott, but we strengthened that in 2012. The regulation of trade unions in Australia has never been stronger than it is now, and accountability has never been higher. The powers of the Fair Work Commission to investigate and prosecute for breaches have never been broader than they already are, and while in government we tripled penalties, which means they have never been tougher. Much of the work that the government is now trying to do was already done in 2012, and resulted in the comprehensive pursuit of wrongdoers in the HSU case and in serious criminal penalties.


The minister consistently uses the HSU matters, having often inappropriately commented on matters before the judiciary, to justify the government's changes. But they are ignoring the fact that the Registered Organisations Act already prohibits members' money from being used to favour particular candidates in internal elections or campaigns. The Registered Organisations Act already allows for criminal proceedings to be initiated where funds are stolen or obtained by fraud. It already ensures that the Fair Work Commission can share information with police as appropriate, as we saw in the HSU case, and it already provides for statutory civil penalties where a party knowingly or recklessly contravenes an order or direction made by the federal court or the Fair Work Commission under the Registered Organisations Act or the Fair Work Act.


When unions and industry representatives agree with each other that something is not a good idea, then perhaps a government should listen. Usually in government one side or the other will support you and the other will not, but in this case both sides of the argument believe that this is a bad deal. The new criminal provisions, if enacted, mean that registered organisations, employer unions and bodies are likely to have difficulty in persuading people often in a voluntary capacity, to take on official responsibilities. The AI Group states:


If the proposed criminal penalties and proposed massive financial penalties for breaches of duties are included in the RO Act, this would operate as a major disincentive to existing voluntary officers of registered organisations continuing in their roles, and would deter other people from holding office.


These are genuine concerns expressed by both unions and industry representatives, and these concerns have not been addressed by the government, in spite of the amendments that were made in this most recent version of the bill. Unions have also raised quite legitimate concerns about the impacts of the proposed laws. Usually when you have industry bodies and unions lining up together on a unity ticket against a government proposition, the government may be well served to realise that something is very wrong. That is certainly the case here.


Of all the concerns with this bill, the biggest concern is that the penalties the government seeks to impose on officers of registered organisations quite substantially exceed those that are imposed through the Corporations Act, and again, the arguments the government makes is that they are trying to make those penalties even—this bill does not do that. It fails in that, and we will not be supporting it.

"Jensen, Dennis, MP",LP,2014-07-14,"



Dr JENSEN
 (Tangney) (18:44):  The Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Amendment Bill 2014 seeks to address the foolish and bungled amendments that Labor passed in 2012, led by none other than the current Leader of the Opposition. The issues in this bill are core to the promises we gave at the last election, and we intend to deliver on our promise to help the Australian people and the economy. This bill seeks to cut the large amount of unnecessary red tape, especially relating to the unjustifiable power and position that unions can impose on the workplace. It seeks to minimise the huge amount of inefficiency that unions bring to business, whilst ensuring and entitling that the rights and integrity of workers are preserved. These amendments hope to engage unions and the workplace in fairer dealing. It essentially puts the 'fair' back into 'fair work'. 


The current policy imposes a large amount of red tape and gives inexcusable powers to unions to frustrate and inconvenience businesses in their day-to-day operations. These common sense amendments will aid businesses; however, at the same time, they will limit but not cease union powers. Unions do have their place in society, but let us make some distinction here with how businesses and the economy take the centre role. It is Australian businesses and the economy, not unions, which line the pockets of workers. It is Australian businesses and the economy, not unions, that put bread on the table. And it is Australian businesses and the economy, not unions, that bring prosperity to the Australian people.


These amendments address the disgraceful extent to which unions are impinging on Australian businesses. For example, BHP recorded 676 right-of-entry visits to the Worsley alumina plant in 2010 alone. These visits require employers to set aside time and resources to attend to entry requests, and they must also allocate resources to escorting permit holders on the premises. The current legislation allows union representatives to enter the workplace and to enter into discussions with employees, even though the workplace may have no members of the union in question.


These amendments follow on from the Fair Work Act Review Panel's recommendations, which the previous government failed to implement during their term. The review set out some common sense, practical recommendations, which are reflected in these amendments. The Leader of the Opposition, who was then the responsible minister, pushed through rushed reforms, without understanding or anticipating how his solutions would be worked. Labor rushed them through, without thinking how they would affect other parts of Australia's society; instead, they were just thinking about how to appease their union mates. Unions, under Labor's misguided modifications, advance the notion that unions can enter into a workplace, even though no employee has sought their presence. So, if the unions are claiming to represent the workers, why are they entering into workplaces without the permission of those workers they claim to represent? This is a fantastic demonstration of how Labor failed to take a macro perspective on the Fair Work Act, just as it has done with so many other areas of policy.


The fair work amendments rebalance the powers of unions with the efficiency of businesses. This policy ought to have the support of both sides of the House, because this amendment aims to put the 'fair' back into 'fair work'. It aims to rebalance the personal liberties of Australian workers, whilst supporting the prosperity of Australian businesses and thus the prosperity of Australia's economy. It aims to rebalance the fairness of the act and to cut red tape which intrudes unnecessarily on Australian commercial interests, whilst ensuring transparency, accountability and responsibility of those commercial interests. This policy reflects the coalition's central philosophies of ensuring and instilling personal liberty and choice to the Australia people. It releases the shackles that the unions have imposed upon Australia, whilst allowing them, the unions, to fulfil a role in society that does not dominate or damage the liberty of Australian workers or does not dominate or damage the Australian economy.


It is false to assume that workers' rights cannot hang in harmony with that of economic prosperity. These two fundamental parts of a workplace should not, and will not, be at odds with these amendments. Industrial action hurts employers, employees, customers and families. It is the aim of these amendments to settle industrial disputes in a peaceful manner that prevents undue action, without an extensive bargaining stage. Labor's loophole in the current bill allows unions to 'strike first, talk later'. This must be stopped! The loophole must be closed and unions need to know that negotiation is the first step in settling an industrial dispute. Ironically, Labor's promise from 2007 will actually be legislated.


The only reason why these recommendations were not legislated during the terms of previous Labor governments is that they just could not get their act together. These amendments are fair and balanced. The government is now introducing policy which will make sure that, if an employee of the Commonwealth is for some apparent reason owed money by the Commonwealth, that employee will retain the value of that money by introducing interest payments. These interest payments will retain the value of the money owed, with the payment being calculated in line with the consumer price index. 


The amendments will also address the growing need in Australian workplaces for flexibility. The bill at inception has seen the need for flexibility. However, just like many other policy areas, Labor identified but failed to address this very important area of Australia's modern workplace. This government is determined not to impose decisions about industrial action on the people of Australia. Rather, we will enforce the power of choice to the Australian people. We, on this side of the House, give the choice to Australia and Australians. We, on this side of the House, give prosperity to Australia and all Australians. We on this side of the House give liberty.


The amendments to the Fair Work Act not only give fairness to workers and business but are a sign that Australia is prepared and well equipped to handle future problems. They are a sign to investors that Australia is open for business. They give business and investors confidence through knowing that Australia is mature in handling industrial disputes. Investment in Australia will ensure the future success of all Australian business and thus the prosperity of workers and the prosperity of all Australians.


I am speaking today on the Fair Work amendment bill, because I want to bring the issue of fairness to the Fair Work debate. I note that the Labor party has an undying adherence to the mantra of fairness. In particular, Labor fancies philosophers such as the American John Rawls to justify their attempts at redistributive fairness. How ironic is it that Fair Work as Labor knows it, sees it and wants it is so unfair. Fairness by definition and practice is entwined with personal liberty. No matter whether it is a positive or negative view of personal liberty or is the freedom from or freedom to, fairness and liberty are related. How unfair is it then that unions can so entrust themselves in the Australian workplace in their own every inefficient way? How unfair is it then that unions take from the productive to line the pockets of the unproductive? How unfair is it then that Labor used legislation when it was in government to try to protect the position of the unions? Labor knew that the concept, need and purpose of the unions was dead. Membership is going in one direction only, to the grave. It is going to zero. The union movement in my experience has been a parasitic beast tormenting small and medium businesses in the electorate of Tangney. I need not remind members opposite of the names of disgraced ex-union officials. Names like Jackson and Thompson ring around the homes of this nation, as unwanted as the names Ben and Jerry are wanted.


This debate and this government are all about productivity and adding value. This debate should be about protecting those who add value, not those who only take and, most insidiously, are on the take. Do not just take my word for it. Former AWU National Secretary Paul Howes said in 2013, in relation to union dishonesty and corruption, 'If we ignore any pocket of dishonesty it will grow like a cancer'. This legislation and these amendments have the strong support of those members of the union movement who share the same discouragement, disillusionment and disappointment.


Let me educate the good members who oppose what we are doing. We are acting because we said we would. We are keeping our promises, something Labor will never understand. Our plan, the fully costed policy document we took to the last election, spelt out clearly how we felt about unions. It also spelt out how we were going to make unions work for workers again, not for unions. We promised the Australian public 'better transparency and accountability of registered organisations'. It is the coalition's belief that Australians joining trade unions deserve to have confidence in the conduct and administration of these organisations. Let me say also that this debate takes place in the context of the ongoing inquiry by the royal commission into union corruption. Unions and corruption seem to go together like bread and butter—Wilson, Blewitt, Gillard. The Liberal Party has been the law and order party ever since the days of Menzies. How could I not support this bill? How could I not be happy about this bill, as it increases the penalties for breaches of current civil penalty provisions and even criminal penalties in  some cases.


In sum, being light on union heavies is no longer possible. The economy and our global competitiveness position demand that we get more innovative and more competitive. Our future prosperity demands that we get the heavy hand of union mobs off the economic tillers. If we do not act now then, due to union greed and myopia, Australia will become what Singapore's former and first Prime Minister, Lee Kuan Yew, predicted: 'The poor white trash of Asia'.

"Hall, Jill, MP",ALP,2014-07-14,"



Ms HALL
 (Shortland—Opposition Whip) (18:57):  I find the previous speaker's contribution to this debate on the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Amendment Bill 2014really incredible. He finished by saying that the government is keeping its promises. Each and every day in this House we hear how the government is breaking its promises. Before the last election it promised that there would be no cuts to health and education. Over $80 billion has been taken out of health and education. It promised that pensioners would not have their pensions cut. Legislation that will lead to a direct reduction in the rates of pensions has passed through this House. It promised that there would be no cuts to the ABC. There have been cuts to the ABC. So for the member for Tangney to stand up in this place and say, 'This government is keeping its promises,' shows just how much we can trust members on the other side of this House.


The member for Tangney spent a lot of time talking about individual liberty, about the right of people to make decisions of their own—basically, about how it was liberating for people to be able to do as they wish. He talked ad nauseam about personal liberty and at the same time was very critical of any form of what I would call mutual obligation. According to him, the power of choice is tantamount to everything; it is about an individuals right, about liberty. The member for Tangney would be quite happy to see the liberty of one group transcend the rights of another group. He is very much of the view that unions should have a zero membership—and those words passed through his mouth when he was speaking of this. He referred to unions as 'heavy-handed'. He referred to 'a mature handling of industrial relations'—I think a mature handling of industrial relations as far as the member for Tangney is concerned would be to have an industrial relations system where there were no unions whatsoever.


When I was sitting down preparing this speech, I really struggled to understand this government's approach to unions and to workers. I feel that it has adopted a position where it will not rest until unions do not exist. To hear the member for Tangney's contribution, I really believe that that is the situation. There is an ideological hatred of unions, and I ask: why? The member for Tangney pointed out that he wanted to bring fairness to the debate. Well, I think unions bring fairness to the equation. Any study of history will show that unions have actually brought fairness to the equation—unions provide protection for workers, just as employer groups provide a voice for employers. I will put on the record now that I appreciate what employers do in our community. I went to a small business awards ceremony in my electorate on Saturday night, and I was so proud of each and every one of those small-business people who were there and of the enormous contributions that they have made to my local area—just as I am really proud of the way unions stand up for workers, the way unions move to create some fairness in the equation, and the way unions protect workers. There is an imbalance of power, if you have a very strong employer group and a very weak union group. The idea is to have a balance.


When I hear members like the member for Tangney putting forward their extreme, right-wing, harsh, uncaring, unbalanced contributions to this debate, I can see why this legislation is before us in the House. I do not think that all members on the other side of this House could possibly share the extreme views that were expressed a moment ago. I do not see how people could accept a situation where personal liberty—the right to choose whatever you wish to do, over anything else—is paramount. I am sure there are members on the other side of the House who can see that there is a strong role for unions, just as there is for employers—because workers deserve protection. It is about balance and it is about fairness.


I look at this legislation before us today, the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Amendment Bill 2014, and I ask, how is it fair to impose on unions requirements and penalties that are more onerous than those in the Corporations Act? And for once, we have a unity ticket here between employer groups and union groups—both of those groups believe this legislation is flawed. The government is reintroducing legislation that came before this House in November. We did not support it then, and we certainly won't be supporting it this time. Even with the proposed amendments, employer and employee organisations still have significant concerns about the bill. As I said, employers and unions are on a unity ticket. Even with the proposed amendments, the penalties in this bill still exceed the penalties in the Corporations Act 2001. The government promised to regulate registered organisations in the same way as corporations—well, it certainly is not doing that in this legislation. If this bill is passed, the legislation implemented will place much harsher requirements on registered organisations. This is just another broken promise, by a government that comes in each day and breaks promises. The Australian people know that. And the Australian people are very suspicious about this kind of legislation. They know that those on the other side of this House—the large majority of them—have an ideological hatred of unions. The Australian people know that those opposite would like a situation where there were no unions; where workers were at the mercy of employers. But to have a good industrial relations system, you need balance; you need a system where you have strong employers and strong employee organisations—strong unions.


Now a bit of history: this bill has come through the Senate. The committee tabled its report in December 2013, and on 27 March this year the Senate committee's report was actually tabled. That report did not support the legislation, and in March the amendments recommended by the Senate legislative committee were put in the Senate, and the bill was negated.


As I have already mentioned, the bill also modifies disclosure requirements, making them more onerous. It includes higher penalties for civil contraventions, and it introduces criminal offences, in respect of officers' duties, which are modelled on, but also exceed, those found in the Corporations Act.


Registered organisations—and this is where we come from—play a fundamental role in the Australian workplace relations system. The organisations are created and registered for the purpose of representing Australian employers and employees, giving them a voice—that is what it is about. Unfortunately, this bill seeks to take that voice away from them. Registered organisations represent members before industrial relations tribunals and courts. On a regular basis I have people come to my office who need that sort of assistance and are in a position where, even if they seek to exercise their individual rights and freedom, they do not have the ability or the knowledge to be able to do that without the assistance of their unions. Therein lies the answer to the question. Many of those on the other side do not believe that the people who find themselves in that situation should have a voice.


While we have problems with this legislation, we have absolutely no tolerance for corruption by union officials or officers in employer bodies, just as we have no sympathy for any corruption within corporations. We support tough penalties for breaking the law. I would argue that those tough penalties are already available. We support appropriate regulation for registered organisations, including a properly empowered regulator. The Leader of the Opposition, when he was minister, toughened the laws to include financial transparency and disclosure by registered organisations. As a result, the regulations for trade unions in Australia have never been stronger. Listening to those on the other side of this House, you would think that the regulations are weak and that the country is controlled by trade unions. Australia has one of the lowest levels of industrial disputes in the world. Accountability has never been higher. The power of the Fair Work Commission to investigate and prosecute for breaches has never been broader. We tripled the penalties, which means that they have never been tougher. But this government thinks that—even given those facts—the regulations should be tougher. The government wants to take away all power from the trade unions. It wants to create a situation where workers have no voice or ability to protect themselves. The Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act 2009 already prohibits members' money being used to favour particular candidates in internal elections. It already allows for criminal proceedings to be initiated. It already ensures that the Fair Work Commission shares information with police. The Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act already provides statutory civil penalties.


Under the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act, registered organisations have a fiduciary duty akin to directors of corporations. It requires them to disclose their personal interests. A friend of mine told me about the level of disclosure he has to make in relation to his own personal interests—which includes disclosing payments made to relative parties and exercising care and diligence.


It is a really unusual situation when you have industry bodies and unions lining up on a unity ticket against the proposition. There is something very wrong with legislation that creates that situation. The opposition sought to engage with the government to ensure that the penalties did not exceed those in the Corporations Act, but the government was not willing. There are a number of issues, not the least of which is that this bill does not cover and regulate a range of entities and bodies, which are those that have been seen in New South Wales—bodies that have come before ICAC and that have put the honesty and integrity of organisations in that state into question.


This is flawed legislation. This is legislation that should not be passed. It is ill conceived and is another example of this government's broken promises saying one thing before the election and doing another thing after the election.

"Buchholz, Scott, MP",LP,2014-07-14,"



Mr BUCHHOLZ
 (Wright—Government Whip) (19:12):  It is a pleasure to be able to stand in this House once again speaking to the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Amendment Bill 2014.


I remind the House that in the last parliament I put forward a private member's motion to bring into line some of the concerns that were raised by the previous speaker—that is, making unions accountable under the Corporations Act, and the penalties that would apply the same as those that already exist under the Corporations Act. It will not surprise those in this House that that private member's motion was not successful, because those on the other side of this House mostly owe their seats, their position in this parliament, either through direct or indirect funding, to a union movement. At the last election, the front bench of the previous government—I think it was 10 out of 12 of them—had some direct linkage to union movements.


The previous speaker also talked about how on this side of government we have a hatred for unions. That is just farcical. My operations in the transport sector work very closely with unions. I have found that the union reps that I deal with are always accommodating, because I put forward a logical, succinct argument about why some of the decisions I made would be for the greater benefit of my employees. So to come into this place and say that this side of that House has a hatred for unions is predominantly flawed.


The amendments to the Fair Work Act 2009 contained in this bill are important items of the coalition's Fair Work policy that we took to the election. We did not say one thing before the election and another after, which has been the mantra of those opposite as they have come into the chamber to debate this. That has been the thread or flavour of their debate. They have been making that claim. Nothing could be further from the truth. We are actually doing what we said we were going to do before the election, and we are doing it consistent with an eminent panel.


In particular, this bill responds to a number of outstanding recommendations included in the Towards more productive and equitable workplaces: an evaluation of the Fair Work legislation review conducted in June 2012 when it was commissioned by the now Leader of the Opposition. The very capable review panel of eminent Australians—comprising of the Reserve Bank board member John Edwards, the former Federal Court judge Hon. Michael Moore and the noted legal and workplace relations academic Professor Ron McCallum AO—were asked to provide recommendations on areas where the operation of the act could be improved. They provided 53 proposals to tackle a range of issues and inspired many of the amendments contained in this bill. Do those on the other side of the chamber suggest that those eminent gentlemen who I just mentioned are also union haters? That is not the truth. It is unfair to come in and cast those aspersions in this House.


An interesting conclusion drawn from the review relates to the economic aspects of the Fair Work Act. The panel determined that since the Fair Work Act came into force important outcomes such as wages growth, industrial disputes, the responsiveness of wages to supply and demand, the rate of employment growth and the flexibility of work patterns have been favourable to Australia's continuing prosperity.


The exception has been productivity growth. That is what is missing. As a government—



Ms Butler interjecting—




Mr BUCHHOLZ:
  I sat here for the last three speakers and heard your speakers in silence, so do not come in here with your union intimidatory tactics and yell and shout. Just sit. The expectation has been for productivity growth. It has been disappointing in the Fair Work Act framework and in the two preceding frameworks over the last decade. It is this which has motivated the coalition's amendments. If you were not yapping, you would have just heard that. It is this which has motivated the coalition's amendments to the Fair Work Act. The coalition is dedicated to making Australia a more prosperous nation in which productivity growth plays an instrumental role. In order to achieve productivity growth, several of the amendments contain in this bill seek to eradicate loopholes, negatively geared systemic problems and prohibiting factors preventing Australian employers and employees from getting on with the job of growing their Australian economic pie.


One of the proposed amendments which the coalition has adopted from the Fair Work panel review relates to offering additional support to new greenfield industrial agreements. When reading it, I was quite surprised that the Fair Work Act review recommended:


greenfields agreement provisions be made consistent with the general enterprise bargaining stream by applying suitably modified good faith bargaining rules to negotiations for proposed agreements. Given the national significance of some greenfields projects and the need for assurance in project design and investment, the Panel also recommends a form of arbitration be available if the parties are unable to reach agreement within a suitable time frame


Under Labor, the Fair Work laws effectively gave unions the power to veto new projects by requiring an employer to always negotiate a greenfield agreement with a union. To date, unions have exploited this veto power by deliberately causing delays and setbacks, while others have used it as a tool to demand exorbitant conditions. In addition, these irresponsible actions are responsible for the perceived doubt surrounding many important new projects which have failed to receive adequate investment as a result. The coalition wants to ensure that enterprise agreements for greenfield agreements can be negotiated quickly to ensure that infrastructure projects are not delayed and to encourage investment for everyone's benefit.


This bill also addresses the imbalance in union workplace access rules currently impeding the productivity of many workplaces. The Fair Work panel review expressed the need for changes to the right-of-entry provisions to unions as a means of encouraging productivity and fairness in our work environments. I have a real-life example on entry provisions. I took the opportunity to reach out to one of the processors where a number of people in my electorate are employed. It is in a neighbouring electorate. They turn over around $365 million, with a workforce of around 1,800. In spite of the employees voting in favour of working under a new EBA to secure the future of the plant and 1,000 jobs, the union has continued to run legal action through Fair Work Australia and now the Federal Court because it has lost its privileges. The union has lost privileges that do not matter to the workforce. The workforce said in this particular case that they were quite happy with the EBA. But the union has still taken the company to court. This has been ongoing for 10 months, causing great uncertainty and threatening the viability of the business. The union has already delayed the first wage increase of three per cent for employees. Fancy that—a union delaying an increase in employees' entitlements! It has extended the life of the new EBA by six months. If the union is successful, 70 per cent of the employees will suffer a wage decrease, which means they will come off the three per cent that they have agreed to in the workplace to receive a lesser amount. Groundbreaking, profit-sharing bonuses will be at risk—$3,000 to $5,000 per employee. It is about sharing the profits and sharing the productivity gains with the employees. The union would not have anything to do with that.


The new EBA is classic win-win: improved productivity, wage increases and profit share. The IR system has allowed this farcical situation to occur and flourish. In their email to me, this business went on to say that these government's amendments are only the start of much-needed reform if we are going to have any chance of running successful manufacturing and processing in this country. 


Furthermore, the unlawful practices and inappropriate behaviour conducted by unions are well documented. For example, the Royal Commission into the Building and Construction Industry of 2001 identified no fewer than 392 separate instances of unlawful conduct—




Ms Butler:
  There were no charges.




Mr BUCHHOLZ:
  25 different types of unlawfulness and 90 different types of inappropriate behaviour, as well as referring 31 individuals who had possibly breached criminal laws. I take the interjection from the member opposite. The royal commission was back in 2001. I state for the record that the member indicated that there were no charges.


The changes included in this bill fairly and sensibly balance the right of employees to be represented in the workplace if they wish to be with the right of employers to go about their business without unnecessary disruption. There is clear evidence of union representatives abusing their right of entry, with excessive workplace visits recorded at a number of sites. For example, the Pluto LNG project received over 200 right-of-entry visits in a period of only three months. BHP Billiton's Worsley alumina plant faced 676 right-of-entry visits in a single year. There is no doubt that this sort of blatant interference on a work site by union representatives is hindering workers' ability to just get on with their jobs. There is no doubting the motivations behind such excessive visitation and access. Unions are fighting for representation of members and they are targeting workers in the workplace as a means of getting them signed up.


 Given the union movement has a long reputation of intimidation in the workplace—people who do not wish to become members, employers and each other—I think it is fair to recommend that this sort of behaviour is not acceptable. Intimidatory tactics in the workplace to force people to sign up are not acceptable. We heard those opposite say that corruption is not acceptable. I take it one step further: intimidation in the workplace should never be seen as an acceptable workplace practice by the union movement. 


Importantly, we will repeal the amendments which make the meal room or break room at the premises the default location for discussions between unions and workers and which require employers to provide transport and accommodation for unions seeking to access remote worksites. We will restore the arrangements that were in place previously, including that union officials must comply with any reasonable request by the employer to hold discussions in a particular location. Our changes will also mean that occupiers at remote work sites do not have to facilitate accommodation and transport for union officials to visit their workplace, reducing unnecessary and costly regulation for affected employers.


 To be clear, these amendments will enact Labor's publicly stated position prior to the 2007 election—a promise that was not honoured. Given that the Labor Party in opposition, with the strong support of the union movement, supported this 2007 policy platform, we expect that these amendments will not be contentious and will go through. However, in the vein of what speakers before me have said, I would suggest that we may be going to a vote on this. 


An additional aspect of this bill amends a significant loophole in the current system of strike first, talk later, which is costing our economy millions. The ABS reports that the number of work days lost as a result of industrial action is at an eight-year high. The member for Shortland mentioned that the union movement's strikes in this country are low when compared with those globally. I suggest that when 293,100 days are being lost annually, that is not a figure to crow about.


Under the existing Fair Work Act industrial action is able to commence before any bargaining has commenced. This has resulted in more frequent strikes occurring and on a larger scale. We are seeking to remove this loophole in the interests of small business and the economy. The bill will amend the Fair Work Act to provide that protected industrial action can only be taken if bargaining for a proposed agreement has commenced. This means that costly and productivity-hindering industrial action cannot be the first step in the bargaining process, which will restore order and balance to the enterprise bargaining approach. So that is not a bad amendment to have.


In conclusion, I would like to commend this bill to the House. It cements the coalition government's commitment to help make Australian workplaces even better, by improving the Fair Work laws to provide a stable, fair and prosperous future. We on this side of the House do not hate unions. I have worked closely with them and I will continue to work closely with them. If those on the other side want some advice, they should ask themselves: why has union membership in Australia fallen dramatically over the past 30 years? These amendments are not going to affect future union membership. If you want to build a successful union, if you want a union that members can find value in, support this bill and these amendments. Make the same conditions apply to the union movement that apply under the Corporations Act.

"Butler, Terri, MP",ALP,2014-07-14,"



Ms BUTLER
 (Griffith) (19:28):  I rise to oppose the government's Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Amendment Bill 2014 and the circulated amendments. This bill ignores all advice from stakeholders and represents yet more broken promises from this government.


This bill will establish the Registered Organisations Commission, the ROC, and amends the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act. The ROC will be headed by a Registered Organisations Commissioner, with greater investigative powers than those available to the General Manager of the Fair Work Commission. The bill also modifies disclosure requirements, includes higher penalties for civil contraventions and introduces criminal offences in respect of officers' duties, which are modelled on, but also in some cases exceed, those found in the Corporations Act 2001.


We all know that the reason we are debating this bill tonight is that, as we have seen in recent weeks, this government would like to talk about anything but its toxic budget. It is a budget that takes money out of the pockets of the very people who trusted this Prime Minister before the election. As is the hallmark of this government, this bill represents yet another broken promise from a Prime Minister and a government that are watching their trust and support slip away like sand between their fingers. It is hardly surprising that when a Liberal-National government is in trouble, they run towards what they know best, which is attacking workers and attacking representative organisations. This bill is about registered organisations, which are employer and employee organisations registered under the Fair Work regime 


They play an important role in Australia's workplace relations system. They are registered organisations that this bill seeks to further regulate.


I listened to the previous speaker, the member for Wright, with interest, and I wish to offer to him in good faith a conversation about the effect of the Fair Work laws, because, as he might have noticed, there were quite a few things that he mentioned in his speech with which I disagree. One of them is this idea about greenfields agreements. The previous speaker said that somehow it was a problem that greenfields agreements were to be negotiated with unions. But I ask: who else would a greenfields agreement be negotiated with? The definition of the greenfields agreement is that there are no employees with whom to negotiate. If the employer is not negotiating with the future employee's representative organisation, then with whom would they negotiate? Would we really want to go back to Work Choices? That is the alternative. The alternative is to go back to the Work Choices regime for greenfields agreements.


Let us think about that Work Choices regime for a second. An employer could make a greenfields agreement called an employer greenfields agreement. Who were the parties to that employer greenfields agreement? They were the employer and itself. In other words, the employer called a meeting with itself. It went into a room and said: 'Hello, employer. I'd like to give them no wage increase in the next three years. How do you feel about that?' 'Well, employer, that seems pretty fair to me. Let's shake on it.' That is ridiculous. That is why greenfields agreements need to be negotiated with representative organisations that are acting in the interests of the future employees, because, frankly, there is nothing more than a glaring conflict of interest when an employer negotiates with itself, as occurred under the WorkChoices regime of the federal government under Mr Howard. That is the sort of thing the previous speaker was talking about: going back to that Work Choices regime, where there were no protections for future employees of greenfields projects.


But coming back to this bill, let us talk about registered organisations. The previous person who spoke to this bill was at pains to say that the coalition is not against unions. Well, I beg to differ. The trade unions royal commission that we see at the moment is an exercise in de-legitimising the union movement. That is what it is an attempt to do. It is to make the union movement seem like it is not legitimate. And why? We have seen things like the HSU scandal, a scandal in which the HSU was the victim of white-collar crime from unscrupulous, unethical persons who committed crimes against that union and its membership. But that does not mean that we should accept that unions in and of themselves are illegitimate, and unfortunately that is what this bill is aimed at giving the impression of. When we talk about registered organisations we are talking about employer organisations like the Australian Industry Group, like the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, and about trade unions, like the CFMEU and other unions we have heard spoken about. These are organisations that are registered under the Fair Work legislation with an obligation to represent their members, both in the workplace and before industrial tribunals and courts. And they play a broader role. Unions and employer associations are part of a civil society, they are part of the fabric of Australian democracy, and they provide support to people individually but they also contribute to the sort of society that we want to live in.


If you want to know about the importance of unions in this country and in democracies, you might want to consider the case of CFMEU v North Goonyella Coal Mine Pty Ltd [2013 FCA 1444]. It is a case very close to my heart, because my former colleagues at Maurice Blackburn—Emma Thornton and Kelly Thomas—did such a great job working in that case, where an employer was being pursued for its contraventions of the Fair Work Act for adverse action against members of unions. It was a really important decision, and it was one in which His Honour Justice Logan spoke at length about the importance of unions in our democracy. He said that the case:


… provides a very useful occasion to recall why in our country, for so many years, trade unions have been regarded as lawful and why it is that those who take what is called these days adverse action against persons because of trade union activity are amenable to penalty.


To understand that, one has to go back almost 200 years to a case which was passed into history as the Tolpuddle Martyrs' Case, but which is known in the law reports as R v Lovelass and Others (1834) 172 ER 1380. That case was decided in England against the background of a group of farm workers … who wished to form a union to prevent reduction of their wages. … The farm workers concerned met in the home of a Thomas Standfield. They there took an oath to combine together and to seek to prevent the reduction of their wages. They formed what was known as the Friendly Society of Agricultural Labourers. They were prosecuted under an Act, the Unlawful Oaths Act 1797 (UK). That Act had been passed by the British parliament in response to a threat of mutinies following the French Revolution. It made it illegal to make an oath and an offence to not reveal the oath in particular contexts. The workers concerned were convicted and sentenced to transportation to Australia. Such was the outpouring of popular outrage in respect of that prosecution and its sequel that the British government decided to return the workers concerned from Australia. Some later migrated to Canada. One remained here.


It is that case which is generally regarded as providing the inception of a movement which gradually throughout the 19th century led to the recognition by the British parliament and then by colonial parliaments here of trade unions as lawful organisations. The history of the progression from the Tolpuddle Martyrs' Case, through the 19th Century, to the recognition under the Trade Union Act 1871 (UK) and the Trade Disputes Act 1906 (UK), which have Australian equivalents, is set out, notably, in a work by Sidney Webb (later Baron Passfield) and his wife, Martha Beatrice Webb, The History of Trade Unionism (Revised Edition, 1920).


In Australia, drawing on that heritage, ever since we have had a federal industrial relations statute, trade unions have been recognised expressly by our parliament upon registration as lawful organisations, having a recognised representational role in our industrial relations system. The history of the provisions proscribing adverse action in the Fair Work Act is as long as federal industrial regulation in Australia.


The case that His Honour was dealing with involved an employer taking adverse action against people for their union involvement. His Honour said:


The long and the short of it is that this case displays a blatant, deliberate, concerted and fulfilled endeavour on the part of an employer to subvert a deeply rooted feature—


and this is the important part for our purposes today—


not just of our industrial relations system, but of our democracy itself.


He was there talking about trade unions and their importance to our democracy, and he said:


I cannot overemphasise the seriousness of the conduct concerned. It is no new subject that trade unions are regarded as lawful and that those who seek to take adverse actions against person on the basis of trade union activity are subject to penalty.


Equally as important for the purposes of our consideration of this bill tonight, His Honour went on to say:


Of course, with the benefit of recognition as lawful organisations comes great responsibility for trade unions and those who hold office in trade unions. Over time, a number of commissions of inquiry, State and Federal, have exposed practices where the privilege of recognition of trade unions has been abused, or where those who hold office within unions have abused a privileged position.


With the greatest of respect to His Honour, I most humbly agree with him. It is very important that the seriousness of the role of the representation of working people be conducted absolutely without any corruption and without any unlawful behaviour. It is a role of great trust and great responsibility. Labor knows that and that is why we have no tolerance for corruption by union officials or officers of employer bodies, who equally share that sacred obligation as a representative and as a person to whom their membership look to represent their best interests.


The Labor Party has always supported tough penalties for those that break the law. We have always supported appropriate regulation for registered organisations, unions and employer associations, including a properly empowered regulator and consequences for those who break the rules. That is because we know better than anyone how important that position of trust is, not just to the individual members and to the members as a whole, but to our democracy and our society. It is fundamental to our democracy and society that we have a union movement that is held in high esteem. That is why we have always been committed to ensuring financial accountability by unions and employer organisations. So much so that the now Leader of the Opposition, Bill Shorten, as a minister, strengthened the laws around transparency and disclosure by registered organisations to their members.


Yet here we have those opposite standing here to talk about unions in a negative way, just like their counterparts in my home state of Queensland. That is where we saw anti-union legislation. Wasn't that a success! It was such a success that the Queensland LNP had to rush into the parliament to repeal their own transparency laws, because they knew that they were not going to survive an upcoming High Court challenge. Those rushed through anti-union laws did not survive and were so poorly written and so poorly put together. The facts though, from Labor's perspective, speak for themselves.


As a result of Bill Shorten's work, the regulation of trade unions in Australia has never been stronger, accountability has never been greater, the powers of the Fair Work Commission to investigate and prosecute for breaches have never been broader and penalties for breaches have never been tougher. Labor tripled the penalties when we were in government. Yet we now hear those opposite coming in here to try to manufacture a basis to justify their changes. They refer to things like the HSU, which, as I have said, was a victim of white collar crime but unscrupulous officials.


Let us have a look at the Registered Organisations Act as it now stands. Does the act prohibit members' money from being used to favour particular candidates in internal elections or campaigns? Yes, as it has been a longstanding principle of industrial law in this country that members' money cannot be spent on electing particular candidates in union election campaigns.




Mr Ciobo:
  Someone should have told Craig Thomson.




Ms BUTLER:
  I will take the interjection. Craig Thomson has just been raised. As we know, he broke the law and he should suffer the full consequences of a breach of the law. But the fact is that the union was the victim of that crime. Just as if a director of a company defrauds that company, that does not make that company illegitimate; so if an official of a union defrauds a union, that is not a basis to claim that unions are illegitimate. Does the act allow for criminal proceedings to be initiated where funds are stolen or are obtained by fraud? Yes, it does. Does the act already ensure that the Fair Work Commission can share information with the police as appropriate? Yes, it does. The Registered Organisations Act already provides for statutory civil penalties where a party knowingly or recklessly contravenes an order or direction made by the Federal Court or the Fair Work Commission under the Registered Organisations Act or the Fair Work Act.


Officers of registered organisations already have fiduciary duties akin to those for directors under the Corporations Law and there are corresponding statutory obligations. The Registered Organisations Act already requires officers to disclose their personal interests, already requires officers to disclose when payments are made to related parties and already requires officers to exercise care and diligence, act with good faith and not improperly use their position for advantage. Given all of this, we cannot help but question the motives of this government in introducing this bill.


Why is the government rushing to impose this new regime, which includes some penalties that exceed the Corporations Act? It is just yet another attack on unions, because they do not want to talk about their budget. They are looking for something—anything—to talk about other than their toxic budget, which is the budget that has been rejected so comprehensively by the Australian people and that breaches those pre-election commitments of no cuts to health, no cuts to education, no changes to the pension and no new taxes. What have we seen? We have seen the GP tax, the tax when you go and get an x-ray, the tax when you get a blood test, the deregulation of higher education, the cuts to education, the changes to the pension indexation that will leave pensioners worse off and the petrol tax. It is a litany of broken promises and twisted priorities. (Time expired)

"Chesters, Lisa, MP",ALP,2014-07-14,"



Ms CHESTERS
 (Bendigo) (19:43):  I also rise to speak in opposition to the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Amendment Bill 2014, for the second time in this term of parliament. Still the government has not done their homework on the bill before us. They have not improved their work at all. It is still a failure. It is still a poorly conceived bill that is badly motivated and entirely unnecessary, because this issue was dealt with by the 43rd parliament. Nobody is denying that if there is criminal behaviour and if it occurs in any organisation, then it should be dealt with properly by the Criminal Code Act.


That is exactly what we have seen happen, whether it be Craig Thomson or whether it be Geoff Shaw. If there is somebody who breaks the law, they will be dealt with appropriately. That is why this bill is not the right place for this. The Fair Work Act and this bill seek to impose penalties that are tougher than we have seen anywhere else in any part of our acts, including the Corporations Act.


Nobody is excusing the behaviour of one or two individuals, but, as we have said repeatedly, you cannot punish the entire institution of registered organisations for the actions of one or two individuals. If we were to adopt the government's logic, we would be punishing every MP in the Victorian parliament because of the actions of one, Jeff Shaw. But we have not seen that happen. All this bill seeks to do is to union bash—to bash up the natural foe of the conservatives, our trade union movement. Along their way, in their frantic push to bash the trade union movement, the government have caught up a few of their traditional supporters, their own organisations—the employer groups.


The burden of this extra regulation will fall not just on the full-time, salaried union officials that they seek to punish but also on the volunteers of the trade unions or registered organisations such as the Australian Industry Group. These groups have been quite vocal in their opposition to this bill, not once or twice but a number of times, whether it be to individual members of parliament or whether it be to Senate inquiries, but the government still ignores their words and their pleas. The government has wrongly claimed that these reforms will protect union members' interests and give greater democracy to union members. Again, it is just another attempt by a desperate government to distort the facts. This bill will achieve the exact opposite. It will impose tough and rigid regulations on the largely rank and file members who run our trade unions. The government seek to impose large fines on those rank and file members. 


I know those opposite struggle to understand what a trade union looks like. As an example, the executive, the council, of United Voice in the state of Victoria, like in every state, is made up of rank and file members. There are only a couple of people who are paid officials. Take, for example, Marie Angrilli, who works for Spotless as a part-time school cleaner. She gives up her spare time as a volunteer to be president of United Voice in Victoria. Why should she be treated any differently from the president of a school council, who is also a volunteer, or the president of a sporting club? That is exactly the distinction this bill tries to make. The government has wrongly labelled Marie, who is a volunteer rank and file member on the union executive, as one of the union bosses and union heavies, and seeks to impose on her, as well as on all the other members who are rank and file members elected to their trade union state councils or executives, very tough penalties. The other union I wish to mention is the rail division of the RTBU. Bob Bassett is a full-time conductor for V/Line—another hardworking person who this government seek to victimise, demonise, call a union boss and vilify in the way they are trying to do in this bill. The government suggest that these people are union bosses and union heavies, but nothing could be further from the truth. 


There are still two million people in Australia who are members of a trade union, making the trade union movement one of the largest community based rank and file organisations in this country. Yet this government is dead set scared of them. I can understand why. When working people are active, when they get together, when they organise around their working rights, when they stand up, when they have a voice, they become a broadbased movement that can speak directly against what this government is trying to do. It is no wonder that upon being elected one of the first things that this government did was try to tear down the union movement—because they, unlike the rest of Australia, knew about that horror budget, that shocker budget, that they were about to bring down. That budget did one thing, and that was to tear at our working people. It attacked their children, whether they be in school or trying to get a university education, and it attacked working people's parents, whether they be self-funded retirees or on a pension, or in an aged care facility, possibly victims of the government's latest cut to the dementia supplement. It is no wonder that the government has brought forward this bill to try and attack unions, to distract their members from the real battle that is going on outside of the workplace, whether it be in their homes, whether it be in their children's schools, whether it be with their parents and their pension. The government is no fan of working people. They are not the great saviours of the working people that they like to champion. Whether it be on this version of the debate or a previous version of the debate, speaker after speaker from the government side have claimed that they are the best friend of working people. 


As I have mentioned, it is not only trade unions that are opposed to this bill but also a number of employer organisations. I note the submission of the Australian Industry Group to the Senate Education and Employment Legislation Committee. When I was first elected I never thought I would be standing up in the parliament saying that I agreed with the Australian Industry Group on the matter of workplace relations. But here I am in this House doing that. It just shows how far to the right the government has gone when employer groups are saying that their proposal concerning part of the Fair Work Act is too radical and too draconian. Just as our union delegates come from the rank and file, the Australian Industry Group also have rank and file not delegates but councillors that run their incorporated organisations in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland—in fact, 85 people from their rank and file membership based organisations. 


Like many of our union delegates who work on state councils and state executives running their unions, these officers for the Australian Industry Group are volunteers. They give up their time without payment for their role. This bill seeks to make their job harder by imposing new regulations on volunteers who make sure their organisation is run properly. Yet, all it will do will is increase the amount of time, regulation and red tape for these volunteer based organisations. This means these organisations, like our trade union movement, would have less time to spend on their businesses, less time to spend on policy, and potentially some of them would have to give up their role as volunteers in a registered organisation. 


This is what the government seeks to do with this bill. It is an example of how poorly-conceived and rushed the government is in their desperate attempt to union bash and distract the community from their real agenda, which is to attack working people in every aspect of their lives. I quote from the Australian Industry Group's submission to the Senate inquiry on this bill. They state:


Unlawful conduct within one organisation must not be used as an excuse to impose unfair laws or an excessive compliance burden upon all registered organisations.


I also note that they cite the ILO's Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention, 1948. When you have the Australian Industry Group in a submission to an inquiry talking about protection of the freedom of association, you know the government is on the wrong path. They, like their workers, seek to organise—seek to have a collective voice. From time to time, bosses and workers do disagree, but nobody should deny their right to organise. Yet this government seeks to do that; it seeks to tear at that basic convention—that of freedom of association.


As I have said, this bill is poorly-conceived, badly-motivated and entirely unnecessary. It should be rejected in its entirety. It creates a large volume of new regulation without evidence that it is necessary. The work was already done in the former parliament. This bill also creates a new Commonwealth regulator, where one already exists. This is from a government that claims that it wants to get rid of red tape—yet, it is introducing more. This bill creates a large volume of new regulation that will not just increase the burden for registered trade unions, but it will also increase the burden on employer organisations. As I have said, it should be rejected in its entirety.


The problem with this debate is that, once again, it is centred around the rhetoric of union bashing. Why on earth does the government continue with its union bashing? Why does it seek to perpetuate this myth? Perhaps it is for their own purposes—they need an enemy. So let's create one from working people. Let's remind ourselves who unions are: they are men and women in a workplace who get together; they organise to have a say about their workplace rights. And they are very good at it; they have had a lot of influence. In some sectors they have organised well—they have good working conditions. Yet this government, we know, in other bills seeks to tear those down. We also know that in a number of new industries unions are still doing the hard work of ensuring that their members have good workplace conditions. The cleaners here in Parliament House and the cleaners who work for the government are some of the latest victims of this government's budget shocker. In their determination to cut costs, they have cut the wages of their own cleaners. I would like to cite a comment from an editorial in the Herald Sun, challenging the psychology of the government's IR minister: what sort of psyche does a man have if he cuts the wages by up to $5 an hour of the person who cleans his toilet? To me that statement says it all: if you cut the wages of your own cleaners—the people who clean your toilets—you are not a friend of hard-working people. It does not matter how many times you say in front of the mirror that you are the worker's friend, it is simply not true.


The government's actions when they were previously in government demonstrate that they are not the fans or supporters of working people. When the Prime Minister was the workplace relations minister, he showed very little regard for working people. He said that the Howard government's legacy would be WorkChoices; he said it was one of their proudest achievements. It is simply not true. WorkChoices, as we know, is not 'dead, buried and cremated', as the Prime Minister has continued to say. In fact, it could not be further from the truth. We have seen through their attempt to try to amend the IFA and their other bill on the Fair Work Act that they are seeking to bring it back. That is why they have to demonise the very organisations that stand up against them. Let us not forget what the government did when they changed unfair dismissal, when they went after penalty rates, when they attacked people's retirement income and when they made sure that working people would have less access to their union representatives. Let's be clear about this bill: it seeks to demonise unions and hard-working union officials. (Time expired)

"Jones, Stephen, MP",ALP,2014-07-14,"



Mr STEPHEN JONES
 (Throsby) (19:58):  This bill is about the regulation of unions, employer associations and their officers and officials. In common parlance, the word 'official' is taken to mean somebody who is elected or appointed to a full-time job within an organisation and who draws a salary for performing those functions. It belies the fact that the majority of officials, at least within unions, are volunteers who give up hundreds of hours of their time every year for a purpose and a cause that they believe in. For unions, the cause is the protection and the betterment of the wages and conditions of the people they represent—ordinary Australian workers. They help them balance the cost of living with their income and they help them get a fair go at work.


Any debate about workplace relations in this place is always conducted on many levels. As the contributors to this debate have demonstrated, it is as much about the political contest between the conservative parties and us, the Labor Party, as it is about the subject matter of the bill. We have heard numerous contributions from those on the other side of the House and from those on this side of the House which give testament to that. It has been that way since Federation. Governments have risen and fallen on the question of industrial relations. It is an unfortunate fact that the objects of the legislation, by which I mean those for whom it purports to regulate, are often swept aside.


I would like to say a few words about a mate of mine to correct the balance. My friend's name is Kerry Edsall. She was a government employee who started work in the Department of Social Security, as it then was, in one of the first call centres that that department established, in Geelong in 1993. She was a strong woman with a great work ethic who was as respected by the workers in her workplace and nationally as she was by her employers. She joined the union soon after becoming an employee of the Department of Social Security and became deputy delegate in her workplace soon after. She represented the department and Centrelink on the union's section council from 2001 and became the union secretary in 2003, a position that she then held for over 10 years—all on a voluntary basis. In 2013, in recognition of her many decades of service to the union, she was granted a life membership. 


She was a key CPSU leader in Centrelink and the Department of Human Services and represented members through many agreement negotiations and in other national and international forums. She was well respected by management, by government and by union representatives because of her deep knowledge of the work of the department, the needs of the clients of the department, the operation of the union and the needs of their members. As well as supporting and engaging members in her workplace, Kerry mentored many young workers, including workplace delegates and section councillors, across the country. She was a courageous leader and a courageous worker who genuinely lived up to the cliche that you have to walk the walk as well as talk the talk. She never dodged difficult discussions with members, with management or with anyone who needed to hear the truth. She was a person who was very comfortable speaking truth to power. 


Kerry understood that union strength comes from the work that you do in the workplace—not from acts of parliament, as important as they are and as influential as they can be in governing workers' rights, but from the strength within the workplace. Her commitment and passion for union and Labor values motivated many members throughout her workplace and around the country. Her commitment to union work was legendary, and I repeat: it was all done on a volunteer basis. It was not uncommon for her to rise before sun-up and take the long commute from Geelong to Canberra to be involved in negotiations with management—only to turn around and go back again and be one of the first people at work the very next day. 


You can only imagine the high regard in which she was held within the workplace and within the union—and you can only imagine the devastation people felt when, on 23 June this year, Kerry passed away after a relatively short battle with cancer. She is survived by her husband John and her daughters, Sheridan and Shea, whom she adored and was as proud of as they were of her. Kerry did more than just promote the values of the union; she lived them. So when I see members opposite and others around this parliament seeking to go about the task of demonising unions and union officials, I know they have a tough battle ahead of them if they want to demonise people like Kerry Edsall. She was someone who lived the values of the union—and she did it all for nothing. She was a great example and a great mentor to generations of young women.


When you are in government you have limited time, and how you spend that time is a statement of your priorities and your values. That is why I say that this bill before the House demonstrates the fact that this government has its priorities all wrong when it comes to workplace relations. They had the opportunity to correct an outrageous error—perhaps it was not an error; perhaps it was a deliberate act—they perpetrated during that great failed episode of 'Deregulation Day'. By the stroke of a pen on that day, they cut the wages of cleaners by somewhere between $172 and $225 per week. I am talking about some of the lowest paid people who work in this place. If you were to look at a diagram of who the highest paid and who the lowest paid people in this place are, you would find the Prime Minister and the Treasurer somewhere near the top of the pay pile—and you would find the people who clean this place when we have gone home near the bottom. So you have to ask yourself: what was in the minds of the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and his parliamentary secretary when he tried to bury a provision, within over 50,000 pages of government regulation, to cut the wages of some of the lowest paid people in the parliament and within government employment. It is a statement of the government's priorities. 


We could today be debating a bill that corrected that error. We could be debating, perhaps, amendments from government members effectively saying, 'We know we got it wrong when we cut the wages of some of the lowest paid people in the country.' Instead, they have used the limited resources and the limited time available to this parliament to debate a bill which does something completely different. I will get to what it does in a moment, but I think that speaks volumes about the priorities of this government.


I am a relatively new member, Deputy Speaker Mitchell. We came into this parliament at the same time, after the 2010 election. I remember an important debate that we had in this parliament when Labor introduced legislation regarding directors' salaries, and an important reform Labor introduced that gave ordinary shareholders some say in the outrageous salaries that many directors were awarding themselves, and a mechanism to correct those salaries.


When I heard the Prime Minister say before the election that one of his objectives in workplace reform was to ensure that we brought into line the obligations incumbent upon unions and union officials in the Workplace Relations Act so they more closely mirrored the obligations upon directors and companies within the Corporations Law, I thought I would find a provision in there that enabled that reciprocal flow of obligations. I can tell you this—and I have quite detailed knowledge about this—there would not be a union in this country whose rules did not provide that if a meeting of the members properly constituted of that union, or the governing body of that union, passed a resolution that said the officials of that union shall afford themselves a particular salary or a particular form of remuneration, and no more or no less, then the officials of that union would have to comply with that resolution of the membership body. When the government says they want to align the obligations of unions and corporations, that is one they have overlooked—because I remember very well, as you would remember very well, Deputy Speaker Mitchell, that they opposed tooth and nail those changes to the Corporations Law. They argued against them as 'excessive red tape'. If the government is truly interested in ensuring that the same obligations upon unions and employer associations apply to corporations, they would be rethinking their policies when it came to that particular issue around director salaries.


I listened with great interest to a number of the contributors to this debate when they talked about the genesis or the objectives of the legislation, and they invariably relied upon the great scandal concerning the Health Services Union. I am appalled by some of the revelations that have come to light about the expenditures and the use of members' money within the Health Services Union, but it is worth noting that the officials who have done the wrong thing within that union have had those malfeasances brought to light, they have been charged and have been prosecuted under the existing laws. If the motivation for bringing these laws before the parliament is to correct something that was going wrong in one or two organisations, I simply make the point that the reforms have already been implemented. In fact, the now Leader of the Opposition introduced those reforms when he was the government minister in relation to workplace relations. The reforms have created greater obligations for registered organisations and have ensured that there are greater penalties for non-compliance and greater obligations in relation to the use and reportage around members' funds, and other obligations.


For example, in 2012 he toughened the laws to improve the financial transparency, and the disclosure by registered organisations and their members. If the motivation is anything more than kicking the industrial question into the political debate, then you have to look at what has already been done and the remedies that are already available. We on this side of the House say that we stand shoulder-to-shoulder with those in the community who are appalled that the funds of any registered organisation—or any community organisation, or any charity or any company, for that matter—could be used for any purpose other than the purpose for which they are contributed. We should come down on them like a ton of bricks. But we look at the legislation and at what is already there, and we cannot draw any other conclusion but the fact that this is just an opportunity for the government to kick the industrial question back into parliament to use it as a part of a concerted campaign to try to reintroduce laws they said they would never reintroduce and to try to muddy up those who are their political opponents, and in doing that give themselves some form of political advantage.


So we are all for looking at and introducing laws that ensure the highest standards are imposed upon employer and employee organisations, but we say that this legislation does not do that. We say that this legislation is not necessary, that we will be opposing the legislation, and that we will be doing it because we say it is introduced to the House for an entirely different purpose altogether.

"Neumann, Shayne, MP",ALP,2014-07-14,"



Mr NEUMANN
 (Blair) (20:13):  I speak in relation to the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Amendment Bill 2014 to express my opposition to it. The government has reintroduced legislation before the chamber—a bill they have submitted earlier in this term of parliament, back in November. We did not support it then and we will not support it now. The whole purpose of this legislation is driven by rank right-wing ideology. This is not about registered organisations and their best interests, or the best interests of industrial relations, and fairer, simpler and decent workplaces—this is motivated by ideology.


In some countries the division between the major political parties is driven by religion, in some it is driven by geography and in others it is driven by language. In Australia, the divide between the major political parties is on industrial relations, and it has been for decades. Labor on this side has stood up for working people; on the other side, they have stood up for the interests of capital. Labor believe that employers and employees can work productively and constructively in the workplace, without coercive, investigative and onerous powers being put on by bodies created for the purpose of imposing ideology in the workplace. We saw that when those opposite were in government back before 2007, and we are seeing it resurrected yet again. It is in their DNA. They just cannot help it. It is reflexive. It is what they believe in their blood and bones, and that is to prosecute and persecute workers in the workplace. So we will not support this legislation. 


We believe the bill exceeds the penalties that are necessary in the workplace to make sure that registered organisations do the right thing. The bill exceeds penalties in the Corporations Act, which governs so much of corporate Australia. The government promised it would regulate registered organisations in the same way that companies, directors and shareholders are dealt with, but that is not what is happening here. What this bill actually does, as it has done before when it was introduced previously and when we opposed it, is establish a registered organisations commission; it amends the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act 2009. That registered organisations commission, headed by a registered organisations commissioner, will have more investigative and coercive powers than those available to the general manager of the Fair Work Commission. There are some more onerous disclosure provisions and, of course, greater penalties in terms of civil contraventions. There is also some criminality introduced in terms of criminal offences with respect to officer's duties which are discharged in the exercise of the work for those registered organisations. 


Registered organisations are absolutely crucial to Australia's workplace relations system. They play a very important role in the maintenance of productive, flexible and fair workplaces. Australian employers and their employees are entitled to representation in their workplaces. They are entitled to representation before the courts and before tribunals which deal with areas of disputation, whether it is internal within one state or across state and territory borders. They are entitled to that representation to advance their concerns and their interests. When governments consider policies in relation to industrial relations, employers and employees are also interested in how it affects their rights, their interests and their obligations. They are entitled to that representation free of corruption by employers, by employees and also by the bodies that represent those interests. They are entitled to know that their membership fees are not being misspent. As the Australian Industry Group stated in their submission to the Senate Education and Employment Legislation Committee inquiry into this bill: 


Overwhelmingly the officials and staff of registered organisations of employers and employees are dedicated and ethical people who work very hard for the benefit of their Members, their industries and the broader community. 


This is absolutely accurate and correct. 


In my time as a federal member of parliament and in my days before that, as an employer and as someone who has lived in the Ipswich and West Moreton community all my life, I must say that I have had very productive and genuine dealings with representatives of both employer and employee registered organisations. However, we must acknowledge that, although corruption is rare, it does occur in business, in government and in the community. I want to make it plain that Labor will not tolerate corruption by union officials or by officers of employer bodies. We support appropriate regulation of registered organisations in Australia's workplaces. We support a properly empowered regulator. We support appropriate and tough penalties for those who do not follow the rules and for those who break the law. It does not and should not matter if the registered organisation found to be breaking the rules represents employers or their employees. We demonstrated this when in government. 


In 2012, Labor in government then toughened the rules for registered organisations. We made their finances more transparent to their members. We dramatically increased the disclosure responsibilities. When the now Leader of the Opposition was the minister in charge of workplace relations he achieved this with legislation that he initiated in this place. The then Labor government acted to strengthen the regulation of registered organisations, whether trade union or employer organisations. That regulation, which currently governs the workplaces of this country, is the strongest it has ever been. 


As I said, the background to this this bill is really important. We made it a requirement that officers of a registered organisation disclose to that organisation the remuneration paid to them by the organisation, by a related party to the organisation or because the officer is a member of a board due to being an officer of the organisation. We made it a requirement that officers of a registered organisation disclose to that organisation any material personal interest that they or their relatives—spouse, parent, child, grandchild, grandparent, brother or sister—have or acquire relating to the affairs of that particular organisation. We made it a requirement that the registered organisation disclose to their members and to the Fair Work Commission by 31 December 2014 and every year thereafter the remuneration which the five highest paid organisational officers and the two highest branch officers had been paid in that previous year, the material personal interest which the officers had disclosed and all payments to related parties of the organisation, including payments to entities controlled by officers of the organisation. It is through the Labor government's actions that members of registered organisations now know more than they ever did before and can have confidence in the organisations which seek to represent them in the workplace. We acted to broaden the Fair Work Commission's power to investigate suspected rule breaking by those registered organisations or individuals associated with them. When this rule breaking was proved, we acted to broaden the Fair Work Commission's powers to prosecute that breach. 


The minister is a regular commentator on the Health Services Union, even when the matter is before the judiciary. He justifies this bill and changes made previously through constant references to the HSU. He says that this bill will sort it all out. What he will not admit is that the current legislation—the Fair Work Act and the registered organisations act—already contains the powers to deal with HSU matters. We already have in the registered organisations act prohibitions on members' money being used to favour particular candidates in internal elections or campaigns and provisions in relation to criminal proceedings being initiated where funds are stolen or are obtained by fraud. The current legislation ensures that the Fair Work Commission can share information with the police when appropriate for an investigation. The legislation currently provides for statutory penalties where a party knowingly or recklessly contravenes an order or direction made by the Federal Court or the Fair Work Commission under the registered organisations act or the Fair Work Act. These things exist already; they are already in place. There is no need for the legislation before the chamber to be brought before the House again.


The Fair Work Act already places on officers of a registered organisation a fiduciary duty that is very much similar and akin to the obligations that a director has under the Corporations Law in relation to the disclosure of personal interests, the disclosure of payments to related parties, being required to exercise a responsibility with care and diligence, acting in good faith and not acting improperly to use their position for political advantage. These are already obligations in the law. If you breach those obligations the Fair Work Commission has broad powers to investigate and if necessary prosecute. If officers are found guilty they face a range of serious penalties. This is not fancy. This is not fiction. This is what the law is currently. All of that would occur under the Fair Work Act and the registered organisations act as they currently exist. So why is the government trying to do this? As I said before, this is about ideology. There is no rhyme or reason, other than pure ideology, for these changes. The penalties are draconian. They are not supported by industry. The Australian Industry Group said of what the government is trying to do:


If the proposed criminal penalties and proposed massive financial penalties for breaches of duties are included in the RO Act, this would operate as a major disincentive to existing voluntary officers of registered organisations continuing in their roles, and would deter other people from holding office.


The penalties in this legislation are punitive. When you consider what a person can face in civil and criminal prosecution under this legislation for a failure to disclose or for reckless use of their position you can see that these penalties would act as a disincentive, as the Australian Industry Group has said. Who would volunteer if there are massive penalties for a mistake? Why does this bill seek to introduce criminal penalties for behaviour that is already covered by and subject to criminal law in other legislation? This is not about the government being concerned for registered organisations. This is part of an agenda. It is irrational. The government is not interested in good policy or empirical evidence. This is about the government's DNA and their blood and bone. They hate unions and they hate those who represent workers in the workplace.


We have always remained open to the government's discussing good industrial relations policy and the concerns they may have about defects in the system and about deficiencies that could be remedied, but we cannot support this legislation. If the government were fair dinkum about tackling corruption, regardless of the type of organisation involved, they would not have this legislation before the chamber. Why is the bill silent on non-registered organisations? The bill is not about good governance at all. I believe that Australians will see the bill for what it is, yet another ideological attack on Australia's unions and Australian workers. They have established the royal commissions into the trade union movement. They have done so many things since they have been in power, as the member for Throsby said in relation to cleaners and elsewhere. They just cannot help themselves. This legislation is not about good governance or better workplace relations. It is not about reducing red tape. It is simply about ideology. We will oppose this bill. It is another broken promise like their budget of betrayal and broken promises. We will not stand for it. Australians should oppose it; they will see the bill before the chamber for what it is, another attack by a government that has no regard for Australian workers.

"Snowdon, Warren, MP",ALP,2014-07-14,"



Mr SNOWDON
 (Lingiari) (20:28):  I thank the member for Blair for his contribution and say how well it elucidated the issues before the chamber. I was particularly struck by his description of the coalition and what is contained within their DNA. I participate in this debate on the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Amendment Bill 2014 as someone who has been here longer than anyone else on our side of the chamber and only one other person—




Dr Chalmers:
  A hundred years!




Mr SNOWDON:
  A bloody long time! One other person, Deputy Speaker Scott, has been here a lot longer than me. You still have hair, Deputy Speaker, I have little.




Mr Hartsuyker:
  That wouldn't be hard, to have more hair than you!




Mr SNOWDON:
  That is true. I have to tell you that I have not lost that hair worrying about trade unions. I have lost that hair worrying about this government, and about what the conservatives and the far Right in this country are wanting to do to the people of this country. This bill, as the member for Blair rightly pointed out, is a really good lesson as to this government's political agenda and how much it replicates—across the board—their own ideological self-interest, and their lack of recognition of the proper place of unions in this country and of the rights of Australian workers to be represented by those unions. I remember being on a building site at age 15 and labouring—I won't tell you how successful I was at that job; I was not that flash, I have to tell you—




Mr Butler:
  In the Boer War intervention!




Mr SNOWDON:
  In the Boer War intervention. But I had a very close friendship with the local BWIU organiser—someone who I was able to talk to about the job I was in; someone who was able to give me some guidance about occupational health and safety issues in that workplace; someone who was able to talk to me about my rights, as a young man earning adult wages at 15 and labouring on a building site, here at the university which my friend here, the member for Rankin, has just—well, relatively recently, as far as I am concerned!—received his PhD from: working in that workplace was very instructive. It taught me—as if I had not been told by others, including my family—about the importance of joining a union. From then on, throughout my whole working life, I have been and remain a member of the union. I organised as a union representative—I was a shop steward, effectively—in my workplace. I was an elected official in a trade union; not a paid official but an elected representative of my peers. By being in that organisation, I found out how important it is to understand the intrinsic value of organising workers in this country, the role of trade unions, and their historical importance and their validity, not only historically but also today. This bill demonstrates to us the government's disguised and absolute disdain for and abhorrence of unions and their historically critical role in representing Australian workers—




Mrs Griggs:
  Craig Thomson did a good job!




Mr SNOWDON:
  I will come to you later; just don’t go out of here! The role of the unions in winning pay and conditions from capital, by dint of their organisational ability, their capacity as individuals, their advocacy, and their professionalism—that is what it is about; understanding the proper role of trade unions. In this country, we all know—even the blue bloods opposite know; those with the silver spoon know this, and they have got that silver-spoon privilege not by dint of their own work but by the work of hardworking Australian men and women—that those people doing the hard yakka in the workplace: in the coalfields; on the building sites; in the financial sector; in the hospitals; those are the people doing the work. These are the people who create value for us. It might well be thought that you would recognise that even if you were born with a silver spoon in your mouth, as many of the other side seem to have been. I have a great deal of respect for some—not all, but some—members of the government. I know them to be fair and genuine people—yourself included, Mr Deputy Speaker. Not that I want to malign you—




Mr Butler:
  Or damn with faint praise!




Mr SNOWDON:
  Or damn you with faint praise! But nevertheless, this government, as the member for Blair has rightly said, has form. Since I first came here a long time ago, at every opportunity the coalition, whether in government or in opposition, has sought to undermine the rights of Australian working men and women by attacking their trade unions. It is absolutely true: the historical record speaks for itself . It is in their DNA to vilify, attack and undermine the role of unions in the workforce and the rights of their members. And I, among many in this place, lived through the Work Choices debacle, and what followed: we all remember the dogs on the wharf; we all remember those things. That is what is in the DNA of this government. That is what this bill represents. It is, as the member for Blair rightly said, irrational. It is superfluous. There is no need for this legislation. We need to comprehend for a moment what it in fact seeks to do. This bill, as you know Mr Deputy Speaker, would establish the Registered Organisations Commission, or ROC, and would amend the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act. The ROC would be headed by a Registered Organisations Commissioner with greater investigative powers than those available to the General Manager of the Fair Work Commission.


This same bill was first introduced in November of last year. It was defeated in the Senate; earlier this year, the amendments recommended by the senate legislative committee were circulated in the House. Now we have got the same piece of legislation again. As the member for Blair has said, we will not be supporting this government's Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Amendment Bill 2014, or the circulated amendments. As I pointed out earlier, these registered organisations—these trade unions—play a fundamental role in Australia's workplace relations system. They are created and registered for the purpose of representing Australian employers and employees at work. Registered organisations also represent their members before industrial tribunals and courts, and work with government on policy matters ranging from employment issues to economic and social policy. I want to refer to other contributions about union officials who acted inappropriately and corruptly: there is no place for them. We in the Labor Party have no tolerance for corruption by union officials or anyone else, including officers of employer bodies. We support tough penalties for those who break the law. As the member for Blair so eloquently pointed out, there are existing legislative frameworks which deal with those matters and make this piece of legislation redundant.


We support appropriate regulation for registered organisations, including a properly empowered regulator and consequences for those who do not follow the rules. We support—and are committed to ensuring—financial accountability for unions and employer organisations alike. That is why the now Leader of the Opposition, as minister, toughened the laws in 2012 to improve financial transparency and disclosure to their members by registered organisations, that Tony Abbott had enacted.As a result, the regulation of trade unions in Australia has never been stronger, accountability has never been higher, and the powers of the Fair Work Commission to investigate and prosecute for breaches have never been broader.


The minister consistently uses the HSU matters, of which we are all aware. We say that those matters can be fairly and properly dealt with by other areas of the law. Under the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act, officers of registered organisations already have fiduciary duties akin to those for directors under the Corporations Act. The Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act already requires officers to disclose their personal interests. The Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act already requires officers to disclose when payments are being made to related parties. It already requires officers to exercise care and diligence, to act with good faith and not to use their position improperly for political advantage. The government promised to regulate registered organisations in the same way as corporations and as you would expect—and I am sure you would not have to admit to this—they have broken that commitment. This bill places higher penalties and a more onerous regime on officers of registered organisations than those imposed on company directors. The Australian Industry Group suggests that the alignment of disclosure requirements for registered organisations with company directors under the Corporation Act was inappropriate.


Let us be very clear. The Australian community needs to understand—and I am sure it does—that we on this side of the House will not tolerate criminal or corrupt behaviour by anyone, least of all those people who are in charge of these registered organisations. The member for Solomon had the good grace to intervene a little earlier. I noticed that she had a contribution to make in an earlier discussion on the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Amendment Bill. She made some observations which, as we have come to understand, were quite wrong. She railed against the Australian Education Union's Northern Territory branch, and attempted to discredit the union and its members by referring to that union's former president standing as a candidate in the recent Northern Territory by-election. It is true that the union president contested this election, and a union president moving from the industrial to the political arena is not on—even more so when it is without reference to the union he works for. The member's statement about this being a grotesque misuse of resources is factually incorrect. It is just plain wrong. It is my understanding that both the AEU and the candidate himself made it very clear from the outset of his misplaced and unacceptable campaign. For the public record, I, as a union member, criticise his decisions and the way he was operating as a president of the union. I made it very clear that neither I nor his members supported what he was up to. But it is very clear that not one cent of AEU funds or members' funds went on his campaign expenditure. The member for Solomon got it wrong again. Ignorance is no excuse for her willingness to mislead the parliament in the way that she has done. In fact, all of her contributions fitted that description: ignorant and misleading.


Had the member for Solomon wanted to genuinely address corruption in the Northern Territory, she needed only to look at the Northern Territory government. That was all she had to do. The CLP government in the Northern Territory have set the standard for corrupt behaviour in Australia—at worst, a standard for corrupt behaviour in practicing Australian politics for many years. Their latest slush fund, Foundation 51, has replaced its discredited precursor, the Carpentaria trust proprietary limited company. A former director of Foundation 51, Mr Peter Maley, now a magistrate, retired from the position once his involvement was publicly exposed. The conflict of interest was obvious, but it goes deeper. Just look at the facts. The corrupt behaviour of the CLP government in the Northern Territory needs to be properly and clearly understood by the people of the Northern Territory and the people of Australia—and I am sure they will come to understand it. They know it already. The CLP government is deeply unpopular—almost as unpopular as the member for Solomon. Let me be fairly clear, we will not be supporting this legislation. We will stand up for the rights of unions and union members, and we will make sure that those people who act corruptly are dealt with properly by the law.

 (Scullin) (20:43):  I rise in opposition to the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Amendment Bill 2014. Deputy Speaker, I hope you will forgive me for saying that I am not pleased to do so, because I am not. This is an unnecessary debate concerning unnecessary legislation.


As other contributions in this debate have already noted, this is not the first time this place has considered those matters that are the substance of the bill which is before us. Last year, I spoke in opposition to an identical bill, as I believe many of my colleagues did. I fear to some extent that I may be going over old ground, but this is worth repeating—or so it would seem. Perhaps this time the members opposite will listen. I note that the few of them that participated certainly did not have much to say in this debate.


The other place, wisely, in my opinion, rejected this bill. The government dominated Senate committee made a series of amendments to the original bill which the government agreed to. Then that bill was also negatived by the Senate in May. Bizarrely, the government, having accepted the recommendations for amendments from that Senate committee, has now introduced the bill essentially in its original form and has reintroduced the amendments instead of redrafting the current bill to incorporate those amendments. Surely this is just another sign of this government's dysfunction? This is a long way from what could be described as situation normal. This is incompetence and it cannot—although I suspect that it will—be blamed on everyone else.


But it is a bit more than dysfunction and incompetence; it is also a sign of this government's desperation. As the member for Griffith put it so well earlier in this debate, we see here before us a government determined to talk about everything but their cruel, unfair budget of broken promises. At one level, it is hard to blame them for that. The budget is toxic and it has caused a reversion to their basic DNA and make-up for members opposite—their ideologically driven aversion to collective action and unionism.


This debate today is another example of this government's twisted priorities. In this case, it is a distraction from debating the substance of the budget that people in my constituency—and I am sure people in the member for Lalor's constituency—want to talk about and want to hold members opposite accountable for. Whatever else this government is, this government is not, as the minister stated in his second reading contribution, 'staunchly committed to improving protections for members of registered organisations'. Rather, it is simply reverting to type, breaking yet more election promises while attacking not just unionism but ordinary working people. I think about the people spoken of by the member for Throsby and the member for Bendigo in their excellent contributions to this debate—ordinary working people taking voluntary roles to oversee the management of the organisations they are proud to be members of, people who are a long way from the boardroom, decent people who should be supported in these important voluntary roles. The rhetoric of the minister suggests that that is his concern, but his actions fly in the face of those statements.


Regardless of the government's confusion in this space, Labor's position is clear: we have zero tolerance for corrupt much less criminal practice, as the member for Lingiari just said, and support proper accountability of registered organisations for their members and the community. So we oppose this bill and its associated amendments.


I will turn very briefly to the structure and substance, such as it is, of the legislation which is before us. The current bill, like the previous bill, seeks to create a registered organisations commissioner and a registered organisations commission within the Office of the Fair Work Ombudsman. This commissioner would supervise the conduct of employer and employee organisations that are registered under the Fair Work Act 2009. Interestingly, as the member for Gorton has noted, it would pay no heed to those unregistered organisations that are amongst the very few cheerleaders of this legislation. The bill also provides for: increased disclosure requirements for registered organisations and officers; stronger coercive investigatory powers—they have been described as 'draconian'—for the commissioner, with very limited restrictions on their use; and also increased penalties, including criminal penalties.


I note that, even with the proposed amendments, employer and employee organisations alike still have significant concerns with the bill—and rightly so. I also note the concerns of the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills in this regard, concerns the minister has done little to allay. The government promised to regulate registered organisations in the same way as corporations. However, like many other promises, the coalition has broken this one as well, because those provisions which are contained within this bill exceed those penalties contained in the Corporations Act. This is unnecessary legislation. It contains extensive duplication. I am reminded of being in this place when the member for Kooyong and other members opposite celebrated with their little tea party red tape repeal day. It is astonishing that a government that took such pleasure in a deregulatory agenda could be putting forward legislation such as this. I note in this regard that, moreover, regulation of registered organisations has never been stronger. Last year in December and today we heard much sensationalism in this debate from the very few members inclined to participate on the opposite side but with very little grounding in the substance of those matters which are contained within the bill that is before us.


I am reminded that in 2012, before I was here, the 43rd Parliament considered all of those substantive matters that are the subject of this bill before enacting into law the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Amendment Act 2012. So I ask myself: why are rushing into this new regime? It is proposed, in effect, that we discard one regime, an evidence based regime, before it has had a chance to do its work and for that work to be appropriately scrutinised. I said last year that the government was proceeding with this bill with undue haste to remedy a problem it has been unable to properly articulate. Save to recite a predictable list of failings and breaches—including certainly some very serious matters but which are irrelevant to the present debate—the government is still yet to justify this legislation.


I say again: Labor takes a zero tolerance approach to union corruption and criminality and remains committed to ensuring accountability of all registered organisations—those representing employers and those representing employees. That is we properly toughened the legislative regime as well as making it more open and transparent. We enacted properly what this minister talked about disingenuously. I asked last year and I ask again: where is the evidence that these present arrangements have not worked? What specific aspect, if any, can the government point to that is not working today? If there is something specific that is not working as best it can then why not take the time to work with the system to ameliorate any problems? The government have not made the case. In fact, they have not even tried to engage with these questions.


Eight months on from that debate, I am concerned that members opposite do not seem to appreciate that registered organisations, be they reflecting the concerns of employers or employees, are fundamentally different from for-profit corporations. This difference is about purpose as well as structure. So we say to the avid deregulators opposite that regulation must be fit for purpose. Before us in this debate I can see a lot of unnecessary red tape.


I am reminded that in his original second reading speech, the Minister for Education stated:


Many registered organisations control assets worth millions of dollars. They are effectively dealing with cash flow and investments similar to those of large businesses.


I take this opportunity once more to remind him that this is a misleading assertion. Usually, the biggest asset that a union might have would be its premises, so to compare this to the investment of a large business is, at best, meaningless. And I also note that the proposed increased penalties are, to say the least, vastly disproportionate to the assets of most registered organisations, particularly those representing the concerns of employees. What may be right in relation to the regulation of large companies is unlikely to suit these types of not-for-profits. In this regard I again refer to the concerns of the Australian Industry Group, who say, 'It is unfair to subject non-profit organisations to the same disclosure rules applying to listed company executives. Much less, of course, more onerous obligations.' And it is unfair. It is as simple as that for anyone without ideological blinkers firmly affixed or for someone who is not desperate for a distraction. 


I note in this regard that that bastion of the sensible centre beloved of the former workplace relations minister, now Prime Minister, the Institute of Public Affairs, gets star billing as one of the very few strong supporters of the bill before us. What a surprise that is! The IPA, according to the explanatory memorandum, believes that 'further measures should be taken to strengthen the financial management and regulation of registered organisations, commensurate with their considerable financial resources'—repeating that canard of the minister's. Maybe the IPA is where he got it from. It is one thing to support this principle—a principle, I remind members opposite, that is presently enacted in law. Regulation is currently fit for purpose. But it is quite another to use it to attempt to justify these onerous, unnecessary provisions. And, of course, it is just wrong as a matter of fact.


I spoke last year about what I hoped might be unintended consequences of the legislation before us. I note that non-registered organisations continue to be, unsurprisingly, much keener on this bill than registered ones. It creates a real disincentive against office-holding and a powerful incentive for those registered organisations that can—that is not employee organisations—cease their registration under the act. And so I say that surely we should be encouraging democratic participation in the governance of registered organisations, if we are sincere in our concern for their members. We should be, if the words of the minister are more than just words, if our actions in this place are to match our rhetoric here and outside. But instead we see, in the words of the socialist sect the Australian Industry Group, this 'unfair' commitment, that will, I am sure, push ordinary members—those people spoken of so movingly by the member for Bendigo and the member for Throsby—away from involvement in governance, involvement in being a meaningful check and balance on the operation of those who act on their behalf, and from a meaningful role in organisations that are at the core of our democratic system, in trade unions.


It is worth remembering that the current regulatory regime for registered organisations already provides for obligations and duties very similar to those applying to corporate directors, as many previous speakers on this side have noted, but it is a fact which seems to elude members opposite. Financial disclosure and transparency rules for registered organisations have been dramatically improved under the process Labor embarked upon in 2012 and that I spoke of earlier. Training has been underway for some time since that legislation passed. It has been improving the operation and accountability of registered organisations. So it is, to say the least, disappointing that, in having this unnecessary debate again, we cannot have regard to the efficacy of the regime which is presently in place. We are not considering the lived experience of those presently subject to it after only a very short amount of time. I noted in December that some of the provisions we were proposing to repeal had not yet become operative. That is the contempt which this government has for the process of this place and for evidence based decision making. 


We have already provided under the 2012 legislation for the disclosure of remuneration, including board fees, of high-paid officials of registered organisations, and these are aligned with the usual reporting periods for annual reports and the filing of financial returns. Again, this is creating a system of obligations and duties very much like those applying under the Corporations Act. Labor has recognised and acted upon appropriately the seriousness of complying with workplace laws, of looking after members' interests, and so increased penalties but kept those penalties proportional to the distinct nature of registered organisations. This was fit-for-purpose regulation, made in response to circumstances and enacted following appropriate consultation with stakeholders across the whole spectrum—employers, employees, registered organisations and unregistered organisations—not just the IPA and certain unregistered organisations. This is in stark contrast with the bill before the House now and in December last year. This bill is at odds with its stated justification. This bill, as it has been reincarnated, albeit with very little life breathed into it, was an attack on trade unionism then and it remains so today.


If members of the coalition care about union members and people on low to middle incomes more generally, then they would not have supported a budget that attacks their way of life, their ability to see a doctor or to get an education. We are being asked on the one hand to have regard to a royal commission, but with this bill we are being told the government has already made its mind up anyway. I oppose this bill, which has at its core an attack on the very notion of collective action. (Time expired)

Ms RYAN
 (Lalor—Opposition Whip) (20:58):  I, like the member for Scullin, rise to speak again on the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Amendment Bill 2014. Like the member for Scullin, I spoke in December. As then, tonight I will speak for a few moments and return to the speech at another time.


I oppose this bill, just like I oppose the Treasurer's so-called fair budget, with its so-called fair changes to pensions, fair cuts to education, fair GP tax, fair changes to Newstart eligibility and fair changes to higher education, training and apprenticeships. I rise to oppose the ludicrous, the ridiculous situation whereby this government would retain the word 'fair' while making amendments that are not fair.


When I was working in schools in the western suburbs of Melbourne I saw the impact on local families of the then Minister Abbott's WorkChoices legislation. I saw students exploited by individual contracts. I heard direct from these kids about being paid in pizzas. I heard time and time again about kids who did not get a job when they asked about the conditions and overtime arrangements. I saw parents under pressure, too—


Debate interrupted.

"Bandt, Adam, MP",AG,2014-07-14,"



Mr BANDT
 (Melbourne) (18:04):  I was making the point when this matter was last before the House that the government, when you look at the various pieces of legislation that they are putting forward and what is in the budget, is coming for people's rights at work indirectly this time around. They have learnt the lesson from the John Howard era of WorkChoices that if you come and attack people's rights at work they will fight back and they will turf you out. So now, this time, the government is coming at it in a far more sly fashion. As I mentioned last time, we are seeing legislation that will enable people who work to be paid in kind by the businesses that they work for. If you work at the fish and chips shop, expect now to be paid partly in fish and chips. You cannot pay your rent with that, you cannot pay your electricity bill with that, but that is no concern of the Prime Minister's.


And then we see this bill. It is said by the minister and by those who support it that this bill is about putting corporations and unions on an even footing and saying that organisations of workers should be treated in the same way as organisations that exist to make a profit. I will come back in a moment to the functions of registered organisations that make them very, very different from corporations. But let us just take that suggestion at face value for a moment. If the government was serious about saying that we are now going to regulate corporations in the same way as unions, then what flows from that? Firstly, I can tell you that unions are required under the Fair Work Act and other legislation to be democratic organisations, which means that the people who run those organisations have to be elected to those positions.


So, assuming that the government is right that now corporations are going to be treated the same way, it is going to come as a shock to most CEOs who have been appointed by their board to find out that now they are going to have to be elected, because presumably that is what this government thinks is fair. It is also going to come as a shock to everyone who has a proprietary limited company to learn that their accounts and their financial returns for every year are now going to be published on the internet, because that is what happens with registered organisations and unions at the moment. The standard of scrutiny over their accounts is well above that of someone who sets up a Pty Ltd company.


So if the government is truly serious about this, they will be requiring everyone who incorporates their small business to now not only elect the people who run it but also publish all of their information and their financial affairs on the internet. You understand that the government, of course, is not interested in that. The government is quite happy to let companies run their own race, but feels completely legitimate about coming in and saying to organisations that represent workers, 'We deserve the right to micromanage you in a way that we would never dream of doing to a private company, but we will impose the same penalties on you as we might on a publicly listed company.'


What the government fails completely to understand is that organisations of workers do not exist for the same purposes as businesses. That is where the whole argument behind this legislation falls down. Businesses exist for a purpose. They exist to make a profit. That is what they do and they are judged on that basis. Corporations law requires directors to act in the best interests of their shareholders and continue to make a profit. They are judged accordingly. Unions do not exist that reason. Unions exist to advance the interests of the people they represent.


I very much doubt that, apart from perhaps the odd member of the AMA, anyone on the government's side of the benches has ever been a member of a union. Had they been in a union, actually been involved in a union and understood what unions do, they would not be pursuing this bill. What they would understand is that there are many, many people who work in this country who do not know their rights. There are many people who work in this country who rely on someone to advise them about what they are entitled to, and who then rely on someone to go in and enforce that basic entitlement. That is the role of a union.


Before I came to this place, I worked for many years representing some of the lowest paid workers in this country and their unions. There are people in Melbourne working in garages, sheds or their own rooms who are making the clothes that you will find being sold on Bourke Street or Swanston Street for $200 or $300 and they are getting paid $3 an hour for it. These people do not have sick pay and they do not get annual leave. They are required to look after their own workers' compensation. They usually do not speak English as a first language. If they get injured, they have to look after themselves. They are so-called independent contractors, even though they are doing all the work of employees and of workers.


The only reason that these people are able to enjoy something approaching a decent income and quality of life—which most of us would take for granted—is because they have had a union that has gone in there and told them what their rights are and then gone out and advocated for them. They have had a union that has gone out and fought for changes to our workplace laws. The unions do not do that for their own benefit. They do it for the benefit of others, and they do not get a direct financial benefit from it. That is where unions—and employer organisations as well, because they participate in the industrial sphere with the aim of advancing the conditions of others—are fundamentally different from profit-making companies such as your BHP or your corner shop. It is why they should be treated differently.


I think anyone who has been in a union or has been involved in a union would condemn any union official who breaches that fundamental principle and who starts getting involved in union activity for their own personal benefit. The government is using that as a justification for this law, but I would say two things about that. Firstly, we have seen very clearly that the current laws work when it comes to finding those people and prosecuting them. If the current laws did not work, we would not have people now facing jail sentences. The current laws do work. Secondly, the suggestion that somehow the imposition of new penalties is somehow going to make life better for the people who these organisations are supposedly representing is just fanciful, because if this were a charity the government would be getting up and saying, 'This is red tape.' In fact, that is exactly what the government is saying when it comes to the charities regulator.


With the charities regulator, you have organisations saying, 'We would much rather have a one-stop shop so that we do not have to go to multiple places of regulation and so that everyone can be assured that we are doing the right thing.' The government says, 'No, no. We are going to take that away, because it is too much red tape.' Yet when it comes to unions, they are prepared to put the kinds of regulations and oversight on them that they would never dream of doing to businesses and that they are trying to unwind for charities. So why is the government doing it? It cannot be about better regulation or better governance. They are doing it simply because they know one fundamental fact: for many, many workers and for many people who do not have the time themselves to go out and defend their own interests, because they are just too busy making ends meet or living their own lives, they know that they have unions out there in this country that look after them.


The unions have fought for shorter working weeks in this country and have helped bring us the weekend. It is thanks to unions that we have the penalty rates in this country that mean that people who work unsociable hours get to have a decent income, in recognition of the fact that their family members and their friends might be out having a good time, catching up on the weekend, and yet the workers are stuck at work. Many people know that when they see annual leave loading on their pay slip it is not there because an employer decided, 'What a good idea, I will give it to you.' It was there because it was fought for.


That is why the government is introducing this legislation. It is to tie up workers and their unions in red tape so that they do not have time to go and advance the interests of the people that they are looking after. It is a transparent piece of legislation. The day that the government comes in and says, 'Yes, we are willing to make every private company and every public company subject to the same level of scrutiny, disclosure and democracy as a trade union,' is when I will start taking them seriously that they are interested in levelling the playing field. But they are not interested in that. This is just the wind-up for the attack on people's rights at work. We, on behalf of the Greens, will be having none of that. If someone breaches the law and if someone breaches fundamental principles and starts getting involved in a union for their own personal financial benefit, they deserve to have the book thrown at them. What we are seeing every day is that they will have the book thrown at them. There is no need for this legislation.

"McNamara, Karen, MP",LP,2014-07-14,"



Mrs McNAMARA
 (Dobell) (18:15):  This government is committed to improving the fair work laws so we can build a more stable, fair and prosperous future for Australian workers, businesses and the economy. The measures in the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Amendment Bill are a key election commitment and deliver our pre-election policy for better accountability and transparency of registered organisations. There is no doubting the public's support for these measures, particularly in light of recent findings following the Fair Work investigation into the Health Services Union and the current royal commission into registered organisations. This government is determined to improve protection for members of registered organisations through the implementation of a comprehensive plan to enhance the government's accountability of registered organisations. Never again should the hardworking members of an organisation such as the HSU experience misappropriation of their funds towards an individual's personal gain. This is why we are reintroducing the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Amendment Bill. 


When Labor and the Greens combined to vote down this legislation, they demonstrated a refusal to support greater accountability and transparency for registered organisations. They have voted against improved protection for union members and have given the green light to further exploitation of honest union members by dishonest union officials. They have also voted against a clearer and simpler reporting framework that would assist both unions and employer associations to comply. While members opposite champion themselves as the defenders of Australian workers, they will be judged by their actions, not their rhetoric. The shadow minister for employment and workplace relations, the member for Gorton, said during his contribution to the original debate in the House:


… the opposition has no tolerance for corruption—none whatsoever—whether it be by union officials or officers of employer bodies. We support tough penalties for those who break the law. We support appropriate regulation for registered organisations, including a properly empowered regulator and consequences for those who do not follow the rules.


Yet the member for Gorton opposed this legislation and went as far as moving an amendment to deny a second reading on the grounds that the House would be ill advised to continue, having regard to the adverse impact of the creation of the Registered Organisations Commission on registered organisations, including unions and employer and employee groups.


There should be absolutely no question about the importance of this legislation. Until this parliament acts and supports this legislation, Australia will be denied a sufficiently robust system to tackle corruption within registered organisations. It is no longer tenable to argue that the present system is adequate to deal with or discourage the sort of behaviour brought to light by the investigation into the HSU. By rejecting this legislation the unholy Labor-Green alliance has given the green light to more of the same behaviour as demonstrated by the HSU, Craig Thomson and Michael Williamson.


This bill replicates the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Amendment Bill 2013, which was rejected by the Senate on 14 May 2014. However, the previous government's amendments to the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Amendment Act 2012 demonstrated that there was a need to increase financial accountability of registered organisations, strengthen investigative powers and increase penalties. But these changes were not adequate. In a submission to the Senate Standing Committee on Education, Employment and Workplace Relations inquiry into the registered organisations amendment legislation, the Australian Mines and Metals Association advised in reference to the former Labor government: 


… the changes the government has proposed are not tough enough to deliver the accountability that the members of those organisations are seeking 


The Institute of Public Affairs commented:


Further measures should be taken to strengthen the financial management and regulation of registered organisations, commensurate with their considerable financial resources.


This government agrees that the Labor government's amendments did not go far enough. This is why this bill strengthens reporting and disclosure obligations to align more closely with the Corporations Act, moves obligations from the rules of registered organisations to the face of the legislation, and provides the new Registered Organisations Commission greater scope to ensure that officers are complying with their obligations and greater powers to investigate when a member makes a complaint about a registered organisation. It is this government's view that registered organisations should be as accountable to their members as company directors are to their shareholders. Like companies, many registered organisations control assets worth millions of dollars, and we have seen members from the other side access these funds to aid their election campaigns. We want to see that these assets are administered properly and used to benefit members.


According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, in August 2012 1.8 million people were members of trade unions. As of 17 October 2013, there were 112 registered organisations listed with the Fair Work Commission. The majority of these registered organisations are not-for-profit and operate to serve the interests of their members. Some have additional arms or subsidiaries to the organisation that are not related to their status as a registered organisation, such as a for-profit training arm.


For the purpose of this debate, it is important that we acknowledge the financial strength of these registered organisations and demonstrate the level of responsibility assigned to their office bearers. Forty-five per cent of employer organisations and 73 per cent of employee organisations have net assets valued at over $2 million. These assets, and the functions of Registered Organisations, are to protect their members' interests by representing members in industrial matters and campaigning on policies that affect them, such as taxation, workplace relations and broader government policies. Naturally, in order to achieve their aims, registered organisations require funds to cover their direct operating costs, such as advertising and legal matters. These funds are obtained from membership fees, donations and other investments. Therefore, the trust placed in the officials of these registered organisations is high, and the membership deserves appropriate protections and recourse when their funds are misused.


Importantly, this bill introduces higher penalties for beaches of civil penalty provisions, some criminal penalties and stricter reporting and disclosure obligations that compare with those under the Corporations Act 2001. This bill increases penalties for a wide range of civil offences in order to create a real deterrence for wrongdoing by registered organisations and their officers. Serious breaches of an officer's duty, such as where an officer uses their position to obtain benefit for themselves or someone else, are criminal offences. The maximum penalty for these offences is $340,000 or five years imprisonment, or both. The civil penalties for serious contraventions will be $204,000 for an individual or $1,020,000 for a body corporate. Currently maximum penalties for serious offences are only $10,200 for individuals. These offences relate to officers and employees of registered organisations who fail to discharge duties in good faith and for a proper purpose. Criminal sanctions will also apply where an officer does not comply with the commissioner's new investigative powers.


A strong message needs to be sent to discourage wrongdoing by officers and to rebuild the confidence of members and the community. Stronger requirements for registered organisations and stronger penalties will only successfully combat corruption with a tough cop on the beat. This bill establishes the Registered Organisations Commission headed by the Registered Organisations Commissioner. The Registered Organisations Commission will be established within the Office of the Fair Work Ombudsman. Importantly, the commissioner will have independence in the exercise of their functions and powers to direct the staff of the commission. Significantly, the activities of the commission will be subject to the same oversight by the Commonwealth Ombudsman as Commonwealth agencies. This will ensure the appropriate level of transparency and public accountability. 


Whilst members opposite oppose these measures, members of the government have not forgotten why these measures are absolutely necessary. The limitations of the Fair Work Ombudsman were exposed through the investigation into the HSU. Members opposite defended the Fair Work Ombudsman, but it took far too long between the allegations first being raised and the eventual findings by the justice system—in total five years. It is clear that the investigations into the HSU by the Fair Work Commission took too long and questioned the Fair Work Commission's capacity to be an effective regulator of registered organisations.


The Registered Organisations Commission will ensure that allegations of wrongdoing are investigated quickly and efficiently. Its sole focus will be on rules relating to the accountability and transparency of registered organisations. Importantly this bill ensures a strong interaction between the Registered Organisations Commission and the Fair Work Commission. Transitional arrangements are included in the bill to ensure any ongoing matters being dealt with by the Fair Work Commission relating to registered organisations can be dealt with by the newly established Registered Organisations Commission. It is absolutely essential that the Registered Organisations Commissioner be able to share information with law enforcement agencies if they reasonably believe it is to appropriate to do so in the course of conducting their role.


This is in direct response to the recent investigation into the HSU, which exposed shortcomings when dealing with possible breaches of criminal laws. My electorate of Dobell, more than any other electorate, has witnessed firsthand the stench of this corruption within the trade union movement. The charges and allegations against the former Labor-turned-independent member for Dobell, Craig Thomson, along with ALP national president, Michael Williamson, exposed the vulnerability of the current registered organisation arrangements. So serious were the allegations stemming from the systemic rorting in the HSU, the breaches were investigated by both the Fair Work Commission and the Victorian Police.


The Fair Work Commission investigation into the HSU identified a total of 181 contraventions of the Registered Organisations Act and HSU rules by union officials and others. The claim against Mr Thomson included 37 alleged breaches of general duties imposed on officers of registered organisations and a further 25 alleged breaches of HSU rules. In addition to these findings, Mr Thomson was arrested in relation to more than 150 fraud related criminal charges, including allegations that his 2007 federal election campaign was partly funded by union money without authorisation. The magistrate found Mr Thomson guilty of using credit cards issued to him in his role as national secretary of the HSU between 2002 and 2007. Mr Thomson was found guilty of stealing HSU funds and obtaining a financial advantage by deception when he used the HSU credit card to pay for escort services, cigarettes, firewood, travel expenses for his previous wife and withdrawing nearly $10,000 in cash from ATMs.


The hard-working, honest members of registered organisations, such as the HSU, deserve better treatment from the people elected to represent their interests. They also deserve government support to stand by their side, and not by the side of dishonest union officials. If it was not for Mr Thomson and Mr Williams' high-profile involvement in the Australian Labor Party, one wonders if the truth of the matter would ever have been exposed. This government is of the firm belief that corruption and poor governance within Australia's trade union movement should be identified and stopped. This government's determination to stand up for honest union members is exemplified through the establishment of the Royal Commission into Trade Union Governance and Corruption. It is clear that the Australian people have become increasingly concerned about a range of revelations and allegations involving officials of industrial organisations benefiting from certain funds, which have been set up for purposes that are often unknown. In the words of former Prime Minister Julia Gillard:


It's common practice, indeed every union has what it refers to as a re-election fund, slush fund …


The royal commission will ensure that wrongdoing in the union movement is exposed and those responsible for illegal actions are held to account.


This government is serious about protecting workers and tackling a culture riddled with allegations of corruption, dodgy deals and secret funds. The time has come for this legislation to be supported; the rorts, the rackets and the rip-offs must end. Members of registered organisations must have their interests protected, and the community must have faith in our institutions. The only people who have anything to fear by these amendments are those who do the wrong thing. Members of registered organisations and the community have everything to gain. It is time for members opposite to stand with the government to ensure honest workers are not ripped off by dishonest union bosses. I commend this legislation to the House and I call on members opposite to do likewise.

"Owens, Julie, MP",ALP,2014-07-14,"



Ms OWENS
 (Parramatta) (18:29):  I will start by commenting on a couple of the things the member for Dobell covered in her speech on the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Amendment Bill 2014. Firstly, at the very beginning of her speech, she said that the fact that the opposition was not supporting the bill was an indication that the opposition supported some of the worst behaviour of a small number of union officials. That of course is not the truth. For the benefit of the member for Dobell: sometimes two people can see the same problem—and can even have equivalent views about the seriousness of the problem—but can disagree on the answer. I think that is what is happening in this House at the moment. I do not think there is anyone in this House, on either side, who believes that officials of registered organisations—be they representatives of unions or employers—should be able to get away with the kinds of behaviour we have seen in recent months from some people who had been elected or appointed to represent the interests of their members.


When we on this side look at the problem, however, we disagree with the answer the government has put forward. We disagree for a number of reasons. Firstly, the member for Dobell herself said that she was seeking to ensure that officials of registered organisations were held to account in the same way those in corporations were. But this bill goes much further than that. The penalties imposed on officials of registered organisations exceed those imposed for equivalent corporate crimes. So this bill does not match the penalties for registered organisations with those for corporations; it in fact goes further for registered organisations—much further.


The other interesting part of the member for Dobell's speech was when she listed the outcomes of the inquiries into the HSU case involving Mr Thomson. She talked about the Fair Work inquiry. She talked about the 181 breaches of registered organisation rules and HSU rules—and about the penalties imposed. In doing so, she in fact she described how effective the current regime was in dealing with the HSU case. While she was putting all that forward as an indication of why you should change the rules, it actually demonstrates that those rules worked. A person has been appropriately investigated, breaches have been found and penalties have been applied—a jail sentence has been handed down. That demonstrates an extremely effective piece of regulation that did its job very well.


It is not really necessary to state this, because I think everybody in this House would agree, but none of us have any tolerance for corrupt union officials or for corrupt officers of employer bodies. Nobody in this House has a tolerance for that. I have no tolerance for people who offer bribes to union officials or for those who receive them. I do not make the distinction that one side is better than the other. When the government talks about corrupt union officials, I would feel more comfortable if it also occasionally mentioned the people who offered or received the bribes—or the businesses that engaged bikie gangs to collect their debts or to bully union officials. There are many aspects surrounding this issue of union corruption that we are not talking about. Again, I would feel more confident that the government was seriously concerned about corruption if the debate dealt also with those who interact with union officials.


Unlike many of those on the other side, I am a great supporter of the union movement, although I do not myself come from the union movement. I did work for a registered organisation, but it was an employer body. I ran the Australian Independent Record Labels Association for nearly seven years. It represented almost all—about 80 per cent by the end of my time there—of the independent labels in Australia. We worked to level the playing field. We did the kinds of deals and bulk agreements needed to level the playing field between the small end of the industry and the very large players. It was a great occupation to have. It was one of the best jobs in the country.


So my background, my perspective, is that of a person who represented employers, not workers. Yet I have been a union member all of my life—because I think they are incredibly important organisations. In many ways the work the union movement has done for over a century has helped to create a ballast in our economy that perhaps those on the opposite side of this chamber do not appreciate—the permanent secure work that so many people enjoyed for so long and the working conditions in our public service, in our public hospitals and in our fire brigades. Secure, stable jobs create a ballast. As a result of the efforts of the union movement, when there is great volatility in the economy, there remains a substantial group of workers who feel secure. That group is less likely to stop spending as quickly as others stop spending and they are more likely to start spending again a little earlier. That helps to smooth out some of the bumps, some of the volatility, in the economy. 


For over a century, unions have worked to help provide real opportunities for family life—the 38-hour week, weekends, days off, extra rostered days off, four weeks annual leave, family leave et cetera. These things allow people to spend time with their family. Even more importantly than that, perhaps, unions have helped ensure that work requirements are planned in advance—so families can know what time they will be able to spend together. All of these things help create ballast in our economy as well. They help to create stable families, families who have savings, who plan, who accumulate assets and who have a greater chance of staying together.


So behind all the to-and-fro in this House about whether unions are good or bad—and we know the government do not like any worker who belongs to a union; they do not like the maritime workers, they do not like the construction workers and they do not like manufacturing workers, because they are unionised—




Mr Robert:
  On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker: the standing orders do not allow a member to impugn the motives of other members. That includes impugning the motives of all members of the government. For the member for Parramatta to say, 'The government does not like any worker', is impugning our motives and should be withdrawn.




Ms OWENS:
  I withdraw.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Broadbent
):  The member has withdrawn.




Ms OWENS:
  It is interesting to watch the government's lack of support for industries such as the manufacturing sector, the construction sector, the maritime sector; to see the extraordinary lack of support for those areas of work. But underneath that to and fro, I think there really should be a recognition in this House that over many, many years the union movement has done an extraordinary job in providing a way of life that in many ways Australians have now take for granted. An incredible effort over many decades went into that.


The Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Amendment Bill 2014 is a reintroduction of a previous bill with some amendments that came from the Senate legislative committee report, but there are still a number of problems with it from this side of the House. It establishes the Registered Organisations Commission and amends the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act. The Registered Organisations Commission will be headed by a registered organisations commissioner with greater investigative powers than those available to the general manager of the Fair Work Commission. It also modifies disclosure requirements to make them more onerous, no doubt, including higher penalties for civil contraventions, and it introduces criminal offences in respect of officers' duties that are modelled on but also exceed those found in the Corporations Act. So it increases the red tape burden, makes the disclosure requirements considerably more onerous and raises the penalties to a higher level than those found in the Corporations Act. While one of the rationales for this bill is to make those penalties even, it actually increases the penalties beyond those of the Corporations Act.


Registered organisations play a fundamental role in Australia's workplace relations systems, whether they be registered organisations that represent employers or employees. They also represent their members before industrial tribunals and courts and work with governments on policy matters ranging from employment issues to economic and social policy. They are incredibly important, but they are not corporations—they are elected in many cases, and appointed in some others. People in various positions are not remunerated in the same way that corporations are, and they are often volunteers, as well. They are not corporations, and to impose penalties that are higher than those for for-profit organisations is quite extraordinary, and we cannot support that.


We do support appropriate regulation for registered organisations, including properly empowered regulators and consequences for those who do not follow the rules. This side of the House is committed to ensuring financial accountability by unions and employer organisations, and that is why in 2012 we toughened the laws to improve financial transparency and disclosure by registered organisations to their members. That original law was enacted by Tony Abbott, but we strengthened that in 2012. The regulation of trade unions in Australia has never been stronger than it is now, and accountability has never been higher. The powers of the Fair Work Commission to investigate and prosecute for breaches have never been broader than they already are, and while in government we tripled penalties, which means they have never been tougher. Much of the work that the government is now trying to do was already done in 2012, and resulted in the comprehensive pursuit of wrongdoers in the HSU case and in serious criminal penalties.


The minister consistently uses the HSU matters, having often inappropriately commented on matters before the judiciary, to justify the government's changes. But they are ignoring the fact that the Registered Organisations Act already prohibits members' money from being used to favour particular candidates in internal elections or campaigns. The Registered Organisations Act already allows for criminal proceedings to be initiated where funds are stolen or obtained by fraud. It already ensures that the Fair Work Commission can share information with police as appropriate, as we saw in the HSU case, and it already provides for statutory civil penalties where a party knowingly or recklessly contravenes an order or direction made by the federal court or the Fair Work Commission under the Registered Organisations Act or the Fair Work Act.


When unions and industry representatives agree with each other that something is not a good idea, then perhaps a government should listen. Usually in government one side or the other will support you and the other will not, but in this case both sides of the argument believe that this is a bad deal. The new criminal provisions, if enacted, mean that registered organisations, employer unions and bodies are likely to have difficulty in persuading people often in a voluntary capacity, to take on official responsibilities. The AI Group states:


If the proposed criminal penalties and proposed massive financial penalties for breaches of duties are included in the RO Act, this would operate as a major disincentive to existing voluntary officers of registered organisations continuing in their roles, and would deter other people from holding office.


These are genuine concerns expressed by both unions and industry representatives, and these concerns have not been addressed by the government, in spite of the amendments that were made in this most recent version of the bill. Unions have also raised quite legitimate concerns about the impacts of the proposed laws. Usually when you have industry bodies and unions lining up together on a unity ticket against a government proposition, the government may be well served to realise that something is very wrong. That is certainly the case here.


Of all the concerns with this bill, the biggest concern is that the penalties the government seeks to impose on officers of registered organisations quite substantially exceed those that are imposed through the Corporations Act, and again, the arguments the government makes is that they are trying to make those penalties even—this bill does not do that. It fails in that, and we will not be supporting it.

"Jensen, Dennis, MP",LP,2014-07-14,"



Dr JENSEN
 (Tangney) (18:44):  The Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Amendment Bill 2014 seeks to address the foolish and bungled amendments that Labor passed in 2012, led by none other than the current Leader of the Opposition. The issues in this bill are core to the promises we gave at the last election, and we intend to deliver on our promise to help the Australian people and the economy. This bill seeks to cut the large amount of unnecessary red tape, especially relating to the unjustifiable power and position that unions can impose on the workplace. It seeks to minimise the huge amount of inefficiency that unions bring to business, whilst ensuring and entitling that the rights and integrity of workers are preserved. These amendments hope to engage unions and the workplace in fairer dealing. It essentially puts the 'fair' back into 'fair work'. 


The current policy imposes a large amount of red tape and gives inexcusable powers to unions to frustrate and inconvenience businesses in their day-to-day operations. These common sense amendments will aid businesses; however, at the same time, they will limit but not cease union powers. Unions do have their place in society, but let us make some distinction here with how businesses and the economy take the centre role. It is Australian businesses and the economy, not unions, which line the pockets of workers. It is Australian businesses and the economy, not unions, that put bread on the table. And it is Australian businesses and the economy, not unions, that bring prosperity to the Australian people.


These amendments address the disgraceful extent to which unions are impinging on Australian businesses. For example, BHP recorded 676 right-of-entry visits to the Worsley alumina plant in 2010 alone. These visits require employers to set aside time and resources to attend to entry requests, and they must also allocate resources to escorting permit holders on the premises. The current legislation allows union representatives to enter the workplace and to enter into discussions with employees, even though the workplace may have no members of the union in question.


These amendments follow on from the Fair Work Act Review Panel's recommendations, which the previous government failed to implement during their term. The review set out some common sense, practical recommendations, which are reflected in these amendments. The Leader of the Opposition, who was then the responsible minister, pushed through rushed reforms, without understanding or anticipating how his solutions would be worked. Labor rushed them through, without thinking how they would affect other parts of Australia's society; instead, they were just thinking about how to appease their union mates. Unions, under Labor's misguided modifications, advance the notion that unions can enter into a workplace, even though no employee has sought their presence. So, if the unions are claiming to represent the workers, why are they entering into workplaces without the permission of those workers they claim to represent? This is a fantastic demonstration of how Labor failed to take a macro perspective on the Fair Work Act, just as it has done with so many other areas of policy.


The fair work amendments rebalance the powers of unions with the efficiency of businesses. This policy ought to have the support of both sides of the House, because this amendment aims to put the 'fair' back into 'fair work'. It aims to rebalance the personal liberties of Australian workers, whilst supporting the prosperity of Australian businesses and thus the prosperity of Australia's economy. It aims to rebalance the fairness of the act and to cut red tape which intrudes unnecessarily on Australian commercial interests, whilst ensuring transparency, accountability and responsibility of those commercial interests. This policy reflects the coalition's central philosophies of ensuring and instilling personal liberty and choice to the Australia people. It releases the shackles that the unions have imposed upon Australia, whilst allowing them, the unions, to fulfil a role in society that does not dominate or damage the liberty of Australian workers or does not dominate or damage the Australian economy.


It is false to assume that workers' rights cannot hang in harmony with that of economic prosperity. These two fundamental parts of a workplace should not, and will not, be at odds with these amendments. Industrial action hurts employers, employees, customers and families. It is the aim of these amendments to settle industrial disputes in a peaceful manner that prevents undue action, without an extensive bargaining stage. Labor's loophole in the current bill allows unions to 'strike first, talk later'. This must be stopped! The loophole must be closed and unions need to know that negotiation is the first step in settling an industrial dispute. Ironically, Labor's promise from 2007 will actually be legislated.


The only reason why these recommendations were not legislated during the terms of previous Labor governments is that they just could not get their act together. These amendments are fair and balanced. The government is now introducing policy which will make sure that, if an employee of the Commonwealth is for some apparent reason owed money by the Commonwealth, that employee will retain the value of that money by introducing interest payments. These interest payments will retain the value of the money owed, with the payment being calculated in line with the consumer price index. 


The amendments will also address the growing need in Australian workplaces for flexibility. The bill at inception has seen the need for flexibility. However, just like many other policy areas, Labor identified but failed to address this very important area of Australia's modern workplace. This government is determined not to impose decisions about industrial action on the people of Australia. Rather, we will enforce the power of choice to the Australian people. We, on this side of the House, give the choice to Australia and Australians. We, on this side of the House, give prosperity to Australia and all Australians. We on this side of the House give liberty.


The amendments to the Fair Work Act not only give fairness to workers and business but are a sign that Australia is prepared and well equipped to handle future problems. They are a sign to investors that Australia is open for business. They give business and investors confidence through knowing that Australia is mature in handling industrial disputes. Investment in Australia will ensure the future success of all Australian business and thus the prosperity of workers and the prosperity of all Australians.


I am speaking today on the Fair Work amendment bill, because I want to bring the issue of fairness to the Fair Work debate. I note that the Labor party has an undying adherence to the mantra of fairness. In particular, Labor fancies philosophers such as the American John Rawls to justify their attempts at redistributive fairness. How ironic is it that Fair Work as Labor knows it, sees it and wants it is so unfair. Fairness by definition and practice is entwined with personal liberty. No matter whether it is a positive or negative view of personal liberty or is the freedom from or freedom to, fairness and liberty are related. How unfair is it then that unions can so entrust themselves in the Australian workplace in their own every inefficient way? How unfair is it then that unions take from the productive to line the pockets of the unproductive? How unfair is it then that Labor used legislation when it was in government to try to protect the position of the unions? Labor knew that the concept, need and purpose of the unions was dead. Membership is going in one direction only, to the grave. It is going to zero. The union movement in my experience has been a parasitic beast tormenting small and medium businesses in the electorate of Tangney. I need not remind members opposite of the names of disgraced ex-union officials. Names like Jackson and Thompson ring around the homes of this nation, as unwanted as the names Ben and Jerry are wanted.


This debate and this government are all about productivity and adding value. This debate should be about protecting those who add value, not those who only take and, most insidiously, are on the take. Do not just take my word for it. Former AWU National Secretary Paul Howes said in 2013, in relation to union dishonesty and corruption, 'If we ignore any pocket of dishonesty it will grow like a cancer'. This legislation and these amendments have the strong support of those members of the union movement who share the same discouragement, disillusionment and disappointment.


Let me educate the good members who oppose what we are doing. We are acting because we said we would. We are keeping our promises, something Labor will never understand. Our plan, the fully costed policy document we took to the last election, spelt out clearly how we felt about unions. It also spelt out how we were going to make unions work for workers again, not for unions. We promised the Australian public 'better transparency and accountability of registered organisations'. It is the coalition's belief that Australians joining trade unions deserve to have confidence in the conduct and administration of these organisations. Let me say also that this debate takes place in the context of the ongoing inquiry by the royal commission into union corruption. Unions and corruption seem to go together like bread and butter—Wilson, Blewitt, Gillard. The Liberal Party has been the law and order party ever since the days of Menzies. How could I not support this bill? How could I not be happy about this bill, as it increases the penalties for breaches of current civil penalty provisions and even criminal penalties in  some cases.


In sum, being light on union heavies is no longer possible. The economy and our global competitiveness position demand that we get more innovative and more competitive. Our future prosperity demands that we get the heavy hand of union mobs off the economic tillers. If we do not act now then, due to union greed and myopia, Australia will become what Singapore's former and first Prime Minister, Lee Kuan Yew, predicted: 'The poor white trash of Asia'.

"Hall, Jill, MP",ALP,2014-07-14,"



Ms HALL
 (Shortland—Opposition Whip) (18:57):  I find the previous speaker's contribution to this debate on the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Amendment Bill 2014really incredible. He finished by saying that the government is keeping its promises. Each and every day in this House we hear how the government is breaking its promises. Before the last election it promised that there would be no cuts to health and education. Over $80 billion has been taken out of health and education. It promised that pensioners would not have their pensions cut. Legislation that will lead to a direct reduction in the rates of pensions has passed through this House. It promised that there would be no cuts to the ABC. There have been cuts to the ABC. So for the member for Tangney to stand up in this place and say, 'This government is keeping its promises,' shows just how much we can trust members on the other side of this House.


The member for Tangney spent a lot of time talking about individual liberty, about the right of people to make decisions of their own—basically, about how it was liberating for people to be able to do as they wish. He talked ad nauseam about personal liberty and at the same time was very critical of any form of what I would call mutual obligation. According to him, the power of choice is tantamount to everything; it is about an individuals right, about liberty. The member for Tangney would be quite happy to see the liberty of one group transcend the rights of another group. He is very much of the view that unions should have a zero membership—and those words passed through his mouth when he was speaking of this. He referred to unions as 'heavy-handed'. He referred to 'a mature handling of industrial relations'—I think a mature handling of industrial relations as far as the member for Tangney is concerned would be to have an industrial relations system where there were no unions whatsoever.


When I was sitting down preparing this speech, I really struggled to understand this government's approach to unions and to workers. I feel that it has adopted a position where it will not rest until unions do not exist. To hear the member for Tangney's contribution, I really believe that that is the situation. There is an ideological hatred of unions, and I ask: why? The member for Tangney pointed out that he wanted to bring fairness to the debate. Well, I think unions bring fairness to the equation. Any study of history will show that unions have actually brought fairness to the equation—unions provide protection for workers, just as employer groups provide a voice for employers. I will put on the record now that I appreciate what employers do in our community. I went to a small business awards ceremony in my electorate on Saturday night, and I was so proud of each and every one of those small-business people who were there and of the enormous contributions that they have made to my local area—just as I am really proud of the way unions stand up for workers, the way unions move to create some fairness in the equation, and the way unions protect workers. There is an imbalance of power, if you have a very strong employer group and a very weak union group. The idea is to have a balance.


When I hear members like the member for Tangney putting forward their extreme, right-wing, harsh, uncaring, unbalanced contributions to this debate, I can see why this legislation is before us in the House. I do not think that all members on the other side of this House could possibly share the extreme views that were expressed a moment ago. I do not see how people could accept a situation where personal liberty—the right to choose whatever you wish to do, over anything else—is paramount. I am sure there are members on the other side of the House who can see that there is a strong role for unions, just as there is for employers—because workers deserve protection. It is about balance and it is about fairness.


I look at this legislation before us today, the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Amendment Bill 2014, and I ask, how is it fair to impose on unions requirements and penalties that are more onerous than those in the Corporations Act? And for once, we have a unity ticket here between employer groups and union groups—both of those groups believe this legislation is flawed. The government is reintroducing legislation that came before this House in November. We did not support it then, and we certainly won't be supporting it this time. Even with the proposed amendments, employer and employee organisations still have significant concerns about the bill. As I said, employers and unions are on a unity ticket. Even with the proposed amendments, the penalties in this bill still exceed the penalties in the Corporations Act 2001. The government promised to regulate registered organisations in the same way as corporations—well, it certainly is not doing that in this legislation. If this bill is passed, the legislation implemented will place much harsher requirements on registered organisations. This is just another broken promise, by a government that comes in each day and breaks promises. The Australian people know that. And the Australian people are very suspicious about this kind of legislation. They know that those on the other side of this House—the large majority of them—have an ideological hatred of unions. The Australian people know that those opposite would like a situation where there were no unions; where workers were at the mercy of employers. But to have a good industrial relations system, you need balance; you need a system where you have strong employers and strong employee organisations—strong unions.


Now a bit of history: this bill has come through the Senate. The committee tabled its report in December 2013, and on 27 March this year the Senate committee's report was actually tabled. That report did not support the legislation, and in March the amendments recommended by the Senate legislative committee were put in the Senate, and the bill was negated.


As I have already mentioned, the bill also modifies disclosure requirements, making them more onerous. It includes higher penalties for civil contraventions, and it introduces criminal offences, in respect of officers' duties, which are modelled on, but also exceed, those found in the Corporations Act.


Registered organisations—and this is where we come from—play a fundamental role in the Australian workplace relations system. The organisations are created and registered for the purpose of representing Australian employers and employees, giving them a voice—that is what it is about. Unfortunately, this bill seeks to take that voice away from them. Registered organisations represent members before industrial relations tribunals and courts. On a regular basis I have people come to my office who need that sort of assistance and are in a position where, even if they seek to exercise their individual rights and freedom, they do not have the ability or the knowledge to be able to do that without the assistance of their unions. Therein lies the answer to the question. Many of those on the other side do not believe that the people who find themselves in that situation should have a voice.


While we have problems with this legislation, we have absolutely no tolerance for corruption by union officials or officers in employer bodies, just as we have no sympathy for any corruption within corporations. We support tough penalties for breaking the law. I would argue that those tough penalties are already available. We support appropriate regulation for registered organisations, including a properly empowered regulator. The Leader of the Opposition, when he was minister, toughened the laws to include financial transparency and disclosure by registered organisations. As a result, the regulations for trade unions in Australia have never been stronger. Listening to those on the other side of this House, you would think that the regulations are weak and that the country is controlled by trade unions. Australia has one of the lowest levels of industrial disputes in the world. Accountability has never been higher. The power of the Fair Work Commission to investigate and prosecute for breaches has never been broader. We tripled the penalties, which means that they have never been tougher. But this government thinks that—even given those facts—the regulations should be tougher. The government wants to take away all power from the trade unions. It wants to create a situation where workers have no voice or ability to protect themselves. The Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act 2009 already prohibits members' money being used to favour particular candidates in internal elections. It already allows for criminal proceedings to be initiated. It already ensures that the Fair Work Commission shares information with police. The Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act already provides statutory civil penalties.


Under the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act, registered organisations have a fiduciary duty akin to directors of corporations. It requires them to disclose their personal interests. A friend of mine told me about the level of disclosure he has to make in relation to his own personal interests—which includes disclosing payments made to relative parties and exercising care and diligence.


It is a really unusual situation when you have industry bodies and unions lining up on a unity ticket against the proposition. There is something very wrong with legislation that creates that situation. The opposition sought to engage with the government to ensure that the penalties did not exceed those in the Corporations Act, but the government was not willing. There are a number of issues, not the least of which is that this bill does not cover and regulate a range of entities and bodies, which are those that have been seen in New South Wales—bodies that have come before ICAC and that have put the honesty and integrity of organisations in that state into question.


This is flawed legislation. This is legislation that should not be passed. It is ill conceived and is another example of this government's broken promises saying one thing before the election and doing another thing after the election.

"Buchholz, Scott, MP",LP,2014-07-14,"



Mr BUCHHOLZ
 (Wright—Government Whip) (19:12):  It is a pleasure to be able to stand in this House once again speaking to the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Amendment Bill 2014.


I remind the House that in the last parliament I put forward a private member's motion to bring into line some of the concerns that were raised by the previous speaker—that is, making unions accountable under the Corporations Act, and the penalties that would apply the same as those that already exist under the Corporations Act. It will not surprise those in this House that that private member's motion was not successful, because those on the other side of this House mostly owe their seats, their position in this parliament, either through direct or indirect funding, to a union movement. At the last election, the front bench of the previous government—I think it was 10 out of 12 of them—had some direct linkage to union movements.


The previous speaker also talked about how on this side of government we have a hatred for unions. That is just farcical. My operations in the transport sector work very closely with unions. I have found that the union reps that I deal with are always accommodating, because I put forward a logical, succinct argument about why some of the decisions I made would be for the greater benefit of my employees. So to come into this place and say that this side of that House has a hatred for unions is predominantly flawed.


The amendments to the Fair Work Act 2009 contained in this bill are important items of the coalition's Fair Work policy that we took to the election. We did not say one thing before the election and another after, which has been the mantra of those opposite as they have come into the chamber to debate this. That has been the thread or flavour of their debate. They have been making that claim. Nothing could be further from the truth. We are actually doing what we said we were going to do before the election, and we are doing it consistent with an eminent panel.


In particular, this bill responds to a number of outstanding recommendations included in the Towards more productive and equitable workplaces: an evaluation of the Fair Work legislation review conducted in June 2012 when it was commissioned by the now Leader of the Opposition. The very capable review panel of eminent Australians—comprising of the Reserve Bank board member John Edwards, the former Federal Court judge Hon. Michael Moore and the noted legal and workplace relations academic Professor Ron McCallum AO—were asked to provide recommendations on areas where the operation of the act could be improved. They provided 53 proposals to tackle a range of issues and inspired many of the amendments contained in this bill. Do those on the other side of the chamber suggest that those eminent gentlemen who I just mentioned are also union haters? That is not the truth. It is unfair to come in and cast those aspersions in this House.


An interesting conclusion drawn from the review relates to the economic aspects of the Fair Work Act. The panel determined that since the Fair Work Act came into force important outcomes such as wages growth, industrial disputes, the responsiveness of wages to supply and demand, the rate of employment growth and the flexibility of work patterns have been favourable to Australia's continuing prosperity.


The exception has been productivity growth. That is what is missing. As a government—



Ms Butler interjecting—




Mr BUCHHOLZ:
  I sat here for the last three speakers and heard your speakers in silence, so do not come in here with your union intimidatory tactics and yell and shout. Just sit. The expectation has been for productivity growth. It has been disappointing in the Fair Work Act framework and in the two preceding frameworks over the last decade. It is this which has motivated the coalition's amendments. If you were not yapping, you would have just heard that. It is this which has motivated the coalition's amendments to the Fair Work Act. The coalition is dedicated to making Australia a more prosperous nation in which productivity growth plays an instrumental role. In order to achieve productivity growth, several of the amendments contain in this bill seek to eradicate loopholes, negatively geared systemic problems and prohibiting factors preventing Australian employers and employees from getting on with the job of growing their Australian economic pie.


One of the proposed amendments which the coalition has adopted from the Fair Work panel review relates to offering additional support to new greenfield industrial agreements. When reading it, I was quite surprised that the Fair Work Act review recommended:


greenfields agreement provisions be made consistent with the general enterprise bargaining stream by applying suitably modified good faith bargaining rules to negotiations for proposed agreements. Given the national significance of some greenfields projects and the need for assurance in project design and investment, the Panel also recommends a form of arbitration be available if the parties are unable to reach agreement within a suitable time frame


Under Labor, the Fair Work laws effectively gave unions the power to veto new projects by requiring an employer to always negotiate a greenfield agreement with a union. To date, unions have exploited this veto power by deliberately causing delays and setbacks, while others have used it as a tool to demand exorbitant conditions. In addition, these irresponsible actions are responsible for the perceived doubt surrounding many important new projects which have failed to receive adequate investment as a result. The coalition wants to ensure that enterprise agreements for greenfield agreements can be negotiated quickly to ensure that infrastructure projects are not delayed and to encourage investment for everyone's benefit.


This bill also addresses the imbalance in union workplace access rules currently impeding the productivity of many workplaces. The Fair Work panel review expressed the need for changes to the right-of-entry provisions to unions as a means of encouraging productivity and fairness in our work environments. I have a real-life example on entry provisions. I took the opportunity to reach out to one of the processors where a number of people in my electorate are employed. It is in a neighbouring electorate. They turn over around $365 million, with a workforce of around 1,800. In spite of the employees voting in favour of working under a new EBA to secure the future of the plant and 1,000 jobs, the union has continued to run legal action through Fair Work Australia and now the Federal Court because it has lost its privileges. The union has lost privileges that do not matter to the workforce. The workforce said in this particular case that they were quite happy with the EBA. But the union has still taken the company to court. This has been ongoing for 10 months, causing great uncertainty and threatening the viability of the business. The union has already delayed the first wage increase of three per cent for employees. Fancy that—a union delaying an increase in employees' entitlements! It has extended the life of the new EBA by six months. If the union is successful, 70 per cent of the employees will suffer a wage decrease, which means they will come off the three per cent that they have agreed to in the workplace to receive a lesser amount. Groundbreaking, profit-sharing bonuses will be at risk—$3,000 to $5,000 per employee. It is about sharing the profits and sharing the productivity gains with the employees. The union would not have anything to do with that.


The new EBA is classic win-win: improved productivity, wage increases and profit share. The IR system has allowed this farcical situation to occur and flourish. In their email to me, this business went on to say that these government's amendments are only the start of much-needed reform if we are going to have any chance of running successful manufacturing and processing in this country. 


Furthermore, the unlawful practices and inappropriate behaviour conducted by unions are well documented. For example, the Royal Commission into the Building and Construction Industry of 2001 identified no fewer than 392 separate instances of unlawful conduct—




Ms Butler:
  There were no charges.




Mr BUCHHOLZ:
  25 different types of unlawfulness and 90 different types of inappropriate behaviour, as well as referring 31 individuals who had possibly breached criminal laws. I take the interjection from the member opposite. The royal commission was back in 2001. I state for the record that the member indicated that there were no charges.


The changes included in this bill fairly and sensibly balance the right of employees to be represented in the workplace if they wish to be with the right of employers to go about their business without unnecessary disruption. There is clear evidence of union representatives abusing their right of entry, with excessive workplace visits recorded at a number of sites. For example, the Pluto LNG project received over 200 right-of-entry visits in a period of only three months. BHP Billiton's Worsley alumina plant faced 676 right-of-entry visits in a single year. There is no doubt that this sort of blatant interference on a work site by union representatives is hindering workers' ability to just get on with their jobs. There is no doubting the motivations behind such excessive visitation and access. Unions are fighting for representation of members and they are targeting workers in the workplace as a means of getting them signed up.


 Given the union movement has a long reputation of intimidation in the workplace—people who do not wish to become members, employers and each other—I think it is fair to recommend that this sort of behaviour is not acceptable. Intimidatory tactics in the workplace to force people to sign up are not acceptable. We heard those opposite say that corruption is not acceptable. I take it one step further: intimidation in the workplace should never be seen as an acceptable workplace practice by the union movement. 


Importantly, we will repeal the amendments which make the meal room or break room at the premises the default location for discussions between unions and workers and which require employers to provide transport and accommodation for unions seeking to access remote worksites. We will restore the arrangements that were in place previously, including that union officials must comply with any reasonable request by the employer to hold discussions in a particular location. Our changes will also mean that occupiers at remote work sites do not have to facilitate accommodation and transport for union officials to visit their workplace, reducing unnecessary and costly regulation for affected employers.


 To be clear, these amendments will enact Labor's publicly stated position prior to the 2007 election—a promise that was not honoured. Given that the Labor Party in opposition, with the strong support of the union movement, supported this 2007 policy platform, we expect that these amendments will not be contentious and will go through. However, in the vein of what speakers before me have said, I would suggest that we may be going to a vote on this. 


An additional aspect of this bill amends a significant loophole in the current system of strike first, talk later, which is costing our economy millions. The ABS reports that the number of work days lost as a result of industrial action is at an eight-year high. The member for Shortland mentioned that the union movement's strikes in this country are low when compared with those globally. I suggest that when 293,100 days are being lost annually, that is not a figure to crow about.


Under the existing Fair Work Act industrial action is able to commence before any bargaining has commenced. This has resulted in more frequent strikes occurring and on a larger scale. We are seeking to remove this loophole in the interests of small business and the economy. The bill will amend the Fair Work Act to provide that protected industrial action can only be taken if bargaining for a proposed agreement has commenced. This means that costly and productivity-hindering industrial action cannot be the first step in the bargaining process, which will restore order and balance to the enterprise bargaining approach. So that is not a bad amendment to have.


In conclusion, I would like to commend this bill to the House. It cements the coalition government's commitment to help make Australian workplaces even better, by improving the Fair Work laws to provide a stable, fair and prosperous future. We on this side of the House do not hate unions. I have worked closely with them and I will continue to work closely with them. If those on the other side want some advice, they should ask themselves: why has union membership in Australia fallen dramatically over the past 30 years? These amendments are not going to affect future union membership. If you want to build a successful union, if you want a union that members can find value in, support this bill and these amendments. Make the same conditions apply to the union movement that apply under the Corporations Act.

"Butler, Terri, MP",ALP,2014-07-14,"



Ms BUTLER
 (Griffith) (19:28):  I rise to oppose the government's Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Amendment Bill 2014 and the circulated amendments. This bill ignores all advice from stakeholders and represents yet more broken promises from this government.


This bill will establish the Registered Organisations Commission, the ROC, and amends the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act. The ROC will be headed by a Registered Organisations Commissioner, with greater investigative powers than those available to the General Manager of the Fair Work Commission. The bill also modifies disclosure requirements, includes higher penalties for civil contraventions and introduces criminal offences in respect of officers' duties, which are modelled on, but also in some cases exceed, those found in the Corporations Act 2001.


We all know that the reason we are debating this bill tonight is that, as we have seen in recent weeks, this government would like to talk about anything but its toxic budget. It is a budget that takes money out of the pockets of the very people who trusted this Prime Minister before the election. As is the hallmark of this government, this bill represents yet another broken promise from a Prime Minister and a government that are watching their trust and support slip away like sand between their fingers. It is hardly surprising that when a Liberal-National government is in trouble, they run towards what they know best, which is attacking workers and attacking representative organisations. This bill is about registered organisations, which are employer and employee organisations registered under the Fair Work regime 


They play an important role in Australia's workplace relations system. They are registered organisations that this bill seeks to further regulate.


I listened to the previous speaker, the member for Wright, with interest, and I wish to offer to him in good faith a conversation about the effect of the Fair Work laws, because, as he might have noticed, there were quite a few things that he mentioned in his speech with which I disagree. One of them is this idea about greenfields agreements. The previous speaker said that somehow it was a problem that greenfields agreements were to be negotiated with unions. But I ask: who else would a greenfields agreement be negotiated with? The definition of the greenfields agreement is that there are no employees with whom to negotiate. If the employer is not negotiating with the future employee's representative organisation, then with whom would they negotiate? Would we really want to go back to Work Choices? That is the alternative. The alternative is to go back to the Work Choices regime for greenfields agreements.


Let us think about that Work Choices regime for a second. An employer could make a greenfields agreement called an employer greenfields agreement. Who were the parties to that employer greenfields agreement? They were the employer and itself. In other words, the employer called a meeting with itself. It went into a room and said: 'Hello, employer. I'd like to give them no wage increase in the next three years. How do you feel about that?' 'Well, employer, that seems pretty fair to me. Let's shake on it.' That is ridiculous. That is why greenfields agreements need to be negotiated with representative organisations that are acting in the interests of the future employees, because, frankly, there is nothing more than a glaring conflict of interest when an employer negotiates with itself, as occurred under the WorkChoices regime of the federal government under Mr Howard. That is the sort of thing the previous speaker was talking about: going back to that Work Choices regime, where there were no protections for future employees of greenfields projects.


But coming back to this bill, let us talk about registered organisations. The previous person who spoke to this bill was at pains to say that the coalition is not against unions. Well, I beg to differ. The trade unions royal commission that we see at the moment is an exercise in de-legitimising the union movement. That is what it is an attempt to do. It is to make the union movement seem like it is not legitimate. And why? We have seen things like the HSU scandal, a scandal in which the HSU was the victim of white-collar crime from unscrupulous, unethical persons who committed crimes against that union and its membership. But that does not mean that we should accept that unions in and of themselves are illegitimate, and unfortunately that is what this bill is aimed at giving the impression of. When we talk about registered organisations we are talking about employer organisations like the Australian Industry Group, like the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, and about trade unions, like the CFMEU and other unions we have heard spoken about. These are organisations that are registered under the Fair Work legislation with an obligation to represent their members, both in the workplace and before industrial tribunals and courts. And they play a broader role. Unions and employer associations are part of a civil society, they are part of the fabric of Australian democracy, and they provide support to people individually but they also contribute to the sort of society that we want to live in.


If you want to know about the importance of unions in this country and in democracies, you might want to consider the case of CFMEU v North Goonyella Coal Mine Pty Ltd [2013 FCA 1444]. It is a case very close to my heart, because my former colleagues at Maurice Blackburn—Emma Thornton and Kelly Thomas—did such a great job working in that case, where an employer was being pursued for its contraventions of the Fair Work Act for adverse action against members of unions. It was a really important decision, and it was one in which His Honour Justice Logan spoke at length about the importance of unions in our democracy. He said that the case:


… provides a very useful occasion to recall why in our country, for so many years, trade unions have been regarded as lawful and why it is that those who take what is called these days adverse action against persons because of trade union activity are amenable to penalty.


To understand that, one has to go back almost 200 years to a case which was passed into history as the Tolpuddle Martyrs' Case, but which is known in the law reports as R v Lovelass and Others (1834) 172 ER 1380. That case was decided in England against the background of a group of farm workers … who wished to form a union to prevent reduction of their wages. … The farm workers concerned met in the home of a Thomas Standfield. They there took an oath to combine together and to seek to prevent the reduction of their wages. They formed what was known as the Friendly Society of Agricultural Labourers. They were prosecuted under an Act, the Unlawful Oaths Act 1797 (UK). That Act had been passed by the British parliament in response to a threat of mutinies following the French Revolution. It made it illegal to make an oath and an offence to not reveal the oath in particular contexts. The workers concerned were convicted and sentenced to transportation to Australia. Such was the outpouring of popular outrage in respect of that prosecution and its sequel that the British government decided to return the workers concerned from Australia. Some later migrated to Canada. One remained here.


It is that case which is generally regarded as providing the inception of a movement which gradually throughout the 19th century led to the recognition by the British parliament and then by colonial parliaments here of trade unions as lawful organisations. The history of the progression from the Tolpuddle Martyrs' Case, through the 19th Century, to the recognition under the Trade Union Act 1871 (UK) and the Trade Disputes Act 1906 (UK), which have Australian equivalents, is set out, notably, in a work by Sidney Webb (later Baron Passfield) and his wife, Martha Beatrice Webb, The History of Trade Unionism (Revised Edition, 1920).


In Australia, drawing on that heritage, ever since we have had a federal industrial relations statute, trade unions have been recognised expressly by our parliament upon registration as lawful organisations, having a recognised representational role in our industrial relations system. The history of the provisions proscribing adverse action in the Fair Work Act is as long as federal industrial regulation in Australia.


The case that His Honour was dealing with involved an employer taking adverse action against people for their union involvement. His Honour said:


The long and the short of it is that this case displays a blatant, deliberate, concerted and fulfilled endeavour on the part of an employer to subvert a deeply rooted feature—


and this is the important part for our purposes today—


not just of our industrial relations system, but of our democracy itself.


He was there talking about trade unions and their importance to our democracy, and he said:


I cannot overemphasise the seriousness of the conduct concerned. It is no new subject that trade unions are regarded as lawful and that those who seek to take adverse actions against person on the basis of trade union activity are subject to penalty.


Equally as important for the purposes of our consideration of this bill tonight, His Honour went on to say:


Of course, with the benefit of recognition as lawful organisations comes great responsibility for trade unions and those who hold office in trade unions. Over time, a number of commissions of inquiry, State and Federal, have exposed practices where the privilege of recognition of trade unions has been abused, or where those who hold office within unions have abused a privileged position.


With the greatest of respect to His Honour, I most humbly agree with him. It is very important that the seriousness of the role of the representation of working people be conducted absolutely without any corruption and without any unlawful behaviour. It is a role of great trust and great responsibility. Labor knows that and that is why we have no tolerance for corruption by union officials or officers of employer bodies, who equally share that sacred obligation as a representative and as a person to whom their membership look to represent their best interests.


The Labor Party has always supported tough penalties for those that break the law. We have always supported appropriate regulation for registered organisations, unions and employer associations, including a properly empowered regulator and consequences for those who break the rules. That is because we know better than anyone how important that position of trust is, not just to the individual members and to the members as a whole, but to our democracy and our society. It is fundamental to our democracy and society that we have a union movement that is held in high esteem. That is why we have always been committed to ensuring financial accountability by unions and employer organisations. So much so that the now Leader of the Opposition, Bill Shorten, as a minister, strengthened the laws around transparency and disclosure by registered organisations to their members.


Yet here we have those opposite standing here to talk about unions in a negative way, just like their counterparts in my home state of Queensland. That is where we saw anti-union legislation. Wasn't that a success! It was such a success that the Queensland LNP had to rush into the parliament to repeal their own transparency laws, because they knew that they were not going to survive an upcoming High Court challenge. Those rushed through anti-union laws did not survive and were so poorly written and so poorly put together. The facts though, from Labor's perspective, speak for themselves.


As a result of Bill Shorten's work, the regulation of trade unions in Australia has never been stronger, accountability has never been greater, the powers of the Fair Work Commission to investigate and prosecute for breaches have never been broader and penalties for breaches have never been tougher. Labor tripled the penalties when we were in government. Yet we now hear those opposite coming in here to try to manufacture a basis to justify their changes. They refer to things like the HSU, which, as I have said, was a victim of white collar crime but unscrupulous officials.


Let us have a look at the Registered Organisations Act as it now stands. Does the act prohibit members' money from being used to favour particular candidates in internal elections or campaigns? Yes, as it has been a longstanding principle of industrial law in this country that members' money cannot be spent on electing particular candidates in union election campaigns.




Mr Ciobo:
  Someone should have told Craig Thomson.




Ms BUTLER:
  I will take the interjection. Craig Thomson has just been raised. As we know, he broke the law and he should suffer the full consequences of a breach of the law. But the fact is that the union was the victim of that crime. Just as if a director of a company defrauds that company, that does not make that company illegitimate; so if an official of a union defrauds a union, that is not a basis to claim that unions are illegitimate. Does the act allow for criminal proceedings to be initiated where funds are stolen or are obtained by fraud? Yes, it does. Does the act already ensure that the Fair Work Commission can share information with the police as appropriate? Yes, it does. The Registered Organisations Act already provides for statutory civil penalties where a party knowingly or recklessly contravenes an order or direction made by the Federal Court or the Fair Work Commission under the Registered Organisations Act or the Fair Work Act.


Officers of registered organisations already have fiduciary duties akin to those for directors under the Corporations Law and there are corresponding statutory obligations. The Registered Organisations Act already requires officers to disclose their personal interests, already requires officers to disclose when payments are made to related parties and already requires officers to exercise care and diligence, act with good faith and not improperly use their position for advantage. Given all of this, we cannot help but question the motives of this government in introducing this bill.


Why is the government rushing to impose this new regime, which includes some penalties that exceed the Corporations Act? It is just yet another attack on unions, because they do not want to talk about their budget. They are looking for something—anything—to talk about other than their toxic budget, which is the budget that has been rejected so comprehensively by the Australian people and that breaches those pre-election commitments of no cuts to health, no cuts to education, no changes to the pension and no new taxes. What have we seen? We have seen the GP tax, the tax when you go and get an x-ray, the tax when you get a blood test, the deregulation of higher education, the cuts to education, the changes to the pension indexation that will leave pensioners worse off and the petrol tax. It is a litany of broken promises and twisted priorities. (Time expired)

"Chesters, Lisa, MP",ALP,2014-07-14,"



Ms CHESTERS
 (Bendigo) (19:43):  I also rise to speak in opposition to the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Amendment Bill 2014, for the second time in this term of parliament. Still the government has not done their homework on the bill before us. They have not improved their work at all. It is still a failure. It is still a poorly conceived bill that is badly motivated and entirely unnecessary, because this issue was dealt with by the 43rd parliament. Nobody is denying that if there is criminal behaviour and if it occurs in any organisation, then it should be dealt with properly by the Criminal Code Act.


That is exactly what we have seen happen, whether it be Craig Thomson or whether it be Geoff Shaw. If there is somebody who breaks the law, they will be dealt with appropriately. That is why this bill is not the right place for this. The Fair Work Act and this bill seek to impose penalties that are tougher than we have seen anywhere else in any part of our acts, including the Corporations Act.


Nobody is excusing the behaviour of one or two individuals, but, as we have said repeatedly, you cannot punish the entire institution of registered organisations for the actions of one or two individuals. If we were to adopt the government's logic, we would be punishing every MP in the Victorian parliament because of the actions of one, Jeff Shaw. But we have not seen that happen. All this bill seeks to do is to union bash—to bash up the natural foe of the conservatives, our trade union movement. Along their way, in their frantic push to bash the trade union movement, the government have caught up a few of their traditional supporters, their own organisations—the employer groups.


The burden of this extra regulation will fall not just on the full-time, salaried union officials that they seek to punish but also on the volunteers of the trade unions or registered organisations such as the Australian Industry Group. These groups have been quite vocal in their opposition to this bill, not once or twice but a number of times, whether it be to individual members of parliament or whether it be to Senate inquiries, but the government still ignores their words and their pleas. The government has wrongly claimed that these reforms will protect union members' interests and give greater democracy to union members. Again, it is just another attempt by a desperate government to distort the facts. This bill will achieve the exact opposite. It will impose tough and rigid regulations on the largely rank and file members who run our trade unions. The government seek to impose large fines on those rank and file members. 


I know those opposite struggle to understand what a trade union looks like. As an example, the executive, the council, of United Voice in the state of Victoria, like in every state, is made up of rank and file members. There are only a couple of people who are paid officials. Take, for example, Marie Angrilli, who works for Spotless as a part-time school cleaner. She gives up her spare time as a volunteer to be president of United Voice in Victoria. Why should she be treated any differently from the president of a school council, who is also a volunteer, or the president of a sporting club? That is exactly the distinction this bill tries to make. The government has wrongly labelled Marie, who is a volunteer rank and file member on the union executive, as one of the union bosses and union heavies, and seeks to impose on her, as well as on all the other members who are rank and file members elected to their trade union state councils or executives, very tough penalties. The other union I wish to mention is the rail division of the RTBU. Bob Bassett is a full-time conductor for V/Line—another hardworking person who this government seek to victimise, demonise, call a union boss and vilify in the way they are trying to do in this bill. The government suggest that these people are union bosses and union heavies, but nothing could be further from the truth. 


There are still two million people in Australia who are members of a trade union, making the trade union movement one of the largest community based rank and file organisations in this country. Yet this government is dead set scared of them. I can understand why. When working people are active, when they get together, when they organise around their working rights, when they stand up, when they have a voice, they become a broadbased movement that can speak directly against what this government is trying to do. It is no wonder that upon being elected one of the first things that this government did was try to tear down the union movement—because they, unlike the rest of Australia, knew about that horror budget, that shocker budget, that they were about to bring down. That budget did one thing, and that was to tear at our working people. It attacked their children, whether they be in school or trying to get a university education, and it attacked working people's parents, whether they be self-funded retirees or on a pension, or in an aged care facility, possibly victims of the government's latest cut to the dementia supplement. It is no wonder that the government has brought forward this bill to try and attack unions, to distract their members from the real battle that is going on outside of the workplace, whether it be in their homes, whether it be in their children's schools, whether it be with their parents and their pension. The government is no fan of working people. They are not the great saviours of the working people that they like to champion. Whether it be on this version of the debate or a previous version of the debate, speaker after speaker from the government side have claimed that they are the best friend of working people. 


As I have mentioned, it is not only trade unions that are opposed to this bill but also a number of employer organisations. I note the submission of the Australian Industry Group to the Senate Education and Employment Legislation Committee. When I was first elected I never thought I would be standing up in the parliament saying that I agreed with the Australian Industry Group on the matter of workplace relations. But here I am in this House doing that. It just shows how far to the right the government has gone when employer groups are saying that their proposal concerning part of the Fair Work Act is too radical and too draconian. Just as our union delegates come from the rank and file, the Australian Industry Group also have rank and file not delegates but councillors that run their incorporated organisations in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland—in fact, 85 people from their rank and file membership based organisations. 


Like many of our union delegates who work on state councils and state executives running their unions, these officers for the Australian Industry Group are volunteers. They give up their time without payment for their role. This bill seeks to make their job harder by imposing new regulations on volunteers who make sure their organisation is run properly. Yet, all it will do will is increase the amount of time, regulation and red tape for these volunteer based organisations. This means these organisations, like our trade union movement, would have less time to spend on their businesses, less time to spend on policy, and potentially some of them would have to give up their role as volunteers in a registered organisation. 


This is what the government seeks to do with this bill. It is an example of how poorly-conceived and rushed the government is in their desperate attempt to union bash and distract the community from their real agenda, which is to attack working people in every aspect of their lives. I quote from the Australian Industry Group's submission to the Senate inquiry on this bill. They state:


Unlawful conduct within one organisation must not be used as an excuse to impose unfair laws or an excessive compliance burden upon all registered organisations.


I also note that they cite the ILO's Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention, 1948. When you have the Australian Industry Group in a submission to an inquiry talking about protection of the freedom of association, you know the government is on the wrong path. They, like their workers, seek to organise—seek to have a collective voice. From time to time, bosses and workers do disagree, but nobody should deny their right to organise. Yet this government seeks to do that; it seeks to tear at that basic convention—that of freedom of association.


As I have said, this bill is poorly-conceived, badly-motivated and entirely unnecessary. It should be rejected in its entirety. It creates a large volume of new regulation without evidence that it is necessary. The work was already done in the former parliament. This bill also creates a new Commonwealth regulator, where one already exists. This is from a government that claims that it wants to get rid of red tape—yet, it is introducing more. This bill creates a large volume of new regulation that will not just increase the burden for registered trade unions, but it will also increase the burden on employer organisations. As I have said, it should be rejected in its entirety.


The problem with this debate is that, once again, it is centred around the rhetoric of union bashing. Why on earth does the government continue with its union bashing? Why does it seek to perpetuate this myth? Perhaps it is for their own purposes—they need an enemy. So let's create one from working people. Let's remind ourselves who unions are: they are men and women in a workplace who get together; they organise to have a say about their workplace rights. And they are very good at it; they have had a lot of influence. In some sectors they have organised well—they have good working conditions. Yet this government, we know, in other bills seeks to tear those down. We also know that in a number of new industries unions are still doing the hard work of ensuring that their members have good workplace conditions. The cleaners here in Parliament House and the cleaners who work for the government are some of the latest victims of this government's budget shocker. In their determination to cut costs, they have cut the wages of their own cleaners. I would like to cite a comment from an editorial in the Herald Sun, challenging the psychology of the government's IR minister: what sort of psyche does a man have if he cuts the wages by up to $5 an hour of the person who cleans his toilet? To me that statement says it all: if you cut the wages of your own cleaners—the people who clean your toilets—you are not a friend of hard-working people. It does not matter how many times you say in front of the mirror that you are the worker's friend, it is simply not true.


The government's actions when they were previously in government demonstrate that they are not the fans or supporters of working people. When the Prime Minister was the workplace relations minister, he showed very little regard for working people. He said that the Howard government's legacy would be WorkChoices; he said it was one of their proudest achievements. It is simply not true. WorkChoices, as we know, is not 'dead, buried and cremated', as the Prime Minister has continued to say. In fact, it could not be further from the truth. We have seen through their attempt to try to amend the IFA and their other bill on the Fair Work Act that they are seeking to bring it back. That is why they have to demonise the very organisations that stand up against them. Let us not forget what the government did when they changed unfair dismissal, when they went after penalty rates, when they attacked people's retirement income and when they made sure that working people would have less access to their union representatives. Let's be clear about this bill: it seeks to demonise unions and hard-working union officials. (Time expired)

"Jones, Stephen, MP",ALP,2014-07-14,"



Mr STEPHEN JONES
 (Throsby) (19:58):  This bill is about the regulation of unions, employer associations and their officers and officials. In common parlance, the word 'official' is taken to mean somebody who is elected or appointed to a full-time job within an organisation and who draws a salary for performing those functions. It belies the fact that the majority of officials, at least within unions, are volunteers who give up hundreds of hours of their time every year for a purpose and a cause that they believe in. For unions, the cause is the protection and the betterment of the wages and conditions of the people they represent—ordinary Australian workers. They help them balance the cost of living with their income and they help them get a fair go at work.


Any debate about workplace relations in this place is always conducted on many levels. As the contributors to this debate have demonstrated, it is as much about the political contest between the conservative parties and us, the Labor Party, as it is about the subject matter of the bill. We have heard numerous contributions from those on the other side of the House and from those on this side of the House which give testament to that. It has been that way since Federation. Governments have risen and fallen on the question of industrial relations. It is an unfortunate fact that the objects of the legislation, by which I mean those for whom it purports to regulate, are often swept aside.


I would like to say a few words about a mate of mine to correct the balance. My friend's name is Kerry Edsall. She was a government employee who started work in the Department of Social Security, as it then was, in one of the first call centres that that department established, in Geelong in 1993. She was a strong woman with a great work ethic who was as respected by the workers in her workplace and nationally as she was by her employers. She joined the union soon after becoming an employee of the Department of Social Security and became deputy delegate in her workplace soon after. She represented the department and Centrelink on the union's section council from 2001 and became the union secretary in 2003, a position that she then held for over 10 years—all on a voluntary basis. In 2013, in recognition of her many decades of service to the union, she was granted a life membership. 


She was a key CPSU leader in Centrelink and the Department of Human Services and represented members through many agreement negotiations and in other national and international forums. She was well respected by management, by government and by union representatives because of her deep knowledge of the work of the department, the needs of the clients of the department, the operation of the union and the needs of their members. As well as supporting and engaging members in her workplace, Kerry mentored many young workers, including workplace delegates and section councillors, across the country. She was a courageous leader and a courageous worker who genuinely lived up to the cliche that you have to walk the walk as well as talk the talk. She never dodged difficult discussions with members, with management or with anyone who needed to hear the truth. She was a person who was very comfortable speaking truth to power. 


Kerry understood that union strength comes from the work that you do in the workplace—not from acts of parliament, as important as they are and as influential as they can be in governing workers' rights, but from the strength within the workplace. Her commitment and passion for union and Labor values motivated many members throughout her workplace and around the country. Her commitment to union work was legendary, and I repeat: it was all done on a volunteer basis. It was not uncommon for her to rise before sun-up and take the long commute from Geelong to Canberra to be involved in negotiations with management—only to turn around and go back again and be one of the first people at work the very next day. 


You can only imagine the high regard in which she was held within the workplace and within the union—and you can only imagine the devastation people felt when, on 23 June this year, Kerry passed away after a relatively short battle with cancer. She is survived by her husband John and her daughters, Sheridan and Shea, whom she adored and was as proud of as they were of her. Kerry did more than just promote the values of the union; she lived them. So when I see members opposite and others around this parliament seeking to go about the task of demonising unions and union officials, I know they have a tough battle ahead of them if they want to demonise people like Kerry Edsall. She was someone who lived the values of the union—and she did it all for nothing. She was a great example and a great mentor to generations of young women.


When you are in government you have limited time, and how you spend that time is a statement of your priorities and your values. That is why I say that this bill before the House demonstrates the fact that this government has its priorities all wrong when it comes to workplace relations. They had the opportunity to correct an outrageous error—perhaps it was not an error; perhaps it was a deliberate act—they perpetrated during that great failed episode of 'Deregulation Day'. By the stroke of a pen on that day, they cut the wages of cleaners by somewhere between $172 and $225 per week. I am talking about some of the lowest paid people who work in this place. If you were to look at a diagram of who the highest paid and who the lowest paid people in this place are, you would find the Prime Minister and the Treasurer somewhere near the top of the pay pile—and you would find the people who clean this place when we have gone home near the bottom. So you have to ask yourself: what was in the minds of the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and his parliamentary secretary when he tried to bury a provision, within over 50,000 pages of government regulation, to cut the wages of some of the lowest paid people in the parliament and within government employment. It is a statement of the government's priorities. 


We could today be debating a bill that corrected that error. We could be debating, perhaps, amendments from government members effectively saying, 'We know we got it wrong when we cut the wages of some of the lowest paid people in the country.' Instead, they have used the limited resources and the limited time available to this parliament to debate a bill which does something completely different. I will get to what it does in a moment, but I think that speaks volumes about the priorities of this government.


I am a relatively new member, Deputy Speaker Mitchell. We came into this parliament at the same time, after the 2010 election. I remember an important debate that we had in this parliament when Labor introduced legislation regarding directors' salaries, and an important reform Labor introduced that gave ordinary shareholders some say in the outrageous salaries that many directors were awarding themselves, and a mechanism to correct those salaries.


When I heard the Prime Minister say before the election that one of his objectives in workplace reform was to ensure that we brought into line the obligations incumbent upon unions and union officials in the Workplace Relations Act so they more closely mirrored the obligations upon directors and companies within the Corporations Law, I thought I would find a provision in there that enabled that reciprocal flow of obligations. I can tell you this—and I have quite detailed knowledge about this—there would not be a union in this country whose rules did not provide that if a meeting of the members properly constituted of that union, or the governing body of that union, passed a resolution that said the officials of that union shall afford themselves a particular salary or a particular form of remuneration, and no more or no less, then the officials of that union would have to comply with that resolution of the membership body. When the government says they want to align the obligations of unions and corporations, that is one they have overlooked—because I remember very well, as you would remember very well, Deputy Speaker Mitchell, that they opposed tooth and nail those changes to the Corporations Law. They argued against them as 'excessive red tape'. If the government is truly interested in ensuring that the same obligations upon unions and employer associations apply to corporations, they would be rethinking their policies when it came to that particular issue around director salaries.


I listened with great interest to a number of the contributors to this debate when they talked about the genesis or the objectives of the legislation, and they invariably relied upon the great scandal concerning the Health Services Union. I am appalled by some of the revelations that have come to light about the expenditures and the use of members' money within the Health Services Union, but it is worth noting that the officials who have done the wrong thing within that union have had those malfeasances brought to light, they have been charged and have been prosecuted under the existing laws. If the motivation for bringing these laws before the parliament is to correct something that was going wrong in one or two organisations, I simply make the point that the reforms have already been implemented. In fact, the now Leader of the Opposition introduced those reforms when he was the government minister in relation to workplace relations. The reforms have created greater obligations for registered organisations and have ensured that there are greater penalties for non-compliance and greater obligations in relation to the use and reportage around members' funds, and other obligations.


For example, in 2012 he toughened the laws to improve the financial transparency, and the disclosure by registered organisations and their members. If the motivation is anything more than kicking the industrial question into the political debate, then you have to look at what has already been done and the remedies that are already available. We on this side of the House say that we stand shoulder-to-shoulder with those in the community who are appalled that the funds of any registered organisation—or any community organisation, or any charity or any company, for that matter—could be used for any purpose other than the purpose for which they are contributed. We should come down on them like a ton of bricks. But we look at the legislation and at what is already there, and we cannot draw any other conclusion but the fact that this is just an opportunity for the government to kick the industrial question back into parliament to use it as a part of a concerted campaign to try to reintroduce laws they said they would never reintroduce and to try to muddy up those who are their political opponents, and in doing that give themselves some form of political advantage.


So we are all for looking at and introducing laws that ensure the highest standards are imposed upon employer and employee organisations, but we say that this legislation does not do that. We say that this legislation is not necessary, that we will be opposing the legislation, and that we will be doing it because we say it is introduced to the House for an entirely different purpose altogether.

"Neumann, Shayne, MP",ALP,2014-07-14,"



Mr NEUMANN
 (Blair) (20:13):  I speak in relation to the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Amendment Bill 2014 to express my opposition to it. The government has reintroduced legislation before the chamber—a bill they have submitted earlier in this term of parliament, back in November. We did not support it then and we will not support it now. The whole purpose of this legislation is driven by rank right-wing ideology. This is not about registered organisations and their best interests, or the best interests of industrial relations, and fairer, simpler and decent workplaces—this is motivated by ideology.


In some countries the division between the major political parties is driven by religion, in some it is driven by geography and in others it is driven by language. In Australia, the divide between the major political parties is on industrial relations, and it has been for decades. Labor on this side has stood up for working people; on the other side, they have stood up for the interests of capital. Labor believe that employers and employees can work productively and constructively in the workplace, without coercive, investigative and onerous powers being put on by bodies created for the purpose of imposing ideology in the workplace. We saw that when those opposite were in government back before 2007, and we are seeing it resurrected yet again. It is in their DNA. They just cannot help it. It is reflexive. It is what they believe in their blood and bones, and that is to prosecute and persecute workers in the workplace. So we will not support this legislation. 


We believe the bill exceeds the penalties that are necessary in the workplace to make sure that registered organisations do the right thing. The bill exceeds penalties in the Corporations Act, which governs so much of corporate Australia. The government promised it would regulate registered organisations in the same way that companies, directors and shareholders are dealt with, but that is not what is happening here. What this bill actually does, as it has done before when it was introduced previously and when we opposed it, is establish a registered organisations commission; it amends the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act 2009. That registered organisations commission, headed by a registered organisations commissioner, will have more investigative and coercive powers than those available to the general manager of the Fair Work Commission. There are some more onerous disclosure provisions and, of course, greater penalties in terms of civil contraventions. There is also some criminality introduced in terms of criminal offences with respect to officer's duties which are discharged in the exercise of the work for those registered organisations. 


Registered organisations are absolutely crucial to Australia's workplace relations system. They play a very important role in the maintenance of productive, flexible and fair workplaces. Australian employers and their employees are entitled to representation in their workplaces. They are entitled to representation before the courts and before tribunals which deal with areas of disputation, whether it is internal within one state or across state and territory borders. They are entitled to that representation to advance their concerns and their interests. When governments consider policies in relation to industrial relations, employers and employees are also interested in how it affects their rights, their interests and their obligations. They are entitled to that representation free of corruption by employers, by employees and also by the bodies that represent those interests. They are entitled to know that their membership fees are not being misspent. As the Australian Industry Group stated in their submission to the Senate Education and Employment Legislation Committee inquiry into this bill: 


Overwhelmingly the officials and staff of registered organisations of employers and employees are dedicated and ethical people who work very hard for the benefit of their Members, their industries and the broader community. 


This is absolutely accurate and correct. 


In my time as a federal member of parliament and in my days before that, as an employer and as someone who has lived in the Ipswich and West Moreton community all my life, I must say that I have had very productive and genuine dealings with representatives of both employer and employee registered organisations. However, we must acknowledge that, although corruption is rare, it does occur in business, in government and in the community. I want to make it plain that Labor will not tolerate corruption by union officials or by officers of employer bodies. We support appropriate regulation of registered organisations in Australia's workplaces. We support a properly empowered regulator. We support appropriate and tough penalties for those who do not follow the rules and for those who break the law. It does not and should not matter if the registered organisation found to be breaking the rules represents employers or their employees. We demonstrated this when in government. 


In 2012, Labor in government then toughened the rules for registered organisations. We made their finances more transparent to their members. We dramatically increased the disclosure responsibilities. When the now Leader of the Opposition was the minister in charge of workplace relations he achieved this with legislation that he initiated in this place. The then Labor government acted to strengthen the regulation of registered organisations, whether trade union or employer organisations. That regulation, which currently governs the workplaces of this country, is the strongest it has ever been. 


As I said, the background to this this bill is really important. We made it a requirement that officers of a registered organisation disclose to that organisation the remuneration paid to them by the organisation, by a related party to the organisation or because the officer is a member of a board due to being an officer of the organisation. We made it a requirement that officers of a registered organisation disclose to that organisation any material personal interest that they or their relatives—spouse, parent, child, grandchild, grandparent, brother or sister—have or acquire relating to the affairs of that particular organisation. We made it a requirement that the registered organisation disclose to their members and to the Fair Work Commission by 31 December 2014 and every year thereafter the remuneration which the five highest paid organisational officers and the two highest branch officers had been paid in that previous year, the material personal interest which the officers had disclosed and all payments to related parties of the organisation, including payments to entities controlled by officers of the organisation. It is through the Labor government's actions that members of registered organisations now know more than they ever did before and can have confidence in the organisations which seek to represent them in the workplace. We acted to broaden the Fair Work Commission's power to investigate suspected rule breaking by those registered organisations or individuals associated with them. When this rule breaking was proved, we acted to broaden the Fair Work Commission's powers to prosecute that breach. 


The minister is a regular commentator on the Health Services Union, even when the matter is before the judiciary. He justifies this bill and changes made previously through constant references to the HSU. He says that this bill will sort it all out. What he will not admit is that the current legislation—the Fair Work Act and the registered organisations act—already contains the powers to deal with HSU matters. We already have in the registered organisations act prohibitions on members' money being used to favour particular candidates in internal elections or campaigns and provisions in relation to criminal proceedings being initiated where funds are stolen or are obtained by fraud. The current legislation ensures that the Fair Work Commission can share information with the police when appropriate for an investigation. The legislation currently provides for statutory penalties where a party knowingly or recklessly contravenes an order or direction made by the Federal Court or the Fair Work Commission under the registered organisations act or the Fair Work Act. These things exist already; they are already in place. There is no need for the legislation before the chamber to be brought before the House again.


The Fair Work Act already places on officers of a registered organisation a fiduciary duty that is very much similar and akin to the obligations that a director has under the Corporations Law in relation to the disclosure of personal interests, the disclosure of payments to related parties, being required to exercise a responsibility with care and diligence, acting in good faith and not acting improperly to use their position for political advantage. These are already obligations in the law. If you breach those obligations the Fair Work Commission has broad powers to investigate and if necessary prosecute. If officers are found guilty they face a range of serious penalties. This is not fancy. This is not fiction. This is what the law is currently. All of that would occur under the Fair Work Act and the registered organisations act as they currently exist. So why is the government trying to do this? As I said before, this is about ideology. There is no rhyme or reason, other than pure ideology, for these changes. The penalties are draconian. They are not supported by industry. The Australian Industry Group said of what the government is trying to do:


If the proposed criminal penalties and proposed massive financial penalties for breaches of duties are included in the RO Act, this would operate as a major disincentive to existing voluntary officers of registered organisations continuing in their roles, and would deter other people from holding office.


The penalties in this legislation are punitive. When you consider what a person can face in civil and criminal prosecution under this legislation for a failure to disclose or for reckless use of their position you can see that these penalties would act as a disincentive, as the Australian Industry Group has said. Who would volunteer if there are massive penalties for a mistake? Why does this bill seek to introduce criminal penalties for behaviour that is already covered by and subject to criminal law in other legislation? This is not about the government being concerned for registered organisations. This is part of an agenda. It is irrational. The government is not interested in good policy or empirical evidence. This is about the government's DNA and their blood and bone. They hate unions and they hate those who represent workers in the workplace.


We have always remained open to the government's discussing good industrial relations policy and the concerns they may have about defects in the system and about deficiencies that could be remedied, but we cannot support this legislation. If the government were fair dinkum about tackling corruption, regardless of the type of organisation involved, they would not have this legislation before the chamber. Why is the bill silent on non-registered organisations? The bill is not about good governance at all. I believe that Australians will see the bill for what it is, yet another ideological attack on Australia's unions and Australian workers. They have established the royal commissions into the trade union movement. They have done so many things since they have been in power, as the member for Throsby said in relation to cleaners and elsewhere. They just cannot help themselves. This legislation is not about good governance or better workplace relations. It is not about reducing red tape. It is simply about ideology. We will oppose this bill. It is another broken promise like their budget of betrayal and broken promises. We will not stand for it. Australians should oppose it; they will see the bill before the chamber for what it is, another attack by a government that has no regard for Australian workers.

"Snowdon, Warren, MP",ALP,2014-07-14,"



Mr SNOWDON
 (Lingiari) (20:28):  I thank the member for Blair for his contribution and say how well it elucidated the issues before the chamber. I was particularly struck by his description of the coalition and what is contained within their DNA. I participate in this debate on the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Amendment Bill 2014 as someone who has been here longer than anyone else on our side of the chamber and only one other person—




Dr Chalmers:
  A hundred years!




Mr SNOWDON:
  A bloody long time! One other person, Deputy Speaker Scott, has been here a lot longer than me. You still have hair, Deputy Speaker, I have little.




Mr Hartsuyker:
  That wouldn't be hard, to have more hair than you!




Mr SNOWDON:
  That is true. I have to tell you that I have not lost that hair worrying about trade unions. I have lost that hair worrying about this government, and about what the conservatives and the far Right in this country are wanting to do to the people of this country. This bill, as the member for Blair rightly pointed out, is a really good lesson as to this government's political agenda and how much it replicates—across the board—their own ideological self-interest, and their lack of recognition of the proper place of unions in this country and of the rights of Australian workers to be represented by those unions. I remember being on a building site at age 15 and labouring—I won't tell you how successful I was at that job; I was not that flash, I have to tell you—




Mr Butler:
  In the Boer War intervention!




Mr SNOWDON:
  In the Boer War intervention. But I had a very close friendship with the local BWIU organiser—someone who I was able to talk to about the job I was in; someone who was able to give me some guidance about occupational health and safety issues in that workplace; someone who was able to talk to me about my rights, as a young man earning adult wages at 15 and labouring on a building site, here at the university which my friend here, the member for Rankin, has just—well, relatively recently, as far as I am concerned!—received his PhD from: working in that workplace was very instructive. It taught me—as if I had not been told by others, including my family—about the importance of joining a union. From then on, throughout my whole working life, I have been and remain a member of the union. I organised as a union representative—I was a shop steward, effectively—in my workplace. I was an elected official in a trade union; not a paid official but an elected representative of my peers. By being in that organisation, I found out how important it is to understand the intrinsic value of organising workers in this country, the role of trade unions, and their historical importance and their validity, not only historically but also today. This bill demonstrates to us the government's disguised and absolute disdain for and abhorrence of unions and their historically critical role in representing Australian workers—




Mrs Griggs:
  Craig Thomson did a good job!




Mr SNOWDON:
  I will come to you later; just don’t go out of here! The role of the unions in winning pay and conditions from capital, by dint of their organisational ability, their capacity as individuals, their advocacy, and their professionalism—that is what it is about; understanding the proper role of trade unions. In this country, we all know—even the blue bloods opposite know; those with the silver spoon know this, and they have got that silver-spoon privilege not by dint of their own work but by the work of hardworking Australian men and women—that those people doing the hard yakka in the workplace: in the coalfields; on the building sites; in the financial sector; in the hospitals; those are the people doing the work. These are the people who create value for us. It might well be thought that you would recognise that even if you were born with a silver spoon in your mouth, as many of the other side seem to have been. I have a great deal of respect for some—not all, but some—members of the government. I know them to be fair and genuine people—yourself included, Mr Deputy Speaker. Not that I want to malign you—




Mr Butler:
  Or damn with faint praise!




Mr SNOWDON:
  Or damn you with faint praise! But nevertheless, this government, as the member for Blair has rightly said, has form. Since I first came here a long time ago, at every opportunity the coalition, whether in government or in opposition, has sought to undermine the rights of Australian working men and women by attacking their trade unions. It is absolutely true: the historical record speaks for itself . It is in their DNA to vilify, attack and undermine the role of unions in the workforce and the rights of their members. And I, among many in this place, lived through the Work Choices debacle, and what followed: we all remember the dogs on the wharf; we all remember those things. That is what is in the DNA of this government. That is what this bill represents. It is, as the member for Blair rightly said, irrational. It is superfluous. There is no need for this legislation. We need to comprehend for a moment what it in fact seeks to do. This bill, as you know Mr Deputy Speaker, would establish the Registered Organisations Commission, or ROC, and would amend the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act. The ROC would be headed by a Registered Organisations Commissioner with greater investigative powers than those available to the General Manager of the Fair Work Commission.


This same bill was first introduced in November of last year. It was defeated in the Senate; earlier this year, the amendments recommended by the senate legislative committee were circulated in the House. Now we have got the same piece of legislation again. As the member for Blair has said, we will not be supporting this government's Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Amendment Bill 2014, or the circulated amendments. As I pointed out earlier, these registered organisations—these trade unions—play a fundamental role in Australia's workplace relations system. They are created and registered for the purpose of representing Australian employers and employees at work. Registered organisations also represent their members before industrial tribunals and courts, and work with government on policy matters ranging from employment issues to economic and social policy. I want to refer to other contributions about union officials who acted inappropriately and corruptly: there is no place for them. We in the Labor Party have no tolerance for corruption by union officials or anyone else, including officers of employer bodies. We support tough penalties for those who break the law. As the member for Blair so eloquently pointed out, there are existing legislative frameworks which deal with those matters and make this piece of legislation redundant.


We support appropriate regulation for registered organisations, including a properly empowered regulator and consequences for those who do not follow the rules. We support—and are committed to ensuring—financial accountability for unions and employer organisations alike. That is why the now Leader of the Opposition, as minister, toughened the laws in 2012 to improve financial transparency and disclosure to their members by registered organisations, that Tony Abbott had enacted.As a result, the regulation of trade unions in Australia has never been stronger, accountability has never been higher, and the powers of the Fair Work Commission to investigate and prosecute for breaches have never been broader.


The minister consistently uses the HSU matters, of which we are all aware. We say that those matters can be fairly and properly dealt with by other areas of the law. Under the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act, officers of registered organisations already have fiduciary duties akin to those for directors under the Corporations Act. The Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act already requires officers to disclose their personal interests. The Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act already requires officers to disclose when payments are being made to related parties. It already requires officers to exercise care and diligence, to act with good faith and not to use their position improperly for political advantage. The government promised to regulate registered organisations in the same way as corporations and as you would expect—and I am sure you would not have to admit to this—they have broken that commitment. This bill places higher penalties and a more onerous regime on officers of registered organisations than those imposed on company directors. The Australian Industry Group suggests that the alignment of disclosure requirements for registered organisations with company directors under the Corporation Act was inappropriate.


Let us be very clear. The Australian community needs to understand—and I am sure it does—that we on this side of the House will not tolerate criminal or corrupt behaviour by anyone, least of all those people who are in charge of these registered organisations. The member for Solomon had the good grace to intervene a little earlier. I noticed that she had a contribution to make in an earlier discussion on the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Amendment Bill. She made some observations which, as we have come to understand, were quite wrong. She railed against the Australian Education Union's Northern Territory branch, and attempted to discredit the union and its members by referring to that union's former president standing as a candidate in the recent Northern Territory by-election. It is true that the union president contested this election, and a union president moving from the industrial to the political arena is not on—even more so when it is without reference to the union he works for. The member's statement about this being a grotesque misuse of resources is factually incorrect. It is just plain wrong. It is my understanding that both the AEU and the candidate himself made it very clear from the outset of his misplaced and unacceptable campaign. For the public record, I, as a union member, criticise his decisions and the way he was operating as a president of the union. I made it very clear that neither I nor his members supported what he was up to. But it is very clear that not one cent of AEU funds or members' funds went on his campaign expenditure. The member for Solomon got it wrong again. Ignorance is no excuse for her willingness to mislead the parliament in the way that she has done. In fact, all of her contributions fitted that description: ignorant and misleading.


Had the member for Solomon wanted to genuinely address corruption in the Northern Territory, she needed only to look at the Northern Territory government. That was all she had to do. The CLP government in the Northern Territory have set the standard for corrupt behaviour in Australia—at worst, a standard for corrupt behaviour in practicing Australian politics for many years. Their latest slush fund, Foundation 51, has replaced its discredited precursor, the Carpentaria trust proprietary limited company. A former director of Foundation 51, Mr Peter Maley, now a magistrate, retired from the position once his involvement was publicly exposed. The conflict of interest was obvious, but it goes deeper. Just look at the facts. The corrupt behaviour of the CLP government in the Northern Territory needs to be properly and clearly understood by the people of the Northern Territory and the people of Australia—and I am sure they will come to understand it. They know it already. The CLP government is deeply unpopular—almost as unpopular as the member for Solomon. Let me be fairly clear, we will not be supporting this legislation. We will stand up for the rights of unions and union members, and we will make sure that those people who act corruptly are dealt with properly by the law.

"Giles, Andrew, MP",ALP,2014-07-14,"



Mr GILES
 (Scullin) (20:43):  I rise in opposition to the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Amendment Bill 2014. Deputy Speaker, I hope you will forgive me for saying that I am not pleased to do so, because I am not. This is an unnecessary debate concerning unnecessary legislation.


As other contributions in this debate have already noted, this is not the first time this place has considered those matters that are the substance of the bill which is before us. Last year, I spoke in opposition to an identical bill, as I believe many of my colleagues did. I fear to some extent that I may be going over old ground, but this is worth repeating—or so it would seem. Perhaps this time the members opposite will listen. I note that the few of them that participated certainly did not have much to say in this debate.


The other place, wisely, in my opinion, rejected this bill. The government dominated Senate committee made a series of amendments to the original bill which the government agreed to. Then that bill was also negatived by the Senate in May. Bizarrely, the government, having accepted the recommendations for amendments from that Senate committee, has now introduced the bill essentially in its original form and has reintroduced the amendments instead of redrafting the current bill to incorporate those amendments. Surely this is just another sign of this government's dysfunction? This is a long way from what could be described as situation normal. This is incompetence and it cannot—although I suspect that it will—be blamed on everyone else.


But it is a bit more than dysfunction and incompetence; it is also a sign of this government's desperation. As the member for Griffith put it so well earlier in this debate, we see here before us a government determined to talk about everything but their cruel, unfair budget of broken promises. At one level, it is hard to blame them for that. The budget is toxic and it has caused a reversion to their basic DNA and make-up for members opposite—their ideologically driven aversion to collective action and unionism.


This debate today is another example of this government's twisted priorities. In this case, it is a distraction from debating the substance of the budget that people in my constituency—and I am sure people in the member for Lalor's constituency—want to talk about and want to hold members opposite accountable for. Whatever else this government is, this government is not, as the minister stated in his second reading contribution, 'staunchly committed to improving protections for members of registered organisations'. Rather, it is simply reverting to type, breaking yet more election promises while attacking not just unionism but ordinary working people. I think about the people spoken of by the member for Throsby and the member for Bendigo in their excellent contributions to this debate—ordinary working people taking voluntary roles to oversee the management of the organisations they are proud to be members of, people who are a long way from the boardroom, decent people who should be supported in these important voluntary roles. The rhetoric of the minister suggests that that is his concern, but his actions fly in the face of those statements.


Regardless of the government's confusion in this space, Labor's position is clear: we have zero tolerance for corrupt much less criminal practice, as the member for Lingiari just said, and support proper accountability of registered organisations for their members and the community. So we oppose this bill and its associated amendments.


I will turn very briefly to the structure and substance, such as it is, of the legislation which is before us. The current bill, like the previous bill, seeks to create a registered organisations commissioner and a registered organisations commission within the Office of the Fair Work Ombudsman. This commissioner would supervise the conduct of employer and employee organisations that are registered under the Fair Work Act 2009. Interestingly, as the member for Gorton has noted, it would pay no heed to those unregistered organisations that are amongst the very few cheerleaders of this legislation. The bill also provides for: increased disclosure requirements for registered organisations and officers; stronger coercive investigatory powers—they have been described as 'draconian'—for the commissioner, with very limited restrictions on their use; and also increased penalties, including criminal penalties.


I note that, even with the proposed amendments, employer and employee organisations alike still have significant concerns with the bill—and rightly so. I also note the concerns of the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills in this regard, concerns the minister has done little to allay. The government promised to regulate registered organisations in the same way as corporations. However, like many other promises, the coalition has broken this one as well, because those provisions which are contained within this bill exceed those penalties contained in the Corporations Act. This is unnecessary legislation. It contains extensive duplication. I am reminded of being in this place when the member for Kooyong and other members opposite celebrated with their little tea party red tape repeal day. It is astonishing that a government that took such pleasure in a deregulatory agenda could be putting forward legislation such as this. I note in this regard that, moreover, regulation of registered organisations has never been stronger. Last year in December and today we heard much sensationalism in this debate from the very few members inclined to participate on the opposite side but with very little grounding in the substance of those matters which are contained within the bill that is before us.


I am reminded that in 2012, before I was here, the 43rd Parliament considered all of those substantive matters that are the subject of this bill before enacting into law the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Amendment Act 2012. So I ask myself: why are rushing into this new regime? It is proposed, in effect, that we discard one regime, an evidence based regime, before it has had a chance to do its work and for that work to be appropriately scrutinised. I said last year that the government was proceeding with this bill with undue haste to remedy a problem it has been unable to properly articulate. Save to recite a predictable list of failings and breaches—including certainly some very serious matters but which are irrelevant to the present debate—the government is still yet to justify this legislation.


I say again: Labor takes a zero tolerance approach to union corruption and criminality and remains committed to ensuring accountability of all registered organisations—those representing employers and those representing employees. That is we properly toughened the legislative regime as well as making it more open and transparent. We enacted properly what this minister talked about disingenuously. I asked last year and I ask again: where is the evidence that these present arrangements have not worked? What specific aspect, if any, can the government point to that is not working today? If there is something specific that is not working as best it can then why not take the time to work with the system to ameliorate any problems? The government have not made the case. In fact, they have not even tried to engage with these questions.


Eight months on from that debate, I am concerned that members opposite do not seem to appreciate that registered organisations, be they reflecting the concerns of employers or employees, are fundamentally different from for-profit corporations. This difference is about purpose as well as structure. So we say to the avid deregulators opposite that regulation must be fit for purpose. Before us in this debate I can see a lot of unnecessary red tape.


I am reminded that in his original second reading speech, the Minister for Education stated:


Many registered organisations control assets worth millions of dollars. They are effectively dealing with cash flow and investments similar to those of large businesses.


I take this opportunity once more to remind him that this is a misleading assertion. Usually, the biggest asset that a union might have would be its premises, so to compare this to the investment of a large business is, at best, meaningless. And I also note that the proposed increased penalties are, to say the least, vastly disproportionate to the assets of most registered organisations, particularly those representing the concerns of employees. What may be right in relation to the regulation of large companies is unlikely to suit these types of not-for-profits. In this regard I again refer to the concerns of the Australian Industry Group, who say, 'It is unfair to subject non-profit organisations to the same disclosure rules applying to listed company executives. Much less, of course, more onerous obligations.' And it is unfair. It is as simple as that for anyone without ideological blinkers firmly affixed or for someone who is not desperate for a distraction. 


I note in this regard that that bastion of the sensible centre beloved of the former workplace relations minister, now Prime Minister, the Institute of Public Affairs, gets star billing as one of the very few strong supporters of the bill before us. What a surprise that is! The IPA, according to the explanatory memorandum, believes that 'further measures should be taken to strengthen the financial management and regulation of registered organisations, commensurate with their considerable financial resources'—repeating that canard of the minister's. Maybe the IPA is where he got it from. It is one thing to support this principle—a principle, I remind members opposite, that is presently enacted in law. Regulation is currently fit for purpose. But it is quite another to use it to attempt to justify these onerous, unnecessary provisions. And, of course, it is just wrong as a matter of fact.


I spoke last year about what I hoped might be unintended consequences of the legislation before us. I note that non-registered organisations continue to be, unsurprisingly, much keener on this bill than registered ones. It creates a real disincentive against office-holding and a powerful incentive for those registered organisations that can—that is not employee organisations—cease their registration under the act. And so I say that surely we should be encouraging democratic participation in the governance of registered organisations, if we are sincere in our concern for their members. We should be, if the words of the minister are more than just words, if our actions in this place are to match our rhetoric here and outside. But instead we see, in the words of the socialist sect the Australian Industry Group, this 'unfair' commitment, that will, I am sure, push ordinary members—those people spoken of so movingly by the member for Bendigo and the member for Throsby—away from involvement in governance, involvement in being a meaningful check and balance on the operation of those who act on their behalf, and from a meaningful role in organisations that are at the core of our democratic system, in trade unions.


It is worth remembering that the current regulatory regime for registered organisations already provides for obligations and duties very similar to those applying to corporate directors, as many previous speakers on this side have noted, but it is a fact which seems to elude members opposite. Financial disclosure and transparency rules for registered organisations have been dramatically improved under the process Labor embarked upon in 2012 and that I spoke of earlier. Training has been underway for some time since that legislation passed. It has been improving the operation and accountability of registered organisations. So it is, to say the least, disappointing that, in having this unnecessary debate again, we cannot have regard to the efficacy of the regime which is presently in place. We are not considering the lived experience of those presently subject to it after only a very short amount of time. I noted in December that some of the provisions we were proposing to repeal had not yet become operative. That is the contempt which this government has for the process of this place and for evidence based decision making. 


We have already provided under the 2012 legislation for the disclosure of remuneration, including board fees, of high-paid officials of registered organisations, and these are aligned with the usual reporting periods for annual reports and the filing of financial returns. Again, this is creating a system of obligations and duties very much like those applying under the Corporations Act. Labor has recognised and acted upon appropriately the seriousness of complying with workplace laws, of looking after members' interests, and so increased penalties but kept those penalties proportional to the distinct nature of registered organisations. This was fit-for-purpose regulation, made in response to circumstances and enacted following appropriate consultation with stakeholders across the whole spectrum—employers, employees, registered organisations and unregistered organisations—not just the IPA and certain unregistered organisations. This is in stark contrast with the bill before the House now and in December last year. This bill is at odds with its stated justification. This bill, as it has been reincarnated, albeit with very little life breathed into it, was an attack on trade unionism then and it remains so today.


If members of the coalition care about union members and people on low to middle incomes more generally, then they would not have supported a budget that attacks their way of life, their ability to see a doctor or to get an education. We are being asked on the one hand to have regard to a royal commission, but with this bill we are being told the government has already made its mind up anyway. I oppose this bill, which has at its core an attack on the very notion of collective action. (Time expired)

 (Lalor—Opposition Whip) (20:58):  I, like the member for Scullin, rise to speak again on the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Amendment Bill 2014. Like the member for Scullin, I spoke in December. As then, tonight I will speak for a few moments and return to the speech at another time.


I oppose this bill, just like I oppose the Treasurer's so-called fair budget, with its so-called fair changes to pensions, fair cuts to education, fair GP tax, fair changes to Newstart eligibility and fair changes to higher education, training and apprenticeships. I rise to oppose the ludicrous, the ridiculous situation whereby this government would retain the word 'fair' while making amendments that are not fair.


When I was working in schools in the western suburbs of Melbourne I saw the impact on local families of the then Minister Abbott's WorkChoices legislation. I saw students exploited by individual contracts. I heard direct from these kids about being paid in pizzas. I heard time and time again about kids who did not get a job when they asked about the conditions and overtime arrangements. I saw parents under pressure, too—

Ms OWENS
 (Parramatta) (21:00):  Is there any election promise that this government will not break? On 26 August 2012 Christopher Pyne said in a media release:


The coalition has no plans to increase university fees.


Then, on 1 September 2013, the then opposition leader, Tony Abbott, said:


I want to give people this absolute assurance: no cuts to education …


No plans to increase university fees and no cuts to education: two very clear promises, both broken, appallingly, in this savage budget.


The truth is that there is more than $5 billion in cuts to higher education alone in this budget. For a start, we see the government reduce the per-student Commonwealth Grant Scheme funding by an average of 20 per cent per student across all the disciplines. It is different for each discipline; it varies quite considerably. But on average it means an increase of $2,251 per annum in fees for each student just to cover the cuts that the government is making to the per-student contribution. The increases range from a modest one per cent increase in fees for allied health up to a 110 per cent increase in fees paid by the student for environmental studies. This means, in the case of the largest increase, a $9,876 per annum fee increase for a student of environmental studies. We see increases across the board: a 61 per cent increase in fees for social studies; a 97 per cent increase for communications, excluding audio-visual; a 49 per cent increase for visual and performing arts; a 24 per cent increase for nursing; a 58 per cent increase for engineering, science and surveying; a 110 per cent increase for environmental studies; a 43 per cent increase for dentistry, medicine and veterinary science; and a 43 per cent increase for agriculture. These are fee increases just to cover the cuts that the government is making to the per-student contribution. On top of that, of course, we have the increase in the interest repayments. Loans will have interest of between four and six per cent rather than the current two and three per cent. Students will be obliged to repay loans earlier. They will receive less financial assistance, and they will lose the HECS-HELP benefit for graduates in education, nursing, early childhood, maths and science.


These are appalling changes that will dramatically change the face of our education. There will also be over $200 million less for university teaching and research programs as a result of changes to indexation and $171 million in cuts to equity programs. The low-SES funding will be reduced by $51 million over four years nationally. The Education Investment Fund will be transferred to the Asset Recycling Fund. That is another loss, of $3.5 billion. And the reward funding of $121 million, which rewarded universities for meeting various government KPIs, will be cut. These are dramatic changes. Since the 1970s we have had a university sector where the quality of your work in school, your abilities, determined whether or not you could get into university. With this budget—with the Pyne-Abbott model—we see the end of that. We see a situation where, once again in this country, the ability to go to university will be determined not by your abilities but by the extent of your wealth.


In the electorate of Parramatta there is overwhelming rejection of this change. An independent survey, commissioned by the National Tertiary Education Union, of 2,000 people found that nearly 70 per cent of them reject the increase in fees for university. That is an overwhelming rejection of an appalling policy by a government that cannot keep a promise from one day to the next. But add on top of that the complete deregulation of the setting of fees that allows universities to raise fees above those massive average 29 per cent increases just to cover the cuts, and we see a university system that is absolutely skewed to those who can afford it and against those who cannot. I reject this government's model and urge them to reconsider.

Ms HALL
 (Shortland—Opposition Whip) (10:32):  I am sure members have been contacted by their constituents about the proposal to sell off Australian Hearing, and the scoping study that is currently being undertaken. I have been contacted by many constituents in my electorate.


I want to share with the House the story of a mother of twin boys who came to see me on Friday, 4 July 2014. Angela Lamb has two boys, Kai and Ryan, and they were born at 28 weeks. Ryan has a very, very significant hearing loss. Angela told me it was all a blur at the start. There were numerous tests that had to be undertaken. The costs of hearing aids, FMs and batteries were all covered for her by Australian Hearing. Angela also had access to early intervention services. Those early intervention services were coordinated through Australian Hearing and have made an enormous impact on Ryan's life. He has been able to attend a mainstream daycare centre, and he will be attending a mainstream school next year. He has been exposed to so many different things because of the way his hearing loss has been handled by Australian Hearing. Ryan's mum works two days a week at Lake Macquarie City Council. Angela has received the best available support for Ryan and that has helped not only to reduce the impact of his hearing loss but also to ensure that he has a very significant bond with his brother.


Angela is very concerned about the potential sale of Australian Hearing that was outlined in the 2014 budget. She thinks it will have a profound affect on the lives of young Australians and she does not want to see a system that has worked so well for her and her son, Ryan, change: a system that has allowed him to be in a position where he will attend mainstream school next year. Australian Hearing is vitally important to Angela and to other parents with children that suffer hearing loss.



I have also been contacted by a number of senior Australians who have used the services of Australian Hearing. They speak so highly of it and they rely on it to ensure that they get access to the quality hearing services that they need to maintain a good level of hearing. (Time expired)

Ms PARKE
 (Fremantle) (11:03):  by leave—I move notice No.1, as amended, relating to human rights in Myanmar:


That this House:


(1) notes that:


(a) the sectarian unrest in parts of Burma and also in the Mandalay, Bago, and Rangoon regions, but in Rakhine state in particular where around 140,000 people have been displaced for almost two years, is of particular concern;


(b) Human Rights Watch released two reports on the unrest in Rakhine state and the situation of Rohingya Muslims there, which raise concerns about persecution against Rohingya and outlines the dire humanitarian situation in Rakhine state;


(c) Rohingya in Rakhine state were unable to self-identify in the national census in Burma in April 2014;


(d) on 27 May 2014 Burma’s state-run media published a draft law on religious conversions that would impose restrictions on citizens wishing to change their religion, which would encourage further repression and violence against Muslims and other religious minorities;


(e) the Australian Government continues to assist affected people in Rakhine state through direct humanitarian assistance, and has provided almost $10.7 million in humanitarian assistance since the violence in 2012, making Australia one of the largest humanitarian donors to Rakhine state; and


(f) significant acts of discrimination or violence against any persons in Burma will impact on Burma’s international standing and consequently harm its bilateral relationships; and


(2) calls on the Australian Government to urge the Myanmar Government to:


(a) elevate its efforts to resolve sectarian unrest in parts of Burma and provide a safe and secure environment for aid personnel so they can continue to provide vital humanitarian assistance to people in need, including in in Rakhine state;


(b) allow the establishment of the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner of Human Rights in Burma with a full rights protection, promotion and technical assistance mandate, and permit unfettered access to all areas where sectarian violence has occurred;


(c) permit Médecins Sans Frontières to freely enter and operate in Rakhine state, and provide humanitarian assistance to all persons needing it;


(d) impartially investigate and bring to justice all those responsible for abuses, regardless of their status, position, or rank;


(e) ensure the security of all persons in Rakhine state while protecting human rights, including the right to freedom of movement, maintaining proper rule of law and good governance that includes an end to all discriminatory policies against Rohingya;


(f) take steps to remove or amend any current laws which discriminate against minority ethnic or religious groups, including Burma's 1982 Citizenship Law;


(g) abandon the proposed law on religious conversions that would politicise religion and permit government intrusion on decisions of faith;


(h) ensure right to fair trial to all persons held in jails in Burma;


(i) ensure all local laws are non-discriminatory and fair to all people of Burma, and respect the rights to movement, religion, work and access to health care and education;


(j) condemn violence and abuse inflicted on any persons, ensuring proper judicial procedures are applied;


(k) ensure Burma security forces protect all communities equally and uphold the law of the state;


(l) initiate appropriate investigations into incidents of violence involving minority ethnic or religious groups, such as the Du Cheer Yar Tan incident in Maungdaw township in January 2014


(m) support the citizenship rights of Rohingya and reconciliation of local communities;


(n) ensure the rights of women by protecting a women’s right to choose whom they will marry without regard to religious faith, and permit persons the right to freely choose the size of their family;


(o) provide appropriate humanitarian assistance, including adequate shelter and access by humanitarian organisations, to those affected by the unrest; and


(p) ensure that any return of internally displaced peoples to their place of origin is conducted voluntarily, in safety and with dignity.


The ethnic and sectarian conflict in Burma continues to involve serious and persistent outbreaks of murder and violence against the Rohingya, a Muslim minority of some 800,000 people who are concentrated in Rakhine state, which in the north borders Bangladesh. Though Burma is home to more than 130 recognised ethnic groups, the Rohingya have been denied recognition and the government continues to regard this group as comprising an illegal migration from Bangladesh, despite evidence that Muslim communities have lived in Rakhine state for centuries.


There is substantial evidence of widespread discrimination against the Rohingya, and this has been enabled and exacerbated by both government policy and government inaction. As a result, the Rohingya have been subject to very serious oppression and to human rights abuses, including violence, dispossession and forcible displacement. The purpose and effect of the mistreatment of the Rohingya has been a form of ethnic cleansing. People have been forced out of their homes—out of the towns and cities where they have lived all their lives—and into camps where conditions are dangerous to health, especially now in the monsoon season.


The oppression of the Rohingya has led many to flee by boat, and this in turn has resulted in deaths at sea, in detention and incarceration without due process of asylum claims, and in the exploitation, ransoming or trafficking of vulnerable people, especially through Thailand. Unfortunately, the transition that took place in Burma in 2011 from military based authoritarianism to a fledgling form of democratic civilian government has released some long-contained antipathies in places like Rakhine state—and certainly the Rohingyas have been comprehensively targeted since that time. Conflict between Buddhists and Rohingyas in Rakhine state in 2012 resulted in nearly 200 people killed and more than 100,000 Rohingyas displaced.


With international concern growing, Burma's President Thein Sein commissioned a report into the situation in Rakhine, but its recommendations, released in April last year, were in large part unhelpful in moving towards a lasting settlement of the issue. The report referred to the Rohingya as 'Bengalis', a clear suggestion that they emanate from and belong in Bangladesh, and also made reference to the need for family planning advice, which adverts to a common prejudice regarding the birth-rate of Muslim minority groups. Other government initiatives have involved seeking to register Rohingyas for resettlement, but this first required them to identify as Bengalis, which, understandably, they refuse to do. In May this year a draft law was published which would ban religious conversions without prior consent—another measure that reinforces a prejudicial perception that the Muslim minority is seeking to grow through intermarriage. This approach is not a recipe for peace and reconciliation, let alone for the sensible and proper integration of the Rohingya within the mainstream of civic life in Burma, with the human rights and protections that such inclusion would guarantee.


I am glad that Australia has made a contribution to addressing the crisis in Rakhine state, including through the provision of nearly $6 million in humanitarian aid, which makes us one of the largest contributors of assistance. But there is more that can be done; and there is more that we must do. Only through persistent and coordinated international pressure can the plight of the Rohingyas be alleviated. In circumstances where the Burmese government's capacity and willingness to prevent further oppression of the Rohingyas is inadequate and uncertain, it is essential that there be greater scrutiny and direct on-the-ground assistance provided by relevant UN agencies and by humanitarian NGOs.


As it stands, the involvement of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights occurs by deployment of personnel from Bangkok when it would be far preferable if that office could maintain an appropriately resourced presence in Burma itself. Similarly, the banning of Medecins Sans Frontieres, or Doctors Without Borders, from operating in Rakhine state is unacceptable and must be protested at the highest level. Medecins Sans Frontieres has been the principal provider of health care in Rakhine, operating nine clinics in towns across the state, but it was ordered by the Burmese government to cease providing this critical function on the grounds of alleged impartiality shown towards the Rohingya. The real reason may be that MSF has been prepared to report accurately on atrocities committed against the Rohingya, such as the incident at Maungdaw earlier this year, where 48 villagers were killed.


In April, the Asia Society announced that a team from Reuters had won the 2014 Osborn Elliott Prize for Excellence in Journalism on Asia for their series of investigative reports on the 'dirty war' against the Rohingya people. I encourage interested members to visit the Asia Society website, which includes links to all the Reuters reports and which, in addition to presenting both the complexity of the big picture and the tragedy of individual human stories, also reminds us of the importance of free, courageous journalism at a time when journalists like Peter Greste and many others are silenced by regimes that would prefer to operate without criticism or scrutiny.


Finally, I thank the government for supporting this motion and those members who are contributing to this debate. I am sure that there is a shared recognition of the terrible mistreatment of the Rohingya minority by their own government and a shared desire to see Australia take all appropriate action to help bring this oppression to an end.

(

):  Is the motion seconded?

"Ruddock, Philip, MP",LP,2014-07-14,"



Mr RUDDOCK
 (Berowra—Chief Government Whip) (11:08):  I rise not only to support the motion but also to second it. I am delighted to do so. I thank the member for Fremantle for her consultation about the form which it might take and I commend her for bringing it forward. Australia, and I have said this frequently, is an example to the rest of the world, where people of different faiths, different religions, different cultures and different races can function effectively as a community—committed Australians. I am very proud of what we are able to achieve and I say to other people in other parts of the world: they should look to Australia as an example, because it is possible.


I thought at the time when Burma was able to change fundamentally from a military dictatorship that we would see a change for all of the people of Burma through democratisation. When we were welcoming Aung San Suu Kyi to Australia, as somebody who has fought for it, I saw that as an ideal opportunity. I said that to her in the context of the issue we are speaking about here today. This is a very special time for Burma to be able to demonstrate that you can bring about political change and it is change that is for the benefit of all the people of the nation.


It is in that context that I think we need to understand that the Rohingya are indigenous to Myanmar, Burma. They are today denied the right to be who they are. They have existed there for over 1,000 years. They have always identified themselves as Rohingya and I believe they will always do so, yet their identity is being destroyed. A recent census had questions that excluded people identifying as Rohingya. Anybody who wrote this down was not even going to be counted. There has been displacement and violence. The citizenship law that formalised the exclusion of their nationality restricts movement, marriage and now religious conversion. Rohingya have a ban on having more than two children, on land rights and on education. They are treated as illegal. On top of that there are restrictions, as the member for Fremantle noted, on humanitarian groups being able to have offices in Burma, Myanmar, for them. These people have been left to either leave or fend for themselves.


I have met with delegations. I have spoken about this issue; I addressed a conference at the University of Western Sydney on this matter. I have met with the president of the local group of the Rohingya, Dr Myint. I know that they all are very concerned. They do not wish to be seen as Bangladeshis. They do not want to identify as another nationality. They want to remain in their homeland. They want to remain as Rohingya. They want freedom. 


I am pleased that our Minister for Foreign Affairs, Julie Bishop, who recently visited Burma, had discussions with President Thein Sein, with members of the government and with human rights advocate Aung San Suu Kyi. She met with representatives of both the Rohingya and Rakhine communities during her visit. I am informed that she raised directly the human rights issues with the government during this time. She has informed me that the government is very concerned about this issue. I think that is as it should be.


We have been providing aid to assist with humanitarian needs in the Rakhine state. The government will continue to do so. I am told that in 2014-15 we will increase development assistance in Burma to an estimated $90 million. I join with the member for Fremantle in calling for the government to commit itself to a reform process, to allow humanitarian assistance and protection, to give people the ability to enter the areas of Rakhine and set up offices and to allow the UNHCR to be there. I join with her in calling for fair trials for all those people held in prison and to abandon harsh laws and further laws on restricting religion, land rights and like matters. I think the citizenship act has to be amended. I urge the government to take positive and necessary measures to prevent further violence. I call upon the government to provide its own humanitarian assistance and to return internally displaced people to their own homes.


This is an important time for the future of this nation. How they deal with this issue will determine the way in which the country will be seen. I commend the member for Fremantle for giving us all an opportunity to speak about this matter in a bipartisan way as we seek to protect the rights of individuals.

Mr LAURIE FERGUSON
 (Werriwa) (11:13):  Whilst the reform process continues in Burma and there are positive aspects, on the other hand Human Rights Watch speaks of an uneven reform process and laws being enforced inconsistently. Nevertheless, the manifest main problem facing this country at the moment is the situation of the Rohingya in Rakhine state. I think it is very important that we have a voice on this issue because we have a situation where even those people we associate with the call for democracy and human rights in Burma—whether it is the first NLD delegation to come to this country, come to the dining room and discuss the issue with us, Aung San Suu Kyi's performance at the Sydney Opera House or a group of democracy 88 activists who came here in the last parliamentary sitting—have been found somewhat wanting on this issue. There has clearly been reluctance by the reform forces in Burma to confront the issue because of the controversy and unpopularity of the situation.


I am pleased that we do join with the US Congress, through the intervention of James P McGovern—a Democrat from Massachusetts—who, on 4 May, resolved to call for the end of the persecution of the Rohingya people and spoke of the need to recognise them as an ethnic group. He said:


The situation is dire and rapidly deteriorating.


It is particularly important that those people who have been seeking to diminish the authority of the government in Burma over a long period of time, and who are still campaigning for constitutional change, and at the same time reiterate that they are absolutely dissatisfied with the situation of the Rohingya. It is not only what is happening to those people in Burma; it is, as some speakers indicated earlier, what is happening to them once they are expelled. There was a situation where Thai authorities, at one stage, drove boats into the sea and refugee claimants were forced to be drowned in their own waters. We have got a situation where refugee claimants, and others in Thailand, are being hugely exploited in the prawn industry and the broader aquaculture industry. We have got a situation in Bangladesh where their religious confrères condemn them to very third-rate conditions. There are no proper camps and people are basically exploited in Bangladesh once expelled from Burma. Indisputably, this question of their definition and their rights in the country is a concern.


On 30 March 2014, The Hindu quoted government spokesman, Ye Htut, as saying:


If a household wants to identify themselves as 'Rohingya', we will not register it.


People do not have the right to self-define, as we do in Australia. They are basically being told that they are Bengalis, full-stop, or they are not counted. MP Aung Mya Kyaw went on to say:


They will only write down 'Bengali' because Rohingya doesn’t exist. 


The previous speaker made it clear that there has been a Muslim presence, not only the Rohingya but also others groups as well, in the country for 1,000 years. Yes, there might have been some flow of Muslims into Burma in recent decades because of overpopulation, despite the historic efforts of the Bangladesh government on birth control, but indisputably there has been a strong presence. It has only been since the 1970s that we have seen this very strong, Buddhist, chauvinistic move going very strongly against them. We heard earlier today of restrictions with regard to marriage and the number of children they can have, and now a contrived attempt in respect of conversions to further restrict them.


We had a situation in 2012 where we received various estimates about how many people were displaced. Let us, for the sake of argument, accept the government's position of 50,000. That was accompanied by uncounted, wide variations of death estimates, the destruction of houses and the destruction of shops, and that has continued through 2013. There was violence in Meiktila in March 2013—there was knowledge of that and the information was suppressed. In August there was the burning of houses and shops. In October last, at least seven people were murdered and another 50 in March of 2014. It is a very sad tale of a lack of intervention by the government to protect these people and, in some cases, collusion of police in their suppression. 


In giving foreign aid to the country, it is important that Australia is out there campaigning, that Medecins Sans Frontieres are allowed back into the area. One of the criticisms is, from Human Rights Watch and others, that we cannot get information—the government is suppressing this information. It is important that Australia does exercise its influence on the matter.

"Gambaro, Teresa, MP",LP,2014-07-14,"



Ms GAMBARO
 (Brisbane) (11:18):  I rise to support the motion that has been put before the House by the member for Fremantle. I thank her for her ongoing commitment to this issue and, in particular, for putting this motion here today so that we can all join with her.


At the onset, and by way of clarification, the Australian government is very concerned and is watching developments in Burma very closely. I would also like to thank the member for amending her motion to make use of the word 'Burma' as a term that now appears in Australian formal government communications. The Burmese embassy was advised about these changes on 8 November. Australia is a major donor and is increasing our development assistance, which is very important, to $90 million in 2014-15.


I had the privilege of visiting Burma two years ago and saw some of the reform processes being undertaken. Australia is committed to helping Burma through the next stages of its development. I met a number of government agencies, including the UNDP, to see how the economic, political, financial and health reforms are going to take place. Burma is at a crossroads in its development. Sadly, all the goodwill in the world can exist but if we do not solve the issues and stop the violence in Rakhine state the rest of the world will be watching very closely. 


There is an opportunity here for the country to move forward. The Abbott government hopes that any constitutional amendments will provide for a strong and inclusive democratic system in Burma, but ultimately what happens in the future is a matter for the Burmese people. Burma's government has made notable progress in improving its human rights record since 2011, but there is so much more to do. The challenges remain: we see the hostilities, the tensions and the violence, particularly involving ethnic minority groups in Rakhine state. It would be great to see independence of the judiciary. There are ongoing allegations of abuse by the military, including the use of torture, and the land grabbing must be reformed. They cannot continue to exist.


Violence between the Rakhine Buddhists and the Muslim Rohingyas in 2012 left 140,000 internally displaced people, most of them Rohingyas. I have seen many of them in camps. The situation remains bleak. From 26 to 27 March, violence targeting UN officers and international NGOs resulted in the destruction of property and the relocation of aid workers, including Australians. Improvements have included the release of more than 1,100 political prisoners, the establishment of a national human rights commission and greater freedom of the press. Australia has raised our concerns about the situation for the Rohingyas, and about human rights more generally, directly with the Burmese government. It was great to see my parliamentary colleague the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Hon. Julie Bishop, issue a media release expressing concerns about the humanitarian situation in Rakhine state and the targeting of UN and NGO officers. Immigration Minister Morrison also raised Australia's concerns during his visit to Burma between 6 and 9 February this year. In her most recent visit to Burma, from 2 to 9 July, Minister Bishop again raised these human rights issues in meetings with leaders of the country. Minister Bishop met with representatives of the Rohingya and Rakhine communities during this visit.


Australia is very, very concerned about what is happening in Rakhine state. The Australian government continues to assist affected people in Rakhine state through direct humanitarian assistance and has provided $10.7 million since the violence in the 2012. This makes Australia one of the largest humanitarian aid donors to Rakhine state. Our support is provided on the basis of need and does not discriminate between ethnic groups. It also extends to providing an additional $12 million to support the broader peace process in Burma. Peace is absolutely essential for the country to achieve long-term stability and economic growth. Again, I thank the member for Fremantle for allowing us to join in a bipartisan way today on this motion.

Mr GRIFFIN
 (Bruce) (11:24):  I join with other speakers in thanking the member for Fremantle for bringing forward this motion. It is a comprehensive motion which outlines in key point form a number of very serious issues facing the Rohingya within Burma but also goes to a number of specific actions that need to be supported by the Australian government and internationally to ensure that there is actually some effective change within that environment. A lot of thought has obviously gone into this motion.


I also visited Myanmar a couple of years ago with the member for Brisbane and others to view some of the aid programs that were being undertaken there by international organisations and also to try to get a sense of what was occurring within Burma with regard to the process of political change. I think we can all agree that there is no doubt that Burma has come from martial law and the extreme dictatorship of a military nature that had been in place since the sixties to, now, a situation where there have been genuine attempts to try to embrace democracy. It is a story that is still being written, but what we saw when we were there were certainly some movements in the right direction. I think we all encourage those movements, but the fact of the matter is there is still a long way to go. The journey the Burmese people are travelling and the Burmese political leadership are seeking to pursue has a long way to go.


Perhaps no group in Burmese society has further to go in terms of getting a fair go than the Rohingya. They are amongst a number of other ethnic minorities within greater Burma. The fact is that the circumstances faced by the Rohingya are particularly debilitating with regard to how they are treated. As other speakers have said, there is actually a situation where their ethnicity is not recognised. They have been recognised internationally as one of the largest stateless people in the international scene. They lack rights. They lack the capacity to be full members of civil society. They have been victim to persecution and to violence sometimes at the hands of extreme elements of the Buddhist community but often, sadly, in a situation where it is with a silent sense of approval or at the very least acquiescence from some elements of the Burmese government and civil society.


That is why it is important that international organisations are able to get into Burma and properly engage. That is why it is important that aid organisations can operate freely and safely within the areas where the Rohingya remain. That is why it is important that there is a conversation internationally but also an engagement with the Burmese leadership about why it is important that these issues are taken seriously. There is no doubt that under President Sein there have been steps taken in the right direction, and we welcome that and encourage it. But, as international citizens, we also have a responsibility to ensure that progress is ongoing and that those who have difficulty speaking for themselves are supported in international forums and in parliaments such as this. So I welcome the statements from members of the government about the actions that are being taken by the Foreign Minister and by the government as a whole with regard to aid and also raising issues with the Burmese leadership, but I think it is important that as a parliament we also make it clear that that is merely a step on the road.


The changes that are needed in terms of ensuring the Rohingya have the right to participate within Burmese society must take place. The opportunity for Rohingya families to be able to live, to gain an education, to celebrate their religion and also to be valuable members of civil society are all steps that needs to be taken. We need to combine encouragement to the Burmese leadership to keep moving forward and recognising the achievements that they have had so far with the fact that there must be an unwavering commitment from the international community to ensure that those who are not getting a fair go do get a fair go in Burma as it develops into the future. The member for Fremantle has done a credit to herself and to this House by raising these issues, by outlining what needs to be done and by ensuring that we encapsulate in a motion the sorts of actions that are required to ensure the Rohingya get a fair go.

Mr LAUNDY
 (Reid) (11:29):  I have only been in parliament a short period of time, but far and away this is my favourite part: both sides coming together and speaking about issues that unite us, not divide us. In my way of thinking, we spend a lot of time in this place talking about things that divide us, and this is Australian parliament working its best. So I not only speak in favour of the motion but commend the member for Fremantle. Although we are on different political sides, there is not a lot that the member for Fremantle puts up to this chamber and to the main chamber that I do not agree with. Today is no exception to that. 


The sectarian unrest in parts of Burma, and in particular in the Rakhine State, continues to be an issue of concern for the Australian government. Also of concern is the continuing impact of the 2012 violence between Rakhine Buddhists and Muslim Rohingya which left 140,000 people internally displaced. I note that this government has made regular representations directly to the Burmese government regarding this ongoing situation. The recent violence targeting UN officers and international NGOs is also deeply concerning—and I acknowledge the member for Fremantle's background working with the UN, and I know the pride and passion she has in that organisation. It is truly worrying, because these aid workers are needed, yet they have had to be safely relocated. Many of these aid organisations provide important humanitarian, medical and other assistance to communities throughout the Rakhine State, and the relocation of these workers has left many of Burma's most vulnerable people without access to medical services, water, food or sanitation. 


Australia continues to assist the people of the Rakhine State through direct humanitarian assistance and has provided almost $10.7 million since the violence in 2012. This makes Australia one of the largest humanitarian donors to the Rakhine State. I commend the foreign minister for raising Australia's concerns relating to the most recent unrest, during her visit to Burma earlier this month. I also commend the immigration minister for similarly raising Australia's concern during his visit to Burma earlier this year.


The Australian government continues to watch the developments in Burma closely and acknowledges that significant challenges remain. Despite these remaining challenges, it is notable that the Burmese government has made progress on improving its human rights record since 2011. These improvements have seen the release of 1,100 political prisoners, the establishment of a national human rights commission and greater freedom of the press. A report on constitutional reform from Burma's parliament was provided in January this year, and a charter amendment implementation committee has been established to develop a law to amend the constitution. The Australian government supports this reform process. It is committed to helping Burma be a politically stable and economically prosperous country in our region again. 


Of course, as an end result to these reforms, I hope any amendments promote a strong and inclusive democratic system in Burma. Looking to the future, it should of course be a priority for the Burmese government and its people to resolve the sectarian unrest in parts of Burma and provide a safe and secure environment for aid personnel. I also express my wish to see Burma's government implement reforms to reflect values that we, as Australians, hold so dear—values such as the removal of discriminatory legislation; the recognition of all minorities; a right to a fair trial for all; freedom of movement, religion, and work; and access to health care and education. 


As I have mentioned before, the Australian government is one of the largest humanitarian donors to the Rakhine State. We are also a large donor to Burma as a whole. Australia increased its development assistance program to Burma to an estimated $90 million in 2014-15. Australia also provides $12 million to support the broader peace process in Burma, without which there is little chance of a stable and prosperous economy. Australia has long advocated with all the country's leaders for a resolution of the situation in Rakhine State. We will continue to do so in the future. 


It is an honour to speak in favour of this motion brought by the member for Fremantle, recognising that, as the member for Reid, I have a diverse community. Having sat with and spoken to Rohingyan Muslims in my office and listened to their stories personally, this one is close to my heart. Congratulations for doing so and may we work together to make a change. 


Debate adjourned.

Mr WATTS
 (Gellibrand) (15:59):  I recently had the pleasure of attending the Vietnamese community in Australia Dual Identity Leadership Program Graduation Dinner in West Footscray.


The Dual Identity Leadership Program is designed to support Vietnamese-Australians in further developing and enhancing their leadership skills. This year saw 35 participants selected to take part in the inaugural leadership program. Participants were able to gain a deeper understanding into the Vietnamese diaspora in Australia and Vietnamese contemporary history.


Speakers in the program ranged from Malcolm Fraser, Nicola Roxon, Jon Faine, Major General David McLachlan AO, Major Bruce Davies MBE, Cam Ngyuen, Professor Kieu Tien Dung and the Reverend Tim Costello. The program highlighted the importance of leadership in community service and the fact that it is everyone's responsibility to participate in making our community a better place.


We, in Melbourne's West, are proud to recognise our future leaders, and celebrate the diverse backgrounds that contribute to building our community. We are particularly proud when these community leaders come from refugee backgrounds.


I would particularly like to acknowledge those who put their time and effort into organising this program. Congratulations to Bon Nguyen, President of the Vietnamese Chapter of Australia, and, in particular, to Vice-President Viv Nguyen for their time and dedication.


The following members of the steering committee also deserve thanks and congratulations: Lawrence Ho, Albert Le, Cathy Nguyen, Cuong Nguyen, Dan Thanh Nguyen, Huong Nguyen, Kim Nguyen, Thomas Nguyen, Veronica Nguyen, Alexandra Wong and Tin Nguyen.


The Vietnamese Chapter Australia Dual Identity Leadership Program is a symbol of the public leadership and community spirit found within Melbourne's West, and I look forward to seeing it grow in the years to come.

"Rishworth, Amanda, MP",ALP,2014-07-14,"



Ms RISHWORTH
 (Kingston) (16:46):  I rise out of great concern for constituents in my electorate and indeed Australians right around this country. In recent months Australians have been reeling from one of the most savage, cruel and brutal budgets ever delivered by a federal government. For the first time in a generation, families will face dire financial hardship caused by this government's unfair budget cuts and new taxes. Everyone will pay a heavy price. Families, young people, the unemployed, carers, pensioners and veterans will all have to choose whether to put food on the table or go and see their GP. These are incredibly important issues that will affect the health and wellbeing of our nation. 


This government has committed to creating a class system where the rich can access health care while the poor are excluded. The government has committed to implementing a $7 GP tax every time you see a doctor. Many of my constituents thought this was bad enough until they found out that this $7 tax is every time you get a blood test or have an X-ray. Indeed, many families have done the calculation and realise that when they see a doctor and need a number of tests it will add up to a lot more than $7.


You would think that before putting this huge proposal in front of the Australian people the government would have done some research and would have had something convincing to tell the Australian people about why this was so important. They have provided no evidence whatsoever to suggest that this will improve the health of Australians and that this will end up ensuring that people get health care when they need it. Nothing whatsoever has been provided to show how this GP tax will improve the health of Australians. Of course that should be what a government does—looking at improving the health of Australians.


Many people—not just the Labor Party—are speaking out against this. The Australian Medical Association and the Australian Healthcare & Hospitals Association have both recently asked the minister the very simple question: where is the evidence that the implementation of the GP tax will lead to better outcomes? Many people, including many experts in the area, are concerned that this will not only hurt the health of Australians but drive people into an expensive emergency department. This ill-thought-through policy will lead to people who cannot afford to see their GP, a low-cost primary health option, waiting for their condition to get worse or just immediately presenting to emergency, putting extra pressure on our hospitals.


We know where this idea came from. We know that this idea was based on the Commission of Audit, where they recommended a $15 GP tax. The Minister for Health quickly snapped that up, but there has been deafening silence from the Minister for Health about where the evidence is. Where is the evidence? There is no evidence; no modelling—nothing to support this recommendation. Indeed, the AMA president, Associate Professor Brian Owler, has quite rightly attacked this government over the tax. He says


The Government must scrap the current co-payment model and seek expert health advice on a better policy direction.


Why is it that this government is implementing an ill-thought through measure that will create a health divide in this country?


The government has had its rhetoric about the fact that cuts and the GP tax are necessary because the health system is unsustainable. But there is compelling evidence that shows that this is just rhetoric, indeed, it is not factual and it is completely incorrect. Compared with other health systems around the world, Australia has one of the most sustainable. You do not have to look much further than the Commonwealth Fund's recent report Mirror,mirror on the wall: how the performance of the U.S. health care system compares internationally for clear evidence.


The report found that Australia has a sustainable health system, with a lower level of expenditure on health as a percentage of GDP compared to many other countries around the world. But it was worrying that Australia does have concerns when it comes to cost-related problems for accessing health care. And so it is incredibly important that we all work towards ensuring that the health system is sustainable. That is why, when in government, the Labor Party increased bulk-billing rates significantly. It was a significant increase in bulk-billing rates, encouraging our doctors out there to bulk-bill patients. Of course, we know that means that people who may not have the money will access primary health care.


I think it is incredibly important to recognise that we have a very sustainable health system. Of course, we always need to look at it and make sure that it is working efficiently and effectively. But to date we have not heard from the minister how a $7 co-payment will actually ensure that the system works more effectively and efficiently. I call on the government to start providing some evidence about that.


Of course, we also have the concern that the PBS co-payments have also increased significantly in this budget. Rather than increasing by CPI, this has increased 80c per prescription for concession card holders and $5 for other patients. This is well above CPI and is very concerning for some people. The last major study, conducted in 2005—which was the last time there was a major increase in the PBS co-payments—did conclude that a significant increase in patient contributions particularly impacted on concessional patients' ability to afford medicines. I made it very clear in my first speech in this parliament, some years ago now, that it should not matter how much money you have in your pocket as to whether or not you can afford health care. And it certainly should not be the case that we have people in this country who cannot afford the medicines they are prescribed. I think it is very sobering to think that, along with the GP tax hike and that hike for medicines, we will see this impact on the ability for so many people to access the health care they need.


I do want to turn to the $50 billion ripped out of health funding for the states and territories. In South Australia that means an amount of $655 million over the next four years. The South Australian treasurer, the Hon. Tom Koutsantonis, has warned that beds will have to be cut as a result of this budget. It equates to close to 600 hospital beds. That equates to the entire size of the Flinders Medical Centre, which services my constituents.


Unfortunately, as a result of these federal budget cuts we have seen already the $100 million upgrade to the Flinders Medical Centre put on hold—this was to be a major infrastructure investment—as well as the $31.3 million upgrade to the Noarlunga Hospital put on hold. These two hospitals are critically important to my electorate, so it is very, very disappointing. We need to be working with the states and territories. It is no good for the federal government to say, 'The states run hospitals, there is no work for us to do here, we do not have a role in running hospitals.' If you want an integrated high-performing health system, both state and federal governments have to work hand in hand. Indeed, while we were in government that is exactly what we were doing. So I ask the Prime Minister and the government to reconsider these cuts, because health care is a fundamental right that our country should be able to provide.


I also want to touch on the $390 million that has been put on hold in this budget for public dental services. For too long we have had the separation of dental services from our healthcare system. I particularly know that if you do not have good dental health and good dental hygiene it does affect your health. So pulling this money for those that can least afford dental presentations is very short-sighted because it will lead to more and more chronic health conditions. So I really do ask the Prime Minister and the government to stop these cruel cuts to health. These cuts to not improve the wellbeing of our country. They do not improve the wellbeing of our citizens. If we want a country that is prospering and well looked after, we need to invest in health and we need to invest in dental. This government is doing the exact opposite.
