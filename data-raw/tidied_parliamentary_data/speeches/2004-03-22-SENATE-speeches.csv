"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2004-03-22,"—The Workplace Relations Amendment (Termination of Employment) Bill 2002 [No. 2] represents a hostile takeover of state unfair dismissal laws. It has been rejected by the Senate in the past and Labor maintains that this should continue to be the case. The bill seeks to take over the state unfair dismissal systems and then to replace them with a weak federal system. The Howard government is obsessed with weakening and removing, where possible, any protections for working Australians against being dismissed unfairly. Chanting the mantra of `choice and flexibility', the Howard government means a choice for employers to dismiss workers unfairly and to downgrade flexibility for vulnerable Australians. 
There was a time when the Prime Minister chanted another mantra—that of states rights—but now it appears that the government is being very directly centralist. Well, not completely. For example, the Workplace Relations Amendment (Award Simplification) Bill 2002 is converse to what is occurring here. The award simplification bill would remove long service leave provisions from federal awards, leaving employers and employees to rely on various state and territory laws for long service leave. In this case, with respect to the termination of employment, the government's core agenda is to reduce workers' entitlements, dabbling within state jurisdictions this time to effect that change. 
This bill is identical to the Workplace Relations Amendment (Termination of Employment) Bill 2002, which was defeated in the Senate on 11 August 2003. The bill has been reintroduced as a second industrial relations double dissolution trigger. The first was the Workplace Relations Amendment (Fair Dismissal) Bill 2002, which would allow all businesses with fewer than 20 staff to dismiss their employees unfairly. With respect to the aims of this bill, the government has made it clear that there is always an array of workplace relations bills on the go in the parliament, particularly since the failure of the second wave legislation. Bit by bit, it is being re-presented to the parliament.  
Since the first wave of legislation in 1996, very few industrial relations bills have been passed by the Senate—for good reason, and that is the quality of the content of those bills. Consistently, bills are presented that are against the interests of working Australians. The only workplace relations bills that have not been against the interests of working Australians arise from other sources. We have had—much to my pleasure and content—the Workplace Relations Amendment (Improved Protection for Victorian Workers) Bill 2003. This was demanded by the Victorian Labor government, once it was in an acceptable form. Secondly, the Workplace Relations Amendment (Protection for Emergency Management Volunteers) Bill 2003 followed the introduction of a Labor private member's bill. 
The other 12 bills that have been in the parliament since 1999—characterised by some as the dirty dozen—further erode the capacity of working Australians to bargain collectively or further weaken the capacity of unions to represent working Australians. These bills, either directly or indirectly, remove the safety net of protection available to Australian workers. These bills are all aimed at achieving the Prime Minister's ambition of an industrial relations environment where a single employee with weak bargaining power is pitted against a powerful employer in a far stronger position. 
Let us look at changes to the federal unfair dismissal system. The bill before us today is true to form. It falls into a category of directly eroding the entitlements of working Australians not to be dismissed unfairly. The bill makes a number of changes to the federal unfair dismissal system, such as a reduction in the amount of compensation that can be awarded to an unfairly dismissed employee of a small business from 26 weeks to 13 weeks pay, an extension to the qualifying period before an employee of a small business can claim unfair dismissal from three months to six months and a narrowing of the scope for an employee made redundant by his or her employer to mount an unfair dismissal action. These changes continue to tear away at the basic protections available to working Australians. They erode the concept of a fair go and the capacity of the commission to determine what is most appropriate in each particular case.
I will concentrate on the issue of taking over state jurisdictions. With this bill the government is not satisfied to just erode entitlements within the federal jurisdiction; it seeks to extend the mean-spirited Workplace Relations Act to those workers who currently fall under state industrial relations systems. It would do this by expanding the unfair dismissal jurisdiction of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to all constitutional corporations. This would result in the commission taking over 85 per cent of the states' unfair dismissal systems. As I said previously, this is quite contrary to the state rights mantra of the Howard government in other respects. This will also leave the remaining 15 per cent of employees—those who work for partnerships and sole traders—under the state systems, so the bill does not achieve the government's aim of creating a unitary system of unfair dismissal laws.
What is better characterised as a blatant grab for power cannot be justified on a number of public policy grounds. The bill was introduced less than a week after a ministerial council meeting with the states at which the federal government did not even mention that it was proposing to introduce this legislation. The federal government did not even get agreement on these provisions with the states; it did not even go through the motions. It certainly did not follow the recommendations of the President of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, Justice Giudice, in relation to the importance of consultation and cooperation, highlighting consultation as the way to develop an appropriate compromise on some of these issues. 
Some concerns have been raised about the impact on the workload of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. There are significant cost consequences of expanding the federal system while still retaining state systems. The government, in its own budget papers, anticipates a 75 per cent increase in the number of unfair dismissal cases brought before the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, at a cost of $16.8 million over four years. Of course, more work for the federal commission means more commissioners. I have to say that, on the government's record of appointing commissioners, this in itself is a significant problem. The government has taken a blatantly one-sided approach to the appointment of commission members, not only on gender issues but also in terms of the backgrounds of the commissioners it has appointed. The vast majority have been from employer and business backgrounds and only one of the last 15 appointees was a woman—a sad fact highlighted in the House of Representatives during International Women's Day.
In conclusion, the bill reduces the level of protection available to employees in respect of unfair dismissal. It overrides state laws and institutions without the agreement or cooperation of the states. This bill is justified by the government on the hollow claim of seeking a unitary system when it still leaves 15 per cent of employees in state unfair dismissal systems at a time when in other areas the government is taking away uniform national standards, such as by having long service leave revert to the various state laws. This bill yet again pursues the Prime Minister's ambition of pitting powerless employees against employers in a stronger position and takes away existing protection for working Australians. There is nothing to commend this bill, and Labor strongly opposes it. The minister used, in the House of Representatives, the example of rail gauges. Unfortunately this would just make another track. This bill has no unitary nature. Labor, as I said in the previous debate on the bill, does support a national unitary system, but this is no way to go about achieving it.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2004-03-22,"—The Workplace Relations Amendment (Termination of Employment) Bill 2002 [No. 2] is before the Senate a second time, and I should point out that Democrat amendments were previously rejected by both parties the first time around. The bill is now potentially another double dissolution trigger. I have concerns about it because it attempts to extend the coverage of federal law on unfair dismissals while simultaneously proposing to exempt small business from unfair dismissal law through the Workplace Relations Amendment (Fair Dismissal) Bill 2002 [No. 2]. The failure of this bill would concern me because of those two contrary objectives.
Schedule 1 of the bill would amend the Workplace Relations Act 1996 to cover the field of harsh, unjust or unreasonable termination. It would extend the operations of the federal unfair dismissal system by covering all employees of constitutional corporations through making greater use of the corporations power in section 51(xx) of the Constitution. In Minister Abbott's second reading speech he said that the covering the field provision meant that the percentage of employees covered by federal unfair dismissal provisions would increase from about 50 per cent to about 85 per cent and that the number of workers covered by unfair dismissal provisions should increase from about four million to about seven million. Schedule 2 provides differential criteria for small business as opposed to large business regarding unfair dismissal by giving them a longer probationary period andother things. Schedule 3 tightens unfair dismissal processes, sharpens relevant considerations and confirms reinstatement as the primary remedy. 
The first Workplace Relations Amendment (Termination of Employment) Bill 2002 was considered in March 2003 by the Senate Employment, Workplace Relations and Education Legislation Committee, on whose findings we wrote a minority report. The bill was dealt with on 11 August 2003 and rejected. The bill advances Democrat philosophy and policy in a number of respects, revisits areas we have previously rejected on principle and in practice and advances a few process improvements on unfair dismissals.
The Workplace Relations Amendment (Termination of Employment) Bill concerns me for another reason. As I said in my speech in the previous second reading debate on this bill, it represents something of a crossroads in the development of industrial relations law in this country because it seeks to cover the field in a manner which has not before been attempted in industrial relations law at the Commonwealth level. This, senators, could be a historic occasion. In recent industrial relations history I think there have been two major and significant events. The first was the Keating inspired changes to the Workplace Relations Act, or the Industrial Relations Act as it was known then, in 1993. The second was the referral of Victoria's industrial relations powers to the Commonwealth. I believe that an amended version of schedule 1 of this bill would be the third significant event. That Keating first wave changed our IR system dramatically, from a centralised one to an enterprise based one. The Victorian referral represented a great and historic step away from a state based, fragmented and inconsistent system towards a national and uniform one.
I want to repeat briefly what I have said before on a unitary industrial relations system. This bill attracts the Australian Democrats' qualified support because it advances our philosophy and policy on a unitary industrial relations system. As I have said many times before both inside and outside this chamber, we need one industrial relations system, not six. We have a small population, yet we have nine governments, 15 houses of parliament and a ridiculous overlap of laws and regulations. There are areas of the economy that genuinely require a single national approach. Like finance, corporations or trade practices law, labour law is one of those areas. Apart from the attractions of efficiency and simplicity, a unitary system would mean that all Australians—employers and employees alike—would have the same industrial relations rights and obligations regardless of where they lived.
This bill does advance unfair dismissal 85 per cent of the way to a unitary system for unfair dismissal. A nearly unitary system for unfair dismissal would have three prime benefits. Firstly, it would achieve for the majority of Australian workers common human rights across Australia, rights which differ at present. The second motivation is economic. Common, easily administered rules and laws make for more efficient, competitive and productive enterprises and for more efficient, competitive and productive national markets. This bill moves towards that objective. Thirdly, the bill facilitates more comprehensive coverage for workers. There have been estimates of up to 800,000 employees not covered by federal or state awards or agreements—for example, the former employees of OneTel, who would now be covered under this bill.
We recognise that the bill cannot go as far as it needs to; constitutional limitations prevent complete coverage. As we have stated earlier, the Democrats are concerned that relying on the corporations power alone will still leave large chunks of employees working for non-incorporated businesses, many of these in small business with still no protection from state or federal laws. We agree that the most effective way to get a single industrial relations system would be by referral of powers to the Commonwealth by the states, as opposed to using the corporations power from the Constitution. Victoria successfully referred its powers, with Democrat support and Labor opposition, in 1997. With that referral also came a category of several hundred thousand Victorian employees under inferior employment conditions under the state law of the time. In 2003, changes were finally made to enable all Victorian workers under common rule awards to be covered by the full federal award safety net. How much better off has Victoria been with one system, not two. The Victorian Labor government have had the balance of power at any time in the recent past to take back the industrial relations system and recreate a state system. But they have not done so for the very good reason that, although Labor would once have opposed the referral in Victoria, they now recognise the value of a unitary system for that state. 
Further referrals are unlikely as there are just too many vested interests, so the alternative is to use corporations power to cover the field. The NSW government have said that if the feds do that they might mount a High Court challenge. I think that would be good. If the use of corporations power to achieve a more unitary industrial relations system were confirmed by the High Court, it would probably result in these powers being more widely used to cover the field in other industrial relations areas. Unfortunately, without government support for all of the Democrats' amendments, those particular waters are unlikely to be tested. Any government that goes the route of using constitutional heads of power must also use sense and, for the greater cause, try to adjust its law to lessen vested interests' opposition. This bill, in its origins and its timing, regrettably had too much politics interfering with its policy, and it might have had an easier and earlier passage if there had not been that mixed thinking.
With respect to unfair dismissals, there are two main issues: process and access. On process, I believe that the federal process is the best in the country, stopping bludgers from both sides taking advantage, and there is no reason to give way on this stricter regime. Access, though, is a different matter. Concerns have been raised that some employees—such as short-term casuals, those on fixed-term or task contracts and high-earning non-award workers, trainees and managers who in some states are able to challenge their dismissal if it is unfair—would not be covered by the federal system. Since the early 1990s, employers have increased their use of casuals, contractors and labour hire forms of employment, often on a long-term basis. The growth in precarious and atypical employment has meant that, increasingly, legitimate workers are excluded from recourse to the industrial relations system as a whole. While many state unfair dismissal legislation regimes make an effort to cover legitimate employees in precarious employment, the federal unfair dismissal regime does not go far enough. In an attempt to address this issue, the Democrats previously proposed an amendment that sought to define `employees'. While we would still like to see a definition of `employee' in the act, we recognise that at this time the government will not agree to our proposed definition. I suspect a Labor government would not agree to that particular proposed definition either. 
The Democrats have the view that we should ensure that employees who are considered such under state law but not under federal law should still be able to access the state system, and we will move amendments today to reinforce our view. We will have to continue to lobby the government on this issue and we are pleased that in our discussions with the government they have indicated that they are willing to conduct an independent review of the scope, meaning and effect of the definition of `employee' for the purposes of accessing the unfair dismissal remedies under the Workplace Relations Act. Whatever the outcome of this bill and this debate, we urge the government to still do this, because the definition in law is unclear.
The other key area with respect to access is the issue of access for casuals as in a number of states casuals have better access than under the federal regime. When we first revised the unfair dismissal regime in 1996 and agreed to the government's proposition of 12 months probation for casuals, casuals were entirely different from what they are today. Today the estimates are that there are about 2½ million Australians in casual employment, and most of those fall under the state jurisdictions.
In Western Australia and in Tasmania, both of which have Labor governments, there is a very strange provision in that there is no probationary period for casuals—which seems remarkable and unreasonable to me. In the other four jurisdictions, casuals on probation are excluded from accessing unfair dismissal laws—rightly, I think. In the Commonwealth, Queensland—where there is a Labor government—Victoria, the ACT and the Northern Territory, the exclusion period is 12 months. In New South Wales and South Australia it is six months. The question in my mind is not whether there should be a probationary period for casuals but what the length of that period should be.
In that respect, if we are going to address the growing numbers that are in this field of employment and minimise the angst of the states about those who can presently access their regimes and who should be entitled to have access to the federal regime, we think it is appropriate to produce a compromise. We have therefore shifted from our view that 12 months is appropriate to the view that six months is long enough to determine whether the casual employee is suitable for the position. Consequently, we are recommending that the standardised casual probationary period be six months. This is not a policy that the government is attracted to. For those states whose access period is less than six months we sought agreement by the government to provide a grandfather clause that on commencement of the bill would enable those casuals to still access their state regime for six months.
We did manage to reach agreement with the government in some other key areas. The Democrats drafted and gained agreement from the government to an amendment that provides a commencement date that will prevent the government from calling a double dissolution election, passing the Workplace Relations Amendment (Fair Dismissal) Bill 2002 [No. 2] which exempts all small business from unfair dismissal, and using that bill to exempt all those caught up by the bill we are discussing today. Concerns were also raised by stakeholders that the federal unfair dismissal system would lead to reductions in the resourcing of state industrial tribunals and hence their ability to perform their other roles, and that workers in regional and rural areas who currently can attend local courts visited by state commissioners would incur increased costs to attend the federal commission, which some expect will be based solely in capital cities. 
While parts of the industrial relations system will remain with the states, the Democrats are sympathetic to the states' concerns and propose that federal unfair dismissal cases should also be able to be heard through state commissioners by having dual state and federal appointments. The government agreed to such an amendment and worked with us to redraft our original amendment. To facilitate the expansion of the unfair dismissal regime to the federal system, the government were also willing to not insist on the small business exclusions in schedule 2 of the bill, which the Democrats oppose. As I have said before, there continues to be little hard evidence to support the view that fair unfair dismissal laws have an adverse effect on overall employment levels although there is evidence to show that unfair dismissal laws that are unfair, or that allow process abuse, do affect business attitudes to employment.
Economics aside, fundamentally the Democrats have consistently said that, on both human rights and equity grounds, we will not accept reducing the rights of employees just because they are employed by small business. The Democrats are willing to support improvements to process and hence we amended the bill to apply to all businesses the provisions on vexatious and frivolous applications. The Democrats believe that the provisions covering vexatious and frivolous applications will be another important step to reducing unfair dismissal claims that do not have merit and reducing the burden on the system to free up time and resources for genuine claims.
The list of amendments I have outlined demonstrates that the Democrats have been talking at length with the government to find common ground. To their credit, the government moved considerably on a number of issues. Where does that leave us today in this chamber? The sticking point is that while the Democrats desire a unitary industrial relations system, we will not do so at any cost. As I stated earlier, access to the unfair dismissal regime is important. We cannot use this historic opportunity to come to an agreement, because we cannot get the government to compromise on reducing to a fair and reasonable period the probation period—which we think should be six months—for casuals to access unfair dismissal laws. And this is a pity.
If this bill goes down, I hope that after the election, if the coalition is returned, the government will return to this issue with us. I hope—but I think it is a vain hope—that if Labor is returned they will also recognise that it is about time to bite the bullet and take some of these issues away from the states. It is important for Australia that we move towards a unitary industrial relations system. In the meantime, while the bill has been a very contentious issue for a number of parties, in particular the states—especially some of the states' trades and labour councils—it has brought to the fore a supposed willingness of various state governments to be involved in discussions about a harmonised national approach so long as it is done in a consultative and cooperative manner. I have read the history of such things and they come in waves; I do not have high hopes about that but perhaps I am being cynical.
The states noted that the federal government have yet to make any genuine attempts to elicit cooperation—and that is a great pity. It is interesting to note that many parties in this debate—including some members of the opposition, unions and industry groups—have expressed a desire to move toward a unitary system. My own strong campaigning in this area has led me to an understanding that more and more people are starting to accept its desirability and are trying to work towards making it a reality. There is obviously still the problem of agreement, and I suggest—to whichever government gets returned at the next election—that it would be valuable for a summit to be held to bring all parties concerned together to try and explore ways in which a national unitary system can be advanced. I hope that by now our amendments have been circulated. We will be dealing with those in committee. ",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Santoro, Sen Santo",LP,2004-03-22,"—I very much appreciate the thoughtful contribution of Senator Murray to this debate. I think Senator Murray speaks a lot of sense and I thank him for the support in principle that he extends to the government in terms of the Workplace Relations Amendment (Termination of Employment) Bill 2002. The point I would like to make to Senator Murray is that this bill represents a beginning: the beginning of a journey along a road that obviously Senator Murray wants to travel—and which would be of enormous benefit to Australian small businesses. I would like to comment on some of the issues raised by Senator Murray, particularly in relation to the debate about the 12-month versus the six-month probationary period.
I have considerable experience in terms of that debate because one of the more tricky questions I had to navigate through a parliament that I previously served in—and I had the privilege of serving as the minister for industrial relations in the Queensland parliament—was exactly that point of 12-month versus six-month exemptions from unfair dismissal provisions for small businesses with under 15 employees. At that stage in Queensland we basically had an `upper house' of one in the very well-meaning, intelligent and constructive Independent, Mrs Cunningham. After consulting extensively throughout the community, we agonised over whether or not we as a government would introduce legislative provision that would exempt for either six or 12 months small businesses with 15 employees or fewer from the application of the unfair dismissal laws of the government that I was a member of. All the feedback I got from small businesses was that they preferred the 12-month exemption as opposed to the six-month exemption. There were many reasons stated for that preference.
Nevertheless, after an extensive consultation process, the then—and still—Independent member for Gladstone, representing the very strong industrial electorate of Gladstone, which was previously held only by the Labor Party, and I agreed that the 12-month exemption from unfair dismissal laws would be more appreciated by businesses. I suppose the proof of the pudding is in the eating. During the two years that those laws applied, there was record employment growth in Queensland, particularly within the small business sector. I will not say that we created that; sometimes I think politicians take on the mantle of job creation too easily. It is the economy, particularly the small business sector, of states—and indeed national economies, such as the Australian economy—that is the biggest generator of employment. Just over 40 per cent of all full-time jobs generated by business and small business in Australia were generated in Queensland at that time. I think those legislative provisions I have just referred to contributed somewhat to that.
The other interesting point Senator Murray made is that there is some reluctance by various states to agree to a unitary system of unfair dismissal laws. I must admit that, when I was representing a state jurisdiction—and without the benefit of the rather unhelpful experience of now having Labor governments right across Australia—I was a pretty strong defender of a state system of industrial relations. There are a lot of players in all states, including Queensland, who have sinecures—who have positions to protect, I suppose, if I can put it that delicately—who would be opposed to the bill being debated in this place today. But, with the passing of time, I have become a convert—at least in terms of the provisions of this bill—to the concept of a unitary system as it applies to unfair dismissals. 
Senator Murray mentioned the experience of Victoria and the fact that Victoria has not reverted to a state based industrial relations system. Senator Murray, I am sure, would appreciate, like all of us, that Victoria really did not give up that much when that state's industrial relations powers were taken on by the federal government. The bulk of the workers—or should I say employees; we are all workers, aren't we?—within the Victorian economy were, in fact, generally covered by federal awards and the federal jurisdiction. I suppose it is not surprising that the Victorian government does not have much incentive to take back jurisdiction which, in many ways, it did not have. Certainly I appreciated Senator Murray's contribution and I thank him most sincerely for making it. I say to Senator Murray: the moment is now. The opportunity to provide relief to businesses who have operations across the multiplicity of the often unfriendly state industrial relations jurisdictions is now, and we can make a start today. I hope that, as the debate progresses, the attitude of the Democrats towards this bill will become even more benign than it currently is.
Certainly the government believes that a more unified national workplace relations system means less complexity, lower costs and more jobs for all Australians. It means providing special relief for small businesses confronted by unfair dismissal claims. It means further streamlining the handling of claims generally in the federal arena. The government's workplace relations system is working: there is more employment, there are fewer strikes and there are better prospects for businesses and employees of businesses as a result of that industrial relations environment. I respectfully suggest to this place that Labor, through its strident ideological opposition to this bill, is trying to kill all of that off.
Labor sees the bill we are debating today as a hostile takeover of state unfair dismissal laws. Labor sees it as some sort of constitutional assault—never mind that it proposes to use only existing Commonwealth powers. There is no Labor style constitutional vandalism involved in this particular initiative. Labor's spokesman in the other place, the member for Rankin, says that wherever possible the Howard government is obsessed with weakening and removing from working Australians any protections against being dismissed unfairly. That is the big union line, of course. We should not be surprised at that; the opposition does get its marching orders from the union movement, after all. It is interesting to contrast Labor's bleak vision of the workplace relations landscape with the reality. Perhaps the member for Rankin is hiding an unsuspected Cezanne in his closet; he is apparently pretty big on impressionism.
The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry says that the Labor Party's industrial relations platform that it adopted at its national conference in January would adversely affect the interests of private employers and compromise economic development. The ACCI represents commerce and industry at the sharp end of the business, where the profits and losses are made. Business is in the business of making a profit. Labor, it seems to me, is in the business of making sure that business does not make a profit—indeed, that it makes a loss. According to the ACCI the additional costs Labor would impose on business through further regulation and heightened trade union activity would have significant implications for jobs and employment. 
The ACCI has called on the Latham Labor Party to at least match the policy vision—and we on this side of the chamber are always happy to give credit where credit is due—adopted by former Prime Minister Paul Keating for a less centralised workplace relations system. Now here is a chance for the Labor Party. Here is an opportunity for it to do what it claims to do best: go back to the past. This would only be a modest shift backwards, after all. The ACCI is not suggesting the ALP should go as far back as it apparently wants to in terms of industrial relations. The ALP wants to pretend this is 1904, not 2004. The ACCI is only suggesting it gets into Mr Latham's time machine for a swift flit back to the 1990s. The ALP must be able to manage that modest excursion if it claims, as it does, that it can go right back into history to find its industrial relations policies.
In the context of the bill before us it is instructive to list the areas of significant concern to the ACCI—and the hundreds of thousands of businesses, mainly small businesses, that it represents—in terms of Labor's workplace relations policy for the 2004 election. These areas of significant concern include increased regulation of workplace bargaining; acceptance of industry wide agreements, in other words, pattern bargaining; abolition of Australian workplace agreements and individual bargaining rights; removal of the ACCC jurisdiction over secondary boycotts; arbitration of non-agreed bargaining demands; expanded AIRC powers and award regulation; expanded union right of entry and employer obligations to assist union activities; rights for casual employees to convert to part-time employment; regulation of contractors; facilitation of schemes for portability of employment conditions; paid maternity leave implications for employers; national entitlements scheme implications for employers; expanded eligibility for claiming unfair dismissal; and union participation in government tenders and procurement.
No doubt those opposite would like to characterise the ACCI's obvious problem with Labor Party policy as just another Tory tall story. But the ACCI does not campaign for or against political parties. It is not against Labor. It is, although it would be far too well-mannered to put it in these terms in these circumstances at this time, against stupidity. That is the sort of thing the ACCI is talking about. We should acknowledge that the ACCI notes that productivity could still be improved—and the government agrees with this hypothesis. Further improvement to productivity and to the employment prospects and wealth of all Australians is indeed what this workplace relations bill and others that have been through this place—some without very much success—are all about.
The ACCI lists the reforms and benefits of the government's industrial relations policies. The ACCI does base its proposals for reform on the extensive consultation that it undertakes with its vast membership. The benefits are higher real wages, at 3.6 per cent growth a year, which is higher than inflation; lower interest rates because of lower inflation; fewer disputes and strikes, and it is worthy of note that under the Liberal coalition government industrial disputation in this country is at its lowest since 1913; record employment, with more than 9.6 million Australian jobs; and lower unemployment, at 5.7 per cent, the lowest in 22 years. How anybody can rail against the further reform of an industrial relations system that has produced those reforms and those benefits for all working Australians and all employees really defies comprehension and understanding.
In these circumstances it is hard to see where the member for Rankin in the other place has gained the impression that this bill represents a naked grab for power by the government. Something that we on this side of the house are very much concerned about is employment security. We are as much concerned about employment security as we are about employment growth. This bill is designed to place employment continuance in the forum where these things, subject to legislation and normal rules of conduct, are best settled. In the broader scheme of things, a union, for example, is not ideally suited to the role of employment agent, as it constantly seeks to interpose itself; exactly the reverse, indeed, is more likely to be the case. Most employment in the private sector in Australia takes place in an environment from which organised labour in the old sense is absent. Overwhelmingly small business is the employer of Australians. Small business should not be held to ransom by big unions running a political agenda; it really is as simple as that. 
In order to illustrate the sense of this legislation I would like to refer to a case that came before the Industrial Relations Commission in December. This very interesting case illustrates precisely the kind of difficulty this bill is designed to overcome. In this case, someone who claimed to have been dismissed contrary to provisions in Western Australian industrial legislation was determined, by a hearing in the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, to be able to proceed under federal law. The case itself first turned on matters of timing—whether the applicant's claim had been lodged within the legislated time frame. It is worth reading the relevant parts of the decision made by Commissioner Thatcher of the AIRC in Perth on 8 December 2003, and I propose to do so now. It will not take long. For those interested, the AIRC decision in question is U2003/6516. The issue was whether there was an acceptable reason for the applicant's delay in lodging her application. Commissioner Thatcher found as follows:
Counsel for the applicant was critical of the existing jurisdictional arrangements “which confuses sometimes even the most knowledgeable legal minds in the sense of which jurisdiction to go to” and submitted that “the system is just incomprehensible to the ordinary person”.
He went on to say:
The irony is that it cannot be concluded that this case was one of representative error with—
the applicant—
being provided by her adviser with the form for the wrong jurisdiction. Nor can it be concluded that the delay was because—
the applicant—
had been proceeding in the wrong jurisdiction. This is because the Western Australian Industrial Appeal Court decision in City of Mandurah v Hull has been interpreted by the WAIRC to mean that it has jurisdiction to hear and determine applications from employees covered by federal awards and certified agreements whose services have been terminated on grounds that the employee had been harshly, oppressively or unfairly dismissed.
Therefore had—
the applicant—
not been influenced not to proceed to lodge the completed Form 1—
the Western Australian form—
when she presented it to the registry, the claim would have been lodged within the prescribed 28 days after the date of termination in the state jurisdiction and proceeded to be determined by the WAIRC without any need for an extension of time for lodgement to be granted.
Commissioner Thatcher went on to say:
Clearly, the apparently overlapping federal and state unfair dismissal laws that operate in Western Australia confused the applicant, like many laypersons. Given that the two systems are by no means harmonised, she was in no position to assess for herself the relative advantages and disadvantages of proceeding in the Western Australian jurisdiction on the grounds that she had been harshly, oppressively or unfairly dismissed from her employment or in the federal jurisdiction on the grounds that her termination of employment was harsh, unjust or unreasonable. If her evidence is accepted, not only was she confused by the complexity but the public servants she spoke to were also. 
He went on to say:
No similar jurisdictional issues apply in respect of the application that relate to alleged contraventions of sections 170CK, 170CL, 170CM and 170CN of the federal act as there are no similar provisions in the Western Australian Industrial Relations Act 1979 and therefore no such claim would have been contained on the Form 1 that the applicant had been intending to lodge in the WAIRC.
There you have in a nutshell the precise set of difficulties that this bill we are debating here today is designed to resolve. I have chosen that particular case amongst several others that I could have chosen to speak on because it is one that relates to a jurisdiction that I know Senator Murray is very much concerned about, that being WA jurisdiction. The government has reintroduced this bill because it believes that a more unified national workplace relations system means less complexity, lower costs and more jobs. The evidence for reform achieving these outcomes is very clear. What is not clear is why the Labor Party has its head in the sand on these issues if it aspires to be a party of modern government in modern Australia.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2004-03-22,"—I find it interesting in this place that so often in the context of bills relating to unfair dismissal applications we hear members of the government saying that this is a government that believes in employment security. I think most Australians would find it hard to understand why a government that supposedly believes in employment security continues to try to water down the rights of Australians to continue to work in secure jobs and, if they are dismissed, to make unfair dismissal applications. The unfair dismissal jurisdiction that exists under the federal act exists for a very simple reason—that is, if people are to be dismissed they ought to be dismissed fairly; and if they are dismissed unfairly they ought to have a remedy. I would have thought that goes to the very heart of employment security, that you are preventing employers from dismissing people unfairly and for the wrong reasons or for not properly giving them warnings and so forth.
It was an interesting contribution by Senator Santoro. I assume, from what he read out, that it was an extension of time application where the commission actually had regard to the complexity of the dual system for the purposes of excusing the applicant's failure to lodge on time. That appeared to be the gist of the quote of the judgment that was read out.
—The gist was that none of the parties understood.
—If none of the parties understood, we could have amendments to the act which harmonise the state and federal systems. That would actually deal with the issue. Frankly, that is the fault of this government and its drafting of the provisions of the Workplace Relations Act. I would acknowledge, as a person who has previously practised in the jurisdiction, that it is extremely difficult for a solicitor, let alone a layperson, to work out precisely what the extent of the Commonwealth jurisdiction is. Yes, we should have the act drafted more clearly. Yes, perhaps we should have better harmony between the state and federal systems. But to move from that proposition somehow to the proposition that that means the federal government ought to be able to override state legislation in relation to unfair dismissals is a very long bow to draw. It is an illogical and inconsistent step. The reason it is illogical and inconsistent is that this government is not interested in taking a logical and consistent approach to dealing with any of these industrial relations issues. It takes an approach which is based on ideology, which is based on continued attempts at watering down industrial rights both for unions and for individual workers, and that has been consistently the theme of the industrial relations legislation that we have seen before this Senate. That also is the basis of the bill we have before us today. 
I want to turn briefly to the particular policy agendas which are set out or explicit in this legislation. First, the Workplace Relations Amendment (Termination of Employment) Bill 2002 [No. 2] seeks an exclusive jurisdiction for unfair dismissal to the extent that the Commonwealth parliament is able to legislate. Second, it introduces a separate criterion for small business. Further, it seeks to prevent unfair dismissal arising for operational reasons. Finally, it attempts to impose a limit on compensation by various means.
Properly understood, this legislation is an attempt by the coalition government to use the power available to it at the federal level to reduce the rights of working people in Australia. Properly understood, that is the objective of this legislation. So we can have a discussion at a principled level about unitary industrial relations systems, but if you really consider what this legislation is about it is essentially about reducing the rights of individual workers and using the legislative power of the Commonwealth parliament to swing the balance away from workers and towards employers. Obviously, there is a political context to this legislation as well. We have state Labor governments and we have a Liberal, or coalition, government in power in Canberra. Naturally, what has occurred is that the coalition is attempting to use the political power that it does have at the federal level, given that it does not have a majority in any of the state legislatures, to shift the balance in the system to employers.
This is not a new proposal. We have debated similar legislation previously in the Workplace Relations Amendment (Termination of Employment) Bill 2001. Nor is this a new approach. One only needs to go through the record of this government when it comes to industrial relations to see quite clearly who the ideologues in this debate are. We hear a lot of complaint from the other side about those of us on this side who actually believe in fair and balanced industrial relations, in the right of workers to organise collectively. We hear a lot of criticism of those principles from the other side, accusations of us being political lackeys and various other insults which are hurled across the chamber.
I say to this chamber and also to anyone who happens to be listening: the real ideologues in this debate are to be found on the other side of the chamber. That is quite apparent if one goes through the bills currently before the Senate and also the acts which have previously been passed. I will go through a few of those because it seems to me that they are thematically consistent with the legislation that is before us. We have had the transmission of business act, which was an amendment of the Workplace Relations Act, whereby the transmission of business provisions in respect of certified agreements were altered, enabling employers to not remain under an existing certified agreement on the transmission of the business. Again, it was a diminution of the rights of employees if the business was sold whereby they might have had an agreement with one employer and, the business being sold, they then could be left without that agreement in place. There were some Democrat amendments but that essentially was the intent of the government's legislation. 
We have had the fair termination act 2003, which excluded casual employees from accessing unfair but not unlawful dismissal remedies unless they had been working for 12 months. We have had the prohibition of compulsory union fees act which prohibited the payment of bargaining services fees and the inclusion of bargaining services fees in agreements and voided existing clauses. We have had the genuine bargaining act which increased the powers of the commission to make orders which, clearly, was directed primarily at trade unions. We have had the Workplace Relations Amendment (Tallies and Picnic Days) Act which sought to remove union picnic days and meat industry tallies from federal awards, although the bill was amended. We have had the termination of employment act 2001 which introduced a three-month qualifying period and had other restrictions put in place. We have had the Youth Employment Act 1999 which allowed pay rate discrimination to continue.
In terms of bills before this parliament, we have had a number of pieces of legislation which the Senate is going to be considering over these coming months. We have had the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Bill 2003 which banned pattern bargaining and any industrial action that was not protected, restricted union rights of entry and limited the operation of state law. We have had the Workplace Relations Amendment (Better Bargaining) Bill 2003 which, amongst other things, seeks to deny access to protected industrial action during the life of a certified agreement, even over claims not addressed in the certified agreement. We have had the Workplace Relations Amendment (Award Simplification) Bill 2002, which has been referred to a legislation committee, which seeks to make a number of award matters non-allowable, including matters such as long service leave, jury service, transfer between work locations, and public holidays above those specified in the award. We have had the Workplace Relations Amendment (Choice in Award Coverage) Bill 2004 which seeks to reduce the scope of federal awards safety nets. And we have had the fair dismissal bill, which is already a double dissolution trigger, which sought to exclude employees of small businesses—that is, people employing 20 employees or fewer—from making any unfair dismissal application in the federal jurisdiction. 
These are some of the bills which the Howard government has pursued, or is pursuing, in relation to industrial relations. They are clearly pieces of legislation aimed at reducing existing rights and conditions of Australian workers. How the government can continue to trumpet its credentials as a government interested in employment security when it is regularly and consistently seeking to abrogate rights which currently exist is, frankly, beyond me. Perhaps the answer is to be found in the attitude that has been displayed in previous debates in this chamber by Senator Abetz and Senator Santoro. Senator Santoro in an interchange with Senator George Campbell on 2 March stated:
... you deserve to be treated with the contempt that you and your union movement are treated with.
Senator Abetz in the second reading debate on the codifying contempt offences commented:
Who said dinosaurs were extinct? We have just heard from one and it seems to be back to Jurassic Park days with Senator George Campbell's contribution.
Hansard is replete with accusations that persons on this side of the chamber were previously trade union officials, which seemed to me to be a rather odd accusation. But that seems to be part of the rhetoric from the other side no matter what the legislation is before the parliament. 
I go back now to some of the comments made by Senator Murray, because he did make some important comments regarding the Democrats' position. Senator Murray articulated what I understand the Democrats' position to be—that they support a unitary system in principle. Let me say this to the Democrat senators: the Labor Party respectfully disagrees with their position and in the current environment we say that that analysis really is acontextual and apolitical. There are quite a number of issues to do with both the legal and jurisdictional context and also the political realities we are currently in which would preclude, we say, moving to a unitary system.
The first is a simple one about the constitutional limitations of the federal parliament. Without going through the details of how the federal parliament can legislate with respect to industrial relations, the reality is that the jurisdictional basis for any industrial relations legislation in this parliament is naturally more limited than what can be passed in most of the state legislatures. For this reason there are quite a number of state acts which actually go well beyond the jurisdiction of the federal legislation when it comes to certain employees. The most obvious example is employees who would be on the cusp of a common law definition as between employee and independent contractor.
That is a real and pressing issue within today's society. We have more and more employees who are employed or engaged on terms and conditions which could make them either a common law employee or an independent contractor, depending on what approach is taken. In respect of some vulnerable groups of workers, such as outworkers, those people are brought within the regulatory system of the state in some states. Such a provision exists in the legislation of my home state of South Australia. There would be constitutional difficulties, I suggest, in expanding—even were the government minded to, which they are not—the federal jurisdiction to deal with such employees. In fact, one could argue that even were the federal government minded to do so there may be significant constitutional impediments to them doing so. So moving to a unitary system in respect of those employees could potentially reduce rights which already exist.
Second, and I say this having had some experience in industrial relations prior to coming into parliament, my impression of state legislation and state commissions is that sometimes, not always, they are more at the coalface than the federal commission. Often, certainly in South Australia, it was easier for employees, even those who were not represented, to deal with applications via the state legislation than applications via the federal legislation. It was a process, a procedure and, frankly, a piece of legislation which was far more user friendly than the federal system.
The political context which I would ask the Democrats to have regard to is this: it is patently obvious that we have a federal coalition government and we have state Labor governments. Any move by the federal government to impose a unitary system is clearly a politically motivated move. That is also demonstrated by the provisions of this bill. If we are to move to a unitary system, let it be negotiated and not imposed. It is remarkable that the government, which often trumpets about state rights, is seeking to walk roughshod over state legislatures in an attempt to impose its politically motivated system on the states.
I say to the Democrats that there are two main principles which ought to be considered before any consideration of a unitary system. First, any unitary system must be negotiated and not imposed on the states and, second, it cannot be a situation where the federal system is imposed for the purpose of establishing a lowest common denominator. Those two issues are not met by this legislation. In fact, those two issues are clearly transgressed by the bill that is before the Senate. For that reason alone, apart from the other policy reasons, this bill should be rejected. ",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Hogg, Sen John",ALP,2004-03-22,"—I rise to oppose the Workplace Relations Amendment (Termination of Employment) Bill 2002 [No. 2]. I do so now and have done so on a number of occasions because fundamentally the bill is flawed, it is wrong and it picks on those who are most vulnerable in our community—those people who are casuals, who are placed in the most precarious employment and who, of course, should be deserving of the greatest protection and not the least protection that a parliament can afford people in the paid work force.
The government have thrown themselves boots and all into this piece of legislation again. It is interesting to read the second reading speech, which has not changed since the last time the second reading speech was made on the previous bill. One must ask how genuine the government really are in pursuing this issue when they have put no thought into the bill whatsoever. It is interesting to note that in the second paragraph of the second reading speech—and if the government were half genuine then they would achieve this—they said:
Maintaining six separate industrial jurisdictions makes as much sense as keeping six separate railway gauges.
At this stage the government have not moved to change the railway gauges in any of the states of Australia. Maybe they should try to achieve that first before worrying about dismantling people's rights and conditions. But then you still have the same throwaway line in the second reading speech where the government said:
A more unified national workplace relations system means less complexity, lower costs and more jobs.
Having given that throwaway line in the second reading speech they hope that if they repeat it often enough it will become the truth. They do not at any stage try to substantiate any of their claims in the second reading speech.
As I say, the fact of life is that this will greatly affect casual employees who are in the most precarious of employments anywhere in this country. In my state in particular, the state of Queensland, the federal jurisdiction has no capacity for common rule awards. Common rule awards in Queensland have a catch-all mechanism where those who are covered by a list of callings, or an application clause in particular in an industrial award, gain the benefits and rights of that industrial award. That is very important. Those state awards in Queensland, and there are many employees who are picked up by state awards where they are not covered by federal awards or federal agreements, provide access to a range of conditions such as working hours, starting and ceasing times, sick leave, rosters, unfair dismissal laws and a raft of other conditions which are bestowed upon them through the state system.
Whilst I heard that Senator Santoro has been down the road to Damascus and is looking for a unitary system now, that is quite different from when he was the state industrial relations minister in Queensland. No evidence has been put forward by the government or any of the government senators in this debate which would justify the abolition of the state system in the state of Queensland and going down the path of a federal industrial relations system separately and by itself. 
The bill, as I said, takes away fundamental and basic rights of people. In the second reading speech, again which has not changed, the government referred to the Melbourne Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research study, which, among other things, found that almost a third of businesses did not know whether they were covered by federal or state unfair dismissal laws. The good part about that is that two-thirds did know whether they were covered by state or federal jurisdictions. That is indeed a very high rate of response when one considers a lot of other surveys that are undertaken. The second reading speech said:
If business managers are confused by this complexity ...
But there is no complexity at all. If an employer in the state of Queensland is not covered by a federal award or agreement then they are caught up under the state laws and the state industrial relations system. So there is no complexity. It is quite the opposite. From my long experience of being a trade union official and of still being a practising trade union official, I know that if there is a doubt in the mind of the employer they will approach their own industrial organisation of employers to find out whether they are covered by a state or federal award system. It is amazing how quickly, when faced with a difficulty, an employer gets on the phone to their representative union of employers.
Over a long period of time as a trade union official in Queensland it has been my experience that very few people in small business are affected by unfair dismissal claims, particularly in respect of casuals but even in respect of full-time employees. As the president of my branch of the SDA I sit as an honorary official at the monthly executive meeting, which I attend. Over the nearly 7½ years that I have been the branch president and over the 15 years before that that I was the branch secretary it has been my experience that very few, if any, applications come forward for casual employees in either big or small business and very few, if any, applications come forward on behalf of full-time employees where they are employed by small businesses. So what we are playing with here in terms of the government's bill is a red herring. It is something that they hope to use for political gain. I can understand that. That is what politics is about. But at the end of the day we are dealing with the life, lifestyle and livelihood of people, as I have said previously in this debate, in the most precarious form of employment. This bill undoubtedly attacks those people.
The desire to extend the qualifying period has no sense or reason and should not be entertained by this parliament. It would, in effect, make even more tenuous the contract of employment for casual employees. It would make them even more attractive to the employer, to be churned out as part of the employer's program of turning over their staff to ensure that they kept casuals up to and including the minimum period, dispensed with them and replaced them with new employees, thereby avoiding any legal obligations that they might have to casual employees beyond a set period. Regardless of the period, we are looking at people being denied their rights and having their rights removed when, in effect, as I said, they should be given more protection than any other employee, even when one considers full-time employees.
 There is no evidence that this measure will boost employment opportunities in industry. There is no evidence that it will make it fairer for casuals. All it will do is put them in a worse position relative to other employees in the industry. Casuals will become the fodder of the industries. That would be a most unfortunate thing indeed. When one looks at the people who take up casual employment, you generally find that they are young people and women—people who are least able to defend themselves in many instances and who have the weakest voice in defending themselves. They are going to be placed at risk under the bill that the government are putting forward here today. 
It is worthwhile turning to the submission by the Queensland government that was reported in the consideration of this bill's predecessor by the Senate Employment, Workplace Relations and Education Legislation Committee back in March 2003. The reasons that the Queensland government opposed it sum up very succinctly why this bill should be defeated. I will go through the report very briefly rather than try to paraphrase it. At page 20 the report says:
The submission from the Queensland Government points out that far from resulting in improved legislation, as the Government claims—
that is, the federal government—
the bill establishes—
the report then lists a number of dot points, the first of which says:
• two different sets of federal laws and procedures governing unfair dismissal matters, depending on the size of the respondent;
That is complex, it adds to the complexity and, as I said, leads to employers artificially maintaining the level of employment within their businesses such that they fall under one part of the legislation or the other. The second dot point says:
• different federal and state unfair dismissal regimes for incorporated and unincorporated entities;
That is straightforward. The third dot point says:
• different federal and state unfair dismissal regimes for incorporated entities, depending on whether they meet the definition of a `constitutional corporation';
Again, that is straightforward. The fourth dot point says:
• concurrent but separate federal and state jurisdiction over different aspects of workplace relations in the one business, for example a federal regime governing a business' unfair dismissals and a state regime governing workplace harassment and industrial disputes; 
If that is not complex, I do not know what is. Instead of bringing together a simplified system, the government are seeking to make the system even more complex, according to this report and according to my submission in this matter. The last dot point says:
• concurrent but separate federal and state jurisdiction over different aspects of the one employee's claim (for example, the federal regime for unfair dismissal and the state regime for insufficient notice or unpaid entitlements).
So I think it is pretty clear. It is as succinct as one would need to get as to why this legislation deserves to be defeated in this chamber. But the summation really goes to the point of what this is about. It says:
Therefore, a state award employee of a constitutional corporation with a claim for unfair dismissal and withholding of wages would need to lodge claims in both federal and state jurisdictions, one for the unfair dismissal component, and the other for the wages component. Employers, who complain now about time wasted in court under the current law will find the regime proposed under this bill to be even more onerous.
That is the last thing that is needed in the industrial relations system. The industrial relations system needs to be relatively simple. It does not need the complexities that the government are trying to impose here. But even if it is simple, whether it be federal or state, it needs to respect the basic rights of those people who are least able to defend themselves, as casual employees are. They need to be protected at all costs. In a society where we have seen the growth of casual work right across a range of industries, we now see more and more people being exposed and being made more vulnerable to the quite strong power and position that an employer occupies in the relationship between a casual employee and an employer. If one looked up an appropriate legal definition of `casual employee', one would find that those people have a contract that operates on a day-to-day basis. They have never, by virtue of the definition that has been tried and tested over a long period in the industrial jurisdictions throughout this country, been placed on a firm footing in terms of their employment. It has always been precarious employment. 
Contrast that with the employment that is offered to part-time or full-time employees. Part-time or full-time employees are employed on a week-to-week basis and there is a prospect there of an ongoing employment relationship. But what we see in the bills that are being dished up by this government is nothing more than seeking to weaken as much as they can the relationship between a casual employee and their employer, placing them in as great a disadvantaged position as they possibly can and thereby making them infinitely more attractive than part-time or full-time employees would otherwise be.
What is really needed for people in the work force is some degree of security. When one talks to people who are seeking employment out in the real world, one finds they want security of employment—they want a real prospect that they will be employed from one week to the next. They do not want to be placed in the invidious position where there is a sword hanging over their head each week and they know that they could get the chop purely and simply because the nature of their contract is a fickle one.
The legislation that the government have put before us today—and it is the case with other pieces of legislation, as I have said—does nothing more and nothing less than weaken the power, the dignity and the strength of those people who are employed casually. Of course, if the government had their way, they would also weaken the employment of full-time and part-time employees. That has been tried in other pieces of legislation, as mentioned by Senator Wong in her contribution to this debate. She mentioned how the government have tried to make the employees of small businesses exempt from certain provisions of the acts.
There is no justification for this whatsoever, other than to give the employer an unprecedented power over the working life, the livelihood and lifestyle of people who have been able to achieve, unfortunately for some people, no form of employment other than casual employment. Anything that prejudices casual employees needs to be exposed for what it is. It is something that clearly removes their dignity and places them at a severe disadvantage compared to other employees in the work force. The government have presented nothing new in this bill whatsoever. It is purely and simply a political stunt, regurgitated such that at some stage, if they desire, they may use it for the purposes of a double dissolution trigger. It deserves what it will get in this chamber, and that is to be beaten and beaten resoundingly.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,2004-03-22,"—Here we go again. The first item of legislation, the Workplace Relations Amendment (Termination of Employment) Bill 2002 [No. 2], that this government has before the Senate this week is a rehash of a bill presented to this parliament last year and defeated. As my colleague Senator Hogg has just so eloquently pointed out, there is nothing new in what the government is putting forward on this occasion. Indeed, all the arguments advanced by the government in support of this bill, which were soundly rejected on the last occasion, are simply regurgitated again. One would have thought that this government would have far more important matters to focus on at this time than just bringing back an old piece of legislation for some ideological purpose and for the purpose of lining up another double dissolution trigger. When the bill was presented for the first time in August last year I stated: 
Since 1996, when the coalition government came to power, there have been over 50 separate pieces of industrial relations legislation introduced by the coalition government. In nearly all cases they have been directed at reducing entitlements for workers, removing their rights, targeting particular groups of workers—such as those in small business—and creating inequitable situations for them. They have been about promoting non-unionism. They have been about limiting the ability of democratic trade unions to function within the industrial relations system.
Those words were true then and they are true today. This legislation will do nothing to streamline industrial relations legislation around this country. It will do nothing to bring about a fairer or simpler system, as the government claimed in its second reading speech. This legislation will do nothing to bring about a uniform and harmonised set of industrial relations laws. These claims about uniformity, national consistency, harmony and a fairer, simpler system are all rhetorical flourishes that the government is engaging in. But any person who has ever been remotely involved—let alone in any detailed way—with industrial legislation in this country knows that those principles are totally at odds with what this legislation seeks to do.
What does the bill do? What it does is to actually remove from the jurisdiction of the state industrial relations commissions the ability of those commissions to determine unfair dismissal cases for employees employed by corporations. With the stroke of a pen, if the legislation is passed, it will overturn more than 100 years of history in some cases, such as the history of the New South Wales industrial jurisdiction. The jurisdiction has a fine record of ensuring industrial harmony and stability within the state of New South Wales during those years and has done so, I might say, in cooperation with the federal jurisdiction. The bill relies on section 51(xx) of the Constitution—that is, the section known as the corporations power. As we know, the Constitution states:
51.	The Parliament shall ... have power to make laws for the peace, order, and good government of the Commonwealth with respect to:
...	...	...
(xx)	Foreign corporations, and trading or financial corporations formed within the limits of the Commonwealth ...
It is a head of power that is focused upon the management of foreign corporations and financial and trading corporations. It is a power that was put into the Constitution to regulate essentially commerce, both domestic and international, in its impact upon Australia. But the government is using this head of power to emasculate the state commissions' ability to determine unfair dismissal cases. It is not relying upon the head of power in the Constitution directly referable to industrial relations—that is, the power under section 51 (xxxv). That is the power which speaks about the Commonwealth having the right to pass laws for the prevention and settlement of industrial disputes. That is the head of power under the Constitution that has been used since 1904. This year is the 100th anniversary of the first Conciliation and Arbitration Act. That is the head of power that has been used to regulate the Commonwealth's involvement in industrial relations.
But this government knows that it cannot rely upon that power, so it is seeking, by a backdoor means, to use the corporations power to take away the rights of state jurisdictions. This legislation is simply an abuse of that power. I might point out that the High Court has recognised that the corporations power itself does not extend to giving the Commonwealth total control over the operations of all corporations or all companies. For instance, the Commonwealth does not have the power generally to regulate the incorporation of companies. The fact that we have a corporations power under federal law in this country today is because each of the states has agreed with the federal government to enact uniform companies law. That is the way you bring about national consistency and national uniformity. You do it in consultation and in cooperation with the states. But this government has had no consultation with the states. It has not sought any agreement with the states to bring about a uniform system of industrial relations. It has not had any discussions with the states about taking away their unfair dismissal powers. What it has done is simply put forward a bill in the federal parliament which, if passed, would take away the powers of the states in that regard. That is an abuse of process. It is not about preventing or settling industrial disputes. It is about trying to create even more disputes.

Did the Prime Minister direct his Chief of Staff, Mr Sinodinos, to ring AFP Commissioner Keelty immediately following Mr Keelty's interview on the Sunday program on 14 March? Why didn't the Prime Minister ring Commissioner Keelty himself? Why didn't the Prime Minister ensure that Commissioner Keelty was contacted through the proper channels—that is, the Minister for Justice? Given Commissioner Keelty's status as AFP Commissioner, a statutory office holder, was any legal advice sought either before or after Mr Sinodinos's phone call as to the appropriateness of Mr Sinodinos contacting Mr Keelty on this matter?

If the minister cannot inform the Senate whether Mr Sinodinos was directed to contact Commissioner Keelty by the Prime Minister, I would appreciate it if he would take it on notice. As to the information as to why the Prime Minister did not ring Commissioner Keelty himself or the other questions asked, if the minister is not willing or not able to provide this information for the benefit of the Senate, I would ask him to take it on notice. I also ask a supplementary question. Could the minister inform the Senate whether Mr Howard authorised his press office to inform the Australian newspaper that Mr Sinodinos had admonished Commissioner Keelty, or was it the Prime Minister's press office backgrounding this information without prime ministerial knowledge? Can you at least tell us the truth in relation to that matter?  ",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>National Security: Terrorism</title>,Questions Without Notice,2,1,question
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2004-03-22,"—I have some information on this matter. I do not think it would be a surprise to the Senate that there is at this time—when there is significant focus on national security issues; greater focus, perhaps, than on other occasions—a regular contact in such circumstances between the office of the Prime Minister and his department and the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police. There are also significant and extensive communications and collaborations between relevant agencies concerned with intelligence and security matters. The content of these discussions must, necessarily, remain confidential. Last week there were discussions between the Prime Minister, his chief of staff, the secretary of his department and the commissioner. They arose from the commissioner's interview on Channel 9 on Sunday, 14 March. There was nothing improper about these discussions. They respected fully the operational role and independence of the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police.

That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Defence (Senator Hill) and the Minister for Justice and Customs (Senator Ellison) to questions without notice asked by senators today relating to treatment of comments of the Australian Federal Police Commissioner, Mr Keelty, about military involvement in Iraq.
Last week was another inglorious chapter in the history of the Howard government and its eternal bid to keep a lid on the truth. On the Sunday program on 14 March, Federal Police Commissioner Mick Keelty linked the atrocity inflicted on the Spanish people to the position that Spain and other allies took on issues such as Iraq. It was a perfectly reasonable and widely supported proposition but not consistent with Howard government orthodoxy. Two hundred and two people were killed and 1,800 injured. It was a horrific attack, as all senators know, and just prior to the Spanish election. The then government of Spain were seen to be trying to mislead the voters about the perpetrators, and they were tossed out at the ballot box a few days later. They tried to keep a lid on the truth.
The spectre of such an electoral backlash obviously panicked Prime Minister Howard. How else could we explain the Prime Minister's Chief of Staff contacting Commissioner Keelty straight after the interview to tell him that he had a `media problem'? Shortly thereafter we had a string of ministers coming out criticising the commissioner's point of view as being uninformed. The ministers and the government created the media problem. Mr Downer, ever the person to go a bridge too far in this government, actually implied that the commissioner was retailing al-Qaeda propaganda. Mr Howard pitted selected words from ASIO Chief Dennis Richardson against Commissioner Keelty to foolishly create divisions between agencies. By Tuesday, Commissioner Keelty was forced to issue a statement putting his words into so-called `context'. This statement was reportedly massaged by the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, possibly also by the office of the Attorney-General, Mr Ruddock, although Mr Ruddock denies any direct ministerial involvement in the exercise.
Despite these heavyweights being involved in this statement, it has been noted by most commentators that Commissioner Keelty did not retract from his original position. After the statement was issued we had Howard government ministers singing the commissioner's praises to the rafters. I think they probably caught wind of the commissioner's position that if the government lacked confidence in him he might resign. Then you would have had a media problem of gigantic proportions. 
Look at the effort in question time today. The government ministers could not tell us whether Mr Sinodinos's phone call was authorised. They could not explain why contact with Commissioner Keelty was not undertaken through the proper channels. We now have a situation where the watered-down guide to official conduct for APS employees and agency heads is defined as cumbersome, bureaucratic guidelines. They could not tell us in question time about Dr Shergold's role in this fiasco. They could not tell us whether Commissioner Keelty drafted his own retraction statement. They could not tell us whether Commissioner Keelty was told to make absolutely no change to his statement. They could not explain why Mr Downer's comments that Commissioner Keelty was expressing a view which reflects a lot of propaganda we have been getting from al-Qaeda were not appropriate. They could not explain why Mr Howard was so weak that he would not explain or make any comment about the Keelty issue at the same time that other Howard government ministers were foaming at the mouth about these issues.
We know why the Howard government is so sensitive about linking al-Qaeda activity to the Iraq war. But this continuing attack on Commissioner Keelty's competence is appalling. It is a new low for the Howard government. Mr Ruddock should apologise, Mr Downer should apologise and Mr Howard should be the first person in the government to apologise to Commissioner Keelty. And then government attacks on Australia's Federal Police Commissioner, Mr Keelty, should cease. This is a disgraceful episode from this government, probably the lowest time in its whole period in office.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>National Security: Terrorism</title>,Questions Without Notice,3,1,speech
"Lightfoot, Sen Ross",LP,2004-03-22,"—As any rational person in this chamber and the other place would expect at a time of high security issues, the government of the day is anxious to be in touch and is in touch with Commissioner Keelty's office. There is no question about that. It has always happened. Whether it is by the Prime Minister, the Prime Minister's senior staff, people from the Office of National Assessments or people of ASIO, of course they are in touch with the most senior commissioner of Australia's police forces. There is no question that that is the right thing to do. There is no question that had the Prime Minister's office not been in touch with Commissioner Keelty's office then we would have been negligent, then we would have been able to be criticised for not being in touch and not taking the issues of our homeland security seriously.
Senator Faulkner says that the ministers today could not explain the issue. Of course the ministers have given explanations. They have been doing so for the past week. Every person on this side of the chamber has nothing but absolute respect for Commissioner Keelty. I probably know Commissioner Keelty better than most in this place, although perhaps not as well as some—perhaps some of the ministers. I have personally spoken at some length with Commissioner Keelty. I have never had anything but absolute cooperation from Commissioner Keelty. What he says makes absolute and cogent sense. You can understand what he means. As the Prime Minister has said—and I do not know where the continual carping on the other side about denigrating the commissioner comes from—he has nothing but absolute respect for Commissioner Keelty. 
Senator Faulkner, the Leader of the Opposition in this place, says that there are continual attacks on Commissioner Keelty. There are not continual attacks on the commissioner from this side. We have stated our position again and again—from the Prime Minister to the Deputy Prime Minister, to senior ministers, to the cabinet, to ministers and even to backbenchers like me—that we have nothing but respect and admiration for the job that Commissioner Keelty has done. That was never more exemplified than when we had the bombings in Bali where, tragically, 89 mostly young Australians and others lost their lives. We are totally satisfied with this commissioner. We have one of the greatest commissioners that this country has ever seen.
The Prime Minister said that there were discussions last week between himself, the chief of staff, the secretary of the department and the commissioner. He acknowledges that. The beat-up came from the ABC. The ABC is clearly and unambiguously opposed to war in Iraq. Of course we had to go in there and sort out one of the worst killers this world has seen. He was not one of the worst in terms of numbers—Stalin and Hitler come before him—but he was unambiguously an evil man. If we had not done that what would have happened? Control of the world's oil would have been diminished but, most of all, the killings would have gone on. Countries in the Middle East and other nations, particularly North Korea, would have taken that as an imprimatur of this government to continue their evil ways.
Are those on the other side saying that Iraq is worse off because the coalition went in there? Is that what they are saying? Are they now making excuses for Saddam Hussein? Are they saying that they are going to bring back Saddam Hussein? If a government is formed by the people on the other side, are they going to encourage Saddam Hussein to go back as president or, if they cannot get him to go back, are they going to encourage his type of dictatorship back in Iraq? If that is what they are saying it is so ridiculous that I can barely find the words to describe it. Are they saying that we were wrong to go into Iraq? It is not quite clear. There are some on the other side who appear to be saying that. Is it Mr Latham's policy that what we did and what we are doing in Iraq is wrong? Is Mr Latham saying that he is going to pull our troops out of Iraq? Is he going to pull our troops out of Iraq if he forms government? God help Australia if he does.

"Ray, Sen Robert",ALP,2004-03-22,"—I just wanted to start my contribution today by quoting from an interview with the Prime Minister on the radio last Thursday. The interviewer says:
Prime Minister, did your office urge Federal Police Commissioner Mick Keelty to issue a clarification over his remarks linking the Madrid bombings to Spain's involvement in Iraq?
The Prime Minister replied:
I'm not going to comment on that story.
The interviewer asked:
Why not?
The Prime Minister replied:
Because I am not commenting on it.
The interviewer asked:
You can't say whether Mr Keelty's statement on Tuesday was made after a request from your office?
The Prime Minister replied:
I don't have any comment on those matters.
We have a very silent Prime Minister, haven't we? I say this to Mr Howard: you can run but you cannot hide. I never, ever again want to hear this Prime Minister infer that one of his opponents lacks ticker, because if anyone lacked ticker it was the Prime Minister last Thursday when, having sent over his lackey to slap around the police commissioner, he was not willing to comment publicly on it because he was so embarrassed by, so ashamed of, such a seedy and sleazy action. Where do you get off not having the courtesy to ring the commissioner— 
—I rise on a point of order, Deputy President. `Sleazy action' is inappropriate when speaking of another parliamentarian, in terms of the standing orders.
—I hear what you say, Senator Hill, but I do not believe it is unparliamentary in the context in which Senator Ray is putting it. He is referring to the actions; he is not referring to the individual as such. Senator Ray, I caution you to be careful in the way you phrase your language on that matter.
—If he had difficulties with the political context in which Mr Keelty was making statements, the Prime Minister had a responsibility to contact him himself. Instead, he went for the more humiliating route to Commissioner Keelty. He sent a staffer to ring him up straight after the program, not later in the afternoon. Before the make-up had been taken off he sent his staffer to the phone to slap around the police commissioner. We pointed out before that, in terms of his own government's guidelines referring to the activities of public servants and staffers, if you want to go into another portfolio you ring the minister first. It certainly would have been better handled had Mr Sinodinos rung Minister Ellison and discussed the matter with him because it may have then evolved that Minister Ellison would have done the necessary cautionary work and not left it up to a staffer and the humiliation that was involved in that.
We heard from Senator Hill today that we cannot hear about any of these discussions because they are confidential. If they are so confidential, why did the government leak them to the Australian? There is no denial of that here today—not one denial. Just to further humiliate Commissioner Keelty you leak it to your favourite newspaper so he is slapped around in public. That is a disgraceful activity by government. Get up here and deny that the government leaked that particular matter. Get up and put your own reputations on the line and deny that the government leaked it.
You send the ministers out to undermine Commissioner Keelty. Mr Downer gets on the airwaves and does an interview in front of a whole range of journalists and basically implies that poor old Commissioner Keelty inadvertently or in some other way was mouthing off al-Qaeda propaganda. Later in the day, when he realises the inadvertent effect of that particular statement, what does he do? He blames the ABC—the old Liberal tactic: `It's the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's fault. They misinterpreted what I said.' The words were quite plain. He either said them deliberately in an effort to smear Commissioner Keelty or he was incompetent in his use of words—a great sin for a foreign minister, who always has to choose his words carefully.
Then we come to the prepared statement by Commissioner Keelty. We cannot find out whether it was the government's initiative or Mr Keelty's initiative. We see it reported in the newspapers that the government prepared this statement. If they did, confirm it; if they did not, deny the newspaper report. What was the role and why was Dr Shergold pulled into this? I think he would have done it very reluctantly. Why bring in the Secretary of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet to negotiate the statement? For heaven's sake, why do that? Why complicate it in this way? 
Then we have the CDF's intervention, standing next to Senator Hill the other day. Again, I do not think it was an intentional thing to undermine the police commissioner, but an absolutely gratuitous contribution—unnecessary and unhelpful for the long-term relationships between the various uniformed services. This is not about intelligence or strategic appraisals; this is about a political spin. Mr Keelty's problem was that he inadvertently turned over the government's spin—their constructed and fabricated view of the relationship between international terrorism and intervention in Iraq. Of course we are always a target. We were a target before Iraq and after Iraq. All we have done is move up the priority list.

"Johnston, Sen David",LP,2004-03-22,"—The main issue confronting Australians today in national security is that one side of politics has a thoroughly thought-out, detailed response to a most complex issue. But Her Majesty's opposition, particularly in this place, unless it is in one syllable and in black and white, are completely and utterly lost.
National security is not as simple as being on one side of the ledger or the other. That is the fundamental point that the Labor Party have never been able to come to terms with. This question is not about whether you support the United States. Of course, that is where the Labor Party get all of their gusto in this debate. Their revulsion for the US-Australian relationship as it now stands, which is stronger than ever, is driving them to want to say, `The Spanish bombing was all about Spain's support of the United States in Iraq.' How infantile and how simplistic. In the light of the foul-up in superannuation, where they actually had to do some work and got it wrong, how typical of this opposition. When push comes to shove, when the heat starts to come on, when you cannot just sit over there mouthing off and when you have to bring something tangible to this place—you actually have to produce the goods so the public can see what you are about—you get it wrong to the tune of $8 billion. The only time you have ever had to do something in the last six months and you get it wrong to the tune of $8 billion.
Terrorism is not as simple as being on one side of the ledger or the other. Tell it to the Indonesians—which side do you think they were on? What about the Saudi Arabians, the Moroccans, the Turks, the Filipinos and, of course, latterly, the Spanish? These countries were all part of a wider problem. The wider problem is that these terrorists are attacking the West. They are attacking a standard of living. They are attacking issues that are important to freedom-loving people. It is not about whether you support the United States in Iraq. Australia was on the hit list long, long before 9/11. We were on the hit list because we went in and saved the men, women and children of East Timor. That is what we did wrong. What is that about? That is about our standing up for what is right. It is as simple as that. It is not about whether you support America or not. The Labor Party need to have it in simple terms.
What about the allegations that have been put forward in this place today? There is no substance whatsoever in terms of fact, so they come in here and say: `Why did you do this? Why did you do that? Why did you send Dr Shergold in?' Who says Dr Shergold went in? Where is the fact? It is typical of Senator Faulkner to come in here and make these grandiose allegations. There is not one shred of fact. I just hope that when Senator Ludwig gets the microphone on this matter, if he does, he actually puts some flesh on the bones of these allegations, because I will be sitting here waiting with bated breath, knowing full well that it will be just another bucket of no substance being tipped over our way. 
The Australian people can be assured that we have one of the best police commissioners in the history of the Australian Federal Police. The work that Mick Keelty has done with respect to Bali has been simply outstandingly professional and the envy of many people around the world. Indeed, we had a team ready to go to Spain following the unfortunate bombing there. The outstanding result that Keelty has achieved in the Solomon Islands has been a great credit to the Australian Federal Police and to his professional skill and ability generally.
I come back to the point. Australia was a target for terrorists long before we joined the war against terror and the war in Iraq. This is an issue that the opposition simply cannot come to terms with. Their revulsion for the United States and the President through their current leader comes to the surface every time they want to talk about what is at the root of terrorist motivations and terrorist intent. It is simplistic and it is infantile.

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2004-03-22,"—Today we have had silence from the government on what has actually occurred in this matter. There has been nothing from that side to explain what has occurred.
—What's occurred?
—For a start, the Federal Police Commissioner made a statement to Jana Wendt on the Sunday program. Then suddenly there was a plethora of activity from the government about the statement. We had the Prime Minister, at least through Mr Downer and the Attorney-General, attacking the Australian Federal Police Commissioner on his comments on the Sunday program. When the Prime Minister was asked about the issue he said, `No comment.' He did not want to explain what went on. Then, two minutes later, the Australian Federal Police Commissioner retracted the statement, or did he? Perhaps he simply issued a clarifying statement—which might be a better way of putting it, I suggest, rather than the way it was put. Then, three minutes later, we had the government praising the Australian Federal Police Commissioner for his work. If you do not think that there is not something there to be asked about, then you should not be in government.
For a start, the Prime Minister must issue a full and detailed explanation of all contact between his office and the office of the Australian Federal Police Commissioner since the Madrid bombing. Senator Hill said today that there are always discussions going on; that is, in fact, the cover story. There might be discussions always going on but let us ask the particular question: did the office of the Prime Minister contact the Australian Federal Police Commissioner and ask him to retract or to change his statement? Why do you not come clean on that issue? Why do you not then indicate to us what did occur? When you look at the next issue, the Prime Minister must confirm or explicitly deny that his office requested that Commissioner Keelty issue a clarification of his previous comments. We did not hear from Senator Hill any clarification of that issue, other than about the cover story. It is a neat cover story but it does not take us anywhere.
What have we heard from Senator Ellison? Unfortunately, we heard nothing from Senator Ellison. Senator Ellison is obviously not in the loop. Although Senator Ellison is the minister responsible for justice, the minister responsible for the Australian Federal Police and the minister responsible for the commissioner, whose position is a statutory one, he is not even in the loop about what is going on. I am not surprised, but I would have expected a little more from him—at least that he would have been in the loop and known what has been going on. 
However, we find that there remain a significant number of questions and this government does not want to give the Australian people the answers. It will not tell us whether there has been a role by Dr Shergold in this event and whether the statement by the Australian Federal Police Commissioner was his own statement, issued by him and put forward by him, or whether it was brought about by some other means. Was it suggested to the police commissioner that he should retract, change or alter his statement? Why else would the police commissioner say that he had considered resigning during this political debacle by the government, other than because he felt threatened or intimidated by the government over this issue? That is not a position in which the government should place the Australian Federal Police Commissioner.
The truth of the matter is that the Australian Federal Police Commissioner is central to issues of the war on terrorism. A considerable amount of the time, energy and resources of the Australian Federal Police are spent dealing with, broadly, issues of national security. When you then look at the issues that have evolved over the last week in this matter, it is high time that the Prime Minister issued a statement and informed the Australian public about what has taken place. It is not an issue on which this government should hide behind a cover story. They should make it plain to the Australian public what has occurred. It cannot be left unstated. We still have government ministers on the one hand criticising the Australian Federal Police Commissioner and indicating— (Time expired)

"Mason, Sen Brett",LP,2004-03-22,"—It was, I remember, freezing cold standing on the Golan Heights, and on the plains below we could see the wreckage of some Syrian tanks. Our guide, David, who was a veteran of the Six-Day War and the Yom Kippur War, pointed to the north-west towards Damascus and said, `Brett, they hate us, you know.' As Jeff Jacoby wrote recently:
Jews ... are the canary in the coal mine of civilization. When they become the objects of savagery and hate, it means the air has been poisoned and an explosion is soon to come. 
Today, sadly, what has been called `the longest hatred'—anti--Semitism—is not only still alive but also thriving. Almost 60 years after the obscenity of the Holocaust, synagogues are burning across Europe and suicide bombers wreak death and destruction in Israel, while in the world media an unprecedented campaign to delegitimise and demoralise the Jewish state is being waged by an unholy alliance of Islamic fundamentalists, Western extremists, various other fellow travellers and what Lenin used to call `useful idiots'.
Across the Islamic world today, from Casablanca to Jakarta, from London to Lagos, the most virulent anti-Semitic propaganda is poisoning the minds of hundreds of millions by blaming every shortfall in Muslim societies on the existence of a Jewish state that is one-third the size of Tasmania. Meanwhile, in the words of Natan Sharansky, a former Soviet dissident and an Israeli government minister, `Anti-Semitism has become politically correct in Europe.' Imagine it: it is now a sign of trendiness and political sophistication in Europe to hate and to disparage Jewish people.
Examples abound. A respectable Italian daily, La Stampa, publishes a cartoon showing the infant Jesus lying in front of an Israeli tank, saying, `Don't tell me they want to kill me again.' An opinion poll of European Union citizens shows that 59 per cent consider Israel to be the greatest threat to the peace of the world. The French ambassador to the United Kingdom at a dinner party refers to Israel as `that—expletive deleted—little country' and says, `Why should we be in danger of World War III because of those people?' Meanwhile in Australia our very own publicly funded broadcasters, the ABC and SBS, are bending over backwards to give the Palestinians the benefit of the doubt and to portray the Israelis as callous and cruel occupiers.
Where words lead, deeds do follow. It is no wonder then that Rabbi Abraham Cooper of the Simon Wiesenthal Centre describes the current situation as `the largest onslaught against European synagogues and Jewish schools since Kristalnacht'. While anti-Semitism has for a long time been a part of the staple rhetorical diet in the Middle East and other Islamic regions, in the West it was thought to be a spent force, an emotion extinguished by the verdict of World War II, the province perhaps of a few remaining mindless skinheads. But a lot has changed since 1945, certainly since 1967, and in the last few years in particular anti-Semitism has gone from being just a part of far Right mythology to becoming largely a disease of the Left. As Christopher Caldwell wrote recently:
What has been most shocking to the Jews of France is that the political class of their country, which has an anti-racism establishment to rival any in the world, has been largely silent about their—
the Jewish—
plight.
Very sadly, the same can said be about other Western countries where Jews have discovered that the much celebrated tolerance of postmodern, multicultural societies stops at the borders of Israel and does not even extend to some of our fellow Western citizens—the uppity Jews. In the words of Charles Krauthammer, the new anti-Semitism is much:
... more sophisticated. It is not a blanket hatred of Jews—
not anymore—
Jews are fine as long as they are powerless, passive and picturesque. What is intolerable is Jewish assertiveness, the Jewish refusal to accept victimhood. And nothing so embodies that as the Jewish state— 
of Israel. This shift in the politics of anti-Semitism has caught many by surprise—but it should not have. It is not difficult to see why the Left has now picked up the mantle of anti-Semitism from the far Right. After all, the Left sees the free, liberal, capitalist United States as a source of evil and, conversely, lionises America's every enemy. The nation of Israel and the Jewish people represent all that too many on the Left despise: the unapologetic commitment to democracy, free market, nation-state and military strength. It is a miniature United States, a Western enclave on the sea of the developing world. Let me reiterate this point for it is an essential one: those who hate Jewish people and hate the state of Israel almost without exception also hate liberal Western democracies, such as Australia and the United States, hate all our values and hate all that we stand for and all that we cherish. Anti-Semitism is only the other side of the anti-American and anti-Western coin. Those who want to destroy Israel and vanquish Jews also want to bring the Western world to its knees. What this means in practice is that we—the Jews and liberal Gentiles—are all in it together. The famous warning of the German anti-Nazi activist, Pastor Martin Niemoller, is ringing true once again:
First they came for the Jews and I did not speak out—because I was not a Jew.
The last time we did not speak out—the last time that Europe allowed itself to freely demonise and dehumanise its Jewish population—was a prelude to the Holocaust. Sadly, today there still exists a significant constituency which wants to see Israel wiped off the map.
It is difficult to understand a country unless one has been there to visit. Late last year I was lucky enough to go to Israel. A few words spoken by an Israeli army officer stuck in my mind then and they still ring clear today. He said, `Israel cannot afford to lose even one war.' In Australia, national security is an important issue—of course it is—but in Israel in many ways it is the only issue. Driving from Jerusalem to the Mediterranean Sea is a shorter distance than from Brisbane to the Gold Coast. Driving from the West Bank to Tel Aviv on the sea, many of my colleagues in the House of Representatives would not even have left their own electorates. In Israel there is no margin for error. But the distance between the West Bank and the Mediterranean lengthens when every person of goodwill around the world stands up and shouts, `Israel shall not perish,' when they will not allow anti-Semitism to go unchallenged and when they put the lie to Cain's biblical evasion and say, `I am my brother's keeper.'",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Anti-Semitism</title>,Matters of Public Importance,10,1,speech
"Stephens, Sen Ursula",ALP,2004-03-22,"—I too rise to speak today about the issue of anti-Semitism, and I am very pleased to see so many young people in the gallery who will perhaps learn a little bit about anti-Semitism in our society through this debate on a matter of public importance. We are here today to talk about the threat that it poses to the cohesion of our society, and I want to remind the Senate of the long history of anti-Semitism and the way that it can influence people to express hatred and carry out violence against Jewish people. Even here in Australia, where we pride ourselves on our communal harmony and religious freedom, there are individuals and organisations who spread intolerance and bigotry in our society. There has recently been an alarming rise in the incidence of violent anti-Semitic acts. The Executive Council of Australian Jewry, the ECAJ, keeps records of all anti-Jewish acts of vandalism, violence, intimidation and harassment reported by Australian people each year. Up to 2002 the annual average number of reported incidents was 279. How extraordinary then that in 2003 the ECAJ received an unprecedented 481 reports. 
Here are some of the statistics complied by Jeremy Jones from the ECAJ database for 2003. There were 36 reports of physical violence and property damage, against an average of 23. They constituted the third highest total ever received. There were 58 reports of face-to-face harassment, including assault, compared to an average of 24. Threatening and abusive telephone calls were reported 23 times and there were 48 reports of anti-Semitic material sent through the mail. Anti-Semitic graffiti is on the rise. There were 64 reports of this as against an average of 36 reports. And leaflets, posters, stickers and emails were the subject of 252 complaints last year, against an average of 79. Consider for a moment what these figures mean in people's lives. There were 481 reported anti-Semitic incidents and there were 481 or more distressed recipients of such abuse. What can these people think when they hear Australia referred to as a lucky country, the land of a fair go?
The outlook has certainly not improved. The latest figures from Jeremy Jones of the ECAJ show that in the first 10 weeks of this year 70 reports had already been received. Some examples of those include seven swastikas and the words `kill Jews' burnt into the lawn of a government building using weedkiller, an incendiary device set off outside a synagogue, windows in a synagogue being smashed, people arriving at a synagogue being repeatedly subjected to anti-Semitic taunts, and several physical attacks on individuals. This offensive behaviour in Australia took place against a backdrop of massive increases in reports of harassment and attacks on Jews in Western Europe. Senator Mason referred to some of those in his speech.
Next year we will be celebrating the 60th anniversary of the end of World War II in Europe. It would be wonderful to think that anti-Semitism was behind us but in fact the opposite is true. A recent manifestation of this anti-Semitism in Europe included fans at a soccer match in Belgium waving Hamas and Hezbollah banners and chanting, `Jews to the gas chamber.' And in Switzerland a woman was recently attacked for wearing a small Star of David necklace. Synagogues, cemeteries and Jewish institutions in Germany have been desecrated. In France there have been so many attacks on Jews in recent months that the chief rabbi has urged religious boys and men to wear baseball caps instead of yarmulkes in public. And in a leading Greek newspaper a journalist wrote that the Jews `have vindicated the persecutions of the Nazis'. The journalist continued, `They deserve such an executioner'—as Hitler—`since they proved to be murderers themselves.'
In the light of these developments it is very important that we express our unequivocal condemnation of anti-Semitism and that we denounce violence directed against Jews and Jewish religious and cultural institutions. In fact, we must denounce all forms of racial and ethnic hatred, and persecution or discrimination on ethnic or religious grounds, whenever and wherever it occurs. Anti-Semitism is described as discrimination against, or denial of, the right of Jews to live as equal members of a free society. What I have recently come to appreciate is the extent to which anti-Semitism is flourishing, not just against Jews as individuals—for example in education, housing or employment—but also against the Jews as a people. This is very evident in public calls for the destruction of Israel and the Jewish people by terrorist organisations like Hamas. We also see it in the fatwas issued by radical Islamic clerics that proclaim it to be a religious obligation to destroy Israel and kill the Jews. 
This genocidal anti-Semitism is very disturbing, but even more disturbing to me is the insidious anti-Semitism happening at all levels that is met with silence and even indifference. An example of what I mean is that the UN Commission on Human Rights singled out Israel for a country specific condemnation even before the annual session began. And 30 per cent of all the commission's resolutions condemned Israel while major human rights violators were immune from any criticism. I wonder how many members of this chamber are aware that Israel's humanitarian aid agency, Magen David Adom, is excluded from membership of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies.
Unfortunately, such insidious racism is not unknown here in Australia. For example, in May 2002 two Australian academics called for an academic boycott of Israel. Their statement, issued in the Australian newspaper and Arena magazine, was signed by over 90 academics from a range of disciplines. In it Israelis are described as evil and immoral oppressors guilty of `crimes of war, massacres and colonization'. And the Palestinians are portrayed as defenceless innocent victims. It goes without saying that in a democracy there must be room for different opinions, and indeed in any informed debate we would expect to hear differences aired by our academic leaders. What a tragedy and what an offence to the sincere efforts of so many to find a peaceful resolution to the hostilities that the complex political situation in the Middle East should be reduced to such simplistic stereotypes.
A criticism of Israel may well be legitimate but all too often it becomes a vehicle for anti-Semitism. I want to alert all Australians to the danger of blurring the distinctions between criticism of Israel and anti-Semitism and alert them to the dangers of implicit and explicit national stereotyping and prejudice. These are likely to encourage and provoke the hostility to the Jews that is, as I have said, already on the rise. I am not for one moment suggesting or implying that Israel is somehow above the law or that Israel should not be held accountable for any violations of law. On the contrary, Israel—just like Australia and every other country—is accountable for any violations of international law or human rights. And I am not suggesting that the Jewish people are entitled to any privileged protection or preference because of the horrors of the holocaust. All I want to see is that those values that we in Australia hold dear—a fair go, justice, equality and respect—are applied to Israel and to Jewish people everywhere, because we cannot allow any people to be singled out for differential and discriminatory treatment.
It is our responsibility as members of this parliament and members of the human community to do what we can to prevent that. As Canada's Minister for Justice, Irwin Cotler, reminds us:
... history has taught us only too well, while the persecution and discrimination may begin with Jews, it doesn't end with Jews.
What can we learn from history about how such discrimination takes hold? The terrible injustices I have been talking about did not just happen; they had their genesis in the culture that produced the perpetrators. In the words of Professor Fouad Ajami:
The suicide bomber of the Passover massacre did not descend from the sky; he walked straight out of the culture of incitement let loose on the land, a menace hovering over Israel, a great Palestinian and Arab refusal to let that country be, to cede it a place among the nations, he partook of the culture all around him—the glee that greets those brutal deeds of terror, the cult that rises around the martyrs and their families.
Attitudes and values are cultivated in a society, and it is essential that we cultivate the right ones here in Australia. We know from our studies of early childhood that children are not born with the ability to hate. In fact, they cannot even learn it until they are at least three. Prime Minister Howard may publicly deride the so-called political correctness of our public schools, but the danger of such dismissive remarks is that they can lead us to overlook the fact that it is indeed imperative to teach our children from their earliest days to respect all human life and to detect and reject racism in all its forms. To quote the Nobel Peace Prize winner Elie Wiesel, `The opposite of education is not ignorance, but indifference.' 
The promotion of social justice should be a core value in all our schools, public and private. To turn a blind eye to anti-Semitism—to laugh off intolerance of racism and injustice as political correctness—is to condone it and to allow it to grow unchecked. Anti-Semitism must always be publicly condemned so that we can build an aware community free of prejudice. To quote Jeremy Jones again:
In 2004, individuals and groups which promote anti-Jewish prejudice and carry out acts of violence, vandalism and harassment directed at the Jewish community in Australia must be clearly and unambiguously told that they are opposed by all decent, moral Australians.
And I would add to that, any time we detect a racist remark, an anti-Semitic slur or even a joke that trades on racist stereotypes, we should all choose to express our opposition rather than remain silent. I for one am prepared to be accused of having no sense of humour, if the alternative is to allow the seeds of hatred and injustice to spread in our society.
Of course, in Australia we are more fortunate than in many other nations because of the open and positive dialogue among Jews, Christians and Muslims. We must all work to maintain this dialogue. We must recognise that one aspect of our ethos—our easygoing nature—can lead us to feel comfortable with a position that does not set out to actively harm or injure Jewish people. This attitude is not strong enough for the situation we find ourselves in. We need to be much more alert to the danger of harming minority groups by our indifference or our ignorance. National stereotyping, both implicit and explicit, is a form of prejudice, and it is likely to encourage and provoke the hostility to the Jews that is, as I have said, already on the rise. We cannot appear to be willing to tolerate anti-Semitism or any other form of racism.
Yesterday, 21 March, was Harmony Day, so this is an appropriate time to take a stand against anti-Semitism—and indeed against any form of racism, prejudice and intolerance—and by our words and actions put into practice the best Australian traditional values of justice, equality, fairness and friendship. In conclusion, I thank the Senate for the formal adoption of the motion that I placed on the Notice Paper on 10 February. The motion expresses Australia's concerns about the issues I have spoken about this afternoon and explicitly encourages those who represent Australia here and overseas to use their influence to oppose anti-Semitism and to promote efforts to foster harmony and tolerance for all.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Anti-Semitism</title>,Matters of Public Importance,10,1,speech
"Ridgeway, Sen Aden",AD,2004-03-22,"—I rise to speak on behalf of the Australian Democrats in wholeheartedly supporting the condemnation of anti-Semitism and violence against the Jewish people both here in Australia and abroad. Though the persecution of Jews has a long history, I am personally reminded of the events of 6 December 1938, in which a Victorian Aboriginal man, William Cooper, led a deputation from the Australian Aborigines League to present a petition to the German government through its consulate in Melbourne, condemning the persecution, violence and intimidation being carried out against German Jews leading into World War II through the practices of Kristallnacht. This is particularly important to me because, as far as I am aware, the first group in this country to protest the German government's treatment of the Jews was from Aboriginal people—a little-known fact but for the dedication of a plaque unveiled at the Melbourne Holocaust Museum in December 2002 to commemorate the protest. 
I join with the Jewish community again in the spirit of that endeavour to condemn many of the acts of violence, persecution and intimidation against Jewish people and to acknowledge that particular suffering. What more evidence is needed that such events from our past are not contained by the historical periods in which they occurred but live on in the way we continue to see present-day manifestations? I would also like to celebrate and put on the record the remarkable strength of the human spirit, which has seen the Jewish people time and time again rise above those frightening histories, and how it continues to play out in our daily lives. This is a particularly important matter of public importance because, in many ways, it provides us with the opportunity to dispel many of the myths that have been allowed to gain legitimacy because of world events over the past few years.
Unfortunately, many modern tragedies which political affiliations and niceties prevent us from discussing openly give licence to other things being said within our community—namely, the rise of anti-Semitism. It is now reported that attacks against Jews in this country are comparable to those of 15 years ago. In particular, I am personally incensed that there are reports of 27 attacks, 18 of those being from within my own state of New South Wales in the past six months, ranging from assault, denial of services, vandalism of private property and synagogues to the circulation of anti-Semitic material.
I was disturbed after having spoken to the B'nai B'rith Anti-Defamation Commission, which is well known within the Australian community, about the range of incidents in New South Wales, particularly in the last three to four months: in Vaucluse, a Jewish man was assaulted by having a glass bottle smashed over his head; in the Co-op Bookshop in Sydney, a Jewish woman was denied service; and a synagogue in the northern suburbs of Sydney was graffitied. A range of other incidents highlight the fact that much of what is being borne out in our community is simply the result of a gross distortion of reality.
Unfortunately, within the last 54 years there has been a calculated worldwide inundation of misinformation about Jewish people in all parts of the world, not just in relation to Israel. A clear affinity has developed between events connected with the Israel-Palestine conflict and the number and severity of anti-Jewish attacks all over the world. Many of the activities described as a criticism of Israel do have anti-Semitic undertones. In many instances, criticism of Israel does turn into unbridled attacks against Zionism and, implicitly, Jewish people. I wish to pay respect to the Jewish community of Australia and, more particularly, the B'nai B'rith Anti-Defamation Commission for taking it upon themselves to promote those values integral to a tolerant and understanding society. Members of that organisation are present in the President's gallery.
Many of the activities we have witnessed in more recent times raise questions about the leadership obligations that we have as politicians and the need to deal with these issues and give the message loudly and very clearly as to what is expected within a fair and decent society. No Australian should feel under threat of abuse, be spat on, be assaulted or have their synagogues or private property abused just because they happen to be Jewish. As Australians, we pride ourselves on democracy and its fundamental freedoms. Most of all it means that we have to uphold the rule of law and guarantee that there is a right to freedom for every citizen in this nation without fear or favour. 
It seems to me that intolerance as a global struggle is exacting a requirement that we not vilify people for who they are, taking precise action and guaranteeing punishment for evil deeds, not just because they happen to resemble someone else. I am proud to give my full personal support to the Jewish community in Australia. It is far easier to fall on the negative side of the ledger, to look for those things that are different and to continue to espouse the negative things in order to demonise people on the basis of their religious beliefs or characteristics. We also need to keep in mind that, whilst we as a nation have led the way in many respects on human rights and stamping out racism, discrimination and anti-Semitism, it comes back to the fact that these values which we promote so openly and dearly as part of what makes up the character of Australia ought not be deserted in these difficult times. It is times like these when we call upon those values to remind ourselves that Australia as a nation has certainly been there to support Israel and the Jewish people time and time again. With recent world events, there is no question that these things ought not continue in the way that they have.
In many respects, we have to give leadership in a country with people from over 140 different cultural backgrounds. It is always going to be a difficult question of how to share power. It is quite problematic in practical terms because the wishes of the dominant culture will always take precedence. It puts an onus on us. This is coupled with the lack of understanding that many people have about other cultures and the potential for fear and resentment. This is what has been shown in the political debate over the past four years. However, saying that, I believe many Australians from all walks of life do appreciate the value of difference. It is important that we as a community and as political leaders spread the message of tolerance—but much more than that, understanding. We also, as political leaders in this country, have to lead Australians to move beyond tolerance towards a more united Australia when we see these things being acted out within our own communities, whether that be in New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania or any other state or territory in this country. Unfortunately, there are many examples of intolerance that have plagued our society. In recent times this has been especially visible against Jewish Australians, and I think we ought to be mindful of that.
Finally, whilst much of the question of anti-Semitism is driven by world events and the politics of the Middle East, that ought not detract us from making a commitment to ensuring that lasting peace and reconciliation are achieved. If you go by the polls that were conducted last year, the majority of ordinary Israelis and Palestinians were keen to move forward and start developing a way of being able to cooperate with each other. We have an obligation to support those processes. Most of all where violence is occurring, violence itself will not justify the outcome. It ought to be condemned and, if that leads to anti-Semitic behaviour, we ought to condemn that too. It does not contribute to a cohesive national society.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Anti-Semitism</title>,Matters of Public Importance,10,1,speech
"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2004-03-22,"—I rise this afternoon to support the remarks of my friend Senator Mason, who has made the case against anti-Semitism and the cultural mainsprings of contemporary anti-Semitism with his customary eloquence and moral passion, and those of Senator Stephens. The first point that must be made is that this is a bipartisan debate. The co-sponsors of this matter of public importance—Senator Mason and Senator Stephens—represent the mainstream of Australian politics from both sides.  
Bipartisanship on this issue has a long history. From the point of view of our friends the opposition, we can trace it back to the distinguished role played by Dr Evatt. As President of the United Nations General Assembly, he was instrumental in the creation of the state of Israel in 1949. Bipartisanship continues to this day in the policies of the government and the opposition and also within the parliament in the contributions in the other place of Mr Pyne, the member for Sturt, and Mr Danby, the member for Melbourne Ports, in maintaining and fostering friendly relations between the parliamentarians of Australia and Israel.
This debate comes at a time of growing concern among Jewish people in Australia that anti-Semitism is on the rise and that that global trend is evident here. It is time for us in this parliament to reaffirm our commitment to two fundamental principles: that racism has no place in our political culture and that violence has no place in our political culture. It is also time to say that, while anyone is free to criticise any particular policy of the government of Israel, legitimate criticism must never be allowed to become a camouflage, a pretext or an excuse for attacks upon the Jewish people themselves. Alas, with alarming frequency in the recent past, that is what has been happening.
Senator Mason cited many instances of the emergence of that phenomenon in Europe. Anti-Semitism has become a new variety of political correctness. It has begun to take its place among a ghastly melange of fashionable postures along with anti-Americanism, antiglobalism, the kind of Arabist romanticism popularised by Edward Said, and a disgusting amoralism which elevates the Arab terrorist—commonly described in even the mainstream media by the sanitised description of `suicide bomber'—to the role of martyr: the latest bogus hero in the grisly pantheon of radical chic. Pause for a moment to think of the ideologisation of language that the description `suicide bomber' implies: as if the most relevant fact about those who cold-bloodedly murder and maim countless innocent civilians—men, women and children—is that they take their own life too.
This debate comes upon the heels of an international conference on anti-Semitism, which took place in Montreal last week. In his keynote address to the conference Professor Robert Wistrich, the director of the international centre for the study of anti-Semitism at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, addressed this issue and, in particular, the convergence of anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism, which he pointed out were initially two distinct ideologies. Today, however, while the convergence is not complete, the rhetoric of anti-Zionism has become one of the most powerful vehicles of anti-Semitism. Professor Wistrich said:
Such anti-Zionism is fundamentally discriminatory in negating even the possibility of a legitimate Jewish nationalism while idealising the violence nihilism of the Palestinian national movement. The anti-globalist crusaders against—
Israel—
regularly justify the terrorism, jihadism and anti-Jewish stereotypes to be found in Islamic fundamentalism. For most of the Western left, Palestinians can only be victims. Hamas bombers are militants engaged in legitimate resistance. They are never perpetrators of any crimes or responsible for their actions. Only Israel is to blame.
...	...	...
This world-view has penetrated the mainstream debate to the point where 60 per cent of Europeans regard tiny Israel as the greatest threat today to world peace. 
Anti-Zionism is not only the historic heir of earlier forms of anti-Semitism. It is also the lowest common denominator between anti-thetical political trends in Europe and the Middle East—the only point on which they can agree. It is a bridge between the left, the right and the militant Muslims; between the elites, including the media, and the masses; between the church and the mosque; between an increasingly anti-American Europe and an endemically anti-Western Arab-Muslim Middle East; a point of convergence between right-wing conservatives and left-wing radicals and a connecting link between the generations. 
Anti-Zionism is no longer an exotic collection of radical chic slogans that somehow survived the debacle of late 1960s counter-culture. It has become an exterminationist, pseudo-redemptive ideology in the Middle East which has been re-exported to Europe with devastating effect.
And not just to Europe. Jeremy Jones, the President of the Executive Council of Australian Jewry—whose presence in the gallery I acknowledge this afternoon—wrote in the current issue of TheReview:
There were a number of articles published and speeches given—
in Australia—
over the past year on the seeming acceptability of antisemitism by significant sections of the political left which wear their claims of anti-racism on their sleeves. It is worth noting that antisemitism mouthed by people who are seen to be part of a broad left or progressive segment in Australia seems to escape the censure that is not only due but which comes automatically to racism voiced by people perceived to be conservative or right-wing.
...	...	...
The exact relationship between anti-Jewish rhetoric and racist violence directed at Jewish individuals and Jewish institutions is not always certain. It would be ridiculous to suggest, however, that there is no connection between incitement and action.
We see that phenomenon in Australia today with the rise in the number of violent acts against Jewish Australians from an average of 279 in the period 1909-2002 to 481 incidents in 2003. The link between the language which gives cultural respectability to, and thereby extends the bounds of political acceptability of, anti-Semitism, and the outcome—violence against our Australian Jewish citizens—is impalpable but distinct. It is for us, the senators and members of this parliament, to denounce it to the echo.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Anti-Semitism</title>,Matters of Public Importance,10,1,speech
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2004-03-22,"—I support this discussion on anti-Semitism as a matter of public importance and I do so unashamedly as a member of the Australian Left. We have heard so much claptrap spoken today that I think it is appropriate we get a balance in this discussion. What we have heard today is, I am afraid, claptrap from a group of people who now unfortunately pass for what is left of the Left of the Liberal Party, and that is a measure of how their position has deteriorated in recent times.
I take the view, unashamedly, that anti-Semitism, like all other forms of racism, must be unequivocally condemned. Anti-Semitism is one of the most ancient forms of racial vilification and one which has been deeply ingrained within our culture throughout time. People might well ask: why is it necessary to move a proposal to discuss an issue like this in a country such as this about something which the majority of Australians would have no time for? It is necessary, unfortunately, because this country has become so blase about the stereotypes that are so often presented, as we have heard this afternoon.
We have a situation where we must state strongly and clearly that Australia will not tolerate racial hatred of any kind and that, if ignored, it can all too easily take root in this country and grow like a noxious weed. In other times and other places we have seen that lunatic minorities, when they are ignored, become powerful majorities. Small liberties have been taken away from people first, only to become large-scale programs of dehumanisation. Our outrage at such developments can diminish in increments until we do not see them as being wrong anymore or we claim that we do not see them at all. We must always be on guard against such numbness. 
Eric Hobsbawm—yet another great left-wing historian, and a Jew—in his book The Age of Extremes highlights this very dilemma. He says that the impersonal nature of prejudice allows acceptance of otherwise repugnant behaviour. He states:
Hardworking German bureaucrats, who would certainly have found it repugnant to drive starving Jews into abattoirs themselves, could work out the railway timetables for a regular supply of death-trains to Polish extermination camps with less sense of personal involvement. The greatest cruelties of our century have been the impersonal cruelties of remote decision, of system and routine, especially when they could be justified as regrettable operational necessities.
So, while the public servant or the politician can be the instrument of racism, they can also be an instrument for its rejection. It is our duty as public figures to ensure we remain highly attuned to anti-Semitic and racist developments within our community. We must defend the values of a humane political culture. We must institutionalise tolerance and acceptance of diversity to ensure that the reverse, the institutionalisation of cruelty, does not happen.
This is at the core of multiculturalism and, for me, this is also at the core of social democratic values. Sadly, we have seen within this country, as we have seen across the Tasman, a growing tendency through our public dialogue to accentuate xenophobia and racial stereotyping and to play upon people's insecurities. While it may seem easy to stand here and condemn what is obviously wrong—that is, the vilification of people based on race, religious or ethnic grounds—it is always important that we do condemn it. It is frighteningly easy for public leaders to exploit the politics of race and resentment, to play upon fears of the other, to demonise the outsider: in short, to undermine the principles of democracy. It is important that in supporting this discussion Australia's political leaders affirm their refusal to exploit the politics of race. Wherever fear and suspicion exist in the community, it is our role not to kindle such flames but to extinguish them decisively. Not only must we condemn those who vilify and persecute but we must also be prepared to make amends for those wrongs and to offer support and, where necessary, refuge.
The discussion is timely and it is appropriate in the current environment, as the devastating actions of minorities have created fear and division and strengthened our racial and religious stereotyping. When the federal parliament condemns anti-Semitic racism, I hope it will remind all citizens that the hatred of people—any people—because of their culture and their religion is unacceptable in this country. We must recognise that religious fundamentalism, which dehumanises other people by pitting them as inferior and wrong, allows adherence to hate and false persecution with a clear conscience. Not only must we recognise that those who adhere to religious beliefs or practices are entitled to their views but we also have to recognise we do not have to support religious fundamentalism. We must also recognise that fundamentalism is not restricted to any one religion.
This discussion is particularly timely because there has been an alarming increase in the number of anti-Semitic attacks in Australia and elsewhere in the last few years. Jewish organisations, such as the Anti-Defamation Commission, have documented these attacks against Jewish communities, synagogues and individuals in Australia. Intimidation, violence and the murder of Jews have increased in Europe, which I think we have all drawn attention to. We have seen that situation in Turkey and France. There has been an exponential rise in anti-Semitism in eastern Europe, particularly since the break-up of the Soviet Union, where a range of tribal hatreds, violence, neo-nationalist actions and fascist and authoritarian movements have re-emerged under the dubious name of `free speech'. I remind Senator Mason that many of those involved also proclaim to support the free market and US foreign policy. 
In Russia there have been several reported cases of the re-emergence of that dreadful medieval disease, the bubonic plague—something we thought had gone forever. Anti-Semitism, in my judgment, can be likened to such a disease—insidious, contagious and deadly. It seems strange that both have re-emerged in the wake of the collapse of political order and in an environmental vacuum of public political morality. Muslim communities have also pointed out that they feel under considerable pressure as a result of racism—and in this country as well. I remind the Senate that historically it was the Catholic Church that embedded anti-Semitism in Western culture centuries ago. During the Middle Ages many Jews were forced to flee persecution and undertake conversions. They were subject to numerous pogroms at the hands of the Inquisition. They found refuge in Muslim communities.
So anti-Semitism predates the Balfour Declaration. Sadly, today vilification and violence against Jews are more commonly associated with opposition to the modern state of Israel. There is no doubt that some anti-Israeli activism, particularly in Europe, is inherently anti-Semitic. However, I certainly do not support the proposition that all criticism of Israel is anti-Semitic. Just as multicultural societies encourage a diversity of people and beliefs, a democratic society also encourages a diversity of opinion. For all its flaws, Israel is essentially a democratic society. It is a society with a vibrant array of dissenting groups and voices from both the Left and the Right. Many of these voices, including Jewish ones, are highly critical of the current Israeli government's policies and can hardly be accused of being anti-Semites.
Similarly, non-Jewish voices in Israel, the Arab world and elsewhere are critical of Israel and cannot automatically be condemned as anti-Semitic. It should be remembered that Zionism itself grew up within the socialist movement. I do not believe that the Left, particularly in Australia, is the traditional home of anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism. A basic commitment to human rights and social democracy must allow for a critical examination of the record of any state, including Israel. I say that having had the benefit of participating in two delegations, where I saw the Golan Heights from both sides of the border and the Lebanese border from both sides. Therefore, I can say with some authority that, as a critic of the current Israeli government's policies, I condemn the demonisation of the state of Israel and the Jewish people. Racist and anti-intellectual words of attack on Israel as a state and on the Jews as a people only give succour to those who try to justify physical attacks on Jewish communities as political acts. They have no place in a constructive debate about securing a peaceful settlement between Israel and its neighbours.

"McGauran, Sen Julian",NATS,2004-03-22,"—That was what was left of the leftovers of the Left. I wish to add my support to the matter of public importance being debated today. Its importance to the Senate can be gauged by the fact that it is supported by both sides of the house—a rare if not unique event for such debates in our Australian parliament. But the reason for this debate is good and timely. The motion we are debating today in essence calls upon the Senate to support an unequivocal condemnation of anti-Semitism. 
As has been said many times before, Australia is one of the great multicultural societies in the world. We house 100-plus different nationalities and in the main live in a harmonious and tolerant society. Moreover, we have avoided the open ethnic wars so prevalent in so many parts of the world. Nevertheless, regrettably, like all countries, we have had to fight back strong elements of anti-Semitism and violent reaction against Jewish institutions. In politics we are only too aware of the fluctuating influence of the extreme Right and Left political groups—mad and racist groups such as the LaRouche society, the League of Rights, the Citizens Electoral Council and so on. Now there is a new element with the extreme Islamic fundamentalists. All these groups are organised and resourced against the Jewish race.
The proven way to stem their flow of hatred and lies is to stand up publicly against them. The tactic of ignoring such madness rarely works. It is necessary to bring information and good argument to an often uninformed but not naive public. This is how you silence and turn the tide on such racism. While Australia has a proven record in race relations, history shows the fragility of human rights when a society is under pressure or attack. History has shown us that it is so easy to single out a scapegoat for society's problems. It would be so easy now for the anti-Semites to say that the war on terror is all the fault of the Jewish occupation of Israel—the illegitimacy of Israel—and that the threat of terror upon Australia would go away if we stopped supporting the Jews. This is false. It is a way of seducing people to anti-Semitism, and that is why we need to stand up in this forum and speak against this pathological propaganda. This seduction, which Australia must avoid, has regrettably taken root in Europe. There is a strong element of anti-Semitism rising within Europe which, given our culture and our economic and political links with Europe, could easily influence this country unless we remain aware.
Europe has a long and shameful history of anti-Semitism, an undercurrent of which seems to remain. The new anti-Semitism employs images not too different from those of the past. It condemns the Jews as controlling the world's only superpower, the United States, and occupying the criminal and illegitimate state of Israel. Europe has confessed to a recent and worrying rise in anti-Semitism, in particular in France. On 19 February this year in Brussels, the President of the European Commission made an address outlining the grave concern of the commission and the European Union regarding the rise of anti-Semitism in Europe. The president said:
We do see vestiges of the historical anti-Semitism that was once widespread in Europe. We do see attacks against synagogues, desecration of Jewish cemeteries and physical assaults on Jews.
The president called upon member states and the European Union's human rights agency to draft measures and proposals to combat this rise in anti-Semitism. At the international level, the president urged the United Nations General Assembly to adopt a resolution on anti-Semitism. However, it is in some parts of the Middle East, in the Arab world, that anti-Semitism takes on its most obsessive and hateful form.
The attack on the Jewish person goes beyond the legitimate debate on the policies of the state of Israel. It occurs daily through many of the Arab newspapers, weekly and monthly magazines and television. Television serials depicting Jewish monsters are shown regularly. The hatred and the lies about the Jews begin in the education system. This horrific mass propaganda is not challenged by the authorities; rather, it is promoted by them. It seems the only link these mostly Middle Eastern dictatorships have with their oppressed and poverty-stricken people is the promotion of an enemy at the gate, which is the Jew. I am sure this institutionalised hatred is a strong reason why these countries have not modernised. 
I saw this anti-Semitism at work when I visited a prominent Middle Eastern country nearly two years ago, just prior to the war in Iraq. Because Australia was part of the coalition of the willing, my delegation received access to the highest political and academic authorities. There was rarely an occasion that leading authorities did not take the opportunity to attack Israel and Jews. On one occasion, a leading academic absurdly blamed the Jews for September 11. This was a lie that permeated the society unchecked. With this in mind I support the sentiments of the motion that encourages Australian ambassadors and other officials engaged in bilateral contacts with other countries to use their influence to oppose and to counter anti-Semitic expressions and to promote all possible efforts at fostering tolerance and community harmony.
I conclude by supporting the part of the motion that condemns all manifestations of anti-Semitism in Australia as a threat to the freedoms that all citizens should enjoy equally in a democratic society and commits the parliament to take all possible concrete actions at a national level to combat this threat to our peaceful and diverse nation. I urge the Senate to support this matter of public importance.

"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,2004-03-22,"—by leave—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
	At last, the free trade agreement arrives in the Senate. That gives the Senate a chance to have formally before it the documents concluded in these negotiations. It also enables the committee which the Senate in its wisdom has appointed to review the FTA to have those documents formally before it so it can conduct its inquiry. There is a question, though: do we in fact have the final document? I have just asked for, and the Clerk has just handed me, the documents tabled by the government. Those documents are headed `Draft, subject to legal review for accuracy, clarity and consistency, March 1, 2004'. That legend has appeared at the masthead of the documents that the government has provided publicly. It seems that what we have here is not the final document concluding a free trade agreement between two nations, Australia and the United States; rather, it is a draft of that final document.
This document is still subject to continuing legal review. What is on the public record is not the black-letter terms of what would be ultimately concluded between these two countries; rather, it is a draft version of that. Given that this agreement was concluded a month or more ago, it raises the question: what changes may occur between the draft and the final document? What will the significance of those changes be? I accept the words of the department that these are minor matters and there will not be very much change, but often on small things great consequences depend. If the changes are minor, the implications of those changes need to be properly assessed. 
Mr Acting Deputy President, I take the opportunity now, through you, to put a question to the minister who tabled these documents, which maybe government speakers can answer: can the Senate be given a clear date by which the final document setting out the exact terms of the agreement that this country would want to enter into with the United States will be available for our consideration?
This document is a weighty tome. It comprises over 1,000 pages, 23 chapters, four annexes and around 50 side letters on matters pertinent to the negotiations. It contains a broad range of issues, including tariffs, agriculture, manufacturing, health, telecommunications, intellectual property, labour issues and environmental matters. To implement the FTA the government says it will need to make a small number of legislative changes—that is, bills will come to this chamber to amend the existing law to make real the commitments entered into in the draft document we have before us. If the Senate or the House declines to pass those bills, or any part of them, or seeks to amend them then the whole of the agreement is suspended and may not come into effect. The government has indicated to us that it wants the legislation arising from this agreement to be implemented in time to enable the FTA to come into force before 1 January next year. 
I have been appointed as Chair of the Senate Select Committee on the Free Trade Agreement between Australia and the United Sates of America. We will now proceed to meet and review these documents. I can promise the Senate that we will go about our task thoroughly and fully. Australians need to know all the implications and they need to know them fearlessly and frankly. They need a proper objective survey of all those implications. Trade agreements are not just agreements between countries; they deeply affect the internal economics of a nation. They deeply affect the industry organisation and arrangements—what is competitive and what is not. They affect cultural values and they affect social issues—for example, if people are displaced from work in one sector, will there be jobs for them in another sector and how will they obtain the relevant skills to make themselves eligible for that employment? These important questions arise from trade agreements and they need to be examined in some detail. The inquiry will do that.
The government has made a number of statements—and I will canvass a couple of them now—which cause us to pause. This government does not have a good record in telling the truth to the Australian people about matters of great importance. I say that honestly, hand on heart, because I chaired the `children overboard' inquiry. That inquiry found that ministers had in fact lied—and I use that word advisedly because it is a finding of the report—to the Australian people about what had occurred. We found the same with the elusive question: where are the weapons of mass destruction? When the government says, hand on heart, that these things are true, we need to stop, pause and examine to see whether or not the facts justify that claim. 
The government claims that this is a once in a lifetime opportunity to secure a trade agreement with the United States. That is one of the statements it has made. The reality is that, over the past 20 years, Australian governments have negotiated a trade deal with the US on at least four other occasions. On those occasions it was decided Australia's broad economic and trade interests would not be well served by a bilateral trade agreement with the United States. We have heard from the government that this is a free trade agreement. The words `free trade' are bandied about with considerable frequency. In reality, this is not a free trade agreement. The deal does not give rise to free trade in agriculture. It excludes sugar. It takes 18 years to reduce tariffs on beef. It maintains quotas on dairy products and imposes safeguard measures on beef and horticultural products. The NFF said: 
This is not a free trade agreement and it fails to secure open access for Australian agriculture, but it offers improvement in access for some farm products. 
The government claims the deal will generate significant benefits for our manufacturing sector. It is instructive to know that, when the Minister for Trade was asked at the National Press Club shortly after the conclusion of the agreement, `What will the impact be on Australia's trade deficit with the United States by the implementation of this agreement? Will it widen or will it narrow?' he could not answer that question.
It is instructive to know that the government cannot now look the Australian public in the eye and say what the economic value of this agreement is. They have concluded this agreement and after signing on the dotted line that they are committed to it, they are now undertaking economic modelling to see what the value is. One would have thought that there would have been some ongoing modelling to ascertain the value of the agreement before the government committed the country to signing it. If the value is not great, there may well be justification for asking the government to go back and negotiate harder and better to achieve something more worth while for the Australian community. If the agreement, in fact, exacerbates our trade deficit, widens the gulf between us and the United States and makes us an importer rather than an exporter of anything substantial, maybe then there would be a justification for looking at it in greater detail.
What are the benefits for the manufacturing sector? The government claims that they are considerable. That claim will be thoroughly assessed. I point out now, though, that the rules of origin to determine whether Australian exports can benefit from reduced US tariffs may be so restrictive that they deny preferential access to many Australian products because those products may have in them, according to the new rules of origin, too many New Zealand, Asian or European inputs.
The government claims our sugar industry is no worse off because of this deal. The sugar industry never got anything out of this deal and by doing this deal, we may well have blighted the chances of the sugar industry getting anything out of a World Trade Organisation negotiation, in which case the sugar industry will be considerably worse off. The government claims that this deal is a big win for the Australian services sector. That is a claim that we will thoroughly test. The government claims that this deal opens up the US federal and state government procurement market to Australian firms. We know that only 27 states of the US union have signed this deal, so it does not open the procurement market for the whole 50 states. We know that, when the US did a deal with Chile, over 37 states signed on. California has not signed on for Australia, so the value of this deal is another matter to be examined.

"Ferris, Sen Jeannie",LP,2004-03-22,"—It is with a great deal of pleasure that I rise to speak at the tabling of this quite historic free trade agreement that has been negotiated with the United States of America. I take this opportunity to applaud the outstanding work of our Minister for Trade, Mr Mark Vaile, and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade officials who produced the 1,100-page text of the free trade agreement in absolutely record time. 
The Free Trade Agreement between Australia and the United States of America will link our economy with the strongest, the biggest and the most robust economy in the world, an economy which, at almost $10 trillion, is one-third of the world's GDP and a market of more than 280 million customers, and we have the same population as Los Angeles County. How fortunate are we as a country to have the opportunity to negotiate such a historic agreement with the United States. Not only is the United States the world's largest and most innovative economy but also it is one of the fastest growing. Over the last decade the United States grew at 3.3 per cent, which is faster than both Europe and Japan. It is without doubt in Australia's long-term national interest to be much more closely integrated with the US economy.
More than 97 per cent of our manufactured exports to the United States, worth $5.8 billion last year, will become duty free from day one of the free trade agreement. I am not sure whether Senator Cook actually recognised that in his contribution a few moments ago: 97 per cent of our manufactured exports to the United States, worth $5.8 billion, will be duty free from day one. What an opportunity for the manufacturers and the exporters of this country. I see my colleague Senator Ian Macdonald sitting in the chamber. As he has pointed out on a number of occasions in answers to questions, more than 66 per cent of the agricultural tariffs in the United States will reduce to zero from day one of this agreement. This number will increase by another nine per cent in the following four years. So 75 per cent of the agricultural tariffs in the United States will reduce to zero within four years of this agreement having been signed.
I would like to mention some of the benefits to my home state and yours, Mr Acting Deputy President Ferguson, of South Australia, and how the free trade agreement, if it is supported in this place, will affect our state from 1 January next year. Under the FTA, from day one the United States will remove all tariffs on automotive products. So exports to the United States auto market, worth $538 million for passenger vehicles in 2002, will grow very significantly. Let us not forget that the statistics provided by the Federation of Automotive Parts Manufacturers, the industry association of component manufacturers, show that total sales in 2001 for the South Australian component industry were worth more than $1.48 billion, with the local content in Australian made cars now at about 80 per cent. So a very significant change will occur in our automotive industries in our home state of South Australia, Mr Acting Deputy President. For Mitsubishi and Holden, two of South Australia's most important employers and export earners, the immediate elimination of the 25 per cent tariff on light commercial vehicles means that very soon we could see a South Australian built Holden utility joining the South Australian built Monaro on United States roads.
It is not only the automotive industry in South Australia that will benefit. Our seafood industry, which is already a very significant export success in the United States, is set to grow exponentially as a result of the proposed free trade agreement. The South Australian tuna industry alone contributes $384 million to Australia's gross food revenue per annum. That is a very significant figure from our relatively modest city of Port Lincoln. Under the proposed free trade agreement, Australian seafood exports to the United States will become tariff free immediately. How significant is that. The removal of a 35 per cent tariff on canned tuna will give producers in Port Lincoln, South Australia, access to the $650 million US market. What an extraordinary opportunity for a small town like Port Lincoln. 
Russ Neal, the CEO of the Australian Seafood Industry Council, welcomed the free trade agreement and said that `these tariff cuts will bring significant relief to our seafood industry. The removal of the tariff alone is worth $20 million in the first year'.
—That's fantastic.
—What a fantastic opportunity for our seafood exports to the United States. I want to turn to the wine industry, again in our home state of South Australia, Mr Acting Deputy President. One of our best-known exports is wine. Whether they are from the Barossa, the Clare Valley, the McLaren Vale or the Coonawarra regions, our wine labels are now recognised around the world. In 2002 South Australian wine exports were valued at $1.4 billion, up 21 per cent on the previous year. By 2002, 75 per cent of all Australian wine exports originated from South Australia. Tariffs on this very important export to the United States will be phased out over the next 11 years. A number of pieces of material used by winemakers come from the United States and there will be benefits there as well, particularly the import of stainless steel machinery for winemaking. I am advised that wine consumption in the United States is set to increase and so, at a time when lucrative markets are set to expand, wine producers will be able to access them unhindered by the old tariff barriers—another great benefit for South Australia.
But wait, there is more. Our agricultural producers will also gain significantly from the free trade agreement tabled in the Senate this afternoon. Our food industry is worth $9.4 billion per annum and is targeted to reach $15 billion by 2010. Our processed beef exports contribute 23 per cent, or $433.3 million, to South Australia's gross revenue. Under the free trade agreement our Australian beef producers will have access for an additional 15,000 tonnes of beef in year 2, increasing to 70,000 tonnes by the 18th year of the free trade agreement. In the last year the South Australian horticultural industry expanded by over 100 per cent, and horticulturalists are also set to benefit from the free trade agreement. There will be immediate tariff elimination on many horticultural products—including oranges, mandarins, strawberries, tomatoes and cut flowers—that are grown in South Australia. What a great opportunity for South Australia this free trade agreement is.
I, like Senator Cook, am looking forward to examining in more detail the issues contained within the free trade agreement during the deliberations of the Senate select committee, which is set to begin its hearings very soon. But it would be an absolute tragedy if Australia squandered such a historic opportunity to enter into an agreement that will provide massive benefits to our economy and to my home state's—South Australia's—economy for many years to come.",SENATE,<title>DOCUMENTS</title>,<title>Australia-United States Free Trade Agreement</title>,Documents,11,1,speech
"Ridgeway, Sen Aden",AD,2004-03-22,"—I rise today to speak to the tabling of the long-awaited text of the Free Trade Agreement between Australia and the United States of America, which is now before the parliament and is being scrutinised by various committees. The deal has been done; what remains now is to determine whether or not it is truly in Australia's national interest. This massive document, of Sydney White Pages proportions, contains within it the key to our economic, social and cultural future. That is a sobering thought, given the complexity of the detail that we have to go through. It is incumbent upon the Senate, nevertheless, to be very thorough and to carefully scrutinise every aspect of this deal. The Democrats are committed to this process. 
First, I would like to turn briefly to comments made by US Trade Representative Robert Zoellick that were recently reported in the Australian. They speak volumes about exactly what sort of deal we have here. Mr Zoellick spoke proudly about what a great deal this was for America and how they had resisted Australia's pleas for even a little more access:
And we have an 18-year phase-out that Prime Minister Howard personally was pushing to get lowered, which we didn't lower. And it actually should work well with our industry ... because we only increased the quota for manufactured beef.
The article also referred to the following comments:
On dairy products, Mr Zoellick sounded especially pleased, using irony to call the Australian increase “huge” and trumpeting the fact that Canberra had been unable to end the tariff protection for US dairy farmers. “And, frankly, in terms of dairy, I think we've increased our quota—didn't touch the tariffs one bit—the huge amount of about maybe $30 or $40 million a year.”
These remarks are quite extraordinarily boastful. It is more than embarrassing; the fact that the Prime Minister made a personal appeal and was rejected, and the Americans are boasting about it, is particularly humiliating for this country—most of all the government. As we are all aware, there have also been rumours that DFAT officials advised the government to walk away from the deal in its current form. Yet this government, desperate to cement its relationship with the USA, decided to go for it anyway—on whatever terms the Americans were prepared to offer.
It is also important to note that we remain at the mercy of the US Congress in respect of this trade deal. They get to vote on the deal; we do not. There has been all this effort and there have been so many huge concessions, and yet it might not be good enough for the US. There have been recent reports that various US sectors are lobbying against the ratification of the deal. Last Thursday the Australian reported that apparently American unions have now attacked the proposed FTA, arguing that it will cost jobs in the United States. Just yesterday the United States Ambassador to Australia, Tom Schieffer, admitted that getting trade deals through the US Congress was very difficult politically. It seems that there are very few people, even in America, who actually think that this deal is a good one.
The exact nature of the impact this deal will have on vulnerable sectors of the Australian economy will be uncovered through the process of the Senate select committee inquiry. I look forward to participating in that process and to uncovering the truth about how this deal will affect our economic, environmental, social and cultural future. I think that a number of issues need to be raised beyond that. It simply comes down to the fact that the national interest is about more than basic economic considerations. It is also about our social and labour standards, the preservation and improvement of our environment, and our national cultural identity. These must also be taken into account in any trade decision.
Wide-ranging trade agreements such as this FTA will have an impact on every facet of our life, and they must be assessed in terms of what has been won against what has been traded away. They will have a critical impact on our national sovereignty more generally. We have to be vigilant to ensure that the terms of the agreement do not affect our government's ability to regulate freely in the national interest in the future. These are all very important issues that have to be considered as part of the process. They are things that have been debated in the past few weeks. Mr Acting Deputy President Cherry, I have a number of other comments. I seek leave to incorporate my remaining remarks in Hansard. 
Leave granted.
The speech read as follows—
The Government has recently announced that the Centre for International Economics will carry out economic modelling and analytical work to assess the impact of this FTA.
As we all know, it was the work done by CIE consultants that provided the basis for the APEC Study Centre report commissioned by DFAT before negotiations for the FTA began.
This report has been widely criticised for using unrealistic assumptions and completely overstating the net gains to Australia arising out of the Free Trade Agreement.
Minister Vaile announced only last week that this economic modelling job would be put out to public tender.
We called on him at that point to ensure that a triple-bottom-line approach was used. The Senate passed a motion calling on the Government to do just that.
As it turns out, we should have saved our breath; there was no chance they were ever going to listen. The process had already begun; the DFAT press release indicates that the process was in train on 25 February.
The Minister misled the Parliament. The Government has tried to assure us all that they are willing to publicly prove the benefits of this deal, in an open and transparent manner.
How can we take this seriously when they lied about the process, and then awarded the contract to the same people who gave them the result they wanted last time?
If they lied about this, then how are we to believe their rhetoric about the benefit of the deal?
The deal appears to have some very serious shortcomings from an Australian perspective. While the Government says critical areas such as the PBS, Australian content in media, quarantine and foreign investment have been protected, these claims do not appear to be supported by the evidence in the text.
The Democrats have been on the record continually expressing our serious concerns about the impact of the deal on the PBS (including generic drugs), Australian culture and media, foreign investment, quarantine standards and the delivery of public services.
In closing, it is worth nothing that our trade deficit with the US is already massive. As was noted recently by Dr Elizabeth Thurbon and Professor Linda Weiss, Australia has long run a massive trade deficit with the US, which now stands at around $9 billion, and is the second-largest trade deficit with the US in the world.
The balance of this trade agreement—with negligible improvements for our highly competitive agricultural sector, and an opening up of a wide range of newer Australian industries—is likely to make this deficit even worse. As Dr Thurbon and Professor Weiss rightly point out,
“While the US has managed to keep its weakest industries effectively shielded from Australian competition, we have agreed to open our weakest industries to an onslaught of highly competitive US imports. Our IT, financial services, telecommunications, media, and pharmaceutical industries (just to name a few) will face intense competition from their more mature and cashed-up American counterparts.”",SENATE,<title>DOCUMENTS</title>,<title>Australia-United States Free Trade Agreement</title>,Documents,11,1,speech
"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2004-03-22,"—The text of the US-Australia free trade agreement that has been tabled in the Senate today is not an enjoyable read for those people who care about the public interest of Australia and protecting our services: for example, our Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme or our cultural industries. It is not even a good read for those people who want to have the gates of US protectionism opened up, as the government articulated going into this deal, for Australian farmers who want to get into the US marketplace. 
The Prime Minister said last week that this deal was a `no-brainer'. I agree with the Prime Minister. It is a no-brainer to want to protect our Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, which is widely recognised as one of the best mechanisms in the world for ensuring that people are able to access affordable medicines. It is a shame that this government in negotiating this agreement has not done so for the Australian people—and I will get into that later. I agree with the Prime Minister that it is a no-brainer to want to ensure that Australian libraries and education institutions are able to afford materials free from the imposition of US copyright laws that are designed to increase profits for US businesses in the arena. It is a shame the Prime Minister has let us down on this key and fundamental right as well.
It is a no-brainer to want to ensure that future Australian governments can regulate key areas of the economy and society, including health, education, water, postal, energy and environmental services. Again, the Howard government has let down Australia's national and public interest by ensuring in this agreement that future governments will not have the same capacity to regulate these essential public services as the current government has. The Greens believe that Australia needs to look again at our relationship with the United States and that this trade deal is an example of why we need to do that. We need to have a relationship with the United States that is based on mutual benefit and independence, instead of the craven ties fostered by this government that mean whatever the US government wants it gets. It is this sort of relationship with the United States that has led to Australia's involvement in an illegal invasion of Iraq that has made us less safe as a result.
Yesterday on television the US ambassador confirmed the views of many Australians, saying that this US-Australia free trade agreement is payback for Australia's involvement in the war on Iraq. The Australian people can say to this government, `Thank you for nothing.' We have got caught up in the quagmire of the ongoing occupation in Iraq, increasing the likelihood of Australia being attacked by terrorists and, in return, the US Congress—maybe—is going to create greater corporate fleecing of Australian industry and society through this US-Australia free trade agreement. What a great deal for the Australian public! Well, the Greens do not think so. We will, both in the parliament and around the community, be talking with Australians about the detail that is in this trade agreement that has been tabled today. We will be talking about issues like the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme.
US Republican senators have been talking about these issues, saying that the US trade deal signed with Australia is the first step in a campaign to raise global pharmaceutical prices and that the cost of Australian drugs will be changed under this agreement. This is what Republican senators are telling the US congress: the US has won in this free trade agreement with Australia. The senators told their committee that the Australian deal was a breakthrough that began the process of getting other countries to bear a greater share of drug company research and development costs. The US believe that they have cracked the great protection our Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme provides.
This is the opportunity for the Australian Senate to stand up and say, `We don't want that Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme to be undermined.' The Greens will be doing so in the Senate, and we hope that those other senators who have the opportunity to hear from the Australian public through the Senate inquiry about the detail of this agreement will join us in standing up for our Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, where this government has failed.

"Macdonald, Sen Sandy",NATS,2004-03-22,"—I present the report of the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee on the provisions of the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Bill 2003 and a related bill, together with the Hansard record of proceedings and documents presented to the committee.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the report.
Leave granted.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
The Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee presents its report on the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Bill 2003 and the consequential legislation. The purpose of the bill is to establish a new military rehabilitation and compensation scheme, which will come into effect when the bill is promulgated, which we anticipate to be on 1 July 2004. That is why there was some urgency in the legislation committee examining the legislation. The new unified scheme will cover all forms of military service and all types of military personnel for service from the date of its enactment. It replaces two existing acts, although these will continue to apply with respect to service before 1 July 2004. The unified approach amalgamates the military and civilian aspects of earlier legislation in recognition of the fact that the boundary between military and civilian engagements has become increasingly blurred in the ADF's recent deployments, a trend that is expected to continue. 
The bill has a strong focus on rehabilitation. This is consistent with the arrangements in the broader community but a departure from traditional practice, where the emphasis has been on compensation rather than rehabilitation, reflecting attitudes at the time the earlier legislation was developed when rehabilitation was not considered an option for most claimants. In addition to improved provisions for rehabilitation, the bill expands the range and level of benefits available to those with a service related injury or disease and to the dependants of those killed in service. Their choice of benefits is also expanded, with financial advice available to assist people to make the most of the opportunities presented to them by these choices. The Department of Veterans' Affairs and the Department of Defence held wide-ranging consultation during 2003 with organisations representing veterans and service members on an exposure draft of this bill. The legislation now before the parliament incorporates a number of changes suggested by these groups.
The Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee held three public hearings during its inquiry into the bill—in Perth, in Melbourne and in Canberra—and received submissions from major veterans and service organisations. Support for this legislation was high, although not universal. Tellingly, support was strongest among the organisations representing serving members, the people who will be directly affected by this legislation. It was weakest among veterans organisations, whose members will continue to be covered by the existing legislation and will not be affected by the bill.
The submissions and public hearings revealed significant levels of misunderstanding of some of the concepts underlying the bill. This was not surprising given the complexity of the legislation. These misunderstandings have given rise to some concerns with certain aspects of the legislation, such as the actuarial basis of some of the compensation payments. The committee considered that with a fuller understanding of these concepts, many of the concerns expressed to the committee will be allayed. Indeed, during the course of the inquiry a number of misconceptions were clarified, and those are detailed in the report to the satisfaction of the ex-service organisations which raised them. The bill provides equivalent or improved rehabilitation and compensation entitlements compared with the existing legislation. None of the bill's provisions is less beneficial, and this was recognised in the evidence and accounts for the generally high level of support for the legislation. On that basis the committee recommends that the Senate pass this bill.
Finally, I would like to thank my colleagues, especially Senator Bishop, the shadow spokesman for veterans' affairs—his commitment and understanding of the legislation is to be commended—and the committee secretariat, especially Mary Lindsay, who produced the report and had to grasp the extremely complex nature of this legislation. It was difficult because of the existing compensation legislation, which is difficult to understand. I note the number of people in the veterans community who have a point of view on changes to the existing legislation and the new legislation, and the passion with which they take part in public debate on the terms and conditions of their compensation and rehabilitation aspects of their life. The veterans community are good citizens and this legislation will continue to do the right thing by them. I commend the report to the Senate.

"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2004-03-22,"—I am pleased to speak to the report on the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee. This report is a live demonstration of the value that scrutiny brings to public policy formulation in this country. This is particularly the case with these military compensation bills, which are very complex and go to the heart of compensation policy for serving ADF personnel and veterans of the future. These bills represent possibly the greatest reform in this area since World War I. I will deal in more detail with that context when the second reading debate on this bill resumes later this week.
Today I would like to speak on the central issue of the committee's consideration—that is, the task of balancing a wide range of views within the veterans community. As mentioned in the report consultation, there was a major weakness in developing these bills. It needs to be understood that the ex-service community is indeed a very homogenous community. There is a very strong bond between members of that community regardless of the time or place of their service. They have all served their country and they take at face value those reassurances given by politicians that in times of strife they will be looked after. Ex-service organisations are determined to hold all members of parliament to that particular pledge.
Part of that bond is to help one another, particularly in times of adversity; another is to safeguard the traditional value of recognition of service. It is perfectly natural, therefore, for the ex-service community to have a deep and vested interest in this legislation. It must be said that, in the main, those interests are protected in this legislation. There is a dilemma, however. Circumstances change, as do conditions of service and the nature of our defence policy and the nature of deployments made pursuant to that policy. Witness, for example, the increase in more recent years in the number of peacekeeping forces being deployed to parts of the world. Modern policy must reflect such shifts, so the traditions preserved have to be relevant to modern service.
I will now return to my first point, on consultation. As expected, involvement by way of putting in submissions and giving evidence at public hearings was dominated by veterans organisations. Some brought to bear on all of the issues a very strong traditional values approach. They focused centrally on the protection of the values attached to warlike service. It must be said, though, that those views were not dominant; they centred on the current generation of Vietnam veterans, whose service does have unique characteristics. Those characteristics could be said to distinguish their service from all other service since World War II. This simply reflects the nature of that service. Certainly it was more dangerous than anything that has followed since. Their views are very relevant and must be respected without question. Others, however, put a broader view which represented more general experience within the services. 
It must be said that the prism through which most views were formed was that of the Veterans' Entitlement Act. Those expressing such views were more concerned with the operation of the Military Compensation Scheme—hence the committee's concern at the level of consultation with current serving personnel. After all, it is only those personnel who are going to be affected by these bills. The dilemma of the committee was therefore the same as that of the framers of this legislation. The current schemes have very different origins, but the best features of both were melded in this new proposal. Of course, agreeing on what is best involves considering perspectives of the kind I have been discussing. We are dealing with perceptions of relevance which have their origins in different eras. Those perceptions are held by different generations with different experiences and were formed at different times in our history. Inevitably, there are some who believe the bills go too far in modernising the approach to compensation. Others believe that too much of the past has been translated across. Thus, there were some very divergent views to be weighed by the committee.
Many issues, as the report accurately acknowledges, reflect concerns about a number of changes that appear to be making things tougher. For example, there is a more rigorous approach to the consideration of the consumption of alcohol, tobacco and drugs as causative of injury and disease. Injury resulting from disciplinary breaches and concealment of injury are also dealt with much more rigorously. Beyond that level of concern, however, a number of issues were examined in greater detail. These centred on that basic conflict about the traditional values attached to qualifying service. This policy had its roots in World War I and continued for World War II, Korea and Vietnam. It reflected the public commitment to provide special care for those who were prepared to put their lives at risk. Its modern equivalent, warlike service, has been declared by the current government for many deployments. I will not go into the arguments of relativity here. Suffice to say there has been considerable dilution of the standards attached to qualifying service in recent years. The main cause of this, it must be candidly admitted, is political pressure.
Further, remuneration provided is of a more generous standard than has been the case in past years. This is clearly based on a policy of the current government that it is preferable to reward risk through allowances up front than through differentials in compensation. However, this policy is not well articulated and is clearly not fully accepted by the veteran community. In fact, it could be said the policy is in a slow transition. Two key examples put to the committee illustrate this transition. One is the differential proposed in these bills for different lump sums to be paid to the widows of those killed in peacetime and in warlike service. The proposed differential is $60,000. The committee was persuaded by the majority view of ex-service organisations that this differential should be removed. The prime reason for this is that it is not considered possible to distinguish between the grief suffered by the loved ones of those killed in peacetime and those killed in warlike service. Another issue is the differential applied to impairment payments made for injury incurred during peacetime and while on warlike service. Here, the only beneficiary is the one injured. Respecting the view of those keen to retain the status of warlike service, the committee have not recommended any change. Thus, with reference to the dilemma, the committee have reached a balanced view. We support that approach.
Finally, the committee considered the matter of administrative review. Once again, two paths were proposed—depending on whether or not a compensation claimant had warlike service. The background to this is more confused. In the past, those with eligibility under the Veterans' Entitlement Act—which included those with peacetime service—could appeal to the Veterans' Review Board as well as to the AAT simply as a matter of efficiency, equity and streamlining. These issues were, however, fully addressed in November last year by the Senate Finance and Public Administration Legislation Committee. 
I will close my remarks on one point. This has been a worthwhile exercise, and public policy is much better off for the exercise. All ADF personnel and veterans can have a better sense that these issues have been fully canvassed. Not all will totally agree with the outcome, but that is a burden we as legislators carry. Good policy should always be the goal, but compromises are necessary when the climate is not right. That is called democracy, and this is democracy at work. My thanks go to the secretariat, who prepared a report which accurately reflects the evidence in a very difficult and somewhat arcane area of law. I will continue my remarks on the bills in more detail when the debate on the second reading resumes.
Question agreed to.",SENATE,<title>MILITARY REHABILITATION AND COMPENSATION BILL 2003</title>,"<title>Report of Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee</title>",Bills,15,1,speech
"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,2004-03-22,"—Before debate on the Workplace Relations Amendment (Termination of Employment) Bill 2002 [No. 2] was adjourned prior to question time, I had made mention of the fact that the government was relying on the corporations power of the Constitution rather than on the specific head of power—namely, the power for the prevention and settlement of industrial disputes. As I said, this legislation does not achieve—or does not even really attempt to achieve—the objectives that the government claims for it in the minister's second reading speech on the bill. What the government is doing is simply riding roughshod over the rights of the states when it comes to the regulation of industrial relations issues within the states.
We have had a dual system of industrial relations regulation in this country, as I said, since at least 1904. One of the great features of our industrial relations system, at both the federal and the state levels, is the respect for the role of the industrial commissions in conciliating and arbitrating on industrial issues, resolving problems at the workplace through a cooperative approach. But, where there is a need for the umpire to make a decision, the system has provided for that through arbitration. That principle has been followed by governments of all persuasions right through until, frankly, the election of the coalition government in 1996. As one who has had a long history of involvement in industrial relations issues prior to coming into this parliament, I have to say that even the Fraser government never went as far as this government has gone in trying to reduce the rights and entitlements of employees. Ministers such as Ian Viner and Ian McPhee, despite the fact that they certainly came from a conservative background that was critical of the role of trade unions in the industrial relations scene, respected that employees had rights, that unions had rights and that the commissions had the responsibility, ultimately, for resolving industrial relations issues. The government did not seek to impose itself constantly on the outcomes of the proper bargaining processes between workers and their employers.
But since Mr Howard became Prime Minister that has all changed. As I recall from his years in opposition, Mr Howard himself always had this reformist zeal to change the industrial relations system in this country and to change it forever to his way of thinking. That is what he set out to do and, as I said, that is why we have seen at least 50 pieces of industrial relations legislation brought before this parliament in the last seven or eight years. Many of them—indeed, most of them—were nothing more than attacks upon workers, trade unions and the industrial relations commissions, seeking to remove that important principle of independence. That is what is happening here. The government is taking away by legislation a right that the state commissions have had for many, many years. It is hypocritical for the government to claim that this will create harmony and a simpler system. Indeed, it will be more complex. 
Let me paint a picture. This bill, if passed, will mean that state jurisdictions—state industrial commissions, such as the New South Wales Industrial Relations Commission—will no longer be able to hear claims for unfair dismissal by employees of corporations in that state. If those employees are covered by a state award of the industrial relations commission, all of their wages and working conditions will continue to be regulated by the state industrial relations commission except for that area of unfair dismissal. You could have a situation, for instance, where there may be negotiations between a corporation and its employees, represented by a union or maybe not represented by a union. They are going through the negotiating process. Let us say there is a dispute, and let us posit—it is more than a possibility; I have seen it happen many times—that an employee or employees are dismissed. Suddenly the state industrial relations commission has no role. It then transfers automatically to the federal commission—notwithstanding that it may have been that the New South Wales Industrial Relations Commission was overseeing the negotiations and the whole process leading up to that dismissal. That is just one example; I can think of many, many situations where it will be far more complex. 
It cannot be argued that taking one element out of the employment contract—the element of unfair dismissal, which is effectively the termination of the contract—and out of the realm of the jurisdiction of the state commission, transferring it to the federal commission and leaving everything else under the auspices of the state commission is creating a simpler system. It is more complex.
The second reading speech sets out the government's real agenda. It says:
The Federal unfair dismissal law is generally less burdensome to employers and less destructive of employment growth than the State laws.
That is code for saying that it is easier to sack people under the federal unfair dismissal laws than it is under the state laws. I have always found it ironic that a government that wants to promote employment growth believes that the way you create it is by making it easier for employers to dismiss people. That is just total idiocy when considered as a proposition. It is simply illogical. The data shows that the highest level of employment growth in this country during the Keating and Hawke years in the various sectors of employment was in the small business sector. Throughout the whole period of the unfair dismissal laws regime that this coalition says was an impediment to employment growth, growth in small business employment was substantial. It was trending upwards all the time whilst employment in areas such as the public sector and large businesses was trending the other way. So the unfair dismissal laws were never really an impediment to employment growth.  
The second reading speech also states:
Even if this were not the case, it is self evident there would be advantages in having to deal with only one set of laws rather than several.
As I pointed out, that objective will not be achieved. Employees who are currently employed by corporations and regulated by state industrial awards or agreements have a simple system at the moment. They have one jurisdiction looking after all of their employment contract related issues. This proposal creates a situation where they will have two jurisdictions. That does not sound more simple; that sounds more complex.
I point to one other hypocrisy that is evident in the bill—that is, the draconian way in which it is being done. This legislation, if it is passed, at the stroke of a pen will remove the unfair dismissal laws from the state jurisdictions. Whatever happened to that great principle of choice that we are lectured about every day of the week by this government: there has to be choice in industrial relations; employees and employers have to have the opportunity to make choices—choices about whether they want an award, an industrial agreement or an AWA; choices about whether they want to be represented by a union or not represented by a union?
One of the choices that have existed throughout our history is the choice available to employers and employees to determine which area of industrial regulation they prefer. It is quite open for employers to seek to have their employees covered by the federal commission or the state commission. There is effectively no impediment that prevents an employer in just about every business in this country, except for certain categories of employees, from seeking to be covered by the federal jurisdiction. Similarly, they can be covered by the state jurisdiction. The way our law is structured is, if they are not covered by a federal award or agreement, they are effectively covered by the state award system by virtue of common rule regulation.
There are plenty of choices available but there is no choice in this legislation. There is no choice for the employee to be able to go to the commission that he has relied upon for regulating all of his other terms and conditions of employment to seek redress for an unfair dismissal. That will be removed totally if this bill is passed. Let us not have any more of these lectures from this government about the fundamental importance of the principle of choice because, when it comes to the area of unfair dismissal, there is no choice for the employee; there is really no choice for the employer either. If you are a corporation or small business incorporated in New South Wales or in the states covered by the state jurisdiction and the bill is passed, you will lose your choice as to what jurisdiction you wish to be covered under. I am not opposed to national uniformity but it should be brought about by cooperation, not coercion. (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Hutchins, Sen Steve",ALP,2004-03-22,"—It is with pleasure that I follow my colleague and fellow New South Wales senator Michael Forshaw in today's debate. This is the second occasion we have debated the Workplace Relations Amendment (Termination of Employment) Bill 2002 [No. 2]. I hope it goes the same way it did on the last two occasions—to the dustbin. Senator Forshaw articulated quite clearly and comprehensively that the reason this bill must be defeated is that, if it were carried into law, the state tribunal would set the day-to-day employment obligations of people, say, in my state yet the federal system would be used for unfair dismissals for these same people.
There are significant differences between the approach of the New South Wales legislation and the approach of the federal legislation. The most obvious is that one was drawn up by a progressive government; the other was drawn up by a regressive government. Nevertheless, the first difference is that within the New South Wales jurisdiction, which covers about 70 per cent of employees in New South Wales, there is the provision for statewide award settlements. That is not the case in the federal jurisdiction at all. These settlements can either be reached by agreement or be arbitrated. Currently there are a number of wage negotiations going on in the state of New South Wales to that effect. The second difference is that to be covered by the proposed federal legislation as a casual worker you would have to have been a casual for 12 months, rather than the six months required in the New South Wales jurisdiction. I will speak about casuals a little later in my contribution because that is something that we as a community need to start thinking about more seriously. 
The third difference between the New South Wales and the proposed federal legislation is what are called deemed employees. Under the New South Wales act there are certain groups of people who are deemed employees. The most outstanding, of course, are clothing outworkers, cleaners and building tradesmen. They are deemed employees because of the category of work that they conduct on behalf of their employers and the particular employment relationship they have with their employers. Probably the most exploited, underpaid and mistreated people in the working community are outworkers, an overwhelmingly large majority of whom are from non-English-speaking backgrounds. They are mainly from Asia and are mainly women.
The New South Wales jurisdiction has sought to deal with the difficulties of these workers by allowing them access to New South Wales tribunals, but nowhere in the proposed federal legislation is there any reference to this group or class of workers. In particular, the issue of clothing outworkers deserves the attention from the federal government that it has received in the state of New South Wales. As I say, under the New South Wales act, outworkers, cleaners and building tradespersons are deemed employees because of the nature of the employment relationship they have with their employer. The fourth difference is with respect to injured workers seeking to return to work. I am not aware whether there is any provision for injured workers in the proposed legislation before us this afternoon.
Let me reiterate those four points of difference with the New South Wales legislation: the provision for award settlements; that casuals are able to be reinstated after six months employment, not 12 months; that employees are deemed to be employees if they are outworkers, tradespersons and cleaners; and the particular category of employee concerning injured workers. 
Another difference that I am probably more familiar with, and which seldom gets mentioned by the government or speakers in this debate, although I have mentioned it before, is the other category of worker in the New South Wales jurisdiction that is not referred to here and the ability in that jurisdiction to deal with that category of worker—I say `category of worker'; lawyers might use a different term. I am referring to lorry owner-drivers—and Senator Ferris would be aware of this issue—or, as they are called in the New South Wales legislation, contract carriers. Those people, and they are predominantly men, have had the ability for nearly 25 years under the jurisdiction in New South Wales to be reinstated if they were wrongfully dismissed by their employer. 
This group of employees is required by their employer—the `principal contractor' as that person is referred to in the New South Wales legislation—to have a particular type, design and weight of vehicle. That vehicle has to be painted in company colours. That person has to be contracted by one company for whom their vehicle is painted. They are subject to the control and direction of the principal contractor and they can be, and have been, dismissed for any misdemeanour.  
Throughout the history of dealing with this matter in New South Wales there has been a bipartisan approach by the major parties in reforming the legislation to allow for this category of worker to be able to seek redress and justice if that is required. As I said, these men are required to paint their vehicles in particular colours. You have all seen them on the road—concrete trucks with Boral or Hymix painted on them and vehicles with TNT, Mayne Nickless, Toll or other major contractors' names painted on them. For all intents and purposes, you and I would not know the class of work that that person is contracted for by their principal contractor unless we asked them. They wear the uniform of the major company, their vehicle is painted in the major company's colours and they are also subject to the direction and control of the major company.
In chapter 6 of the New South Wales industrial relations legislation there has been for some time the provision for lorry owner-drivers or contract carriers to go to the New South Wales commission and seek to be restated if they believe that they have been unfairly dismissed. On a number of occasions in my previous occupation I went before those tribunals and argued on behalf of those people. Sometimes they were reinstated because they had been unfairly dismissed and sometimes they were not, because the judge made the decision that they had been dealt with properly. So in the New South Wales jurisdiction there is the ability to have this particular class or classification of worker dealt with on the issue of unfair dismissal. But it even goes further than that—under chapter 6 of the New South Wales legislation, this class of worker can go before the New South Wales Industrial Relations Commission and argue the case of unfair contracts. The worker has that recourse to a commission, which is not available to any other group of person in this category throughout the country as far as I am aware.
There are some glaring holes in this legislation. When people refer to termination of employment, they want consistency between federal and state jurisdictions, particularly my state of New South Wales. The ability of lorry owner-drivers or contract carriers to be reinstated and to have their contracts dealt with by a commission has been part of the New South Wales structure for nearly half a century and has been the subject of consensus amongst the major parties. In fact, it was only a few years ago, when there were disputes concerning the payment of goodwill, that legislation was introduced to the New South Wales parliament by the member for Auburn, Peter Nagle. The legislation was passed and allowed lorry owner-drivers to argue their cases for goodwill before Industrial Relations Commission judges in a tribunal set up by the New South Wales parliament. Once again that was as a result of consensus between the major parties. This was not a contest between the Labor and Liberal parties; this was seen to be sound public policy, and legislation was passed with goodwill from both conservative and Labor members of parliament. So there are two classes of workers that are not covered by either the New South Wales act or the proposed federal legislation. These are outworkers—probably the most mistreated, abused and exploited group of workers in the community—and lorry owner-drivers, who have been dealt with for over half a century under the jurisdiction of New South Wales. 
I now want to come back to the issue that concerns casual workers. Senators would be aware the Senate Community Affairs References Committee has just completed an inquiry into poverty and financial hardship. During that inquiry we had a significant number of submissions from men and women throughout the country who are casual employees. These are people who want to be permanently employed; they desperately want the opportunity to have a full-time permanent job, but it is not available to them. During the past 20 years the percentage of casual employees in the work force has increased from 12 per cent to 28 per cent. The rise has been more rapid in the last decade. People no longer have the opportunity for permanency that you and I, Mr Acting Deputy President Cherry, would have taken as a right when we were young men.
I want to take the chamber's time briefly to relate to senators what men and women around the country are experiencing. These people told their stories to the inquiry as it travelled around the nation. On 26 May in Sydney, Mr Leeman gave evidence to the inquiry. I will read out excerpts of this so that you can get an idea of what working life is like for people who are not in a strong bargaining position. I will say that again: this is what it is like for people who do not have a strong bargaining position. The federal government's proposed legislation is trying to make it even more difficult for them to have rights and some sort of dignity. Mr Leeman said:
I would like to start by briefly explaining a bit of my work history and then go through some of the issues that have come up over a period of time. I have worked for about four different labour hire companies and I have signed up to 12 over that period as well. With those four I have worked at six different workplaces over the last five years, and I have also had a couple of permanent jobs during that time as well. The things that I have been concerned about during that time as a labour hire employee are issues of occupational health and safety, of being able to know what my rights are as an employee—particularly I could not even get hold of the award that I am covered by—and also the quality of work, and obviously that leads to the quality of life as well: not having much control over the hours that I work and being forced to work a lot harder than I normally would because one is not quite sure when the work is going to come again.
He went on to say:
It is very hard to get information on what rates of pay we should be receiving and what loading and that sort of thing. When I was working at BHP for Skilled Engineering we were required to fill in our own time sheets. Unless you actually knew what rates of pay you should be receiving at different times of the day, over the weekend, award rates and so on—the different loadings—you did not receive them. There were a number of employees who did miss out because they did not know what those things were. It was very much up to each individual to go and get that information.
That is part of what Mr Leeman told the committee. I would now like to read out what Mr Spencer said when he appeared before the committee in Adelaide on 29 April last year. Mr Spencer said:
I am 54 years of age. I am a cleaner and an LHMU member. Until recently I worked at the Myer Centre. I had worked there for 10 years, through three different employers as the contracts kept on changing. About six weeks ago I was made redundant. I was one of 15 people who were retrenched when the contract changed. Twelve of us were over 40. We were cleaners with lots of experience. As a result of losing the job and of having three different employers over the 10 years that I worked on the one site, I have no long service leave, because each employer has committed it, but the long service leave is not portable. It makes life really difficult.
Around Australia the inquiry heard similar tales from men and women who are what we now call the working poor. These people are the ones that we should be paying attention to. We should try not to deprive them of the few rights that they already have. 
Mr Spencer has had three different employers in 10 years and he is over 40 years of age—that is the changing face of Australia's work force. As I said, 20 years ago about 12 per cent of the work force was casual and now it is 28 per cent. We have this scourge of labour hire agencies out there that provide people with no permanency whatsoever. God knows what is going to happen if this legislation is carried. Workers will have to be with their employers for 12 months before they have any rights. As Mr Leeman said, he has worked for a variety of labour hire agencies over a five-year period, but he will never actually qualify for benefits under this legislation, if it passes the 12-month rule, because he does not have one permanent employer. Mr Leeman and Mr Spencer are not working as accountants or in the finance or banking sectors. They are doing the jobs at the low end of the work spectrum—generally the low-skilled and low-paid jobs. I am very concerned about what has come out of the inquiry into poverty and financial hardship that you, Madam Acting Deputy President Knowles, and I have sat on over the last 12 months.
In summation, I cannot see any obvious practical reason why you would change the legislation as it stands in the various states. I have spoken to a number of employers on this issue, and they believe that there is no benefit in them being burdened with some cumbersome federal system when there is a workable and proper state system already in place. It has been proven that in a number of areas in New South Wales the legislation to look after classes of workers or employees has been changed with the consensus of the major parties. It has not been seen as an opportunity to play some sort of political game with people's lives. It has been done because it was sound, practical policy and because it was effective for those men and women and their employers in the areas in which they worked.
I have highlighted the significant differences between the New South Wales and federal legislation. I come back to the point that Senator Forshaw ended on: if this legislation is carried, an employee who claims unfair dismissal will be going down to William Street in Sydney to the federal commission but their terms and conditions and employment obligations will be set by another jurisdiction altogether. If that is the case, it is only commonsense to make sure that people are in one area together.
I mentioned earlier that I was concerned about the working poor. This is an opportunity to highlight to the Senate how that situation affects them. It would appear to me that, with the growth of casual employment in this country, particularly over the last 10 years, these men and women are missing out on the so-called economic miracle that we may be experiencing. These are the men and women who are getting the pointy end of the pineapple. They are really finding it tough, Madam Acting Deputy President, as you will recall from the evidence the committee heard throughout the country. These men and women told us how difficult it was for them to make ends meet. Let us not deprive them of any more rights than those we have already deprived them of by casualising the work force.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2004-03-22,"—I rise to speak on the Workplace Relations Amendment (Termination of Employment) Bill 2002 [No. 2]. The bill was introduced into the House of Representatives on 6 November 2003. It is identical to the Workplace Relations Amendment (Termination of Employment) Bill 2002, which was defeated in this house. The current bill is another piecemeal approach to industrial relations. The government seem to be wedded to having a piecemeal approach to industrial relations. 
I have said before in this chamber that this has been a golden opportunity for the government to talk to people about industrial relations and about any effective changes that they require. But the government seem quite unable not only to talk to but also to consult the states, employers, employees and unions about how to change the industrial relations system to one that might be fairer all round. What the government tend to do is try to divide people. They tend to be divisive, to be negative and to carp. Although they accuse us of that, I think the Liberal Party, along with the National Party, take a pre-eminent position in being the carpers on industrial relations.
The government fail to appreciate that industrial relations is about people. It is about people's lives, it is about their livelihoods and it is about their spending eight, nine or 10 hours—sometimes truck drivers spend 12 or more hours—a day performing for reward. In some instances that reward is not very much. In some instances workers are well rewarded. But the government fail to understand that there is a continuum of workers in both the state system and the federal system of industrial relations who have expectations about entitlements and conditions from that system.
The government seem to be hell-bent on creating a divide. In this legislation the government have chosen to introduce a number of changes, which I will go to later. Standing on their own, none are beneficial. It is not beneficial legislation that the government are trying to implement; it is negative legislation. It is legislation designed to reduce people's entitlements, to remove people's entitlements or to otherwise deal with them negatively. It is not legislation that seeks to achieve the removal of the mischief. There is no underlying causal problem that this legislation seeks to remedy. So this legislation is not trying to remedy a fault that has been discovered in the system. The government are not trying to say in this legislation: `We've discovered a huge problem. This is the reason for the problem; therefore, we need to fix the problem.' This piece of legislation not only takes away people's rights but remedies mischiefs that do not exist.
I can think of only two reasons for this bill. Either it has been introduced with a view to creating another double dissolution trigger on unfair dismissal laws or Mr Andrews has got his riding instructions from the Prime Minister to pursue it again. It is quite surprising that Mr Andrews, whom I would have put a little bit ahead of Mr Abbott and even Mr Reith on industrial relations, appears to be simply following their agenda—the one that was set by Peter Reith. I can understand that. Mr Reith was a true zealot in reforming industrial relations, in his view, but it was in a negative way. He was dedicated to the cause. Mr Abbott was perhaps not so dedicated. He has now moved to health, and the government have left Mr Andrews with this portfolio. Rather than take a backward step to assess and look at what he can do in industrial relations, Mr Andrews has simply fallen into someone else's shoes—not into Mr Abbott's shoes but into those of Mr Reith. He is carrying the torch on behalf of all of those associations that would destroy an industrial relations system and allow a free market to exist. He would rather do that than step back and look at the industrial relations system and talk to the shadow minister about ways of improving it.
This bill is typical of the 10 or so bills that have been pushed up to the Senate from the House of Representatives and reflect the same agenda. I do not think it is the agenda of Mr Andrews. I do not think he would truly agree with some of the things he expects us to agree to. The bill aims to expand the unfair dismissals jurisdiction of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to all constitutional corporations, excluding people who work for partnerships and sole traders, who would remain under state laws. This would result in the Commonwealth taking over 85 per cent of state unfair dismissal systems. It is not 100 per cent—there is still a gap—so why would you do that? If you cannot negotiate with the states to have a single, unified system—whether the minister has even tried to do so is a moot point—why would you move to take over part of a system when the rest of the system will continue to exist? You would have a dual system. 
The government have created another problem in the system. Employees will be unsure of whether they were employed by a corporation, an association, a partnership or a sole trader. Many employees will be concerned about which legislation covered their rights and where they should lodge their complaints. They could lose rights by lodging a complaint in the wrong tribunal, only to discover later that it should have been lodged somewhere else. They would then have to do a paper shuffle to ensure that their rights were still protected. This has all been brought about to remedy a mischief or a problem that does not exist. It cannot be beneficial legislation if it creates this type of outcome.
The bill also proposes to change the processing of unfair dismissal claims and to alter eligibility and available remedies, especially for small business. The bill will effectively create a new class, a `small business class'. The Industrial Relations Commission will have a separate tier of dismissal legislation that will affect not all but some. You can see where we are heading with this. Clearly, the coalition believe in a divided, class based system. They are trying to rediscover their old habits.
The government claim that the bill makes a constructive move towards a unified and simplified system of workplace relations regulation, but they have not been able to demonstrate that here. It really is a grab for power, coupled with a reduction in workers' protection and rights. In simple terms, the purpose of this bill is to extend federal unfair dismissal coverage from four million workers to about seven million; however, in so doing, it displaces the present state jurisdiction for unfair dismissals for incorporated entities. The bill introduces different criteria and consequential compensation provisions for the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to apply in those circumstances. In making the shift away from state coverage, it will reduce that protection and the rights of those employees.
It also extends the qualifying period of employment for small business employees. It creates a second tier for small business employees. As if these lofty gains are not enough, the bill will also do a few more things. At present, the AIRC has coverage of unfair dismissals for employees who work in a corporation under a federal award. It also has coverage for groups such as Commonwealth employees, waterside workers and Victorian and Territory workers. This bill would remove the requirement for a person working for a corporation to also be a federal award employee. The deletion of the federal award criterion would mean that all state award employees who work in corporations would be covered by the Workplace Relations Act's unfair dismissal provisions.
The bill does more than simply remove that; it attempts to prevent unfair dismissal applications arising where the termination was made for operational reasons. That is generally regarded as a redundancy situation. It would create an incomplete, lesser system. The bill seeks to limit compensation payable by all businesses by having the commission consider any contributory conduct of the employee, for instance the earnings whilst in other employment of the employee who is to be reinstated. On the face of it, the proposal may lead you to believe it is about establishing a system of reinstatement jurisdiction which the government is trying to categorise as one step in the right direction. I think it is a backward step. What the government should do is examine the Sweeney report and the Hancock report and perhaps then go to the heads of industrial relations in the various states and examine some of those issues if it wants to provide a seamless rather than a uniform system. 
There are many other ways of achieving world's best practice, or even Australian best practice or states' best practice, rather than adopting this model the Commonwealth now propose. In truth, they are offering a milksop to small business by saying, `We'll push for change here.' They are offering a milksop to corporations by saying, `We'll water down the unfair dismissal provisions and allow you to have a little more ease in dismissing employees.' I do not think that washes with the Australian population at all.
According to the explanatory memorandum, this bill would result in the Australian Industrial Relations Commission annual unfair dismissals caseload increasing from around 8,000 cases to 14,000 cases. The Howard government could use that to appoint more commissioners to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. This would not be an appropriate way to do it. Given the highly biased nature of appointments to the commission by this government, that alone is enough to say: `Stop! Oppose this bill.' However, a complete scheme has not been proposed in this arena in any event. What we have is the divide between incorporated entities and unincorporated entities and partnerships and sole traders, who would not be covered. That is the latter group. You would then have a federal award system which covered federal award employees but only to the extent of termination. So not only is it split into two streams but you also have the divide that exists with small business.
It appears then that the bill fails the test of a move towards uniformity, in any event. Without cooperation on behalf of the states, it would appear that this attempt is going to fail, but a lot depends on the Democrats' position and on the government's position on this bill. Those matters in themselves are enough to oppose the bill. It is apparent that it is better in most instances to discuss and consult with the states and come to an agreement, rather than trying to force a poor uniform system of industrial relations on the states. The system is only part uniform. It is not complete and it is piecemeal rather than uniform. In truth it has the potential to reduce termination laws to the lowest common denominator.
The provision in respect of small business is particularly harsh on small business employees, not that this government seems to care. The provision defines a small business as an employer of fewer than 20 people, including the employee who was terminated and any long-term casuals. Bear in mind the difficulties in trying to define some of those terms. Some people manage their business to try to reduce the number of employees to fall within the definition of an employer of fewer than 20 employees. One problem is that when employers try to do that they remove or exclude long-term casuals. You have another group of small business people who say, `Irrespective of the number, I need so many people to run a business.' If that happens to be 21 rather than 20, they employ 21. Therefore, they are excluded from the legislation. It seems to be a very false way of trying to establish a divide to allow businesses to operate with certainty. At any stage during the growth period they could fall outside the legislation or, at least, into another category. 
This type of arbitrary mechanism is unworkable. The government seem to be stuck on these types of unworkable provisions. In truth, I do not think they want the legislation to pass in any event. That is why they keep serving it up in this form rather than trying to reform the system, and sit down and talk meaningfully with people to work out workable solutions. It is the same legislation, being served up again, that Peter Reith served up as a zealot when trying to destroy the industrial relations system. It also creates another artificial divide in compensation to employees who have been unfairly dismissed—three months for businesses with more than 20 employees but six months for other businesses. There is very little justification for having these divides. You then start to have a `creeping divide', if you want to come up with a new term. The government are forever trying to work out one position for one group and another position for another group. They do it by halving the entitlements you might otherwise be able to get in the dismissal or reinstatement jurisdiction—three months for small businesses with fewer than 20 employees and six months for other businesses.
One thing that always amazes me is that, no matter how much you try to direct here, there has to be a case in the Industrial Relations Commission. An employee on their own or represented by a solicitor, a union or another advocate has to be able to run the case, fight the case and win the case before an industrial relations commissioner, who is experienced in these areas and able to bring their own experience to bear in deciding these matters. Put in that context, it is far preferable to leave as much latitude to the parties to negotiate and come to a settlement and avoid the commission, if possible. That is a far cheaper option, I can tell you from experience. If you are going to run a case, it is far better to let the commission—an independent tribunal—determine all the facts and come to a solution based on the evidence put before it, rather than to use the Workplace Relations Act not as a framework to set up a tribunal to allow it to deal with these issues but to try to tinker.
That is what I think the government is doing with this legislation. It is trying to tinker in the Industrial Relations Commission by trying to narrow definitions. It gets itself in a terrible bind. You get inconsistencies; you get strange outcomes; you get strange clauses being proffered with serious consideration by the government, but they are not serious clauses and they do not deserve serious comment.
The legislation seems to introduce a contributory requirement. This means that the amount of compensation should be reduced if the commission is satisfied that the employee's conduct contributed to the employer's decision to terminate the employee. As I indicated earlier, during the course of a hearing or a settlement, a lot of those issues are taken into consideration, maybe not explicitly but certainly implicitly, as to how these matters are dealt with. You do not require provisions which direct the parties to do what they generally do in any event. Of course, the difficulty is that, when you have provisions that provide that sort of direction, it is a small hurdle—in some cases, a large hurdle—for the commission, the parties or other participants in the system, to try to leap over. Occasionally, people trip over those hurdles with unfair results. 
This means that overall the government is about lowering the level of entitlements to employees generally. It has done that since Peter Reith's day, then in Mr Abbott's day and now in Mr Andrews's day, by trying to serve up legislation that is not beneficial and has no mischief to overcome. Labor has agreed that, if there is a true mischief that requires to be overcome and it can be made out, then Labor will support industrial relations legislation. What this government has tried to do becomes quite stark when it comes to the big end of town. Look at the corporate sector and ask: has the government's response to industrial relations been consistent with the response to corporate greed in the big end of town and business? The answer is simply no. We do not see a plethora of bills being served up in the Senate in relation to the big end of town. We have had a number of CLERPs, up to nine—perhaps nine is the exception, but I will wait—that up until now have not addressed the big end of town in any real sense in comparison with what Mr Andrews, Mr Abbott and Mr Reith have done in relation to workplace relations. The use of these laws can be summarised in three ways: they weaken protection for workers; they are an attempt by the Howard government to take over state unfair dismissal systems against the will of the states, unfairly and without justification; and they are absent of a cooperative approach, resulting in a substantial sector of the work force remaining in state systems anyway. These concerns remain. ",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2004-03-22,"—I want to speak briefly on the Workplace Relations Amendment (Termination of Employment) Bill 2002 [No. 2], which is now before us for the second time. If the bill is rejected, as it was in August last year, it will be added to the pile of double dissolution triggers. It is probably no coincidence that half of those triggers are bills that relate in some form to workplace relations matters. The workplace relations area is probably the last remaining ideological battleground between Labor and Liberal. I sometimes wonder if we should give it heritage status, because they seem to have rolled out the same arguments year after year, pretty much stretching back over many decades. Therefore, in industrial relations matters it pretty much falls to the Democrats to try to cut through the various bits of historical ideological posturing to get to the reality that lies beneath the various proposals.
Many of the criticisms put forward by speakers such as Senator Ludwig are quite valid. It is for that reason that the Democrats do not support the legislation as it stands, just as we did not in August last year. As occurred last year, we will put forward a large number of amendments, and I draw the attention of the Senate to the revised sheets of amendments on behalf of my colleague Senator Murray. There are about 33 amendments in total, and they will dramatically alter the legislation and address many of the flaws contained within it. It is worth noting that under Minister Andrews, the new minister, there appears to have been some willingness to at least consider addressing some of the significant problems in the legislation as it stands, but I understand there is not a willingness to address all of them.
I want to cut through the various viewpoints on this legislation to put the Democrats' position clearly. Ours has been a consistent position since the legislation was first proposed and investigated extensively by a Senate committee around the middle of 2003—that is, as a general position the Democrats are attracted to having a single, national approach in a whole range of areas, not least of which is industrial relations. We believe that, if we could get a single, national system of industrial relations, it would be far better than having six or seven different systems around the country, all having variations. For that reason, any effort to standardise or develop a uniform approach is something we are attracted to. 
Balanced against that is the fact that we are not interested in adopting legislation that will mean a net loss of the existing rights of employees. There is no doubt that the legislation as it stands would mean a net loss in the rights of many employees. The Democrats have sought repeatedly, including in amendments moved last year during the debate on the first version of this legislation, to ensure that, overall, most workers would not be worse off and that a significant number would actually end up having increased rights. That is the scope we have been looking at. An area that continues to be a sticking point is the probationary period for casuals, which is currently 12 months under federal legislation but six months or lower for many people under state legislation. There is also the issue of the definition of exactly what constitutes an employee under federal legislation and whether people might miss out if they were shifted across to the federal jurisdiction.
So it needs to be said quite clearly that many of the concerns, quite rightly put forward by other speakers, relate to the bill as it stands, not to the bill as it would be amended if the Democrat amendments were passed. The Democrats are attracted to the idea of a single system, but not at the expense of an overall increase in the number of workers who would have a reduction in their entitlements from those that exist at the moment.
It has to be said that this legislation would not establish a single, uniform approach. It would dramatically increase the number of people who are under a single, national system, estimated at up to 85 per cent of workers in relation to the unfair dismissal jurisdiction. There is no doubt that it would be preferable to move to a single, uniform system via negotiations with the states, whether for unfair dismissals or for anything else. The fact is that that will not happen. It certainly will not happen at the moment and I cannot see it happening. Even if we were to have a Labor government at the federal level to go with all the state and territory Labor governments, I still would be extremely surprised if there were a willingness to develop a single, uniform approach. The various interests of the different state jurisdictions are such that I find it very difficult to see that happening.
It seems to me that the only way we are likely to get a significant move forward to a single, uniform system is through a number of jumps, and this would be a significant jump. But, as I said, that should not be at the cost of an overall reduction in entitlements or a lowest common denominator approach. That concern was expressed by a number of speakers from the Labor Party, and I share that concern. That is why the Democrats will not support legislation that would allow a lowest common denominator approach to be adopted by the government. We will proceed with our amendments in the committee stage of the legislation and see how they fare. We will make a final decision, as we did in August last year, as to whether the Democrat test for appropriate legislation is met. It does not appear that that will be the case at the moment, but we will make a case for those amendments and see how we go, as we did in August last year.
Sitting suspended from 6.29 p.m. to 7.30 p.m.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Mackay, Sen Sue",ALP,2004-03-22,"—Today, like many of my colleagues before me, I profess to a profound feeling of deja vu standing here about to speak on the Workplace Relations Amendment (Termination of Employment) Bill 2002 [No. 2]. This is the very same bill that was defeated in this place as recently as last August. This is the same bill that has manifested itself in a number of incarnations over the term of this government. In fact, when following the debate on this bill in the House, I heard a number of speakers say that they had spoken on this bill in one form or another about 17 times. I am not quite sure how many times I have, but I think it is up there. By my calculations, that means that about 1.8 million words will have been spoken on this bill by the time it is, hopefully, rejected again at the end of this debate—or, at least, the key points of it. 
I admit to a certain amount of frustration with this. I am frustrated that we are all here simply going through the motions because the government has just run out of steam and is too complacent to put up any legislation aimed at improving things for the Australian people and improving the life of this nation. Instead, we have the same old same old. We have bills being put up again and again that—in substance, with respect to this one—will not pass the Senate. This bill will not pass the Senate, because the elected representatives of the Australian people—at least, those on my side of the chamber and, I am hopeful, other senators—are simply not going to roll over in a fit of fatigue and pass it. The Labor Party will not be supporting the passage of this bill, because we believe it is our role to protect the Australian people from legislation that is not in their best interests. This bill certainly is not in the best interests of the working people of this country. So, jaded and frustrated as I feel, I will stand here again and go through the motions—just as I will later this week, again, when the government puts up the Telstra sale bill.
The truth is that this is really a tired and washed-up government with no real third term agenda. Where are the bills that Mr Howard talked about with respect to what he termed the `barbecue stopping issues'—the work and family issues? He promised action on that front at the last election, and we are all still waiting. Perhaps I should not be quite so uncharitable, because I guess in Mr Howard's book this is a work and family bill. By passing this bill we would be allowing many more Australian workers to spend more time with their families—because they will have been unfairly dismissed and will not have any work to go to. Perhaps that is where we have all missed the point.
—Get a new gag writer!
—You can talk, Senator Abetz. We—on this side of the chamber at least—have been waiting and waiting for this government to introduce legislation to address what the Prime Minister identified as the key issue for this term: assisting workers to better balance work and family responsibilities. We have been waiting and waiting for legislation or policies to improve access to child care, to bring in a system of paid maternity leave—something I know that both you and Senator Crossin have been fighting very hard for—
—The gas has run out on the barbecue!
—That is right. We have been waiting for legislation and policies to give workers more flexibility in how they juggle work and family. We thought that we were waiting in vain, but no, it was here all along. This is it! Do you want time off after having a baby? No worries! Tell your boss that you are pregnant, be sacked on the spot and then take off all the time you like! Because you are a casual worker who has been there less than six months, you have no chance of bringing an unfair dismissal claim. You cannot get child care to cover your shift-work hours? That is okay. Once your boss has unfairly sacked you with no redress for you, you will not need child care!
I am amazed that we did not recognise this cunning plan before. This is the Prime Minister's work and family legislation. It is here! I am sure that any day now this government will be introducing legislation to bring back the marriage bar. I am sure that our enlightened and forward looking Prime Minister would recognise that he should not discriminate against those in a relationship other than marriage. I am sure that, in that case, he would see his way clear to having an all-inclusive bill whereby women in de facto relationships, like me, and one member of a same-sex couple would also have to give up work. Yes, I can see it now: the reintroduction of the marriage bar, like the reintroduction of the ability to unfairly dismiss workers, would be an ideological, plausible way for this government to attempt, in the Orwellian way that it does, to promise to bring in ways of assisting workers to balance work and family. Keep women at home—problem solved. 
That may be the government's way, but it is not the Labor Party's way, and we will not stand by and allow this government to strip away the entitlements of Australian workers. For anyone who remains in doubt about what this bill is attempting to do, even after over 1.8 million words have been spoken about it, let me recap and add some more words. This bill, one, reduces the amount of compensation that can be awarded to an unfairly dismissed employee of a small business; two, extends from three to six months the qualifying period before an employee of a small business can bring a claim for unfair dismissal; three, narrows the scope for an employee to mount an unfair dismissal action; and, four, reduces the amount of back pay available where reinstatement is ordered.
I am here to say to the government, the Prime Minister, Mr Abbott and, in particular, Mr Andrews that size does not matter and nor should it. There is no argument that will convince anybody in the Labor Party that an employee in the small business sector should possess fewer rights than any other employee. Why should a worker who works in a business with 20 employees have less protection than one who works in a business with 21? Does the worker in the smaller enterprise have children who have fewer health care and education needs? Is the small business employee any less likely to experience financial hardship if unfairly put out of a job? Are they more likely to find a new employer who will believe them when they say at an interview, `Yes, I was sacked from my last job, but I hadn't done anything wrong. It wasn't fair but, because I only had 15 colleagues, I couldn't do anything about it'?
The Prime Minister is fond of trotting out his truisms about Australian culture and what he believes defines the Australian character. One of the things that he thinks defines Australians is our belief in a fair go. I agree with the Prime Minister on that, most of the time. I think that the concept of a fair go is held pretty fondly by Australians and sits pretty deeply in the Australian psyche. So I ask the Prime Minister and his various ministers for industrial relations and workplace relations, through you, of course, Madam Acting Deputy President McLucas: where is the fair go in this? How can it be fair to have one rule for workers in a workplace with 21 employees and another harsher one for workers in workplaces with 20? It cannot be fair, and that is one of the reasons Labor will not be supporting the bill.
One of the more disingenuous claims made by the government about this bill is that its purpose for introducing the bill was to create a unitary system of unfair dismissal laws. Nobody on this side of politics believes that for one second. I think we have seen enough from this government to know that their prime motivation in the industrial relations field is removing power and rights from workers. This is a government that laid its cards on the table when it let the attack dogs loose on Australian workers on the waterfront. I will never forget that image—and I am sure nobody on this side of the chamber will—and nor should any Australian worker. That is this government's preferred industrial relations system—a vicious, snarling system snapping at the rights of workers. So any claim about this being about creating a more simplified, unified system clearly has to be taken with a grain of salt. 
Surely if the government were serious about creating a more unified system, the first thing they would have done is consult with the states. They would have gone to the states and said, `How can we ensure we get a better system?' They would maybe take a draft proposal to them for comment to kick off discussions. Did the government do any of that? No, I am advised not. In fact, I checked with the office of my colleague Judy Jackson, the Tasmanian Attorney General and Minister for Justice and Industrial Relations, as recently as last Friday to see what level of consultation by the federal government had taken place on this bill. What was the answer? None. There was no consultation on a bill now in the Senate for the second time which has a direct and huge potential impact on the operation of the Tasmanian industrial relations system.
Professor Ron McCallum, a leading academic in the field of industrial law, said that this bill:
... will strike a blow at the five remaining state systems of employment regulation ...
He went on to say in his speech entitled `The future of state employment regulation in Australia':
... the enactment of this Bill will mean that 85% of Australian employees will only have recourse to the Federal Termination of Employment machinery when seeking to challenge dismissals which are harsh, unjust or unreasonable. This would mean that the State termination of employment regimes would have little work to do because currently they cover approximately 40% of the Australian workforce, and I suggest this would have a telling impact on the viability of these State-based systems of labour relations regulation, especially in the smaller states of South Australia and Tasmania.
Despite not being consulted, a considerable body of research has been undertaken in the states into the implications of this bill. In my home state of Tasmania, the Tasmanian Industrial Commission assessed the last 300 applications that were filed before this bill was put the first time. Their research found that there would be a significant impact on the work of the commission and that the bill would result in a number of potential applicants—33.2 per cent of their sample—not being able to pursue a claim in either the state or federal jurisdiction. Also, 46 per cent of the sample would need to pursue a claim in both the Australian Industrial Relations Commission and the Tasmanian Industrial Commission.
Clearly that is not a recipe for a simpler, more unitary system. What is more, it would bring about a reduction in the work of the state systems to the point where their viability is threatened and there would be an increase in the work of the federal commission. Funny that: the habits of a lifetime are quickly broken by this government when it comes to industrial relations. The explanatory memorandum that accompanies this bill states that the number of cases before the Australian Industrial Relations Commission will increase from around 8,000 to 14,000. We would have a near doubling of the AIRC's caseload. Already the government has allocated nearly $17 million to deal with this increased load. This particularly intrigues me because it flies in the face of nearly every other action of this government. In this instance, unlike dental health, World Heritage area funding in Tasmania or any of the other attempts to cost shift to the states, in this instance the government is saying, `Give it to us and we'll pay you.' 
As well as increased funding, one could also fairly safely assume that the government may take the opportunity to appoint some new commissioners, and that really worries me because we all know what this government's record is like when it come to appointing mates. I have seen more than enough of the government's form in my role as Deputy Chair of the Senate Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts Legislation Committee. I know, based on the government's previous form, that the workers of this country should be afraid; they should be very afraid. Look at the appointment of Professor Flint to the chair of the Australian Broadcasting Authority. Look at Jonathan Shier and the stacking of the ABC board. Look at Christopher Pearson and the SBS board. Yes, the government's track record is there for all to see—and that is just in areas that come within the ambit of the committee I am on. I do not think it will be too long before the government will be announcing the appointment of `Commissioner Reith', or `Commissioner Moore-Wilton' or some other similar travesty.
—There's an idea!
—Senator Abetz says that is an idea. In order that we can move into committee I will conclude by saying that Labor will not be supporting this bill because it is a bad bill, an unjust bill and an unworkable bill. We have never supported this legislation aimed, as it is, at grabbing power from the states—something I think is quite extraordinary, given this government's form, apart from the frolic on health and hospitals—and diminishing the rights and protections of working people. We have never supported it and we are not about to start now.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2004-03-22,"—I thank all senators for their contributions to the debate on the Workplace Relations Amendment (Termination of Employment) Bill 2002 [No. 2]. This is the second time that the Senate has had the opportunity to consider this bill. The bill was previously rejected on 11 August 2003. The government has put the bill forward again because the case for reform is overwhelming and should not be further delayed or frustrated. The cornerstone of the bill is to provide for a national approach to unfair dismissals under the Workplace Relations Act. This is achieved by removing the requirement that employees must be covered by federal awards in order to access federal remedies. Deleting the federal award requirement will allow the dismissed employees of a company to challenge their dismissal in the Australian Industrial Relations Commission as being harsh, unjust or unreasonable.
Such terminology did not flow from Senator Mackay's mouth or from those opposite in their contributions to this debate, as they sought to so grievously misrepresent what this bill is all about. Instead, Senator Mackay is trying to write gags in her office, which seems to be a problem with Tasmanian Labor senators—we recall Senator Sherry having thought for eight years to come up with the funny one-liner, `Work till you drop.' Of course, the funniest one-liner was the $8 billion super blooper made by Senator Sherry. Having spent far too much time trying to think of the funny one-liner, he forgot the detail of a mere $8 billion in his super policy. Similarly with Senator Mackay tonight, we have heard some funny one-liners. Instead of sitting in her office trying to think of one-liners, had she actually bothered to read the legislation—and I draw to her attention section 170CK(2)(f)—she would know that pregnancy is a ground for unlawful dismissal. Here is another classic case of the Labor Party being lazy, not doing their research, trying for the funny one-liner and misrepresenting what the law is at the moment. 
Senator Mackay indicated in her contribution that she had contacted Minister Jackson. It is no wonder she got the response that she did, because Minister Jackson is not exactly the sharpest tool on the rack when it comes to the state ministry in Tasmania. In February 2003 the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations wrote to state workplace relations ministers explaining the intent of this bill and inviting comments. The bill was also discussed at the meeting of the Workplace Relations Ministers Council on 28 March 2003. I understand there was recently a ministerial council which Minister Jackson could not be bothered to attend. Of course, with that history it is all the federal government's fault as opposed to, as we all know, Minister Jackson's incompetence in Tasmania. There was also a Senate committee inquiry into this. If it were a matter of such great importance I am sure that Labor senators on that committee would have consulted with the state Labor governments and ministers around Australia. I cannot blame them on this occasion for not wanting to consult with Minister Jackson, because quite frankly it would have been a waste of time.
 (Senator McLucas)—Order! Senator Abetz, I request that you be a bit more careful with your language.
—About it being a waste of time to consult with her?
—You have referred on a number of occasions to Ms Jackson in a way that I think reflects poorly on her. I think that is unparliamentary. I ask you to be careful with your language.
—For the purposes of this debate I will accept that. With great respect I suggest to the chair that she have a look at some of the other rulings, because question time will be cleaned up considerably from the Labor Party's point of view, if that ruling, like terms of incompetence, is not allowed. With respect, I think that is being a bit precious but I accept your ruling for the purposes of this debate.
We then had the allegations of the thuggery on the waterfront by those opposite. We know where that thuggery came from: the Maritime Union of Australia. Madam Acting Deputy President, take the tip that it was not the workers on the wharves with the dogs trying to break out to attack the MUA. It was the MUA trying to break in to cause their thuggery and havoc on the machinery and the workers who were going about their lawful duty behind the fences. Whilst the Australian Labor Party continue to come into this place and champion the thuggery of the Maritime Union of Australia, they are not fit to govern because they are prepared to do anything for the support of the Maritime Union. We know how important it is, because it was the Maritime Union that saved Senator Kerry O'Brien's endorsement with the Labor Party in Tasmania in recent times.
In this discourse we also heard from Senator Mackay about the World Heritage area and the alleged lack of funding. Isn't it amazing that the state Labor government in Tasmania says it does not have $900,000 to support the jobs so necessary for the World Heritage area, but it has $500,000 for a new office for parliamentary secretary Katherine Hay and the hundreds of thousands of dollars required for a new minister Mr Ken Bacon. The simple fact is that the state Labor government in Tasmania are more interested in creating ministerial jobs than they are in creating jobs in the World Heritage area.
Senators need no reminding that this parliament has debated unfair dismissal laws since the Keating government first legislated for an unfair and unworkable set of arrangements in 1993. I remind those opposite of the first parliamentarian to fall foul of these very laws. Was it one of those obnoxious coalition MPs? No, it was not. It was one of their own—Con Sciacca, the member for Bowman—who fell foul of these very laws. That is how stupid and unworkable they were. Even Labor members were horrified to find out how draconian the legislation was when it happened to be applied to their own work force. The Keating government's partial and untidy retreat from those laws left Australia with unfair dismissal regimes in each state as well as a federal law that is still regarded with deep suspicion by most businesses. For the record, I do not know of any employer that asks, `Who can we sack today?' In fact, the reason that they employ people is to help promote their business activities. All employers want to have a good and workable relationship with their employees. When the relationship breaks down, for whatever reason, it is appropriate that an employer can take appropriate action on the basis that it is not harsh, unjust or unreasonable. 
Since 1996 the present government have sought to provide a fairer go all round for employees and employers, while simplifying the means for handling unfair dismissal claims. Progress has been slower than the community would have liked, and every year Australian industrial tribunals still deal with 16,000 to 17,000 unfair dismissal claims. Currently, about 40 per cent of these claims are lodged with the AIRC. Passage of this bill would break the institutional gridlock that makes the handling of unfair dismissals in Australia perplexing and costly for both employers and employees. If passed, the bill would increase the coverage of federal unfair dismissal laws from about 50 per cent to 85 per cent of all Australian employees. Other workers, including independent contractors and deemed employees, would still have access to remedies and protections under relevant state laws. Few seriously dispute the need for a fresh approach. When the bill was first debated in the House of Representatives, the former Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, the Hon. Tony Abbott, said:
Maintaining six separate industrial jurisdictions makes as much sense as keeping six separate railway gauges.
The former shadow minister, the Hon. Robert McClelland, expressed a similar sentiment, saying:
... it is silly, quite frankly, to have six disparate industrial relations systems, and the Labor Party recognises that.
Other ALP speakers have echoed that view during debate on this bill. The Australian Democrats workplace relations spokesman, Senator Murray, has also expressed strong support for one national industrial relations system, including for a single set of unfair dismissal laws. He reaffirmed that support in a speech delivered to the Australian Mines and Metals Association national conference just last Friday.
The cost and confusion generated by the six different arrangements that currently operate across the country has been widely acknowledged by business and academic commentators and in the wider community. For instance, independent research by the Melbourne Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research shows that one-third of Australian businesses do not even know whether their workplace relations are covered by state or federal law. Other independent research conducted by Don Harding of the Melbourne institute reveals that the current unfair dismissal arrangements add an estimated $1.3 billion annually to the costs of running small and medium sized businesses. Part of that cost is reflected in the madness of maintaining six different unfair dismissal laws, with the forum shopping and double handling that that entails. 
It is deeply disappointing that we appear to have again reached a stalemate over this very important and potentially ground-breaking bill. This stalemate comes despite the government expressing a willingness to consider a raft of Democrat amendments including: delaying the commencement of the bill; having concurrent appointees to the AIRC handle unfair dismissal claims, subject to agreement with each state; removing the provisions in the bill that treat dismissals of small business employees differently; and modifying the bill's treatment of exceptional circumstances for the purpose of determining whether a redundancy may give rise to an unfair dismissal. The government was also prepared to consider a number of wide-ranging Democrat proposals, including: new definitions of `employer' and `employee' that would include deemed employees and independent contractors; and preserving, for a time, state based unfair dismissal remedies for casual employees.
Despite the government's willingness to explore the opportunities for sensible compromise, Senator Murray—for all his eloquent words about the importance of moving to a unitary system in his recent speech to the AMMA—is still not satisfied, apparently closing the door to reform with the two-line observation:
The Democrats have been talking at length with the Government to find common ground. The sticking point is that while the Democrats desire a unitary Industrial Relations system, we will not do so at any cost.
One might ask: what would be an acceptable cost? For their part, the Democrats want the government to agree to an amendment that would reduce the period of exclusion from unfair dismissal remedies for short-term casual employees. The Democrats want to allow casual employees with only six months service access to federal unfair dismissal remedies. The government believes that the present 12-month threshold draws an appropriate distinction between short-term and long-term casuals. More to the point, this is the standard that has applied at the federal level for the past eight years. The other Democrat proposal the government cannot accept is for casual employees to continue to be able to access state unfair dismissal remedies. This would make a mockery of the concept of a national system and would reduce its coverage to fewer than three-quarters of employees. Processes and the remedies available would vary from state to state, which would increase complexity, add to costs and provide a possible vehicle for forum shopping between the state and federal tribunals.
In agreeing to consider many of the Democrats' proposals in relation to this bill, the government was conscious that it would be putting on hold the proposed changes to the federal law contained in this bill and in the fair dismissal bill, which has been twice rejected by the Senate during the life of this parliament. This would involve a significant shift from the government's preferred position, but when reasonable compromises have needed to be made in securing better laws then the government has always been prepared to make them. The Australian Democrats, however, have continued to insist on further amendments which would not only reduce the scope of this bill but also make significant changes to the federal law as it has operated for the past eight years. This the government cannot accept. It is a pity the government's constructive approach and willingness to compromise have not been reciprocated. The Democrats appear willing to support a national system for unfair dismissal only in theory, not in practice. I call upon non-government senators to give a little ground, to agree to a national approach to unfair dismissal laws and to support this bill, which I commend to the Senate. 
Question agreed to.
Bill read a second time.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2004-03-22,"—The Senate is considering two bills that propose significant changes to the current regulatory system that applies to migration agents. The Migration Agents Registration Application Charge Amendment Bill 2003 is a straightforward proposal dealing with the registration fee applicable to registered agents who change their status from non-commercial to commercial. It is supported by the Labor opposition. In its original form, the Migration Legislation Amendment (Migration Agents Integrity Measures) Bill 2003 generated considerable concern in the industry and was sharply criticised by all members of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee, including the three Liberal-National Party members of that committee. 
I note that the Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs, Minister Hardgrave, has considered aspects of the original proposals, resulting in the announcement of some 39 government amendments to his own legislation. That is a significant backdown in anyone's terms and it goes a long way towards meeting Labor's concerns. However, it does not reflect well on the minister's initial refusal to come to terms with concerns conveyed to him at the time by the opposition and by the board of the Migration Agents Regulatory Authority, amongst others.
To put this bill into its proper context it is important to first consider briefly the history of the current regulatory system and of the industry regulator, MARA. It is true to say that the activity of unscrupulous migration agents has been a longstanding concern for those of us on the Labor side of politics. We recognise that visa applicants are particularly vulnerable to exploitation by rip-off merchants, given the complexity of our migration program, the lack of knowledge and the tendency of some operators to claim to have influential contacts within, or special influence over, those who run the migration program. We see that unscrupulous operators represent a threat to the integrity of our rules based immigration system. Thus there is both a consumer protection and a program integrity rationale for regulating the migration advice industry.
Labor first introduced a form of compulsory registration for agents in the form of the Migration Agents Registration Scheme over a decade ago. Subsequently, the Liberal-National Party government abolished MARS and, in March 1998, replaced it with the current form of statutory self-regulation. Under this system the industry professional association, the Migration Institute of Australia, acts as the regulator under powers delegated to it by the parliament. Essentially it considers applications for the registration of new agents, oversights the continuing professional education requirements for existing agents and deals with complaints against registered agents.
It is important to understand two aspects of the creation of MARA. The first is that the then minister for immigration, Mr Ruddock, saw it as the precursor to complete voluntary self-regulation. This is something which the Labor Party is implacably opposed to. The second is that its creation was the outcome of a deal in late 1997 between the Liberal-National Party government, the Democrats and Independent senators. Given this history, it is somewhat paradoxical that the lead-up to the debate on the current legislation has seen the government posturing as the enemy of rogue agents while simultaneously seeking to undermine and grab back the power from the very regulator that it created in 1998.
The history of the current bills goes back to the review of the regulatory system that the government commissioned in September 2001. That review was officially called the review of statutory self-regulation of the migration advice industry, and it reported to the government in July 2002. The report of the review panel is commonly referred to as the Spicer report. The review panel found that the industry was not ready for voluntary self-regulation as advocated in the past by the former minister, Mr Ruddock, and recommended that MARA continue on an indefinite basis. Legislation to do just that was passed by the parliament with the Labor opposition's support, as we wanted to give MARA the chance to get on with the job. Recommendation 16 of the review was as follows:
To support the integrity of the migration and humanitarian programs, improve the monitoring of agents and develop more effective means of sanctioning agents who lodge high numbers of vexatious, unfounded or incomplete applications. 
It is relevant to note that the specific mechanisms for monitoring and sanctioning agents that the government has proposed were not developed by the independent panel that conducted the review or by MARA itself. They were purely the product of the department and were seen by many as an attempt by the department and the minister to gain themselves increased power at MARA's expense. From the outset Labor's shadow minister, Mr Laurie Ferguson, indicated to the minister that, while the Labor opposition supported firm action against those agents who were abusing the system, there were grave misgivings about the Liberal-National Party's original proposals.
Labor's concerns revolved around the following fundamental issues: firstly, the intention to profile agents with a complete caseload as small as four; secondly, the definition of a case and the associated notification requirement, where failure to notify DIMIA of an agent's involvement in a case constitutes an offence; thirdly, the lack of transparency in the handling of agents identified as having an unacceptably high rejection rate, with the minister effectively acting as judge and jury and MARA being reduced to rubber-stamping a predetermined penalty; and, fourthly, the minister's discretion to overturn a sanction imposed on an agent without being required to give a reason for doing so. In addition, the Labor opposition was concerned that the original bill took no action on the issue of professional indemnity insurance, which is optional at present, or on Mr Spicer's recommendation that overseas agents be brought within the regulatory system.
Unfortunately, these concerns were ignored by the minister, and the bill was passed by the House of Representatives without amendment—I stress that: it was passed without amendment. Yet this evening we are considering some 39 government amendments. So the bill has moved from the House of Representatives, into the Senate, and through the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee and out the other side, and the government is now proposing 39 amendments. 
On 8 October the bill was referred to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee for detailed examination and report by 25 November last year. The committee received 21 submissions in the short period open to stakeholders, with all bar DIMIA expressing concern at the government's proposals. The committee held a public hearing on 27 October and took evidence from MARA, the department, a community legal centre and a lawyers group. In its report on the bill the committee unanimously recommended that the government proposals:
... not proceed, on the basis that the measures are insufficiently targeted to vexatious agents and that the Bill grants complete discretion to the Minister, without detailing the basis on which such discretion will be exercised.
Not surprisingly, this devastating finding—as I said, unanimously presented by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee—led the Liberal-National Party government to take the bill off the Senate legislative program late last year while the minister belatedly sought to talk with the Labor opposition. The Labor opposition has been working constructively to resolve the impasse facing the bill because it is committed to having action taken against agents—and I stress that they are in the minority—who have been clogging up the system with large numbers of vexatious, incomplete and unfounded visa applications and appeals. At the same time, Labor has insisted that agents are entitled to a fairer and more transparent mechanism than that put forward by the Liberal-National Party government. 
The government has been forced into a major backflip and is now proposing 39 amendments to its own bill. In summary, it has agreed to increase the threshold figure before agents can be profiled from four completed cases in six months to 10 completed cases; clarify that the notification and profiling system only includes cases where an agent agrees to represent a visa applicant, thus excluding other forms of immigration assistance, such as where an agent merely gives advice to an applicant; extend by seven days the period that agents have to respond to a show cause notice from the minister; specify by regulation, which will be disallowable, the factors the minister must consider in considering an agent's response to a show cause notice; replace the inflexible mandatory sanction provisions with a power for MARA to determine an appropriate sanction in the circumstances of the case; remove the minister's power to remove a sanction once imposed by MARA; require agents to have professional indemnity insurance as a condition of their registration, as the Labor opposition has been advocating for some months; and empower MARA to publish sanction decisions, even when such decisions have been appealed and to list on its web site those agents who have ceased to be registered, voluntarily or otherwise. While these changes do not fully cover the range of Labor's concerns and our preferred position, we will be supporting the passage of the bills in their amended form. 
The Labor opposition does remain concerned that other issues impacting on vulnerable consumers and program integrity have still not been addressed by the Liberal government. We remain to be convinced that the department gives sufficient priority to the exercise of its own powers in this area. The reality is that MARA's powers are limited to the imposition of non-criminal sanctions on registered agents. It is the department and not MARA that has the power to investigate and prosecute individuals engaged in unregistered practice, people trafficking, migration fraud and other offences under the Migration Act. The number of such cases actually brought to court bears little relation to the Liberal government's rhetoric about the risks facing our migration system, so there is a need to do much more in that area, using the powers that are already available to it and to deal with employers who knowingly and often repeatedly employ illegal workers.
We remain concerned about both the open-ended nature of the system of ministerial discretion and its use by the former minister, Mr Ruddock. These matters of course are the subject of ongoing examination by a Senate committee, so I do not intend to canvass them in any detail at this point. I simply note that, firstly, the government has largely refused to provide that committee with access to departmental material on cases that have been raised in the parliament and the media. Secondly, the data provided to the committee, which was subsequently released to the public, clearly shows that a number of individuals who are not registered migration agents were the source of multiple requests for ministerial intervention on behalf of unsuccessful visa applicants. At the very least, that sets a bad example.
We are disappointed that action has yet to be taken to bring overseas agents within the scope of a regulatory scheme. The Spicer report noted that as many as 2½ thousand offshore agents regularly lodge visa applications on behalf of clients at Australian overseas posts. Most of these are travel agents, lawyers and accountants who have branched out to provide immigration assistance to clients. In some countries, such as the UK, China, India, the Philippines and the former Yugoslavia, such agents are reportedly responsible for the lodgment of up to 60 per cent of all visa applications received by the posts concerned. 
Currently the Migration Act does not allow non-Australian citizens to register with MARA, even if they wish to do so. There are complex issues involved in extending the reach of MARA to these countries. It is most unlikely that the Australian parliament could make it an offence for overseas agents who are unregistered to provide immigration assistance offshore for a fee. It would be possible, however, to require that overseas posts only deal with either visa applicants or registered agents authorised to act on their behalf. That matter was canvassed in the Spicer report in July 2002, almost two years ago. The opposition has been repeatedly told by the current government that a discussion paper on the matter is being prepared as a prelude to possible legislation or other action. To date, this discussion paper—if it exists—has not seen the light of day, and that is just not good enough.
The other matter that requires attention is the issue of audited trust accounts for clients' funds. Lawyers have long been subject to detailed requirement in this area to protect their clients. While not all migration agents take funds from clients that would be subject to trust account provisions, those who do should be required to do so on a consistent and accountable basis. The Liberal government and MARA should address this matter as a matter of priority and make necessary changes to the Migration Act and/or the code of conduct governing registered agents.
In concluding, I wish to reiterate that the Labor opposition, following the proposed 39 amendments to the bills, is supporting the passage of these bills. We do not claim the provisions dealing with vexatious, incomplete and unfounded visa applications are perfect. We acknowledge that concerns remain. MARA, in particular, would clearly prefer a greater role in the process and wider discretion. Some agents fear that the provisions will have unforeseen consequences. That remains to be seen. What is clear is that there is a problem with a minority of agents who have been clogging up the system with multiple vexatious, incomplete and unfounded applications. I might say that some of the evidence I saw at the recent committee hearings stated that agents were at times charging very significant fees for some of these activities. The take-home message is that firm action must be taken against those particular agents. Labor will take a close interest in how effectively, speedily and sensitively the department and MARA use the provisions of these particular bills.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION AGENTS REGISTRATION APPLICATION CHARGE AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2004-03-22,"—There are two bills before us today—the Migration Agents Registration Application Charge Amendment Bill 2003 being what one might call the minor bill and the Migration Legislation Amendment (Migration Agents Integrity Measures) Bill 2003 being the major bill. I will start with the smaller bill first. The Democrats support the Migration Agents Registration Application Charge Amendment Bill 2003 as it stands. It is a simple bill which seeks to introduce a new charge for migration agents who register with the industry regulator—known as MARA or the Migration Agents Registration Authority—to provide immigration assistance on a non-commercial basis but who then give immigration assistance on a commercial basis during the course of their registration period. The charge requires them to pay the higher commercial fee if they commence giving immigration assistance on a commercial basis. I think that is quite appropriate.
The Migration Agents Registration Application Charge Act was introduced in 1997 and was actually one of the very first pieces of legislation I dealt with when I came into the Senate. This whole area, therefore, is one that I have followed with a lot of interest ever since. The entire area of migration agent regulation is one that, in a significant way, stems from those legislative changes in 1997. Whilst the Democrats were crucial to those changes going through, I have never suggested that it is a perfect system. It is very much one that is still evolving and one that I believe will need continued monitoring, continued assessment and probably further changes down the track. 
I note with support the comment in the minister's second reading speech which states:
The Government and the MARA are committed to keeping down non-commercial agent fees as these agents normally work as volunteers in community organisations, assisting the most vulnerable clients.
That is a view that the Democrats very much share and is one of the reasons that I negotiated with the then minister, Minister Ruddock, to ensure that fees for non-commercial agents were lower than those initially proposed. In my view even the current amount is often a significant burden for community legal centres and for non-commercial migration agents who provide an incredibly significant service, often to people who otherwise would get no assistance, in an area which should be acknowledged is often very complicated.
The Migration Act is quite complicated, very regularly subject to change and also often misunderstood. People are quite vulnerable to making mistakes in identifying what their opportunities, their options and their entitlements may be. Sometimes those entitlements are time specific—they need to make an application within a certain period of time—and if they do not have the assistance of somebody who knows the Migration Act and its many regulations then they can very easily come a cropper. I imagine many members of parliament have had contact with individuals who have come a cropper because of the complexity and some of the constraints and hurdles of the Migration Act and its regulations and procedures.
I say that to indicate not just the import-ance of non-commercial migration agents but also more broadly the importance of migration agents as a whole. One thing that concerns me about the thrust of the major piece of legislation here, the migration agents integrity measures bill, is the underlying assumption that there is a widespread problem with the behaviour of migration agents. Often this can be in the eye of the beholder and depends on which piece of rhetoric you point to as to whether or not you believe it is a fair or unfair categorisation. I certainly believe there has been an unhelpful attitude continuing in relation to migration agents—as though there is a large number of dubious operators out there deliberately exploiting vulnerable people and charging excessive fees. There is no doubt that there are a small number who behave inappropriately, there is no doubt that there are a small number who are spectacularly incompetent and there is no doubt that there are a small number who overcharge, but, as with any profession, the behaviour of a small number should not be used to cast a general slur across the entire profession, particularly when—it should be remembered—it is a profession that is relatively new in terms of its regulatory phase. This current phase of legislative regulatory regime has been in place for only six years or so; it is still developing and still evolving.
In that context I do not think it is terribly helpful to be placing unrealistic or unfair pressure on the behaviour of migration agents in general and, therefore, on the regulatory authority, the MARA. They have a difficult job with constrained resources. In that context I think they should be given encouragement rather than unfair pressure. That is not to say that they should be above criticism, of course. I am equally willing to criticise where appropriate, but I do think they have been subjected to unfair criticism to some extent from some quarters, including from some in government and some in the Labor opposition. I do not think that is helpful in terms of the general goal, which I am sure we all share, which is to ensure better practice on behalf of migration agents and better awareness amongst people who might need to use migration agents.  
Apart from being a member of the committee that inquired into this legislation, I am also a member of the current Senate Select Committee on Ministerial Discretion in Migration Matters. That committee is still to report so I will not go into this in detail. I think there was a habit by some people giving evidence before that committee and some of those questioning to equate people who were potentially charging fees to help people with requests for ministerial discretion with migration agents. Often it seemed from anecdotal evidence given to the committee that if there was a problem it was more likely to be in the area of people who were not actually migration agents and who were holding themselves out as being able to charge money to assist in providing requests for the exercise of ministerial discretion.
That area of activity was previously legal. In one of those quirks of the migration law it is not appropriate or legal to give migration advice if you are not a registered migration agent, with certain exceptions, but assisting people to produce a request for ministerial discretion does not count as migration advice because technically it is not an application in the legal sense of the word. It is pleasing to see that area being given greater scrutiny as part of ensuring not so much better behaviour amongst migration agents, because this problem was misbehaviour or exploitation amongst non-agents, but that activity which related to exploring people's rights and entitlements under the Migration Act was conducted by people who understood what they were doing.
That is basically what this is all about: trying to ensure that consumers, if you like, who want to use the Migration Act or to exercise an entitlement under the Migration Act are confident that they can go to somebody who knows what they are doing—namely, a registered agent—as opposed to just any person in the community who is a friend of a friend and might hold themselves out as being able to do special favours. It is important that that area is focused on and tightened up. It is also important to emphasise the fact that the tightening up relates to misbehaviour not by migration agents but rather by others who hold themselves up as having expertise or influence they do not have.
The other aspect of this bill that initially caused a lot of concern to people across all political parties was the extra power it potentially placed in the hands of the migration minister. I am not necessarily impugning the minister, the government or the department in their motive for gaining these extra powers. I think there is a rationale behind putting forward this proposal. But it is quite clear that the bill as originally proposed would have put excessive power in the hands of the minister and, in effect, put the MARA—a supposedly independent regulator—in an impossible position where it would basically be automatically required to carry out the consequences of a verdict arrived at by the government minister. That would be inappropriate for a whole range of reasons.
In general, the Democrats have been concerned about the increasing power of the migration minister in a whole range of areas across the Migration Act, and extending that power further caused us great concern. This is another example of significant change to a bill as a consequence of Senate committee inquiries—and it is a credit to all parties involved, to the government and to the Senate as a whole. The committee inquiry was extremely valuable in getting to the nub of some of the problems with the set-up as it was first proposed. It did so via questioning from senators from all parties—Labor, Liberal and the Democrats—and input from a lot of people who are practitioners in this area. 
There is perhaps a habit of assuming that many migration agents are somehow rather dodgy, as there is a habit by some people of unfairly inferring that many lawyers are dodgy, when that is not usually the case. As I am sure you would agree, there might be a small minority of lawyers who are dodgy, but most of them are engaged in their work for the right reasons. Similarly it is the case with migration agents, as we saw from people appearing before this committee. Indeed, I have seen it in many other committees I have been involved in. We recognised the desire for a better system to identify inappropriate behaviour in migration agents and to penalise agents who are clearly acting inappropriately and vexatiously but to ensure appropriate checks and balances. That is the aim of this legislation, and I think it is fair to say that that is a shared goal across the board of the industry, the government and other interested parties such as the Democrats and the Labor Party. We all have a similar goal—an industry that operates as effectively as possible, provides the best services possible and enables the regulator, the MARA, to identify vexatious agents effectively and as quickly as possible whilst enabling a fair system with checks and balances. That is what we are trying to get out of this.
I am certain that whatever we end up with will not satisfy everybody 100 per cent, probably not even 90 per cent, but that what we do end up with will be at least an attempt to improve on where things are at now. As I said earlier, this system has been in place for six years. It is still very much evolving, and I think it would be unrealistic to expect it to be made perfect within the first few years of its operation. We can expect to need to make further refinements over the next few years. Ongoing refinements, as referred to by Senator Sherry, are still needed and have been recommended by reviews that have already happened. I think the government have indicated that they are still looking at making further changes, such as in relation to agents operating offshore. We will need to keep working on this area, but there is no doubt that the amendments put forward as a consequence of the committee report and the further amendments circulated by the Democrats will address some of the core problems identified by the committee. I do not think they address all of them, but I am concerned that if we do not get a system through the Senate this time around then the undercurrent of that antagonistic approach to migration agents I mentioned earlier might get the upper hand in the political dynamics and we might get a more punitive system than the system proposed in the bill.
One key issue—and I will speak to this a little bit further in the committee stage—the Democrats were concerned about was ensuring that there was still scope for the MARA to make a decision for itself about whether or not the behaviour of an agent was such that the agent required sanction or disciplinary action. That is something I believe is important to the members of the MARA. I think that should be emphasised from the point of view not of the parliamentarians considering this issue but of the people who are active in the migration industry, in the MARA and the Migration Institute of Australia. The people involved in those organisations put in a lot of work as representatives of their profession, and they represent their profession not to enrich themselves in any way. I am quite certain that acting as advocates and representatives of their industry and their profession costs most of them a great deal in time taken out of their normal professional activities.  
I think it needs to be acknowledged in this debate that the representatives of the MIA and the MARA have put a lot of work into not just this legislation but a lot of the other issues surrounding the matters that are touched on in this legislation, and they will continue to do so because, as I said, the issues are ongoing. The work that the MIA has put into engaging with the government and with all political parties on this issue to try to get an outcome that meets the goals that most of us share needs to be acknowledged.
A range of amendments have been circulated in my name on behalf of the Democrats that I will speak on in the committee stage. I indicate that the Democrats are willing to support these bills at the second reading stage because we support the principle, which is to attempt to get a more effective system in place to identify vexatious behaviour by migration agents and to ensure—and this is our aim, which we will be using to judge at the end of the process whether to support the bills at the third reading stage—that that process is fair, that it is sufficiently independent of government and that it is a system that will provide a fair go for migration agents and that they will not just be able to be railroaded by the minister. Not surprisingly there is a fear amongst some in the industry, in an area as politically contentious as migration, that some agents may be used purely as political scapegoats by the government of the day.
That fear is real. It does not matter whether the government says it is fair or not; it is a very real fear, based on the incredibly politicised nature that we all know migration law and practice can have. We only have to look at some of the criticisms that have been made time and again over recent years by the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs and the Attorney-General, past and present, about the activities of lawyers and agents involved in this area. The Democrats believe most of those criticisms have been very unfair and have misrepresented the situation. The fact is that the vast majority of advocates, lawyers and agents involved in the politically contentious areas in the Migration Act are not enriching themselves. They are usually working pro bono or at extremely low rates, trying to ensure that people have some scope for justice and fairness from the migration system. That is what is needed, and that is what those people are trying to deliver. They deserve support—not unqualified support but support in general—for what they are trying to do to ensure that there is still justice available in the migration law, which the Democrats believe is, in many cases, framed in a way that does not easily deliver justice. In fact, sometimes it is almost impossible to get justice out of it.
We need to ensure agents are not able to be politically persecuted and used as political scapegoats. We also need to ensure that that small number of people who are registered as agents and who are operating inappropriately are able to be weeded out. There is no doubt there could be improvement in that system. The Democrats support that goal. We will see how we go in the committee stage in making that goal a worthwhile reality.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION AGENTS REGISTRATION APPLICATION CHARGE AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2004-03-22,"—As most senators know, I am an optimist, and there is the slim possibility of these migration bills getting through tonight, so I will keep my comments very brief. Suffice to say that I thank honourable senators for their contribution. I agree with Senator Bartlett's comments in relation to the government taking note of the Senate committee report, but Senator Sherry could not help but make a few political points about that. We are a consultative government and, when the Senate report came down, there was some merit in some of the recommendations. We as a government are not ashamed to say that our legislation can be improved from time to time as a result of the Senate committee system working. With great respect, I would have thought that Senator Sherry, given last week's events, would not be in a particularly strong position to argue about policy superiority. 
I simply thank the Democrats in particular for their discussions with the minister's office and the cooperation that has allowed a number of amendments to be agreed to which will enhance the legislation and allow its passage. The government has a number of amendments, and the reasons and rationale for that are detailed in the supplementary explanatory memorandum. I do not seek to canvass that further, other than to commend the bills to the Senate.

"Kirk, Sen Linda",ALP,2004-03-22,"—Yesterday we celebrated Harmony Day, a day dedicated to celebrating the diversity of cultures that we call Australian and promoting racial tolerance and acceptance. It is a day on which all Australians should take the time to reflect upon and appreciate the unique range of peoples who have come to call Australia home throughout our 203-year history since white settlement. It was many years ago now that Australia was nicknamed `the lucky country'. Our country was given this name because of the great opportunities that we had to offer to anyone who came here. Australia was a land that gave people a new beginning regardless of their past. Since 1945 over six million people have made Australia their new home.
As a free, open and democratic society, Australia still has a lot to offer its people and this is evidenced by the fact that each year approximately 80,000 people become new Australian citizens. Few other countries of the world could boast such a figure. This represents the tolerance, acceptance and appreciation that the majority of Australians have for other cultures, religions, races and ethnicities.
Yet unfortunately there are always those among us who maintain intolerant attitudes that promote divisiveness. Harmony Day, of all days, is a day for Australians to show the community and the government that such attitudes are unacceptable. The government, through the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs and with the support of the Council for Multicultural Australia, administers the Living in Harmony initiative, which is designed to challenge all Australians to: first, take a stand against racism, prejudice and intolerance; second, help build a peaceful and productive future for our children by setting an example of how to live in harmony, making the most of our racial, cultural, social and religious diversity; and third, put into practice the best of traditional Australian values—namely justice, equality, fairness and friendship.
Harmony Day is a wonderful opportunity to celebrate these great values and, as a society, to put on our best performance, put our best foot forward, put on our best dress. We have so much to celebrate here, and every one of us is enriched by the multiculturalism of our society. However, we should not ignore the disharmony that we see in some places. This year we saw rioting on Redfern's Block, rioting that showed the extent to which some Indigenous Australians feel disenfranchised in our society—cut out, powerless and ignored. Regardless of who was at fault in the incident in question, reactions show the strength of feeling that is out there in the community. It shows us that there is work to be done on this relationship, work to change this discordant note.
Despite the government's own emphasis on practical reconciliation and effective measures which address the legacy of profound economic and social disadvantage experienced by many Indigenous Australians, the government has fallen short of its own yardstick in the area of practical reconciliation. Census data from 2001 shows that the rate of progress in improving Indigenous wellbeing and reducing the level of inequality experienced by Indigenous people compared to non-Indigenous people is minimal.
We also see a government that has no qualms about refusing access to vital services for temporary protection visa holders. These are people who, by government policy, cannot settle down here in Australia like so many other migrants and refugees who have come to our shores before them. People on rolling TPVs can never be sure of their place in our society, and they can never receive government assistance to help them become a part of Australia. Labor's policy is to end rolling TPVs and to give real meaning to the Harmony Day theme of `You + Me = Us'. 
Harmony Day quite appropriately coincides with the United Nations' International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination and, in light of this, I would like to speak briefly about the problem of anti-Semitism. Recently, I was fortunate enough to visit Israel. I greatly appreciated the opportunity to expand my knowledge of the Jewish people and their history. Today senators in this chamber debated Senator Stephens's matter of public importance on the threat posed to the cohesion of Australian society by the rise of anti-Semitism. There are approximately 120,000 Jews living in Australia today, constituting the largest Jewish community in the east Asia-Pacific region. The great majority live in Melbourne and Sydney; however, there are also significant communities in Perth, in Brisbane, on the Gold Coast and in my home town of Adelaide. Jewish people were among the first to settle in Australia in the 18th century and, following World War II, many Holocaust survivors immigrated here. Today Australia has the largest per capita number of Holocaust survivors of any community in the world.
Despite the long history Jewish people have with Australia and the significant contribution they have made to Australian society, Jewish people are often the target of racial and political attacks within the community. Over the past few years there has been a substantial rise in the number of reports of anti-Semitic violence, harassment and intimidation. In some ways then, it seems Australia may be becoming less rather than more tolerant. Historically, Jewish people have always been amongst the first to suffer in any wave of intolerance. In Australia, the past few years have also seen an increase in reports of Muslim women harassed in the streets for wearing their headscarves, vandalism of mosques and anti-Muslim graffiti.
This kind of destructive and divisive behaviour cannot be tolerated. These kinds of actions and beliefs threaten to destabilise the social cohesion that Harmony Day is intended to celebrate. If Australia is to continue to be the open, inclusive and multicultural society we pride ourselves upon, then we must work together to dispel these ignorant and racist attitudes. We can celebrate harmony, but we should not pretend to possess it when we do not.
While the government holds the major responsibility for ensuring Australia continues to be a nation of acceptance and tolerance in both policy and law, in practice it is an area in which all Australians can participate. All Australians are entitled to live free from racial vilification, intimidation and harassment. All of us have an obligation to ensure that this right is a reality. Harmony Day reminds us to proactively discourage intolerant and closed-minded attitudes in all aspects of our lives. We must lead by example. Remaining conscious of personal prejudices and endeavouring not to indulge them are the first steps to removing them altogether. Harmony Day offers all Australians an opportunity to stop and consider the value of our uniquely diverse nation. It also gives us the opportunity to consider what more can be done, not to listen to the few discordant notes that sometimes jar our ears.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Harmony Day</title>,Adjournment,18,1,speech

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2004-03-22,"—The Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:
(1)	The Chief Executive Officer was Mr Robert Robson.
(2)	Harvest FreshCuts applied for the grant on 22 January 2003.
(3)	The amount of the grant applied for by Harvest FreshCuts is part of the application process, which is treated as commercial in confidence by National Food Industry Strategy Ltd (NFIS Ltd), the independent company contracted to deliver certain programs under the National Food Industry Strategy.
(4)	The application was signed by Mr Robert Robson.
(5)	The National Food Industry Council does not sight, recommend or approve FIG applications. A Food Innovation Committee (FIC) makes recommendations to the Managing Director of NFIS Ltd on FIG grant applications. Details of FIC membership and FIG program information and guidelines are available on the NFIS website. The Council member on the FIC Grants Assessment Group which assessed the grant to Harvest FreshCuts was Dr Michael Eyles. Grants in excess of $500,000 are approved by the Board of NFIS Ltd. Strict conflict of interest provisions exist for both the FIC and the Board of NFIS Ltd.
(6)	Of the 109 FIG applications (full or preliminary) received by NFIS Ltd as at 29 February 2004, three are from the companies listed. 
(7)	Details of grant applications which have either been unsuccessful or are still under consideration are not publicly released by NFIS Ltd, although details of successful grants are announced.
