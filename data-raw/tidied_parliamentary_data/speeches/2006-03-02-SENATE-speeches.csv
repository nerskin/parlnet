"Watson, Sen John",LP,2006-03-02,"—I give notice that at the giving of notices on the next day of sitting I shall withdraw business of the Senate notice of motion No.1 standing in my name for nine sitting days after today for the disallowance of the Civil Aviation Amendment Regulations 2005 (No. 3) and business of the Senate notice of motion No.1 standing in my name for 11 sitting days after today for the disallowance of Instrument No. CASA 383/05. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard the committee’s correspondence relating to these instruments.
Leave granted.
The correspondence read as follows—

Civil Aviation Amendment Regulations 2005 (No. 3), Select Legislative Instrument 2005 No. 243

CANBERRA ACT 2600
Dear Minister

I refer to the Civil Aviation Amendment Regulations 2005 (No. 3), Select Legislative Instrument 2005 No. 243. These Regulations amend the principal Regulations to introduce new provisions concerning pilot operating procedures on, and in the vicinity of, non-controlled aerodromes. The Committee has considered these Regulations and raises the following matters.

First, the new paragraph 166(2)(c) requires that the pilot in command of an aircraft that is being operated in the vicinity of a non-controlled aerodrome must conform with, or avoid, the circuit pattern. New paragraph 166(2)(d) requires that when the pilot joins the circuit pattern this must be done in a certain direction. The latter requirement is subject to subregulations 166(3) and (4). The relationship between paragraphs 166(2)(c) and (d) is not clear. Does ‘conforming’ with a circuit pattern mean the same thing as ‘joining’ a circuit pattern? If so, is it intended that paragraph 166(2)(c) should also be subject to regulations 166(3) and (4)? Nor is it clear when a pilot must avoid the circuit pattern. The Committee would appreciate clarification of the operation of these provisions.


Secondly, regulation 166 prescribes a number of strict liability offences. New regulation 166A also prescribes a strict liability offence, but subregulation 166A(4) provides a defence of reasonable excuse. The Committee seeks your advice as to why a similar defence is not available for the strict liability offences specified in regulation 166.

The Committee would appreciate your advice on the above matters as soon as possible, but before 2 December 2005, to enable it to finalise its consideration of these Regulations. Correspondence should be directed to the Chairman, Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, Room SG49, Parliament House, Canberra.

Dear Senator Watson
Thank you for your letter of 10 November 2005 regarding Civil Aviation Amendment Regulations 2005 (No. 3), Select Legislative Instrument 2005 No. 243. I apologise for the delay in responding.
I have now received the following advice from the Civil Aviation Safety Authority.
In respect of your request for clarification of the operation of the provisions in paragraphs 166(2)(c) and (d), I am advised that paragraphs 166(2)(c) and (d) reflect phases of the operation of an aircraft in the vicinity of an aerodrome. Paragraph 166(2)(c) obliges aircraft outside a circuit pattern to avoid the circuit, and aircraft in a circuit pattern to conform with the circuit. Paragraph 166(2)(d) obliges an aircraft outside the circuit wishing to land to join the circuit and to do so in a particular way (unless making a straight-in approach).
Conforming with the circuit pattern means flying an aircraft in the circuit pattern that is defined by any other aircraft already flying in the circuit. Joining the circuit pattern occurs when the aircraft first enters the circuit.
An aircraft which is outside the circuit pattern for an aerodrome and wishes to land at the aerodrome has two options: (a) to join the circuit pattern in accordance with CAR 166(2)(d) or CAR 166(4), and then conform with the circuit in accordance with CAR 166(2)(c); or (b) to avoid the circuit in accordance with CAR 166(2)(c) and carry out an approach in accordance with CAR 166(3).
In respect of your request for advice as to why there is a provision for a strict liability defence of reasonable excuse in 166A but not in 166, I am advised that the defence of reasonable excuse was provided for an offence against subregulation 166A(3) because it only deals with the operation of radio, and that may be reasonable circumstances where the pilot is unable to comply. It is not appropriate to provide for a reasonable excuse defence for the essential safety-related behaviour required by CAR 166. Naturally, the defence of mistake of fact is still available in relation to the strict liability offences in CAR 166.
Thank you for raising these matters with me.
Yours sincerely

Dear Minister

Thank you for your letter of 6 February 2006 (reference 07719-2005) responding to Committee concerns in relation to the Civil Aviation Amendment Regulations 2005 (No. 3), Select Legislative Instrument 2005 No. 243. In general terms, these Regulations introduce new pilot operating procedures on, and in the vicinity of, non-controlled aerodromes.

In your letter, you point out that an aircraft which wishes to land at a non-controlled aerodrome has two options: to join the circuit pattern and land in conformity with the circuit, or to avoid the circuit and carry out a straight-in approach. Under subregulation 166(3), a pilot may choose to carry out a straight-in approach only if the aircraft is equipped with a serviceable radio, and the pilot broadcasts an intention to make such an approach on the frequency in use at the aerodrome, and the wind direction and usable runways are appropriate for such an approach, and final approach is established at least 5 miles from the landing runway, and the pilot gives way to any other aircraft established and flying the circuit pattern.


While subregulation 166(3) imposes a measure of control over the use of straight-in approaches, it is not clear how it will operate in all potential situations. For example, how can the pilot of the aircraft carrying out the straight-in approach be certain of the position of all other aircraft in the vicinity of the aerodrome, particularly those already in, or about to join, the circuit pattern? For the purposes of right of way, is there potential for uncertainty as to whether another aircraft is “established and flying in the circuit pattern” or about to join the circuit. For the purposes of ensuring adequate communication between all aircraft in the vicinity of the aerodrome, should the requirement as to having a serviceable radio, operating on the relevant frequency, be imposed on all those aircraft? Do the new procedures take adequate account of the possibility that inexperienced or trainee pilots might also be in the vicinity of the aerodrome? Finally, to avoid the possibility of any misunderstandings between pilots as to their position or intention, is there any benefit in providing that straight-in approaches should only be undertaken when there are no other aircraft flying in the circuit pattern? The Committee would appreciate clarification of these issues.

The Committee would appreciate your advice on the above matters as soon as possible, but before 1 March 2006, to enable it to finalise its consideration of these Regulations. Correspondence should be directed to Senator John Watson, Chairman, Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, Room SG49, Parliament House, Canberra.

Dear Senator Watson


Thank you for your Committee’s letter of 9 February 2006 regarding Civil Aviation Amendment Regulations 2005 (No 3), Select Legislative Instrument 2005 No. 243. I note that the Committee’s questions appear to fall outside its terms of reference, however I am happy to respond.


In respect of your request for clarification of the operation of the provisions in paragraph 166(3), I have now received advice from the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA). In relation to your specific questions, I offer the following:


1. How can the pilot of the aircraft carrying out the straight-in approach be certain of the position of all other aircraft in the vicinity of the aerodrome ... ? The intention of the recommended suite of continually updated position-based broadcasts is to enable pilots to develop situational awareness or a mental picture of traffic in the vicinity of the aerodrome. In addition, pilots are required to maintain a lookout so as to visually acquire other aircraft. The combination of radio broadcasts and visual lookout is a long standing practice in Australia and elsewhere.


2. 
For the purposes of right of way is there potential for uncertainty as to whether another aircraft is established ... in .... or joining the circuit?
 Regardless of the system employed, there will always be the potential for some uncertainty. That is why pilots are required to maintain a lookout in 166(2)(a). However, if pilots make the appropriate radio broadcasts, that uncertainty is reduced or eliminated. In the case of aircraft not equipped with radio, their position track and altitude relative to the runway provides a visual indication of whether they are established in or joining the circuit.


3. For the purposes of ensuring adequate communication ...should the requirement as to having a serviceable radio ... be imposed on all those aircraft? This is done now where CASA has determined that traffic levels and mix create an unacceptable risk to aviation safety. However at most non-controlled aerodromes traffic levels are too low to justify the mandatory carriage of radio.


4. Do the new procedures take adequate account of the possibility that trainee or inexperienced pilots may also be in the vicinity of the aerodrome? Yes. All pilots are taught the procedures as part of their training. As only a small percentage of the total pilot population at most non-controlled aerodromes are trainees, their contribution to overall risk is small. The standardisation on one set of procedures across all aerodromes also assists trainee and inexperienced pilots.


5. ...Is there any benefit in providing that straight-in approaches should only be done when there are no other aircraft flying in the circuit... ? No. The imposition of such a restriction would unnecessarily prohibit a recognised safe and efficient procedure for aircraft landing. The procedure is in use all over the world and has been used in Australia for more than 
15
 years with no evidence of significant collision risk.


Thank you for raising these matters with me.


Yours sincerely

CANBERRA ACT 2600
Dear Minister

I refer to Instrument No. CASA 383/05 made under regulation 179A of the Civil Aviation Regulations 1988 that specifies instructions for the navigation of an aircraft under the Instrument Flight Rules.
The Committee notes that clause 8 in Schedule 1 to this Instrument makes reference to “a long flight over water”. There is no reference in clause 8 to any definition of what constitutes a “long flight”. The Committee therefore seeks your advice on whether the clause should contain a reference to such a definition.
The Committee would appreciate your advice on the above matter as soon as possible, but before 23 January 2006, to enable it to finalise its consideration of this Instrument. Correspondence should be directed to the Chairman, Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, Room SG49, Parliament House, Canberra.

Dear Senator Mason


I refer to your letter dated 1 December 2005 regarding Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) Instrument No. CASA 383/05 made under regulation 179A of the Civil 
Aviation Regulations 1988
 that specifies instructions for the navigation of an aircraft under Instrument Flight Rules. I apologise for the delay in providing a response.


The Committee noted that clause 8 in Schedule 1 to this Instrument makes reference to “a long flight over water” without defining what may constitute a “long flight”. The Committee sought advice on whether the clause should contain a reference to such a definition.


I am advised that clause 8 of Schedule 1 to the Instrument seeks to prevent an aircraft remaining off track for the remaining part of a flight once an off-track situation is detected.


If an aircraft is off track, the shortest way to the destination is a straight line. However, the aircraft will remain off track for the remainder of the flight if the aircraft is flown from its off-track position direct to the destination. Not regaining the flight plan track, while providing the least flight time, may compromise safety through a breakdown of the applicable traffic separation standard as there is an expectation that the aircraft will be navigated along the flight plan track.


Clause 8 in Schedule 1 to this Instrument requires the pilot in command of an aircraft to cause the aircraft to resume its flight plan track within 200 miles of detecting the off-track situation.


In the context of the Instrument, a “long flight” is one where an off-track position is detected more than 200 miles from the flight destination. The clause only applies to aircraft operating under the I.F.R. in oceanic airspace, which are almost exclusively sophisticated jet operations. Operators involved in such operations have procedures designed to ensure compliance with the requirements of this clause, and understand its purpose and effect.


Accordingly, I am advised that it is CASA’s view that a definition of a “long flight” is not required for the purposes of clause 8 in Schedule I to this Instrument.


Thank you for raising this matter with me.


Yours sincerely

No. 8        Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority Bill 2005
                  Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2005

—I ask the minister to tell us what government business Nos 8 and 9 are, please.
—Thank you, Senator Brown. Have you got a SenateOrder of Business? Have you got the red?
—What do you think?
—The short answer is that if you looked at your red, Senator Brown, you would see that government business orders of the day Nos 8 and 9 relate to the Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority Bill 2005 and the Jurisdiction of Courts (Family Law) Bill 2005 [2006].

That on Monday, 27 March 2006:
the hours of meeting shall be 2.30 pm to 6.30 pm and 7.30 pm to 10.30 pm; and
the routine of business shall be:

the items specified in standing order 57(1)(a)(iii) to (xi).
—I have no objection to that, but I again ask the minister to explain why the motion is necessary.
—This will enable the lunch which is being held for Prime Minister Blair to take place. It will allow the sitting times to better fit in with the lunch.
—I seek leave to make a brief statement about that matter.
—No! Well, only if it is short. Yesterday you went too long.
Leave granted.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Rearrangement</title>,Business,3,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2006-03-02,"—I thank Senator Patterson, amongst others, for that generosity. The visit of Prime Minister Blair is rapidly coming upon us, and I think it is very important to recognise that he is not a head of state. Indeed, he is somewhat of a fading star in global politics. However, it is important to note that we have not yet been notified about an address that is proposed by Prime Minister Blair—
—It’s on the red.
—Okay. It is there on the list now. Let me put a point of view here that is somewhat different from the prime ministerial point of view, because this is a directive, if you like, from the Prime Minister. We have in this place a Great Hall. It should not just be for the raising of huge amounts of money by political parties. It should be put into the service of the people of Australia generally. It is the proper place for visiting heads of state and also people who are not heads of state, like Prime Minister Blair, to address parliamentarians and, indeed, citizens of this country. That is what the Great Hall’s function is.
The use of the chambers of parliament is for those elected to this parliament under our democratic system. The proposal that we go to the House of Representatives to listen to the address from Prime Minister Blair is second-rate. We ought to be going to the Great Hall of this parliament. The Senate should not be seen as a secondary house. We should not be simply falling into a process whereby the Prime Minister of this country wants to aggrandise himself and make determinations about how and when this parliament should be used. Of course, the members of the government will rubber-stamp this proposal, but I want to make it absolutely clear that visiting politicians, whatever their status might be, should be addressing parliamentarians and members of the public in the Great Hall. That is the proper function of the Great Hall.
—Mr President, I rise on a point of order. We gave Senator Brown leave to speak on the motion. The motion was about changing the time of the sitting of the Senate, not about where Mr Blair would speak. I would ask you to draw him to the motion.
—There is no point of order, but Senator Brown did say that he sought leave to make a brief statement. I remind him of what he said.
—I am just about finished, but I take note of the clone who has just interrupted. The fact is that we should have a debate about this matter because we are talking about the use of the parliament of this nation.
—Mr President, I rise on a point of order. There are appropriate ways to address a senator. Senator Brown knows what those appropriate ways are. The discourtesy of Senator Brown is most unwelcome. I invite Senator Brown to address senators with their appropriate names and to withdraw the expression he used.
—Senator Brown, I did not actually quite hear what you said, but I do not think it was an endearing term. I would ask you to withdraw that remark. I think it may have been offensive.
—If the—
—I am asking you to withdraw it.
—I am happy to, because I note that Senator Patterson—
—I am also reminding you about your original request to make a brief statement.
—Senator Patterson does not want to be seen as being identified so closely with or like the Prime Minister. That is okay; I can understand that. I can see why that would be offensive. The fact is that the Great Hall of this parliament is the proper place for great speeches and great presentations. We should not have either house of this parliament used as a stamping ground for the aggrandisement of the Prime Minister.
—I seek leave to make a brief statement as well.
—Mr President, I rise on a point of order. I mean no disrespect to Senator Bartlett, but it seems to me that we are having this debate at the wrong point. If senators followed the red they would see that this resolution relates to the sitting times in order to allow senators to attend the lunch. I think what we are having is a concern about the message which comes under item 7 on the red regarding the resolution carried by the House of Representatives regarding the invitation. I would just bring that to your attention, Mr President. It seems to me that we are going around in circles on the wrong issue.
—If I can just enlighten you, Senator, I understand that the message will be related to the Senate. If someone wishes to comment on that they would have to seek leave, as they are now. So it is six of one and half-a-dozen of the other.
—I am happy to speak later. I was going to speak later but because the debate had started I thought I would finish it all now and get it out of the way.
Leave granted.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Rearrangement</title>,Business,3,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2006-03-02,"—I thank the Senate. Just briefly, even though this motion does relate to the lunch—and I have not decided whether I will go or not, not that anyone will particularly care—I do think that, following on from other comments, it has been the Democrat view, repeatedly stated, that the Great Hall is a better place for addresses by visiting foreign leaders. But I should note that the message that is going to appear from the House of Representatives does conform with recommendations and, indeed, a resolution adopted by the Senate and I think by the House of Representatives after the last occasions where we had visiting dignitaries speaking. So it has at least been an advance in that the government is listening to the recommendations and resolutions put forward regarding these sorts of addresses.
It is still something that obviously changes a bit as we go along because Mr Blair is not a head of state, of course. Indeed, I think we have a head of state in the country at the time who is not coming to address us here. But that is a separate matter. I certainly have always preferred the Great Hall to the House of Representatives, but at least the structure of it this time is by way of invitation rather than some so-called joint sitting of dubious constitutionality. So at least it is a step forward, although I still would suggest that the Great Hall is more appropriate and that we do have some codified set of procedures for these sorts of things.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Rearrangement</title>,Business,3,1
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2006-03-02,"—by leave—I think it is important that we remember that we did deal with these issues in response to some difficulties that arose last time about a joint sitting of the parliament. I do not want to go over that ground. It was pretty well covered at the time. But, as the Clerk reminds me, we did have a report from the Senate Standing Committee of Privileges, the Senate Standing Committee on Procedure and House of Representatives Standing Committee on Procedure which recommended this as a better course of action to get over the difficulties we found with a joint sitting. Whilst this is not the motion on which we ought to be having this debate, I would just indicate that Labor will be supporting it on the basis that that was the procedure recommended. I think there is a great deal of sympathy around the parliament for doing these things as a gathering in the Great Hall because both chambers are treated with equal respect. But, given that we carried the motion we did to overcome the difficulties last time, this seems to me to be at least a reasonable way to proceed.
Question agreed to.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Rearrangement</title>,Business,3,1
"O’Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2006-03-02,"—I move:
That the following matter be referred to the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee for inquiry and report by 16 October 2006:
The adequacy of Australia’s aviation safety regime, with particular reference to the performance by the Civil Aviation Safety Authority of its functions under the Civil Aviation Act 1988.
I must say at the start that I am disappointed that government senators are opposing this reference. I am not surprised the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, Warren Truss, is opposed to it and is calling for government senators to oppose this motion, because this reference was a test for him—a test he has failed. Mr Truss does not want Australia’s aviation safety regulatory regime subjected to a detailed examination by a committee of the parliament, and the question needs to be asked: why? It is obvious that it is because he is worried what an inquiry might reveal.
Let me outline what Labor proposes: a general inquiry by the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee into our aviation safety regime, with particular reference to the performance of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority, to report by 16 October 2006. There is nothing out of the ordinary in that proposal. Indeed, inquiries of this kind used to be the bread and butter of Senate references committees. That was, of course, before the Howard government gained a stranglehold on this chamber and made a deliberate decision to choke it to death. Another important change has occurred: Liberal and National Party senators no longer exercise any will of their own. They take the whip not just from their respective party rooms but straight from the executive. In this case it is a National Party minister calling the shots: the metaphorical tail wagging the dog.
Let me turn to the question of why this inquiry is so necessary and to the reason the government’s decision to block the reference is contemptible. The simple fact is that many Australians have lost confidence in Australia’s aviation safety regime. In particular, they have lost confidence in CASA, the Civil Aviation Safety Authority. A recent survey commissioned by CASA that measures views on aviation safety in Australia shows that many Australians have lost confidence in flying. This survey, released in January, shows that public confidence has fallen since it had last been measured, in 2002. CASA’s own survey shows that complete confidence in arriving safely when flying between capital cities has fallen to 36 per cent, from 41 per cent in 2002. Complete confidence in arriving safely when flying between regional towns has fallen to 24 per cent, from 27 per cent in 2002. The simple fact is that Australians ought to have complete confidence that they will arrive safely when travelling on any commercial flight within Australia. It is disturbing that complete confidence has declined over the past three years.
The survey also reveals that the percentage of Australians who say flying in Australia is safer than flying in countries like the United States has fallen to 53 per cent, from 60 per cent in 2002. That is a worrying fall in confidence, given that the 2002 survey followed the 11 September 2001 terrorist attack in the United States.
CASA did, of course, report the survey results with a big dose of self-congratulation. According to CASA, public confidence is ‘sky high’ and the survey results are ‘good news for the aviation industry’. That is what they say. At the time the survey was released I urged CASA to reverse the decline in public confidence in flying by concentrating on its core activity: improving safety in Australian skies—that is, a little more action and a little less public relations, please. The reality is that if Australians lack confidence in flying the responsibility rests with the regulator.
It really is no surprise that public confidence in falling, particularly in regional aviation. Australia has experienced a series of disastrous aviation events over recent months and years. The most tragic, of course, was the Lockhart River tragedy. Fifteen Australians lost their lives on 7 May last year when a Fairchild Metroliner operated by Transair crashed and exploded in flames near the Lockhart River airstrip. Like some, but certainly not most, senators in this place, I have landed at that airstrip in recent times. That incident shook me. More importantly, it devastated the families of the people on board that flight. Many months later, these families are still waiting for answers.
Mr Shane Urquhart, the father of Ms Sally Urquhart, a young Queensland policewoman who died in the crash, supports this inquiry. In fact, he has told Australian Associated Press that a move to block the inquiry would show that the government has ‘something to hide’. Mr Urquhart says a decision to block this inquiry would ‘show the government has no compassion, no concern for its citizens getting justice, and lacks the guts to question anything CASA does’. Of all the words spoken in this debate, including my own, none will be more powerfully expressed, more powerfully felt, than those words. A decision to block the inquiry would—I quote Mr Urquhart again—‘show the government has no compassion, no concern for its citizens getting justice, and lacks the guts to question anything CASA does’.
It is not just getting answers from CASA about its performance in the lead-up to the Lockhart River tragedy that motivates Mr Urquhart and other relatives of those killed in May last year. By supporting a public inquiry into CASA’s performance, they want to make sure that something like this will not happen again. I have no doubt that at some time in this debate a government senator will say something like: ‘Well, hang on, you can ask all the questions you like during Senate estimates hearings; you don’t need a references inquiry.’ To that I say: turn to the Hansard of May last year and you will discover that the CEO of CASA, Mr Byron, was too busy to appear to answer questions. He skipped estimates to attend a one-day aviation conference in Europe, the cost of which the government is still refusing to reveal.
Have a close look at that Hansard and you will find CASA evidence that it conducted a full audit of Transair’s operations before the Lockhart River tragedy and gave the airline the all clear. That is evidence the regulator gave again at October and February estimates hearings, despite a finding by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau that there were manifest deficiencies in the airline’s operations, including a failure to lodge load sheets at departure and a failure to ensure pilots had the training mandated in the company’s operations manual. What the Senate estimates committee has heard from CASA are excuses, not answers.
On the question of risk profiling, CASA has refused to reveal whether Transair was clearly identified near the top of its risk profile table in the months leading up to the May 2005 tragedy—the top meaning the biggest risk. That is my understanding, but CASA has obfuscated for months. First, senior officers said they could not remember. Then they told us the risk profiling was unreliable. Recently, they claimed the risk-profiling table was filled with dummy numbers just to show what it could do if they ever got it to work. None of that is good enough.
No senator in this place should be satisfied with CASA’s defence of its performance in relation to the Lockhart River disaster. My colleague Senator McLucas has not been satisfied and has battled for months to get answers from CASA on why it gave Transair a clean bill of health when it was demonstrably not deserving of that treatment. A parliamentary inquiry that shines a spotlight on the agency is the very best way to establish whether the agency did the job it was tasked to do by this parliament.
Of course, it is not just the Lockhart River tragedy that has raised serious questions about CASA’s performance. The regulator has been subject to trenchant criticism from a Western Australian coroner in relation to air tragedies in that state. A series of skydiving deaths has raised questions about CASA’s role in the regulation of sports aviation. And then there is the stock-in-trade concern about the performance of the regulator in relation to general aviation.
It is not just this side of the parliament that receives complaints about CASA’s performance, either. Recently we have all heard horror stories about CASA’s handling of pilot photo IDs. We have also heard complaints about CASA’s new cost-recovery based charging regime. Senator Eggleston came into the Senate a couple of months ago and laid out a case against CASA in relation to its dealings with Polar Aviation, a company operating in his home state of Western Australia. He said at that time that the ‘claim that CASA has failed the test of an impartial regulator seems not unreasonable’. He went on:
It seems difficult not to conclude that the behaviour of CASA in this matter warrants further investigation.
It seems not unreasonable for Polar Aviation—and, indeed, anyone who heard that speech—to expect Senator Eggleston to join Labor senators in supporting this motion. It is not unreasonable to expect that rural and regionally based senators on the other side would support an inquiry into CASA—for example, Senator Boswell, someone who claims to champion regional Australia, or Senator Joyce, someone who knows a thing or two about flying in regional Queensland.
It is not just past performance that requires scrutiny. The regulator’s recent announcement of wide-ranging changes to its operations, including the so-called ‘acceptable means of compliance’ safety regime, lends weight to the case for a wide-ranging parliamentary inquiry. This restructure has a backdrop that also warrants attention by a parliamentary inquiry, not least the murky market-testing process clouded in claims—well-established claims, in my view—of conflict of interest. In relation to the new arrangements announced by Mr Byron, the Chief Executive Officer of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority, just hours before the last estimates hearing, questions remain about its rationale and its likely efficacy.
I should not need to tell the Senate that mistakes by aviation safety regulators matter. Each element of the new arrangement announced hastily by Mr Byron before the last estimates is deserving of scrutiny by the parliament, scrutiny that is just not possible within the constraints of an estimates hearing. A references inquiry would give stakeholders an opportunity to make submissions on CASA’s performance, an opportunity that is not available in the estimates process. It would also give CASA an opportunity to explain its role and, if necessary, defend its performance from its critics. So it is even handed. It would afford the parliament the opportunity to have a look at our overall aviation safety regime, including the role played by other agencies. It would give us the chance to look at what we are doing right in aviation safety. Just as importantly, it would give us the chance to look at what we are doing that is not right.
I implore all senators in this place to support this reference. Do not hide behind an excuse that it is not specific to one incident in your own state, as one senator suggested to me was a justification for not supporting this inquiry. If you believe that there are elements in one incident that warrant an inquiry into CASA then why would you withhold scrutiny from CASA in relation to all other matters of concern raised by Australians? Why would you deny Australians with those concerns the opportunity to place before parliament their concerns, to put them on the Hansard, to enable them to be tested by the committee and to ultimately have the report of this committee come to this chamber and go to the minister so that he can be assisted in his administration of his portfolio?
At the end of the day, if the minister wants to hide CASA from scrutiny then it is the minister who will be responsible if the system continues to break down. As Mr Urquhart said, the government needs to have the guts to give the Senate the power to look at CASA because, at the end of the day, Australians want to have confidence in the aviation safety regime. They want to have confidence in the regulator, but every time the government hides the regulator from the scrutiny of parliament, more questions will be raised in the minds of doubters in the Australian community about Australia’s aviation safety regime. More questions will be asked. The numbers in CASA’s survey will probably deteriorate further, indicating a deterioration in confidence in the safety of Australia’s aviation regime, and ultimately that is not good for any operator of an aviation service in this country.
It is certainly not good for the public. It is not good for the parliament generally. And it will not be a good thing for this minister, Mr Warren Truss, because at the end of the day it will be seen that he has obscured an authority over which he has ultimate control from the scrutiny of the parliament. So let us get behind this. Let us see if coalition senators will actually refuse to take direction from the executive, will support the establishment of an inquiry, will allow the parliamentary committee to do its work and will allow accountable scrutiny of the authority that regulates safety in our skies.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee</title>,Committees,15,1
"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,2006-03-02,"—I must say I am somewhat astonished that the government have not taken the opportunity to put on the record their reasons why they are opposing this reference. This is an appalling situation. I am wondering where Senator Boswell and Senator Joyce are, to tell us why they are going to vote against a reasonable, sensible and timely inquiry into the operation of Australia’s air transport regulator. This is an appalling state of affairs. Where are these senators who walk around and say that they are the people who defend rural and regional Queensland? Why are they opposing an inquiry that will allow my constituents some opportunity to understand what CASA was doing in the lead-up to the Lockhart River tragedy? It is an appalling state of affairs.
On 7 May 2005, a plane travelling from Bamaga to Cairns via Lockhart River crashed when attempting to land at the Lockhart River airstrip. Fifteen people were killed in that tragedy—two pilots and 13 passengers. Most of those people were my constituents—can I say, ‘our constituents’; Senator Boswell’s, Senator Joyce’s and my constituents. Yet those senators are not here to explain why they are not going to allow an inquiry that will give the relatives of those people who died an opportunity to understand what CASA was doing in the lead-up to this appalling tragedy.
We know, through the Australian Transport Safety Bureau interim factual report which was released on 16 December 2005, that a number of deficiencies were found that CASA could have dealt with if they had, in the view of many, been doing their job properly. That interim factual report found that the copilot was not approved to conduct an RNAV (GNSS) approach—the type of approach that was being attempted on that tragic day. This was in contradiction of the company’s operation manual. The interim factual report also found that a load sheet was not left at the aerodrome of departure—the town of Bamaga. It also found, astonishingly, that it was not routine practice for Transair to leave a load sheet at the Bamaga airport. This was also in contravention of the company’s operation manual. The cockpit voice recorder was not functioning, and no data from it was usable. The report also found that it had not been functioning for quite some time.
We may well ask why this is relevant to the inquiry which is the subject of the debate today. Following questioning at estimates, CASA has revealed that in early 2005, prior to the tragedy, it conducted what it called ‘a fulsome audit’—an audit which in the view of many, including me, should have revealed the persistent noncompliance of Transair with the company’s operation manual. That is something that it is obliged to do under air safety regulations. It did an audit, but it did not find out that the copilot was not qualified. CASA actually travelled the same route with the same two pilots—those two pilots who were tragically killed—and did not check to see if that pilot was qualified to do the instrument landing that he was attempting that day. How did that happen? We need answers to these sorts of questions, and this inquiry would allow the families of those people who were killed to ask those questions, to put their views on the record and to ask CASA what it was doing. What did it do during that ‘fulsome audit’ that did not reveal the noncompliance with the company’s operation manual?
Further, in the last estimates CASA explained that, partly as a result of the Lockhart River tragedy, a number of internal procedures are proposed to be changed. Those procedures require scrutiny. We want to know what they intend to do and why we have to wait until 15 people are killed before they change their internal operations. What is wrong with this organisation that watched—it is probably too strong to say allowed—an event happen? We need to understand that. That is why it is timely that this inquiry occur—an inquiry that will allow for scrutiny of CASA’s actions prior to the tragedy. It will also allow the families of those who were killed to provide their evidence to the committee.
Not only North Queenslanders have lost confidence in the regulator of aviation and, particularly, in light aircraft aviation over the last 12 months; as my colleague Senator O’Brien has identified, many Australians have diminished confidence in the ability of this government to monitor the safety and compliance of aviation generally. However, when you go to North Queensland and you see the data on the number of incidents and, unfortunately, the number of deaths that we have had, you know it is absolutely timely that an inquiry of this nature proceed.
You cannot simply stand by and say, ‘CASA had nothing to do with the fact that 15 people died at Lockhart River.’ Surely Senator Boswell and Senator Joyce have a responsibility to allow this inquiry to proceed. What do they have to hide? More importantly, who are they protecting? The bottom line is that Liberal Party and National Party senators are lining up today to protect Mr Truss and, before him, Mr Anderson rather than allow the proper scrutiny of the actions of CASA in the lead-up to the Lockhart River tragedy. For all of the bluster of Senator Boswell and Senator Joyce, protecting their leader is more important than allowing scrutiny of Australia’s air transport regulator.
This inquiry is important for Queenslanders—in particular, Far North Queenslanders. They were my constituents, and their families need answers. The number of incidents and, in fact, deaths in North Queensland needs explanation. We need a restoration of confidence in the aviation sector in North Queensland. Cape York Peninsula and the Torres Strait rely on general aviation and regular passenger transport systems in order to connect with the rest of the world. It is not a frivolous part of our life. We have to use planes to get where we need to go. Many of the people of the Torres Strait live on islands. They have to use general aviation—it is like the rest of Australia using roads. But we want to have confidence that when we get on a plane it is going to be okay, and we do not have that anymore. This inquiry would allow scrutiny of our air transport regulator to continue, and I demand that Senator Boswell and Senator Joyce come into this chamber and explain why they cannot support an inquiry that would at least give us some understanding of CASA’s role and would potentially restore some confidence in the aviation sector. It is appalling that they are not here.

"O’Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2006-03-02,"—I move:
That the following matter be referred to the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee for inquiry and report by 16 October 2006:
The adequacy of Australia’s aviation safety regime, with particular reference to the performance by the Civil Aviation Safety Authority of its functions under the Civil Aviation Act 1988.
I must say at the start that I am disappointed that government senators are opposing this reference. I am not surprised the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, Warren Truss, is opposed to it and is calling for government senators to oppose this motion, because this reference was a test for him—a test he has failed. Mr Truss does not want Australia’s aviation safety regulatory regime subjected to a detailed examination by a committee of the parliament, and the question needs to be asked: why? It is obvious that it is because he is worried what an inquiry might reveal.
Let me outline what Labor proposes: a general inquiry by the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee into our aviation safety regime, with particular reference to the performance of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority, to report by 16 October 2006. There is nothing out of the ordinary in that proposal. Indeed, inquiries of this kind used to be the bread and butter of Senate references committees. That was, of course, before the Howard government gained a stranglehold on this chamber and made a deliberate decision to choke it to death. Another important change has occurred: Liberal and National Party senators no longer exercise any will of their own. They take the whip not just from their respective party rooms but straight from the executive. In this case it is a National Party minister calling the shots: the metaphorical tail wagging the dog.
Let me turn to the question of why this inquiry is so necessary and to the reason the government’s decision to block the reference is contemptible. The simple fact is that many Australians have lost confidence in Australia’s aviation safety regime. In particular, they have lost confidence in CASA, the Civil Aviation Safety Authority. A recent survey commissioned by CASA that measures views on aviation safety in Australia shows that many Australians have lost confidence in flying. This survey, released in January, shows that public confidence has fallen since it had last been measured, in 2002. CASA’s own survey shows that complete confidence in arriving safely when flying between capital cities has fallen to 36 per cent, from 41 per cent in 2002. Complete confidence in arriving safely when flying between regional towns has fallen to 24 per cent, from 27 per cent in 2002. The simple fact is that Australians ought to have complete confidence that they will arrive safely when travelling on any commercial flight within Australia. It is disturbing that complete confidence has declined over the past three years.
The survey also reveals that the percentage of Australians who say flying in Australia is safer than flying in countries like the United States has fallen to 53 per cent, from 60 per cent in 2002. That is a worrying fall in confidence, given that the 2002 survey followed the 11 September 2001 terrorist attack in the United States.
CASA did, of course, report the survey results with a big dose of self-congratulation. According to CASA, public confidence is ‘sky high’ and the survey results are ‘good news for the aviation industry’. That is what they say. At the time the survey was released I urged CASA to reverse the decline in public confidence in flying by concentrating on its core activity: improving safety in Australian skies—that is, a little more action and a little less public relations, please. The reality is that if Australians lack confidence in flying the responsibility rests with the regulator.
It really is no surprise that public confidence in falling, particularly in regional aviation. Australia has experienced a series of disastrous aviation events over recent months and years. The most tragic, of course, was the Lockhart River tragedy. Fifteen Australians lost their lives on 7 May last year when a Fairchild Metroliner operated by Transair crashed and exploded in flames near the Lockhart River airstrip. Like some, but certainly not most, senators in this place, I have landed at that airstrip in recent times. That incident shook me. More importantly, it devastated the families of the people on board that flight. Many months later, these families are still waiting for answers.
Mr Shane Urquhart, the father of Ms Sally Urquhart, a young Queensland policewoman who died in the crash, supports this inquiry. In fact, he has told Australian Associated Press that a move to block the inquiry would show that the government has ‘something to hide’. Mr Urquhart says a decision to block this inquiry would ‘show the government has no compassion, no concern for its citizens getting justice, and lacks the guts to question anything CASA does’. Of all the words spoken in this debate, including my own, none will be more powerfully expressed, more powerfully felt, than those words. A decision to block the inquiry would—I quote Mr Urquhart again—‘show the government has no compassion, no concern for its citizens getting justice, and lacks the guts to question anything CASA does’.
It is not just getting answers from CASA about its performance in the lead-up to the Lockhart River tragedy that motivates Mr Urquhart and other relatives of those killed in May last year. By supporting a public inquiry into CASA’s performance, they want to make sure that something like this will not happen again. I have no doubt that at some time in this debate a government senator will say something like: ‘Well, hang on, you can ask all the questions you like during Senate estimates hearings; you don’t need a references inquiry.’ To that I say: turn to the Hansard of May last year and you will discover that the CEO of CASA, Mr Byron, was too busy to appear to answer questions. He skipped estimates to attend a one-day aviation conference in Europe, the cost of which the government is still refusing to reveal.
Have a close look at that Hansard and you will find CASA evidence that it conducted a full audit of Transair’s operations before the Lockhart River tragedy and gave the airline the all clear. That is evidence the regulator gave again at October and February estimates hearings, despite a finding by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau that there were manifest deficiencies in the airline’s operations, including a failure to lodge load sheets at departure and a failure to ensure pilots had the training mandated in the company’s operations manual. What the Senate estimates committee has heard from CASA are excuses, not answers.
On the question of risk profiling, CASA has refused to reveal whether Transair was clearly identified near the top of its risk profile table in the months leading up to the May 2005 tragedy—the top meaning the biggest risk. That is my understanding, but CASA has obfuscated for months. First, senior officers said they could not remember. Then they told us the risk profiling was unreliable. Recently, they claimed the risk-profiling table was filled with dummy numbers just to show what it could do if they ever got it to work. None of that is good enough.
No senator in this place should be satisfied with CASA’s defence of its performance in relation to the Lockhart River disaster. My colleague Senator McLucas has not been satisfied and has battled for months to get answers from CASA on why it gave Transair a clean bill of health when it was demonstrably not deserving of that treatment. A parliamentary inquiry that shines a spotlight on the agency is the very best way to establish whether the agency did the job it was tasked to do by this parliament.
Of course, it is not just the Lockhart River tragedy that has raised serious questions about CASA’s performance. The regulator has been subject to trenchant criticism from a Western Australian coroner in relation to air tragedies in that state. A series of skydiving deaths has raised questions about CASA’s role in the regulation of sports aviation. And then there is the stock-in-trade concern about the performance of the regulator in relation to general aviation.
It is not just this side of the parliament that receives complaints about CASA’s performance, either. Recently we have all heard horror stories about CASA’s handling of pilot photo IDs. We have also heard complaints about CASA’s new cost-recovery based charging regime. Senator Eggleston came into the Senate a couple of months ago and laid out a case against CASA in relation to its dealings with Polar Aviation, a company operating in his home state of Western Australia. He said at that time that the ‘claim that CASA has failed the test of an impartial regulator seems not unreasonable’. He went on:
It seems difficult not to conclude that the behaviour of CASA in this matter warrants further investigation.
It seems not unreasonable for Polar Aviation—and, indeed, anyone who heard that speech—to expect Senator Eggleston to join Labor senators in supporting this motion. It is not unreasonable to expect that rural and regionally based senators on the other side would support an inquiry into CASA—for example, Senator Boswell, someone who claims to champion regional Australia, or Senator Joyce, someone who knows a thing or two about flying in regional Queensland.
It is not just past performance that requires scrutiny. The regulator’s recent announcement of wide-ranging changes to its operations, including the so-called ‘acceptable means of compliance’ safety regime, lends weight to the case for a wide-ranging parliamentary inquiry. This restructure has a backdrop that also warrants attention by a parliamentary inquiry, not least the murky market-testing process clouded in claims—well-established claims, in my view—of conflict of interest. In relation to the new arrangements announced by Mr Byron, the Chief Executive Officer of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority, just hours before the last estimates hearing, questions remain about its rationale and its likely efficacy.
I should not need to tell the Senate that mistakes by aviation safety regulators matter. Each element of the new arrangement announced hastily by Mr Byron before the last estimates is deserving of scrutiny by the parliament, scrutiny that is just not possible within the constraints of an estimates hearing. A references inquiry would give stakeholders an opportunity to make submissions on CASA’s performance, an opportunity that is not available in the estimates process. It would also give CASA an opportunity to explain its role and, if necessary, defend its performance from its critics. So it is even handed. It would afford the parliament the opportunity to have a look at our overall aviation safety regime, including the role played by other agencies. It would give us the chance to look at what we are doing right in aviation safety. Just as importantly, it would give us the chance to look at what we are doing that is not right.
I implore all senators in this place to support this reference. Do not hide behind an excuse that it is not specific to one incident in your own state, as one senator suggested to me was a justification for not supporting this inquiry. If you believe that there are elements in one incident that warrant an inquiry into CASA then why would you withhold scrutiny from CASA in relation to all other matters of concern raised by Australians? Why would you deny Australians with those concerns the opportunity to place before parliament their concerns, to put them on the Hansard, to enable them to be tested by the committee and to ultimately have the report of this committee come to this chamber and go to the minister so that he can be assisted in his administration of his portfolio?
At the end of the day, if the minister wants to hide CASA from scrutiny then it is the minister who will be responsible if the system continues to break down. As Mr Urquhart said, the government needs to have the guts to give the Senate the power to look at CASA because, at the end of the day, Australians want to have confidence in the aviation safety regime. They want to have confidence in the regulator, but every time the government hides the regulator from the scrutiny of parliament, more questions will be raised in the minds of doubters in the Australian community about Australia’s aviation safety regime.

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2006-03-02,"—I would like to add the Greens’ support for this motion. It has been clear for quite some time that the Commonwealth State/Territory Disability Agreement needs some review. When I came new to this portfolio I very quickly became aware that there were significant problems in this sector. In Western Australia alone there is still a vast amount of unmet need for carers in this sector. In fact, we do not really have an understanding of the unmet need in Western Australia because people have actually given up asking. They are so sick of filling in complicated forms that they do not apply anymore. Many carers have said to me that they feel like it is a race to compare how bad your situation is before you can get attention. People are so demoralised by this.
I have heard many disappointing and distressing stories. Just recently I was in Albany and met with a well-known person in Albany who told me the story of what had happened with her husband who suffered from dementia and how hard it was for her to get respite care. They found that what was happening in Albany was that places that should have been reserved for people for short-term respite—to give carers of people some respite—were being filled by long-term patients because it was more economically viable for the centres to fill their places with long-term patients. While that of course is good for the long-term patients and meets a need there, unfortunately there are many people who are missing out because all they need is respite for short periods of time—and they are not getting that.
I have also learned of a change in service provider. While I am not in any way disparaging the service provider it was changed to, what was explained to me was the complicated nature of trying to get service there now and that people are confused about where to go for service. There was not a seamless changeover. I understand that is happening in other regional centres—that there have not been seamless changeovers of care providers who have contracts to provide some of the services. I also understand that there is very little idea of the unmet need for care providers in other states.
I have looked at the first, second and third agreements between the states, and I think there has been a definite shift of Commonwealth responsibility onto the states. To tell you the truth, I am absolutely sick of hearing issues being batted between the Commonwealth and the states: ‘Oh, that is not a Commonwealth responsibility; that is a state responsibility’ or ‘That is not a state responsibility; it is a Commonwealth responsibility.’ Carers and people in need are the ones who suffer. Access Economics produced a report late last year that showed the benefit of carers in the community. Millions and millions of dollars worth of care is provided by carers for people in need of care. The report highlighted the absolute value of the care that is provided for people in the home and the work that carers do.
The report also highlighted the fact that if we as a nation do not get our act together and look at what is happening, long term and into the future, we are going to have an even bigger problem than we have now with the needs of carers and the needs of people who require care. It is absolutely essential that we look not only at how we can meet the needs of carers right here and now but also at what our long-term problems could be. As I have highlighted in this place on a number of occasions, I believe there are a number of clauses in the agreement that give the Commonwealth clear leadership responsibilities and provide the mechanism for the Commonwealth to provide leadership and show the way in trying to get to the bottom of this issue.
There are ongoing issues with people who are on carer payments or carer allowances and the discrepancies between the two and how hard it is to access one and the other. These are all unnecessary burdens on people who are only doing good for our community. Even if you do not want to pay attention to the fact that they are supporting our community, on an economic basis alone, one can see that they are making this country a better place. I absolutely endorse this referral motion. I think it is high time that we looked at this agreement. It is clearly not working in a number of areas. We need to look at what is working and what is not working, learn the lessons and fix this area—because it is the people in the community and the carers, who unselfishly give hundreds and hundreds of hours to this community, who are suffering.

"Humphries, Sen Gary",LP,2006-03-02,"—I rise to indicate that I do not support this motion and to indicate the reasons for that. Let me say at the outset that I do not necessarily disagree with the comments that have been made in this debate about problems with the Commonwealth State/Territory Disability Agreement. Various manifestations of this agreement have been long standing, but there is still some dysfunction in the way territories, states and the Commonwealth share the load of determining an appropriate response to the needs of those in our community with disabilities. For example, in the inquiry that the Senate Community Affairs References Committee conducted into the needs of disabled people lodged in Australian nursing homes, we saw very clear evidence of that dysfunction.
Having said that, however, I do not believe that the process that is at work here is appropriate to deal with this question at this time. Looking through the Notice Paper, I note that there is no other committee of the Senate—standing or select; references or legislation—which appears to have as many matters currently before it as do the community affairs committees, in either the references or legislation manifestations. On my reckoning, there are something like eight separate matters before the community affairs committee at the moment. They include the inquiry into toxic dust, which was to have reported today but is now reporting in May. Only yesterday, I think, another bill was referred to the committee. That was on top of an inquiry to be conducted today into aged care bond bills. There is a report to be produced on the additional estimates hearings last month; budget estimates are also coming up very soon. A major inquiry into petrol sniffing is presently in train, and members of the committee travelled only last week to the Northern Territory for that inquiry and will travel to Queensland next week. Tomorrow there is a further hearing—a roundtable discussion—on gynaecological health issues, and there is also an annual reports report to be prepared. That does not provide for a number of other matters which I know or suspect are in the pipeline.
The committee had informally discussed a process for dealing with the workload, and there was some informal discussion about having a meeting where the committee would assess what issues were pressing on it for consideration in the course of this 12-month period. Members of the committee and participating members may be aware of other issues that are being considered or will be considered by the committee, and I think those issues deserve some consideration as well. However, I think that a proper process should see these issues examined in a different process from the one that has been proposed by Senator McLucas, and for that reason I do not support the motion before the Senate.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Community Affairs References Committee</title>,Committees,17,1
"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,2006-03-02,"—I have got to say that I appreciate Senator Humphries having the courage to come into this chamber and at least express a view on why the government will not support this reference. I think some of his reasons are fairly hollow, and I will go to those in a moment. But I do acknowledge that Senator Humphries at least tried to give some sort of reason why this reference would not be supported—unlike for the previous two references, which have gone through completely on the numbers, without any expression from the government as to why they would not be supported.
Senator Humphries said that he did not disagree with the expressions of complaint. Certainly the whole community is aware of the complaints that have been levelled at the problems in the Commonwealth State/Territory Disability Agreement. That is why an inquiry is appropriate. That is why it is timely, at this point, to investigate why the level of complaint is so high, why there is misunderstanding or lack of clarity of the intent of the agreement and why there is a continual rub between the Commonwealth and states about their levels of responsibility. This is why there is a continual problem that affects older people with disabilities, and why there is a fight between the Commonwealth and the states over who is responsible for the provision of their care. That is the sort of meat that this inquiry would get into. But this government is going to stop it occurring.
Senator Humphries said that he acknowledged that the agreement was dysfunctional. Surely that is an argument in support of an inquiry, rather than an argument against. He then said that on his cursory examination—and I am glad he used that adjective, because it was a fairly cursory examination of the Notice Paper—he saw eight pieces of work that the community affairs committees had to do. That is somewhat misleading. There are three pieces of work that the Senate Community Affairs References Committee has to undertake, and I talked about them in my initial address. The toxic dust inquiry has completed its hearings. It simply has to write a report. I say ‘simply’: that is an understatement. It is a piece of work that has to be done, but it is possible to begin a new inquiry while the conclusion of another inquiry is occurring. The inquiry into petrol sniffing has done a lot of its work. It has a very organised plan for the rest of its hearings, and it too can be completed while we call for submissions for this new proposed inquiry. That would mean that we would complete the first inquiry and move into the second. That is normal practice in this place. To say that the community affairs committee is overloaded is an absolute furphy.
Senator Humphries said there were eight pieces of work that the committee had to do. No, there are three; and on Friday there will be a roundtable into gynaecological issues affecting women in Australia. That is a one-off event. I commend the committee for doing something so creative, but it is a one-off event that will take one day and then there will be a report to be done. It is wrong to say that this committee is overloaded.
Senator Humphries said that this committee has more work to do than other committees. You can well understand why that is the case when you see the number of inquiries that people who sit on the other side of the chamber have not allowed this Senate to undertake. I am very sorry that I have to follow Senator Hill’s excellent address, because he described the value of this place and the Senate committee system beautifully. But that is being undermined very significantly and we have had absolute evidence of that today.
This Senate’s agenda is not being set by the people who sit in this room. This Senate’s committee inquiry agenda is being set by the executive of the government. That is an undermining of what I think is one of the powerful roles of this chamber. We now know that any decision about any inquiry that is going to occur in this place has to go through the Liberal and National party room. We have never done that before—not in the six and a bit years that I have been here. We have been able to control our own agenda and determine the important pieces of work that need to be inquired into—not the leadership of the Liberal and National parties. That is a real shame.
I commend this motion to the chamber. It is a timely reference and one which is supported by the sector. That is the most important thing. This is not a political inquiry; this is an inquiry that people with disabilities, their service organisations and their advocates want. They want to be part of the discussions that will lead up to the fourth agreement. Otherwise, we will be here in three years time saying that the CSTDA is dysfunctional. We will say that it is not working and there is lack of clarity in the intent of the agreement. Let us take the opportunity to help people with disabilities to navigate the difficult and complex bureaucratic processes that they have to go through. Let us use this opportunity to peel back the complexity of service provision for people with disabilities. But I am afraid that the people on the other side of the chamber are saying, ‘No, we just want to leave it like it is.’ They are saying, ‘Let’s not use the Senate processes to assist people with disabilities in getting the services and assistance they in fact need.’ This is a sad day for this Senate. At least Senator Humphries had the courage to tell us why he thinks it is not timely. But, as I said, I think his arguments are pretty weak. I commend the motion to the chamber.

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2006-03-02,"—I would like to add the Greens’ support for this motion. It has been clear for quite some time that the Commonwealth State/Territory Disability Agreement needs some review. When I came new to this portfolio I very quickly became aware that there were significant problems in this sector. In Western Australia alone there is still a vast amount of unmet need for carers in this sector. In fact, we do not really have an understanding of the unmet need in Western Australia because people have actually given up asking. They are so sick of filling in complicated forms that they do not apply anymore. Many carers have said to me that they feel like it is a race to compare how bad your situation is before you can get attention. People are so demoralised by this.
I have heard many disappointing and distressing stories. Just recently I was in Albany and met with a well-known person in Albany who told me the story of what had happened with her husband who suffered from dementia and how hard it was for her to get respite care. They found that what was happening in Albany was that places that should have been reserved for people for short-term respite—to give carers of people some respite—were being filled by long-term patients because it was more economically viable for the centres to fill their places with long-term patients. While that of course is good for the long-term patients and meets a need there, unfortunately there are many people who are missing out because all they need is respite for short periods of time—and they are not getting that.
I have also learned of a change in service provider. While I am not in any way disparaging the service provider it was changed to, what was explained to me was the complicated nature of trying to get service there now and that people are confused about where to go for service. There was not a seamless changeover. I understand that is happening in other regional centres—that there have not been seamless changeovers of care providers who have contracts to provide some of the services. I also understand that there is very little idea of the unmet need for care providers in other states.
I have looked at the first, second and third agreements between the states, and I think there has been a definite shift of Commonwealth responsibility onto the states. To tell you the truth, I am absolutely sick of hearing issues being batted between the Commonwealth and the states: ‘Oh, that is not a Commonwealth responsibility; that is a state responsibility’ or ‘That is not a state responsibility; it is a Commonwealth responsibility.’ Carers and people in need are the ones who suffer. Access Economics produced a report late last year that showed the benefit of carers in the community. Millions and millions of dollars worth of care is provided by carers for people in need of care. The report highlighted the absolute value of the care that is provided for people in the home and the work that carers do.
The report also highlighted the fact that if we as a nation do not get our act together and look at what is happening, long term and into the future, we are going to have an even bigger problem than we have now with the needs of carers and the needs of people who require care. It is absolutely essential that we look not only at how we can meet the needs of carers right here and now but also at what our long-term problems could be. As I have highlighted in this place on a number of occasions, I believe there are a number of clauses in the agreement that give the Commonwealth clear leadership responsibilities and provide the mechanism for the Commonwealth to provide leadership and show the way in trying to get to the bottom of this issue.
There are ongoing issues with people who are on carer payments or carer allowances and the discrepancies between the two and how hard it is to access one and the other. These are all unnecessary burdens on people who are only doing good for our community. Even if you do not want to pay attention to the fact that they are supporting our community, on an economic basis alone, one can see that they are making this country a better place.

"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2006-03-02,"—The Australian Labor Party was proud to recognise the need for a coordinated approach to sports antidoping very early on. In fact, the Labor government’s creation of the Australian Sports Drug Agency, or ASDA, in 1990 placed Australia at the forefront of the international fight against drugs in sport. Labor’s goal in establishing ASDA was to ensure that Australian athletes were able to perform and compete in an environment untainted by banned substances, and this goal needs to be met with ongoing revision and adaptation of our antidoping legislation. Only then is it possible to continue the great tradition of excellent sporting performance that has motivated so many people of all ages to strive to do their best in their chosen sport. Sport, after all, is an essential part of Australian culture, and it needs to be drug free to be fair for the athletes and to be the source of inspiration for, and enjoyment of, children and adults alike.
Labor is supporting the Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority Bill 2005 and the Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2005 because they represent the next crucial step in strengthening the antidoping regime in Australia. It has been the Labor Party that has pressured the Howard government to continue improving the doping regulation in Australia, something that we believe they have been somewhat slack and slow in doing over the years. I think it is appropriate to make comments as to this slackness and slowness in the context of this legislation.
The slackness is evidenced by the fact that, if it were not for Labor, the bungled investigations into allegations surrounding Mark French and other Australian cyclists would never have been exposed. Just to recap: following the preliminary investigation into this matter, the Australian Sports Commission and Cycling Australia instigated a so-called independent investigation of the incident. Allegations were made of drug use by other then unnamed members of the AIS cycling team and of there being a culture of permissiveness with respect to doping at the Del Monte facility. In May 2004, in evidence to the court, Mr French named five other cyclists who allegedly participated in injecting sessions at the Del Monte facility. It is important to note that, while the court found Mr French guilty of antidoping offences, there was no further investigation into the allegations surrounding the five other named cyclists. There was simply a cover-up, and it was shameful that the Howard government did not do anything about it.
On 18 June 2004, it was the Labor opposition who raised this issue in parliament. Senator John Faulkner criticised the government for the mismanagement of the investigations into these allegations of antidoping violations. Senator Faulkner called for the establishment of an investigation and determination process, independent of the Australian Sports Commission. He also expressed concern that no further investigation had taken place of the other alleged offenders involved in the case. It is noted that at the time it was of the utmost sensitivity because it involved potential team members for the upcoming Athens Olympics.
After Labor raised these concerns, the Minister for the Arts and Sport acted, finally. The Hon. Robert Anderson QC was appointed to investigate the claims of doping within the cycling program and to assess the effectiveness of actions taken by the Australian Sports Commission and Cycling Australia. The key recommendation Justice Anderson made from the inquiry mirrored Senator Faulkner’s concerns. Anderson said:
... there should be a body which is quite independent of AIS and of the Australian Sports Commission and of the sporting bodies themselves with the power and duty to investigate suspected infractions such as substance abuse and to carry the prosecution of persons against whom evidence is obtained.
It is important to note that while the ASDA Act was amended in 2004 in order to comply with the WADA code, and the responsibilities mapped out for sporting bodies and athletes in it, ASDA does not currently have the power to examine all the antidoping rule violations in the code or, indeed, to prosecute cases. That is what this legislation does: it enacts that Anderson recommendation, which was only made as a result of Labor’s intervention in the first place.
I would now like to turn to the issue of timing and slowness that I mentioned earlier. The sad thing is that the rush that we are now experiencing with this legislation is because we are only debating these bills some 13 days out from the Commonwealth Games. I note that the bills reflect the view of the government for quite some time now and, in fact, were mooted mid last year. So it is concerning that it has taken till now—as I said, 13 days out from the Commonwealth Games—to finally debate the legislation in this place. We certainly do not want to hold it up any further and we think that it is good that the government has finally brought it before us.
But, that said, it is still important to note that it would have been far better for stakeholders to have more time and to have had a longer lead time in to the Senate inquiry—and it was very important that the government allowed a Senate inquiry, given they have the numbers in this place. We heard during the evidence to the Senate inquiry that a number of stakeholders were concerned that not enough time was provided to them. Because of that condensed time frame the other issues relating to the NAD Scheme, the National Anti-Doping Scheme, which is a critical part of the new operation of ASDA under this act, have not been fully fleshed out. I will speak more to that in a minute.
So they are my criticisms about timing and the slackness evidenced by the Howard government over the years. There is generally a bipartisan policy commitment to wanting Australia to be the best in the world and, as I said, this legislation takes the next step. It is worth noting in my comments, incidentally, that it does provide Australia’s antidoping body with two specific additional powers: the power to investigate doping allegations and to present antidoping violation cases at hearings of CAS or other sports tribunals. Sporting bodies who made submissions to the Senate inquiry concurred that that type of body was required, and the Labor Party also supports it. The additional powers will enable the new ASADA to examine all eight antidoping violations contained in the WADA code—a sensible measure for a government which has required all NSOs to sign on to WADA so that all is consistent in setting up the regime.
ASADA will maintain the existing drug testing, education and advocacy functions of the current ASDA, and will also carry out additional functions in relation to investigation of potential additional sports doping violations; presentation at hearings conducted by the international Court of Arbitration for Sport, CAS, and other tribunals, of cases against an athlete or support person alleged to have committed an antidoping rule violation; determining mandatory antidoping rules to be included in the ASC funding agreements with sports; and advising the ASC of the performance of sports in observing these requirements—all crucial improvements.
ASADA will carry out these functions within the context of the National Anti-Doping Scheme, or NAD Scheme, the framework of which is created by these bills. The detailed protocols and procedures for the exercise of ASADA’s functions will be contained in this scheme, which is a legislative instrument to be developed alongside the bill. Ultimately, it will be tabled in parliament as a disallowable instrument. The National Anti-Doping Scheme will be consistent with the mandatory provisions of the World Anti-Doping Code and will implement the UNESCO convention once it is ratified. The bill acts as a broad legislative umbrella for ASADA, and the NAD Scheme will contain much of the detail that will directly affect athletes and sporting bodies.
We have been advised that the NAD Scheme will contain the antidoping rules applicable to athletes and support personnel, including details of antidoping rule violations and the consequences of infractions; protocols for ASADA drug testing procedures, protocols and procedures governing ASADA investigations, protocols for ASADA to establish a register of its findings and to advise sporting organisations and athletes of its findings and the protocols for ASADA’s presentation of doping cases at sports tribunal hearings.
Labor is satisfied with the government’s, and certainly the department’s, insistence, through the Senate committee process, that national sporting bodies and players associations were to be consulted with the content of this National Anti-Doping Scheme. During the inquiry process sporting bodies did raise a number of valid concerns regarding implementation, such as not being able to see the detail of the NAD Scheme. Certainly, we are taking it on good faith that the government will adhere to its commitments and that, if there is any transfer of current powers as described in the existing ASDA legislation to the regulation, the disallowable instrument, they will not be weakened or undermined in any way, and that it will be a direct reflection of existing powers along with the improvements as provided for as part of these bills.
Some of the questions that sporting bodies were asking were, ‘Would ASADA be conducting raids in the middle of the night or any other time? Would ASADA provide legal support for athletes? Could the major professional sports run hearings at their own tribunals?’ et cetera. The bottom line is that Australian sport has a lot riding on the proper establishment of effective antidoping regulations, and this process of consultation will be invaluable to the pending smoothness of the implementation of the new regime.
During the Senate inquiry, the Australian Olympic Committee also raised some concerns in relation to the bill, in particular that it does not separate the ASADA functions and powers relating to policy making with administration, investigation and prosecution, and this is a valid concern. We heard at the inquiry that ASDA management gave the guarantee that these powers will be separated through good management practices. Time will tell. However, we are satisfied with those assurances. Labor will continue to hold the government to account on their commitment to the national sporting bodies and athletes that this legislation will offer positive benefits, clarify many issues for sports and not incur any additional cost or risk associated with the NAD scheme. Stability, certainty and education are critical elements of an effective regime, and we are assured that all of these will be addressed effectively.
Labor are committed to ensuring that Australia continues to lead the world in the push against drugs in sport. Labor created ASDA in 1990, and we hold dear this proud legacy. Labor will support the passage of these bills. As I said, the concerns we had have generally been allayed through the Senate inquiry process, and we take in good faith that the government will act on their commitments in relation to the development of the NAD scheme. And we hopefully look forward to a drug-free Commonwealth Games in just a few weeks time.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN SPORTS ANTI-DOPING AUTHORITY BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,2006-03-02,"—Senator Lundy, we fully endorse your hopes and expectations about the Commonwealth Games. All of us would certainly hope that, but we are all comforted that the antidoping regime which is now in place is far more rigorous and thorough than any on previous major sporting occasions in this country. I think that it was a big step forward. Senator Lundy indicated in her speech that the Labor Party was very supportive of the Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority Bill 2005. We welcome that very strong support.
For the record, the bill was tabled in parliament at the end of the last session to give time for some public scrutiny, which did occur. There was a Senate hearing and the submissions were considered by a Senate committee. A number of questions were raised and those questions, I think, were comprehensively answered. Clearly, the Labor Party would not support this legislation if they felt that those questions had not been answered in a satisfactory fashion. Senator Lundy was very keen that the national sporting system and the regulations be subject to consultation with key sporting bodies. The advice I have is that that has occurred. A number of issues have been raised but they are not major issues, and we are very comfortable in making sure that Senator Lundy and her officers are fully briefed on these developments.
I think this is a very important day for the fight against doping in sport in Australia. Senator Lundy spoke about the delays, and I will speak briefly on that. There has probably been a delay, and if former Senator Black were here he would say there had been a delay of 16 years. In the investigation that was carried out in the Senate in 1990, headed by Senator Black, there was a proposal not only to set up an antidoping body but to give that body investigatory functions. The truth is that successive ministers for sport did not accept that proposal, and I take considerable pride, as the minister for sport, that it has now been done. Senator Lundy is right to draw the Senate’s attention to the delays, but I think the delays go back further than was perhaps indicated. The Labor Party from 1990 to 1996 was certainly not prepared to proceed down this track. It has happened now and I think that is a good thing. We welcome Labor’s support.
The only unfortunate aspect of Senator Lundy’s speech was the mention of the Anderson inquiry. I invite Senator Lundy to very carefully read the results of that inquiry. Very briefly: Mr Anderson indicated that there was no need for these matters to be raised in parliament, that investigations were under way. The fact that these things were raised in parliament caused a great deal of hurt and pain to many people. There were allegations which were very damaging to the Australian Institute of Sport. It is appropriate to note that the allegations that were made were found to be false. There were allegations about a shooting gallery at the AIS which received worldwide press. I think it is beholden on those people who made those allegations about our sporting system which have been shown to be wrong—and they have been subject to an independent inquiry and shown to be wrong—to withdraw those statements and apologise to the people who were involved. That is a debate for another day, if Senator Lundy would like to have it. But I do invite Senator Lundy and her advisers to carefully reread the Anderson report. I urge those people who read Senator Lundy’s comments today to read the findings of that Anderson report and find out what the genuine facts were.
Putting that aside, this is an absolutely historic day in terms of the fight against doping in sport. As the minister for sport, I am very proud to be associated with this legislation. I am pleased to acknowledge the strong support that we have received from Senator Lundy on this matter. The timetables are tight; Senator Lundy was quite right to mention that the timetables are tight. Regrettably these things take time. The fact is that we would not be this far if, at this last stage, we did not have the support and cooperation of Senator Lundy. I am happy to acknowledge that. We wish the legislation a speedy journey, which it looks as though it is about to have. I assure the Senate that every effort will be made to ensure that ASADA is up and running before the Commonwealth Games.

"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2006-03-02,"—Yesterday, Senator Siewert wanted to know the OECD number of the development assistance code under which the $937,000 payment by AusAID to Mr Trevor Flugge was made. The answer is: agricultural development subcode 31120. I also said that I would check my answer in relation to Mr Downer having signed off on the $100 million AusAID package for Iraq. I said I assumed he had, which is correct. It was to cover two shipments of wheat and included $45 million for handling and distribution costs as the delegate under the Financial Management and Accountability Act. The minister adds that appropriate risk management procedures were taken in relation to the two wheat shipments and milling, bagging and distribution to be undertaken by the World Food Program. However, Mr Downer reminds the senator that with the reinstatement of the oil for food program, the two wheat shipments reverted to the United Nations and Australian aid moneys were not required for these purposes.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: ADDITIONAL ANSWERS</title>,<title>Oil for Food Program</title>,Questions Without Notice: Additional Answers,22,1
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2006-03-02,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of answers given by ministers to questions without notice asked by opposition senators today.
If anything demonstrates what an arrogant, out-of-touch government this is, hung over on the excesses of its partying last night, it was there to be witnessed today in question time.
—It wasn’t that good!
—Oh dear! Senator Joyce, I am sorry that you did not have as good a time. Wouldn’t they let you sit at a table with anybody? Did they make you sit by yourself, Senator Joyce? What we saw today reminded me of Animal Farm. It was Orwellian in its approach to the English language. Today we rejoiced: Senator Coonan was able to explain to the Australian public how good it was for pensioners to get a $60 increase in their fees. How good it was for them! It was unbelievable. They were better off under this government because they had to pay $60 extra! It is Orwellian. You belong in Animal Farm. We have a 43 per cent increase in the cost of putting on a phone, and the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts wants to tell us that we are better off under this government. We have a $60 increase for pensioners and we are better off under the government’s USO, CSG and price caps! Well, we saw today, yesterday and last week that Australia Post and Telstra are driving a truck through the regulations that this government touts as consumer protections. It is a farce that a minister in this chamber stands up and tries to tell people they are better off because they are paying more.
Australia Post is going to reap $5.7 million from pensioners and veterans. Australia Post is going to be better off by $5.7 million. Yet last year the reported profit of Australia Post was $374 million. And they need to rip out of the pockets of pensioners and veterans an extra $5.7 million! Yet again we saw the mock outrage; yet again we saw the minister crying crocodile tears. It is just like last week, when she stood up and said, ‘This is terrible; I haven’t been consulted’—about all these 5,000 payphones that are to be ripped out. We saw crocodile tears last week and crocodile tears this week.
This minister is continually rolled by Telstra. She called them in to give them a piece of her mind last week, and what happened? She came out and said, ‘Well, actually, they can if they want.’ It was pathetic to watch. But what was truly pathetic was watching the minister put on the mock indignation. She held a press conference before I did, to express her outrage. She had the first breath; she beat Barnaby out the door.
—That’s hard!
—That is hard, Barnaby, you are dead right. She beat you and me out the door on this one, and then she beat the retreat even faster. That is the hypocrisy of this government—
—Just turn it down a little bit.
—I know you all have hangovers—you especially, Fergie; I hear it was a big night for you!
—Senator—
—Sorry, I am being provoked, Mr Deputy President.
—That should be withdrawn.
—Sorry, which part?
—The comment you made. Just withdraw it.
—That they are hung over?
—Yes.
—I withdraw it. But I make the point that I am not going to speak quieter or tone it down simply because there are a few headaches on the other side of the chamber. Let us be clear—
—Mr Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. I think Senator Conroy’s statement is impinging on the character of the people on the government benches. To suggest that they did not have control of themselves is completely out of order.
—There is no point of order. Senator Conroy, continue your contribution. You have 32 seconds left.
—So what has happened here is that, for the third time in five days, the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, Senator Helen Coonan, has been rolled. She was rolled by Sol Trujillo last week. We saw the kissing and cuddling exercise from Senator Ronaldson and Senator Joyce. There was all of the tough talk and then they just rolled over and Sol tickled their tummies. That is what happened last week. He made a laughing stock out of Senator Joyce and Senator Ronaldson. He is playing them on a break. (Time expired)

"Eggleston, Sen Alan",LP,2006-03-02,"—Senator Conroy is right—the coalition did have a big celebration last night. They had a big celebration for very big reasons. The coalition after 10 years in government have achieved an awful lot for Australia and changed things for the better for this country in many areas. If you quickly look through what has been done, you will see that we have record low interest rates. I remember buying a house in south Perth in 1989 under the Hawke and Keating government and paying 19 per cent interest rates. Nobody would even think about that sort of thing now. Now they are down to five per cent. We have record low unemployment. Under the Hawke and Keating government, unemployment was around 10 per cent. Under the Howard government it is down to five per cent. We have record growth rates. In fact, the demand for people with skills is so great in places like the Pilbara and Queensland that we have a skills shortage. That is again a reflection, if you like, of the size of the Australian economy and the way it has grown under the Howard government. Most importantly—and Senator Conroy should not be leaving the chamber so quickly—we have paid off the Commonwealth government’s debt of something like $96 billion left by the Hawke and Keating government. So, yes, the coalition did have a lot to celebrate last night. We are very pleased to have been able to do that.
When it comes to telecommunications, which is really what Senator Conroy was focusing on, the government’s deregulation of the telecommunications industry has been enormously beneficial to the Australian population. If you go back 10 years and think about the prices which applied then and the limited range of services and if you look today at the deregulated telecommunications market, where there are over 100 different telecommunications companies, you will see that prices have dropped and the range of services has greatly increased. In particular, telecommunications services in regional Australia are certainly a lot better than they were 10 years ago. In the most remote areas of Australia this government had a special contract of something like $150 million, I think it was, for services to 40,000 people living in the most remote areas of Australia. That was a competitive contract. Telstra and Optus competed for it and Telstra won. These people in the most remote areas of Australia are now getting access to the internet and to much improved telecommunications services compared to where they were 10 years ago.
This government has a wonderful record which we are very proud of and which has brought great benefit across many fronts to the people of Australia. Today Labor has plucked out one individual example of a price increase in telecommunications, but Senator Conroy just ignored all of the examples of price decreases over the past 10 years. The reality is that, overall, telecommunications prices have dropped by some 20 per cent since the Howard government was elected in 1996. That is an enormous drop. I think we all remember quite well how expensive telecommunications services were under the previous Labor government and how long it took to have phone services connected under Labor when there was no universal service obligation or community service guarantee. Labor come in here today and complain about a single price increase. They are really trying to divert people’s attention from their own dismal record. To talk about the great party that the coalition had last night surely must be envy at its most poignant.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Answers to Questions</title>,Questions Without Notice: Take Note of Answers,23,1
"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2006-03-02,"—How interesting it is that the government tries to point to minuscule issues such as the changes that Senator Eggleston pointed out that have somehow been of benefit to consumers when the whole character of the treatment of Telstra under the Howard government for the last 10 years has been completely and utterly dictated by the privatisation agenda. In fact, the proposal back in 1996 to sell Telstra in tranches eventually, when they could not get the full sale through the Senate, has resulted in the privatisation agenda ensuring that Australian customers and telecommunications users have been put at a perpetual disadvantage. This is because the primary political and policy interest of the Howard government has always been to maximise the return on the Telstra asset when they sell it.
With that in mind, the Howard government had no interest in doing anything other than making sure Telstra made a lot of money. What is the obvious and direct impact of that? The obvious and direct impact of that is that customers of Telstra would be delivered a short straw. They would be ripped off. They would be delivered substandard services. There would be cost savings made on Telstra’s services, in the effort to maintain the fattest bottom line in profits as was possible for the company. If that profit margin were not maintained and grown, the share price would not prove to be satisfactory to entice people to buy the shares upon the next tranche sale.
Let us have a look at how this has manifested itself over the last 10 years. I and many other Labor senators have participated in endless inquiries, which have shown up a number of very salient facts, like the existing Telstra copper network being, as described by their own people, ‘five minutes to midnight’ in terms of it being obsolete. So over the last 10 years—and one of these inquiries was only a few years ago—the government and Telstra have admitted that they have underinvested in the network to the point of its obsolescence almost. That is an absolute disgrace, particularly in the context that we all know, that every local government in this country knows and that every state government knows that it is through broadband that we will maximise economic growth particularly in our regions. Yet all these policies have worked in the opposite direction.
Let me make a point about broadband. Up until a few short years ago, the Howard government was talking down the need for broadband in this country. I saw the minister in this place, at world forums around this country and in other places saying, ‘We don’t need broadband.’ This is absolutely true. It was only a few years ago under immense pressure not just from the Labor opposition but from businesses, local councils and community organisations demanding that this government wrap its small mind around the fact that this country needs broadband did we start to see some policy attention, as opposed to permission by the Howard government to allow Telstra to continually underinvest in the network. It is quite rich for this arrogant government to come in here and say, ‘Look what we’ve delivered to Australian consumers.’ It has not delivered anything in terms of improvements.
There is a raft of statistics showing what has worsened in a period of a telecommunications boom in the world, a dot com era which saw a massive increase in the use of the internet. What has happened here? The character of this privatisation driven agenda in telecommunications policy has resulted in minimal investment in the network. Telstra are doing everything they can to prevent other companies investing in broadband networks. The ACCC has experienced incredible frustration regarding the regulations surrounding accessing Telstra’s network, as though that would somehow help, given the blockages to broadband within that network anyway. I will not even go into the pricing of access. You need only to look at the retention of the monopoly of the fixed line and how that has been singularly exploited by Telstra with price increases all the way through. Every time that goes up, everyone has to pay— (Time expired)

"McGauran, Sen Julian",LP,2006-03-02,"—I too rise on this matter of taking note of answers. As has been mentioned by several other speakers, last night the government had its celebration of 10 years in government. It should be noted too that that would also be 10 years in opposition for the Labor Party. As far as our Great Hall dinner went, it was a modest affair. It acknowledged the absolute privilege of being in government and how grateful we are to the Australian people that at four elections they have given us their confidence. We have, in many respects, been proud to live up to their confidence.
The Prime Minister in his address to the hall said many things about politics. I recommend that the other side get copies of the speech. He spoke of the unpredictability of politics, the ever-changing nature of politics. He finished his address by saying—and I think it was a line out of Gone with the Wind—‘There is still much to do and tomorrow is another day.’ The Prime Minister, I should add, was in this chamber to listen to Senator Hill’s address—a rare visit by the Prime Minister. If he had also been in here at question time, I think he would change that line by saying, ‘Tomorrow is not another day; what we’ve experienced today is Groundhog Day.’ For the 10 years we have been in government, you have been bleating and complaining about a policy that has gone to the people of Australia on three occasions. This government’s policy to sell Telstra has gone to three elections and has been endorsed at three elections. Yet, just like Groundhog Day, you whip up the same old arguments and complaints, and it boils down to one thing: you do not support the privatisation of Telstra at all.
This issue of Telstra epitomises our 10 years in government and your 10 years in opposition. In our 10 years in government, on each occasion we have tested this policy with the Australian people. It has a philosophical and policy base to it, and that is competition and choice. We have been transparent, honest and driven by the benefits of privatisation, none less, of course, than the economic benefits of being able to reduce the government debt to zero. And the Australian people know where we have always stood. It also epitomises your 10 years of opposition to this issue, and you are still raising it. After T1, T2 and T3, you still get up here and whip up the same old arguments. You will not accept the judgment of the Australian people, just as you have not accepted the judgment of the Australian people with regard to the government gaining the majority here in the Senate.
Also, the one thing the Australian people know about us is that we are a reformist government—we believe in our reforms and we stick to what we mean; we say what we mean and we do what we mean—whereas they know only too well that you are confused, inconsistent or downright opportunistic when it comes to the policy of privatisation. They have very keen memories of what you did in government. Of course, when you were in government you privatised everything that you could get your hands on, with, I might add, our opposition support. There were Qantas and the Commonwealth Bank just to name a few. And you squandered the funds on top of it. You had no plan and no philosophical base in regard to privatisation; it was just a grab for money to try to fill that deficit gap in your budget, in contrast to this government’s plan of privatisation to reduce debt and to spend the money wisely. So, in many respects, with this issue 10 years on, there are still the same old arguments and the same old basic policy differences. But it epitomises our 10 years of reform government and your 10 years of no policy and picking the wrong issues.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Answers to Questions</title>,Questions Without Notice: Take Note of Answers,23,1
"Polley, Sen Helen",ALP,2006-03-02,"—I rise to take note of the answers, or lack of, given by Senator Coonan with regard to Australia Post’s intention to charge pensioners and veterans fees for the use of mail redirection and holding services. I have to say that today it was a gold medal performance by the senator of not answering any questions, as were the comments of Senator Eggleston in trying to defend the indefensible. And what can I say about Senator McGauran? It was obviously a very late night last night.
As Mr Howard celebrates 10 long years as Prime Minister, our pensioners and veterans will be commiserating on 10 long years of an arrogant government that has continued to attack the most disadvantaged in our community. On a daily basis, I hear of pensioners and veterans who are struggling—I repeat: struggling—to make ends meet. And yet we hear that the Howard government is quite happy for Australia Post to slug an impost on 400,000 Australians. Australia Post believe they are striking a balance by offering a 50 per cent reduction of fees to eligible concession card holders. With a dividend of over $286 million, they are not so much striking a balance as ensuring that the pockets of the Howard government will continue to be overflowing.
This government is more interested in self-congratulations than it is in the average Australian. This government continues to ignore the cries of pensioners and veterans as they struggle to make ends meet. This government has turned a blind eye to Australia Post’s decision and is quite happy to skirt around the issue and advise us in this chamber that Australia Post are an independent corporation and, basically, can do what they darn well please.
Australia is daily becoming a profit driven nation rather than one that looks after its own. Isn’t Australia Post making enough money? Last year, Australia Post reported a record net profit in excess of $374 million, and yet they still find it reasonable to target our pensioners as cash cows. I challenge Australia Post to really be serious about what they call ‘striking a balance’. Did they bother to consider other options? Or did they only bother to think of the easiest and most selfish option, which is the option that benefits only Australia Post and the Howard government?
Australia Post has suggested that if people prefer not to pay—or, to add my own words to that statement, cannot afford to pay—for mail redirection or holding services these people could, to quote from an article in the Australian:
... simply update their address details with all their correspondents before they move, arrange to have their mail picked up or have it sent on by the new occupants of their old address.
Be fair! In other words, if people do not want to pay the fee for a service that was free, they should go ahead and make many expensive telephone calls, pay postage for additional letters of advice or, worse still, inconvenience the occupants of their old address. That does not sound like a solution to me. That sounds like a major inconvenience and expense—an impost, again, on those who can least afford it.
If the Howard government are serious about congratulating themselves on what they describe as ‘a great 10 years’, then perhaps today, yesterday and right now they could take the time to make a difference to the disadvantaged in our community and tell Australia Post that the new policy for mail redirection and holding services stinks. Do not hide behind the excuse of Australia Post being a government business enterprise. The Howard government have a responsibility to protect and enhance the quality of life enjoyed by pensioners and veterans through minimising policy that is an impost on the trivial fortnightly pension.
The Howard government are focused on bottom-line profit, espousing good financial management and gloating about a buoyant economy at the expense of the people who can least afford it. They should demonstrate some strength and compassion and stand up for those who cannot defend themselves. Do not rob our pensioners—reward them. Stick up for the people who elected you and trusted that you would do the right thing by them. The right thing is to tell Australia Post to go back to the drawing board with their fee policy, to have a good hard look at their profits and to think about operating smarter, but not at the expense of 400,000 Australians who struggle each week just to get by.
We have had Welfare to Work and Work Choices, and now we have more complacency. In fact, this one takes the cake because there is no way that the government can stand up here, hold their hands over their hearts and confirm that this fee from Australia Post will not—and I repeat, will not—affect our pensioners and our veterans. And our veterans, despite the many years of commitment— (Time expired)

Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade—Australia’s human rights dialogue process
Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit—403rd report—Access of Indigenous Australians to law and justice services

Leave granted.
The documents read as follows—

Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade


Government response to the report of the Trade Subcommittee on Australia’s engagements with the World Trade Organisation tabled on 3 August 2004

The Government continues to look at new ways of providing trade-related technical assistance in developing countries. In doing so, one of our objectives is to support the capacity of such countries to undertake credible analysis of trade issues and the impact of trade liberalisation.
A recent example of such a project, which started in September 2005, is the Trade and Analysis Reform Project (TARP) for Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam and Thailand. This project, which is funded by the Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID), aims to raise the quality of analysis going into trade policy development and assist these countries to engage more fully with the World Trade Organisation.

AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO THE REPORT OF THE JOINT STANDING COMMITTEE ON FOREIGN AFFAIRS DEFENCE AND TRADE “AUSTRALIA’S HUMAN RIGHTS DIALOGUE PROCESS”


RECOMMENDATION 1

The Committee recommends that the Government encourage dialogue partners to include parliamentary representatives from their own countries to participate in future rounds of the bilateral human rights dialogues
The Government acknowledges that the inclusion of parliamentary representatives in the bilateral human rights dialogues has the potential to enhance the dialogues. The Government, therefore, agrees to make a case-by-case decision based on the state of the bilateral relationship and the maturity of the dialogue whether to suggest to partners they include parliamentary representatives.

RECOMMENDATION 2

The Committee recommends that the participation in and oversight of the bilateral human rights dialogues by Australian parliamentarians be fully supported and formalised by:
party leaders or the Minister for Foreign Affairs nominating one or more parliamentarians from the Government and non-Government parties to attend each dialogue
conferring official delegation status on the nominated parliamentarians; and
the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade providing regular private briefings to the Human Rights Sub-Committee on the status of each of Australia’s dialogues with China, Vietnam and Iran.
Accepted, provided that it is acceptable to the dialogue partner. The Government notes that in the past the Minister for Foreign Affairs has directly invited Government Parliamentarians to participate and has written to the Leader of the Opposition/Opposition Spokesperson for Foreign Affairs to invite them to nominate representatives. The Government considers that the human rights dialogues have benefited from the participation of Australian Parliamentary representations and is keen to enhance that participation.
Accepted.
Accepted. The Government notes that officials have already provided briefings to the Human Rights Sub-Committee upon request.

RECOMMENDATION 3

The Committee recommends that the Government consider preceding each of the bilateral human rights dialogues hosted in Australia with a forum, at which Australian NGOs have the opportunity to brief members of the Australian delegation on human rights issues of particular concern.
The Government has established a number of effective mechanisms through which NGOs are able to convey their concerns about upcoming dialogues. These include written invitations to provide input which are then distributed to all members of the Australian delegation in advance of the dialogue. Points raised by NGOs are frequently included in the brief and are raised during the formal talks. NGOs also have the opportunity to raise particular concerns about human rights in dialogue partner countries during DFAT’s biannual consultations with them on human rights issues. DFAT also uses these forums to brief NGOs on the outcomes of dialogue including, where appropriate, any responses to points NGOs raised prior to the dialogue. The Government has also facilitated NGO involvement in the dialogue with China through invitations to a cocktail reception with the Chinese delegation and arranging the parallel discussions that take place at the time of the eighth round of the dialogue in 2004. The Government is happy to brief NGOs at their request in advance of dialogue rounds, as we have done in the past.

RECOMMENDATION 4

The Committee recommends that the Minister for Foreign Affairs table an annual statement in Parliament on the status and proceedings of Australia’s bilateral human rights dialogues with China, Vietnam and Iran.
Not accepted. The Government considers that formally tabling a report in Parliament would compromise the guarantees of confidentiality that have been so important in ensuring that the dialogues feature frank discussions of sometimes quite sensitive issues. The Human Rights Dialogues are conducted at an officials-to-officials level and it is not customary to make publicly available extensive detail of such discussions, nor to table reports in Parliament. Nevertheless, the Government recognises the special nature of its human rights dialogues and, through its interaction with NGOs and Parliamentarians and websites, makes publicly available as much information as possible while respecting the confidence and trust our partners have placed in us. The Government is prepared to provide in camera briefings to Parliamentarians at their request.

RECOMMENDATION 5

The Committee recommends that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Australian Agency for International Development and the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, make more effective and regular use of their websites to convey up-to-date information on those aspects of Australia’s bilateral human rights dialogues with China, Vietnam and Iran, for which they have responsibility.
Accepted. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Australian Agency for International Development and the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission have taken steps to ensure that their websites are up-to-date and are discussing ways to make better use of the websites to disseminate information about the dialogues.
Australian Government response to Report 403 of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit: Access of Indigenous Australians to Law and Justice Services
Introduction
Recommendation 1
That the Attorney-General’s Department put in place measures to ensure that questions taken on notice to the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit are either responded to within requested timeframes or that reasons are provided showing why responses will be delayed together with a proposed alternative date by which responses will be received by the Committee.
Agreed.
The Attorney-General’s Department takes very seriously its responsibilities to the Committee and to the Parliament. At a private briefing of the Committee on 17 March 2005, officers of the Department undertook to answer by 30 April the questions tabled at that briefing. Several of those 51 questions related to issues that were then under consideration as part of the Budget process. To ensure that the Committee was provided with the most relevant information, the answers to those questions were provided on 11 May 2005: the day after the Budget was announced.
If a similar situation arises in the future, the Department will answer the question by the due date.
Funding and distribution of resources in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Legal Services by case type
Recommendation 2
That based on available data and need, all future contracts between the Attorney-General’s Department and providers of services that are currently delivered by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Legal Services designate specific requirements of family, civil and criminal case loadings and provide adequate funding to meet these requirements.
Agreed.
1 July 2005 marked the commencement of the new administrative arrangements for the provision of legal services for Indigenous people in Victoria, Queensland and Western Australia. The requests for tender for the provision of Indigenous legal services to Northern Territory and South Australia were released on 2 August 2005 with contracts commencing on 1 February 2006. For New South Wales (including the ACT) and Tasmania, the requests for tender were released on 28 January 2006 with contracts commencing on 1 July 2006.
The new providers of legal services to Indigenous Australians have been, or will be, selected through a competitive tendering process. Multi-year performance based contracts will replace the annual grant funding structure under which Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Legal Services (ATSILS) have been operating.
The publicly released Request for Tender, Legal Aid Services to Indigenous Australians provides the draft legal services contract under which all Indigenous legal services will ultimately operate. Clause 3(1)(b) of this contract refers the successful tenderer to tables at Schedule 1 which stipulate annual service delivery targets in the areas of civil, family and criminal law.
The Government recognises that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have significant civil and family law requirements and has made formal provision to meet these needs. The Government’s priority for Indigenous legal aid is to provide legal representation for clients where there is a risk of incarceration or where there is a real risk to a person’s physical safety. Priority assistance is also given to Indigenous persons where cultural or personal well being is at risk. An additional priority is where a family member of a person who died in custody seeks representation at an inquiry into the death. Particular emphasis is placed on meeting the needs of women and children. These priorities are shaped by the extremity of need identified within Indigenous communities and prior investigations such as the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody and the Council of Australian Governments (COAG) National Framework for Preventing Family Violence and Child Abuse in Indigenous Communities.
Indigenous legal aid is a specialist program within a larger network of available services. Community legal centres, legal aid commissions, Family Violence Prevention Legal Services (FVPLSs), community crisis centres, women’s legal service offices and Indigenous women’s projects all offer varied services which augment the capabilities and stipulated service targets of Indigenous legal aid providers.
Indigenous women and access to legal services
Recommendation 3
That the Attorney-General’s Department ensure that Family Violence Prevention Legal Services focus on the provision of family and civil law services to Indigenous Australians, particularly through the legal representation of clients.
Agreed in part.
FVPLS units provide professional legal representation and assistance to Indigenous Australians for a range of legal needs including family and civil law. FVPLSs play a key role in combating family violence in Indigenous communities.
FVPLS units are required to comply with the Family Violence Prevention Legal Services Operational Framework. This specifies ‘legal advice and casework assistance’ as the first service delivery priority, followed by counselling, support, protection, referral and information services. The Operational Framework specifically stipulates that each ‘FVPLS must employ a full time solicitor, that is independent of, and separate from, the position of unit Coordinator’. A solicitor is now based with every FVPLS unit and there are supplementary legal practitioners employed in smaller units to ensure maximum service outputs and service availability.
However, to receive civil law assistance within a FVPLS unit, an Indigenous client must also be affected by family violence considerations. In circumstances where family violence is not a component, a person with need for legal aid will be referred to another legal service provider capable of delivering culturally sensitive assistance.
In this context, ‘family violence’ is broadly interpreted to reflect both the extended nature of Indigenous families and the contexts in which various forms of violence may occur between kinspeople in Indigenous communities. The Operational Framework defines family violence as including ‘all forms of violence in intimate relationships.’ A ‘family’ is defined to cover ‘a diverse range of reciprocal ties of obligation and mutual support’ which can include, for example, ‘aunts, uncles, cousins and children of previous relationships’. This definition ensures broad access to the legal representation services available at FVPLS units, to women, men and children.
Recommendation 4
That the Attorney-General’s Department acknowledge that urban Indigenous populations also require family violence, family and civil law services and locate Family Violence Prevention Legal Services accordingly.
Agreed in part.
Urban Indigenous communities have a need for family and civil law services. Family violence was identified in the COAG Reconciliation Framework as a key issue in Indigenous affairs.
On 24 June 2004, COAG agreed to a National Framework for Preventing Family Violence and Child Abuse in Indigenous Communities. The Australian Government made a $22.7 million commitment over four years to double the number of FVPLS units, from 13 to 26 around Australia.
The Government contracted the Crime Research Centre at the University of Western Australia to identify high-need regions to support the establishment of new FVPLS units. The research took into account rates of family violence; the needs of individuals in particular locations; identification of existing national infrastructure; and the particular need to provide services to rural and remote areas of Australia. The 13 new FVPLS units were established in areas identified by the Crime Research Centre and from stakeholder feedback. They are primarily in remote or regional areas.
The Government will continue to give priority assistance to those areas with the most acute requirements for service. The FVPLS units themselves will also make similar determinations with regards to their own allocation of resources as required by the Operational Framework:
In determining the locations of their service outlets, units must also have regard to the locations of related services, courts and prisons within the geographic area being serviced.
Indigenous communities based in major urban centres have greater access (than do those in remote or regional areas) to other legal service providers such as community legal centres, legal aid commission offices, Indigenous legal aid offices or ATSILS, other Indigenous support and referral services, solicitors undertaking pro bono work and Indigenous women’s legal service units.
Recommendation 5
That the Attorney-General’s Department ensure that Indigenous men are provided full access to all Family Violence Prevention Legal Services.
Agreed.
The Operational Framework requires that all services provided by FVPLS units are available to men, women and children. The units are required to ‘provide culturally sensitive assistance to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander adults and children who are the victims of family violence, including sexual abuse.’ Victims and perpetrators are defined as including ‘aunts, uncles, cousins and children of previous relationships’ and the definition of family is similarly broad in order to capture all the potential nuances of kinship ties seen in Indigenous communities. There is no restriction based on gender.
FVPLS units have been encouraged to employ male field officers, and men are working in unit management. FVPLS units are also encouraged, as part of their community awareness programs, to publicise the fact that men and women are welcome to use their services.
Retention of expert staff
Recommendation 6
That the Attorney-General’s Department, in consultation with National Legal Aid and the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Legal Services Secretariat, develop a comparative scale of remuneration between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Legal Services (ATSILSs) and Legal Aid Commissions and review funding of providers of services currently delivered by ATSILSs as appropriate.
Not agreed.
The issue of relative remuneration rates has been addressed through the tendering of Indigenous legal services.
The tender is an open and competitive process that identifies service providers who can provide professional and culturally sensitive services. Service contracts require service providers to meet specified service levels across various law types (criminal, civil, family) and in specified geographic locations.
The service contracts require Indigenous legal aid providers to manage their staff with a view to delivering a professional legal service of sufficient quality and capability to meet the contract requirements. Accordingly, it is expected that service providers will attract and retain skilled and committed professionals through appropriate remuneration.
Recommendation 7
That the Department of Treasury grant Fringe Benefit Tax supplementation to Family Violence Prevention Legal Services.
Not agreed.
Following amendments made to the Charities Act in 2001, fringe benefit tax supplementation was introduced to assist a range of Indigenous organisations to meet the cost of FBT changes implemented in 2000. Various Indigenous organisations (including some ATSILSs) applied for supplementation in 2001. In the 2005–06 Budget, the Government announced that this supplementation would be extended.
The level of funding of FVPLS units takes into account the expenses and exigencies associated with rural and remote service delivery, including the need to attract and retain people who would be required to work in isolated locations. The Government does not believe that FVPLS units are in need of FBT supplementation, and the Committee’s report does not give any reasons why the supplementation should be extended.
Recommendation 8
That the Attorney-General’s Department, in consultation with the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Legal Services Secretariat and National Legal Aid, develop and implement a formal exchange program whereby solicitors from providers of services that are currently delivered by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Legal Services and Legal Aid Commissions are afforded opportunities to work, for a specified period, within the other organisation.
Agreed.
On 27 July 2005, the Attorney-General wrote to the Chair of National Legal Aid (NLA) asking the legal aid commissions to consider this recommendation.
NLA replied on 9 August 2005, indicating that it is ‘supportive of the general intent’ behind this recommendation and noting that it was made ‘in the context of maintaining expertise within Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Legal Services.’ However, NLA has ‘significant reservations’ about the viability of establishing exchanges in some locations.
NLA has agreed to work with the Attorney-General’s Department and providers of legal aid to Indigenous persons to assist in developing and implementing exchange programs as appropriate. ‘NLA’s strong view is that the programs themselves should be developed and implemented between Indigenous legal services providers and the Commission in each jurisdiction. This will ensure that programs are suited to local conditions such as the capacities of the providers and any community/cultural issues.’
NLA also provided examples of successful exchanges:
the secondment of a family law solicitor from the Victorian Legal Aid Commission to the Victorian Aboriginal Legal Service
the provision of a family law solicitor by ACT Legal Aid to the South East Aboriginal Legal Service, and
the provision of one of WA Legal Aid’s restricted practitioners to the Aboriginal Legal Service of WA to assist with a murder trial.
The NLA also noted that there have been other arrangements in the past between legal aid commissions and Indigenous legal aid services—not ‘exchanges as such’ but a result of the Commissions’ recognition of the needs of certain Indigenous legal services offices and the capacity of Commissions to provide assistance at a given time.
Recommendation 9
That the Department of Education, Science and Training, in consultation with the Attorney-General’s Department, the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Service Secretariat and the National Network of Indigenous Women’s Legal Services, explore the feasibility of implementing a system of bonded scholarships where successful applicants on being accepted to the bar are required to provide a specified period of service to a designated provider of services currently delivered by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Legal Services or Family Violence Prevention Legal Services.
Not agreed.
Under the Higher Education Support Act 2003, organisations such as the ATSILS and the FVPLSs can offer bonded scholarships to students through employer reserved arrangements. Under these provisions, the organisations would enter into arrangements directly with higher education providers to provide particular courses or study programs that meet their professional or training requirements. The organisations would contribute to the costs of their students’ education.
While the terms of these arrangements are matters for employers and universities to determine, the Department of Education, Science and Training could provide advice and general information relating to relevant higher education studies, such as performance statistics and student destination survey data, which may assist organisations in brokering arrangements and implementing such a scheme.
Recommendation 10
That the Department of Education, Science and Training ensure that places are available for the training and development of paralegal community support workers who are employed with providers of services that are currently delivered by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Legal Services and Family Violence Prevention Legal Services.
States and Territories have responsibility for determining training places.
Through the 2005–2008 Commonwealth-State Agreement for Skilling Australia’s Workforce, the Australian Government requires States and Territories over the life of the Agreement to increase participation of Indigenous Australians at higher qualification levels, specifically at Certificate III and above, and also to create additional training places in regional and remote locations for Indigenous Australians. Additional training places for Indigenous Australians will also be available through the Joint Indigenous Funding Pool which has been established to improve outcomes for Indigenous Australians. The Commonwealth–State Agreement for Skilling Australia’s Workforce requires that States and Territories match the Australian Government’s contribution to the Joint Indigenous Funding Pool which will result in approximately $23 million over 2006–2008 for Indigenous training.
The National Training Information Service shows three qualifications, a number of courses and a large number of units of competency in specific training packages that deal with legal issues. The Community Services competency standard has a number of units that could be used to train community support workers in paralegal work (ie ‘working within a legal and ethical framework’ and ‘operating in a legal context’). There are also legal units of competency in the Health, Local Government, Financial Services, Business Services and Administration competency standards—all of which could be relevant to the work performed by the community support workers employed by the ATSILS and the FVPLSs.
Coordination of legal aid services to Indigenous Australians
Recommendation 11
That the Attorney-General raise the matter of Commonwealth and State/Territory funding for providers of services currently delivered by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Legal Services and Family Violence Prevention Legal Services with his state and territory counterparts with a view to gaining some level of state/territory contribution for these services.
Agreed.
The Attorney-General brought this recommendation to the attention of his state and territory counterparts in preparation for a meeting of the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General in Sydney on 4 November 2005. The Attorney-General will continue to encourage state/territory contribution for these services.
Recommendation 12
That the Attorney-General’s Department, in consultation with National Legal Aid and the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Legal Services Secretariat, develop and require providers of services currently delivered by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Legal Services (ATSILSs) to implement a memorandum of understanding between them and Legal Aid Commissions (LACs) that includes:
sharing each others duty solicitors;
the provision of representation and advice by one organisation to the other’s clients;
the use of office space and facilities in ATSILSs by LAC solicitors for Indigenous clients when these clients are referred from ATSILSs to LACs;
protocols requiring ATSILSs solicitors to introduce clients to LAC solicitors in the event that clients are referred from ATSILSs to LACs;
access of ATSILSs solicitors to LAC technology, such as video-conferencing, in order to facilitate remote client contact;
access of LAC solicitors to Aboriginal Field Officers employed with ATSILSs when required to communicate with clients;
mutual sharing of vehicles for remote travel; and
access of ATSILSs and LAC staff to in-house training programs run by the other organisation.
Agreed.
These issues have been addressed through the new administrative arrangements for the provision of legal services to Indigenous Australians.
The terms of the requests for tender (those already released, and those yet to be released) and the contracts that have been entered into (in those states where tendering has been completed) include a standard for co-operation and relationships with other relevant service providers. These cover the cooperative arrangements between community legal service providers, listed in the recommendation.
Service providers are required to ‘establish a sound working relationship with all other legal aid service providers operating in the same geographical area’ through, for example, formal agreements making provision for (specified) arrangements.
Recommendation 13
That the Attorney-General’s Department rationalise funding of Indigenous legal services by incorporating Indigenous Women’s Projects, that are currently administered through mainstream Community Legal Centres, into the Family Violence Prevention Legal Services program.
Not agreed.
On 1 July 2004, four Indigenous law and justice programs previously administered by the Indigenous Law and Justice Branch of ATSIS became the responsibility of the Attorney-General’s Department.
To optimise the delivery of these programs, former ATSIS staff were grouped together in the newly-created Indigenous Law and Justice Branch within the Department. The benefits of mainstreaming were maximised by locating this Branch within the same division as the Legal Assistance Branch. The Legal Assistance Branch is responsible for programs and policy relating to mainstream legal aid, financial assistance, community legal centres and the operation of the National Pro Bono Resource Centre.
These two branches now form the Indigenous Justice and Legal Assistance Division. Co-location creates many synergies and injects significant experience and a holistic perspective into the development and administration of Indigenous justice policies and programs. The Attorney-General’s Department is well placed to harness mainstream law and justice services for the benefit of Indigenous Australians.
The Indigenous Women’s Projects were established to provide broadly based legal aid and community support to women in need. FVPLSs were established with very specific guidelines and goals. There is no obvious advantage to be had by subsuming one program within the other, apart from the administrative synergies that have already been achieved.
Tendering out of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Legal Services
Recommendation 14
That in centralising providers of services that are currently delivered by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Legal Services, the Attorney-General’s Department ensures that these services establish and maintain governance mechanisms that allow representation of and responsiveness to the views of the communities in their service area.
Agreed in part.
This issue has been addressed through the new administrative arrangements for the provision of legal services to Indigenous Australians. Under those arrangements, service providers are required to provide culturally sensitive services. This inevitably requires engagement with the Indigenous community in order to meet its distinct needs and expectations.
Recommendation 15
That in awarding tender bids, the Attorney-General’s Department ensure that the current levels of paralegal community legal workers employed by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Legal Services is not diminished.
Agreed in part.
This issue has been addressed through the new administrative arrangements for the provision of legal services to Indigenous Australians. Although the hiring of staff is a matter for service providers, under the new arrangements those providers are required to meet the standards of accessibility and cultural sensitivity specified in the contract. Service providers must have documented policies and procedures in place and evidence of training that ensures staff are sufficiently aware of cultural sensitivities when dealing with local communities. Recruitment of new staff must be undertaken with regard to the importance of cultural understanding. Training at induction, and on an ongoing basis, is also stipulated.
Recommendation 16
That the Australian National Audit Office conduct a performance audit of those areas of the Attorney-General Department’s responsible for funding of Family Violence Prevention Legal Services and Community Legal Centres with regard to the same matters covered in the Audit Report No. 13, 2003–2004.
This recommendation is a matter for the Australian National Audit Office.
The Office of Evaluation and Audit (OEA), within the Department of Finance and Administration, has completed an audit of the FVPLS program administered by the Attorney-General’s Department.
Recommendation 17
That the Australian National Audit Office conduct a performance audit of the Indigenous Law and Justice Branch of the Attorney-General’s Department at the mid way point of the tender contracts in each jurisdiction with a view to identifying difficulties and recommending improvements in administration and service delivery.
This recommendation is a matter for the Australian National Audit Office.
A reserve topic for 2006–07 in the OEA’s evaluation and work program is an evaluation of the extent to which Indigenous legal aid providers are delivering better outcomes for the Indigenous client communities and better value for money for the Government since the tenders were released.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reports: Government Responses</title>,Committees,24,1
"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,2006-03-02,"—I present the final report of the Legal and Constitutional References Committee on the administration and operation of the Migration Act, together with the Hansard record of proceedings and documents presented to the committee.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the report.
Leave granted.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
I rise to speak to the tabling of the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee report on the administration and operation of the Migration Act 1958. Australia’s immigration policy has been the subject of a good deal of analysis and commentary over the last few years, particularly issues related to the treatment of refugees and more recently the cases of Cornelia Rau and Vivian Solon. This has been accompanied by severe and justified criticism of the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs and the failures of successive ministers.
The references committee was given the task of reviewing the Migration Act. However, it became obvious from the substantial evidence we received that there was public disquiet related to Australia’s humanitarian program, particularly aspects of the onshore refugee program such as ministerial discretion, temporary protection visas, detention and removal policies and practices, the cumbersome nature of the act and the culture of the department. Our report obviously focuses on the issues about which we received most evidence. In consequence, there is limited coverage in this report of the non-humanitarian aspects of the act, although issues related to student visas are the subject of a chapter in this report.
The inquiry was advertised nationally on 29 June 2005 and we received 234 submissions. Public hearings were held in Adelaide, Melbourne, Sydney and Canberra at which the committee heard from 93 witnesses. Members of the committee were also able to visit Villawood detention centre. I want to place on record the committee’s thanks to all those who took the time to provide considered submissions and who appeared as witnesses. I also want to acknowledge the assistance provided to us by officers of the department throughout the inquiry and with our visit to Villawood.
At this early stage of my presentation of this report I would like to thank the committee secretariat for its assistance with the inquiry and the report. In particular, I want to thank the committee secretary, Owen Walsh, who has recently left the Senate and has been replaced by Jonathan Curtis. I think that the work that Owen undertook needs to be particularly mentioned. The secretariat staff who have supported and assisted Owen and more recently Jonathan and the committee as a whole deserve a mention for their diligent and meticulous work in relation not only to the inquiry, which produced the report tabled today, but also in relation to the overall and ongoing work of the committee.
This comprehensive report makes 61 recommendations covering a wide range of regulatory, legislative, accountability and operational issues. Let us remember that this inquiry was initiated because of the gross mistreatment and significant failings of the department in the exposure of the treatment of two Australian citizens and the failure of this government to recognise that instead of having a thorough and efficient immigration system we have had a turnstile of incompetence under the last two ministers.
Let me start with a comment on the state of the Migration Act itself. The committee agrees with the evidence we received that the Migration Act has become a complex and unwieldy monster. Recommendation 7 says:
... that the Migration Act and Regulations be reviewed as a matter of priority, with a view to establishing an immigration regime that is fair, transparent and legally defensible as well as more concise and comprehensible.
We believe that this task should be undertaken by the Australian Law Reform Commission
There is no doubt that the majority of changes in the immigration system in recent years have occurred by changing regulations rather than legislation. This has led to a minister that is now at arms length from the responsibility of the operation of the department and this has provided a shield and an excuse for a succession of ministers that have maintained that any problems lie within the department when they should be stepping up to the plate and taking ministerial responsibility. The roles, powers and corresponding accountabilities of ministers in relation to their departments have changed considerably over the past decade. In the context of the Migration Act there seems to have been a simultaneous growth in ministerial discretion and a decline in ministerial responsibility for the actions and administration of either their staff or the department.
We acknowledge that the complexity of public administration and the wide-ranging scope of departmental decision making do impact on the minister’s role. Nevertheless, the committee considers it important that accountability measures keep pace with these developments and that not only the department but in particular the minister—especially the minister—be held to account for actions and decisions that are made. Therefore it is not appropriate that terms of reference for inquiries, such as those given to Mr Comrie, would exclude the minister and his or her staff. If they are excluded, effective parliamentary scrutiny of public administration is severely curtailed, and we saw that in the Comrie report, which did not have in its terms of reference the authority to inquire into the related matters in the minister’s office.
That is the rationale behind recommendation No. 1 in the report, which reads:
The committee recommends that the terms of reference for any future independent inquiries into the administration of the Migration Act provide the authority for the investigation to include both the Minister and the Minister’s office.
The report reviews mandatory detention from a policy perspective and examines the operation of that policy in practice. The committee has made 14 recommendations for specific changes to the current policy and practice of detention which we believe would greatly improve the present system.
While there have been some changes recently, particularly in relation to women and children, the law still permits indefinite detention. There is a significant body of evidence that prolonged indefinite detention causes detainees an unacceptable level of mental distress and, in some cases, permanent mental illness, and many witnesses provided that evidence to us. This violates one of the most fundamental rights of all human beings: to be treated with respect and to be protected from mental and physical violation.
One of our key recommendations is that the policy of indefinite mandatory detention should cease. We make this recommendation with the full awareness that it was an ALP government that introduced the mandatory detention policy. However the committee believes that circumstances have now changed. It is time this policy changed too. The committee fully understands that there is a need to detain an unlawful arrival while security and health checks are undertaken, but we believe that 90 days should be more than sufficient for that purpose. Any further deprivation of liberty should be subject to judicial supervision and only permitted on specific identifiable grounds such as where the person poses a danger to the community.
I also draw attention to the way in which Australia manages claims for asylum that go outside the definitions under the refugee convention. Australia has human rights obligations not to return a person to a country where there is a serious risk of a violation of human rights or substantial grounds for believing that the individual will be subject to torture. However, under the current system, the only way this protection is available is by a non-reviewable ministerial discretion to grant protection. This only happens after a person has pursued their claims for asylum under the refugee convention. This approach causes significant delays and results in unnecessary and lengthy periods of detention for people with legitimate protection claims who do not fall within the strict definition of the refugee convention. The discretionary approach to this issue also lacks the elements of transparency and accountability. Recommendation 33 therefore recommends that ‘complementary protection’ be put on a proper statutory footing so that all claims can be dealt with simultaneously.
A related issue is management of immigration detention centres. We received evidence on many aspects of the management of detention centres, but for me the bottom line is an abiding belief that there is a fundamental conflict in a private company, whose prime consideration is profit, managing such establishments. Recommendation 48 therefore suggests:
... that, as a fundamental overarching principle, direct responsibility for the management and provision of services at immigration detention centres in Australia should revert to the Commonwealth.
In concluding my comments, I say that it is only today that I have seen the dissenting report from the government members on this committee and I want to make a few comments very quickly. For the government members on this committee this has been a missed opportunity to provide some meaningful and practical changes to the management of the immigration system. There is only one witness who can actually defend the department, and if you look at the government senators’ contribution to their report you will see that DIMIA says, ‘Everything’s okay.’ So if you want to know that everything happening is all right in the immigration department, ask the department themselves. It is a classic case of Yes Minister. The government’s dissenting report fails to quote any of the 233 other witnesses that we heard from; they only quote from the department to defend their stance. It is unfortunate that most of the members of the committee missed the hearings in Adelaide and Sydney and, of course, the trip to Villawood. (Time expired)
",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Legal and Constitutional References Committee</title>,Committees,26,1
"Fierravanti-Wells, Sen Concetta",LP,2006-03-02,"—The majority report of the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee on the operation of the Migration Act was, in our view, substantially flawed. It suffers from a biased and highly selective use of the evidence presented during the inquiry. The dissenting report sets out criticisms of the majority report, but four stand out. Firstly, the majority report consistently fails to see the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs in its wider context. DIMA is a department which makes in excess of four million decisions a year—yes, four million decisions. It administers large and complex migration and refugee programs.
In addition to the 43 per cent of Australians who were either born overseas or have at least one parent who was born overseas, Australia is host to a very large number of temporary entrants. In December 2005, for example, there were around three-quarters of a million people in the country on a temporary visa. In the 10 minutes or so that I speak today, the department has considered and granted around 90 visas and around 550 people have entered or left our country. That is almost one every second. This is a department with a very wide portfolio responsibility, which includes migration and settlement, multicultural issues, community harmony and citizenship objectives. As a consequence of these wide-ranging responsibilities, the department necessarily engages in legal activities. The costs of litigation to the Commonwealth in the immigration sphere are quite significant and have been significant for a number of years.
During my years of employment with the Australian Government Solicitor, I saw first-hand the nature of the legal work undertaken by the department. Indeed, my representation of the department has spanned across 20 years, from the time of judicial review of matters in the 1980s under Labor administrations to the more recent cases of alleged damage claims arising out of detention. Just in response to Senator Crossin, I have seen what this department has done, not just recently but over the last 20 years. The department’s litigation costs are due largely to the number of cases which are undertaken in any year.
I think it is important to note some telling statistics. Currently, the department has a litigation caseload of around 3,500 active cases before the courts and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. It receives approximately 5,000 new cases each year, and this has been the trend in recent years. It resolves just over 5,000 cases each year. These are significant figures. For the last financial year, 2004-05, the department’s spending on litigation external to the department was in the order of $36.8 million and the internal cost of managing that litigation was somewhere in the order of $5½ million.
The department’s success rate in litigation is very high. The department takes great care to seek to defend only those cases where it has reasonable grounds for success. This indeed was my experience also, and I think that is reflected in its success rates before the courts and tribunals. In the financial year 2002-03 the department was successful in 92.5 per cent of the cases it defended; in 2003-04 that improved to 94 per cent; and in 2004-05 it was 95 per cent. Inevitably, in managing such a large number of matters, any agency will make a certain number of mistakes. While it is quite proper to examine these mistakes and take measures to address them, the majority report makes no attempt to see the department’s decision making in a wider context. Indeed, it arrives at general conclusions based on isolated specific examples.
The second major defect of the report is its resolute fixation on the past. Large tracts of text are devoted to a detailed rehashing of information and allegations contained in previous inquiries, blind to the quite extensive changes announced by the minister as a result of, among other things, the recent Palmer and Comrie inquiries. Consequently, many of the issues and criticisms presented in the report are out of date and no longer relevant. Thirdly, the majority report is characterised by what can only be described as a biased and uncritical approach to evidence. In particular, many allegations are passed off as evidence of fact without any attempt to test the accuracy of the claims being made or the motives of the individuals making them. This error is compounded by those allegations then being used to justify sweeping generalisations and recommendations. Fourthly, the majority report seems largely concerned with the management of asylum seekers and immigration detention to the exclusion of the wider operation of the act.
I remind those opposite that the system of mandatory detention was introduced in 1992 by the Keating Labor government. In one of the many classic examples of partisan myopia, the majority report fails to mention, much less objectively examine, detention statistics prior to 1996. The period 1992-1996 is conveniently left absent from discussion in the majority report—four years when the foundation of detention was established. I refer senators to the annual reports of the department—for example, the 1992-93 annual report, which reflected the increases in compliance activity then and the increase in the number of people passing through immigration detention centres.
The report has other failings. These include selective quoting, with unreasonable weight given to comments made by avowed critics of not only the policy of mandatory detention but also the Howard Government in general; selective quoting of statistics; and an unbalanced presentation of material, with chapters containing evidence that is overwhelmingly critical of the department but fails to include comprehensive material provided by the department in response to the hearings and subsequently in answers to questions on notice. The majority report contains paragraph upon paragraph of assertions and allegations on a range of matters and then little of the material provided in response. This gives an unbalanced and distorted view, as it does not put the evidence into proper context.
The majority report is written in an accusatory and negative tone, using over-the-top language rather than giving an unembellished account of the facts. It fails to give proper weight to the reasons why people stay in detention, often for lengthy periods, due to—for example—litigation commenced by them or delays due to applicants seeking adjournments. Indeed, in my years of representing the department, I saw matters prolonged for these very reasons, especially in relation to information the department was seeking to have verified by overseas sources. Another failing of the majority report is that, given that migration agents play an important role, it should have included information about the problems with unscrupulous agents and their impact on cases, as well as the exorbitant fees they charge.
One of the majority report’s main failings is its failure to highlight the key elements of the government’s reform program announced since the Palmer and Comrie inquiries. Indeed, yesterday we saw further announcements by the minister. An important starting point in this process was the minister’s referral to the Commonwealth Ombudsman of all cases of detention that might be in any way doubtful. In light of the Rau and Alvarez cases, this was a justifiable precaution. Supported by a commitment of $231 million, the department has implemented a road map for change which includes the creation of an open and accountable organisation with obligations to government and the community; fair and reasonable dealings with clients; and well-trained and supported staff.
I would remind the Senate of a series of changes, including a restructure of the national office of the department. There are improved and stronger governance arrangements, including a new values and standards committee working with the Ombudsman, the Privacy Commissioner and others. The Audit and Evaluation Committee has now been expanded, with an external chairman.
In addition to the staff training initiatives mentioned in the majority report, substantial improvements have been initiated for the immigration detention centres. These go well beyond the recommendations made in the Palmer report. There is an active case management framework and a community care pilot is also being developed for clients in exceptional circumstances. All detainees are now screened for mental health problems, and mental health plans are developed where appropriate. Vast physical improvements have also been made at Baxter and other immigration detention centres.
Independent reviews of the department’s information technology systems have been implemented, examining business information needs, governance and records management. To these should be added the wider groundbreaking work that the department is doing in developing computerised systems for visa applications. The department has also expressed an ongoing commitment to building on all its reforms, progressing projects and continuing to engage, listen and respond to community concerns.
In combination, these amount to a substantial and systematic response by the government to the flaws identified by the inquiry. The failure of the majority report to properly consider these changes casts serious doubts on the accuracy and relevance of the recommendations it makes. The majority report ignores the wider context of the essential, complex and difficult work that the department does in controlling Australia’s borders. This task is essential to Australia’s security. The dissenting report points out the many flaws in the majority report. Consequently, government senators are unable to agree with the analysis or findings of the majority report.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Legal and Constitutional References Committee</title>,Committees,26,1
"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2006-03-02,"—The scandalous treatment of Cornelia Rau and the discovery that Vivian Solon had been detained and deported continue to raise serious questions in the minds of the public about the competence and the humanity of Australia’s immigration system. The almost universal call for a royal commission to investigate a department that has been described as being out of control and that seriously damages the lives of so many Australians was ignored by the government. Instead, two private inquiries with limited terms of reference were set up. But even these two inquiries, the Palmer inquiry and the Comrie inquiry, indicated there were ‘systemic failures’ and ‘cultural problems’ within the department of immigration.
Due to the government’s refusal to establish a royal commission, the Senate inquiry was set up. The evidence that came before the Senate inquiry, including over 200 submissions, was a litany of disasters—disasters and tragedies where lives were significantly impacted on or destroyed by the actions of this government and this department. The evidence indicated that the cases of Cornelia Rau and Vivian Solon were not isolated incidents. Throughout the inquiry, we heard of widespread instances where such behaviour had gone almost unnoticed and unreported because it was occurring in remote or offshore detention centres. The evidence indicated that the department of immigration was failing to administer the Migration Act in a way that afforded people fairness, justice and proper process. More disturbingly, it was failing in its duty of care to the people in its custody. Indeed, there was compelling evidence that the department and the private companies administering the immigration detention centres were administering the act in a way that was hostile to people and that in some instances led to their abuse.
The evidence also indicated that parts of the Migration Act itself contribute to the failures of the department, particularly the failure of some sections of the department to ensure that officials can use appropriate discretion and commonsense in making the decisions that they make. Parts of the Migration Act that contribute to these failures by the department are section 189, which deals with reasonable suspicion in requiring people to be detained; section 501, which requires people to be deported; and the provisions in the act that deal with temporary protection visas. A further failure of the act is that there is no proper complementary protection scheme in place.
The evidence to the Senate inquiry came under two broad themes. The first relates to the cultural attitudes within the department. We were told of the culture of suspicion and hostility towards asylum seekers—of attempts by department officials to try to catch people out, to look and probe for inconsistencies and to search for reasons to reject applications.
The second theme in the evidence brought before the inquiry was the failure of the policy of mandatory detention and the impact that it has on people’s lives, particularly on their mental health. What was meant to be detention for purely administrative purposes has turned into a system of punitive detention without any of the same safeguards that exist within the criminal justice system. The power to detain unlawful noncitizens has meant that cultural hostility towards asylum seekers has manifested itself in cruel behaviour toward detainees behind razor wire in remote immigration detention centres. Instead of the department making impartial, unbiased and well-considered decisions and treating the individuals in its care with dignity and respect, the policies of this government have led to a virtual criminalisation of asylum seekers.
The Australian Greens lay the blame for the criminalisation of asylum seekers directly on this government. The Prime Minister, the former minister, Mr Ruddock, and the current minister, Minister Vanstone, all bear responsibility for the current cultural and policy problems of the department of immigration. The trails from Cornelia Rau suffering untreated schizophrenia in the Baxter isolation cell and Vivian Solon enduring her injuries in a hospice in the Philippines lead directly to the Prime Minister’s door.
The exploitation of xenophobia by this government and the demonisation of asylum seekers and refugees has led to the culture of hostility that exists within the department of immigration. Continual public comments, some of which have been found to be untrue, from the Prime Minister and the ministers about the security threat posed by boat people and the need to repel and deter asylum seekers, and the discrediting of asylum seekers as non-genuine or queue jumpers, have directly led to the culture problems evident in the recent actions of departmental officials in the department of immigration.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2006-03-02,"—I welcome the tabling of this report. The inquiry was the result of a motion that I moved on behalf of the Democrats, and it is an inquiry that almost certainly would not have been established under the current Senate arrangements. It was initiated in June, before the government took control of the Senate. Judging by the government’s record since then, it is precisely the sort of inquiry that would have been blocked.
I am a bit disappointed in the final results. I think the government senators’ approach from day one has been quite defensive, and that is disappointing with all of the talk from the government about culture change, acknowledging past problems and the reforms that are under way. I would have thought it would be a good opportunity to be more open to examining the problems that still exist.
One comment of Senator Fierravanti-Wells that I do agree with a little bit was that there was a very heavy focus on the asylum seeker and refugee area. Despite that being the area of biggest public controversy, it is actually one of the smaller areas in the operations of the immigration department. That focus in large part was because that is an area a lot of the submissions went to and where the biggest injustices occur. But it is not the only area where there are problems, and it is certainly not the only area where people suffer as a result of the department’s administration of the Migration Act and, indeed, the content of the Migration Act.
Some of those other matters did come up. The inquiry examined issues like the deportation of long-term Australian residents to countries overseas on character grounds and some of the terrible human situations that occur as part of that. We examined and heard some useful evidence about student visa cancellations, the way those are being run and the impact that has on people, and about a few other matters as well.
I think we have to continually make the point that, if we are genuinely going to change the culture of the department, we have to look at the act and the policies that the department has to administer. It is simply not possible and not credible to suggest that a culture is not heavily influenced by the laws and policies that a department has to administer. We have had continual complaints about the number of people that appeal to the courts and the tying up of resources in court action. The fact is that there have been many pieces of legislation put through this chamber supposedly aimed at reducing court action in the migration area and none of them have worked. In fact, I think they have had the opposite effect.
If you make the law deliver unjust outcomes, people will appeal them, because people have an underlying assumption that the law and the system will produce justice and fairness. I know that is a nice, utopian sounding concept, and we all recognise that there are limitations in the justice you can get from the law. But, when you have situations that are clearly fundamentally unfair, unreasonable and unjust, of course people are going to appeal them. The attempts to try and narrow the grounds of appeal to restrict the opportunities for appeal have all failed because the outcomes the government is trying to deliver through its legislation are fundamentally unjust.
There have been warnings time after time. As the Ombudsman himself made clear, there has been report after report, year after year, into all sorts of problems and injustices in the migration area that have been ignored. That has changed with the Cornelia Rau incident, but clearly not enough. We are seeing through this that there is still no recognition from the government. It is time to go back and look at all of the changes that were made over the last 15 years or so and see which ones were really counterproductive. They were all, of course, supported by the Labor Party. They would not have passed into law otherwise, because the Democrats certainly did not support them. There is valuable information from this inquiry that builds on work that has been done before. Unfortunately the government has ignored a lot of that work. I hope they do not ignore this work.

"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,2006-03-02,"—I present the final report of the Legal and Constitutional References Committee on the administration and operation of the Migration Act, together with the Hansard record of proceedings and documents presented to the committee.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the report.
Leave granted.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
I rise to speak to the tabling of the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee report on the administration and operation of the Migration Act 1958. Australia’s immigration policy has been the subject of a good deal of analysis and commentary over the last few years, particularly issues related to the treatment of refugees and more recently the cases of Cornelia Rau and Vivian Solon. This has been accompanied by severe and justified criticism of the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs and the failures of successive ministers.
The references committee was given the task of reviewing the Migration Act. However, it became obvious from the substantial evidence we received that there was public disquiet related to Australia’s humanitarian program, particularly aspects of the onshore refugee program such as ministerial discretion, temporary protection visas, detention and removal policies and practices, the cumbersome nature of the act and the culture of the department. Our report obviously focuses on the issues about which we received most evidence. In consequence, there is limited coverage in this report of the non-humanitarian aspects of the act, although issues related to student visas are the subject of a chapter in this report.
The inquiry was advertised nationally on 29 June 2005 and we received 234 submissions. Public hearings were held in Adelaide, Melbourne, Sydney and Canberra at which the committee heard from 93 witnesses. Members of the committee were also able to visit Villawood detention centre. I want to place on record the committee’s thanks to all those who took the time to provide considered submissions and who appeared as witnesses. I also want to acknowledge the assistance provided to us by officers of the department throughout the inquiry and with our visit to Villawood.
At this early stage of my presentation of this report I would like to thank the committee secretariat for its assistance with the inquiry and the report. In particular, I want to thank the committee secretary, Owen Walsh, who has recently left the Senate and has been replaced by Jonathan Curtis. I think that the work that Owen undertook needs to be particularly mentioned. The secretariat staff who have supported and assisted Owen and more recently Jonathan and the committee as a whole deserve a mention for their diligent and meticulous work in relation not only to the inquiry, which produced the report tabled today, but also in relation to the overall and ongoing work of the committee.
This comprehensive report makes 61 recommendations covering a wide range of regulatory, legislative, accountability and operational issues. Let us remember that this inquiry was initiated because of the gross mistreatment and significant failings of the department in the exposure of the treatment of two Australian citizens and the failure of this government to recognise that instead of having a thorough and efficient immigration system we have had a turnstile of incompetence under the last two ministers.
Let me start with a comment on the state of the Migration Act itself. The committee agrees with the evidence we received that the Migration Act has become a complex and unwieldy monster. Recommendation 7 says:
... that the Migration Act and Regulations be reviewed as a matter of priority, with a view to establishing an immigration regime that is fair, transparent and legally defensible as well as more concise and comprehensible.
We believe that this task should be undertaken by the Australian Law Reform Commission
There is no doubt that the majority of changes in the immigration system in recent years have occurred by changing regulations rather than legislation. This has led to a minister that is now at arms length from the responsibility of the operation of the department and this has provided a shield and an excuse for a succession of ministers that have maintained that any problems lie within the department when they should be stepping up to the plate and taking ministerial responsibility. The roles, powers and corresponding accountabilities of ministers in relation to their departments have changed considerably over the past decade. In the context of the Migration Act there seems to have been a simultaneous growth in ministerial discretion and a decline in ministerial responsibility for the actions and administration of either their staff or the department.
We acknowledge that the complexity of public administration and the wide-ranging scope of departmental decision making do impact on the minister’s role. Nevertheless, the committee considers it important that accountability measures keep pace with these developments and that not only the department but in particular the minister—especially the minister—be held to account for actions and decisions that are made. Therefore it is not appropriate that terms of reference for inquiries, such as those given to Mr Comrie, would exclude the minister and his or her staff. If they are excluded, effective parliamentary scrutiny of public administration is severely curtailed, and we saw that in the Comrie report, which did not have in its terms of reference the authority to inquire into the related matters in the minister’s office.
That is the rationale behind recommendation No. 1 in the report, which reads:
The committee recommends that the terms of reference for any future independent inquiries into the administration of the Migration Act provide the authority for the investigation to include both the Minister and the Minister’s office.
The report reviews mandatory detention from a policy perspective and examines the operation of that policy in practice. The committee has made 14 recommendations for specific changes to the current policy and practice of detention which we believe would greatly improve the present system.
While there have been some changes recently, particularly in relation to women and children, the law still permits indefinite detention. There is a significant body of evidence that prolonged indefinite detention causes detainees an unacceptable level of mental distress and, in some cases, permanent mental illness, and many witnesses provided that evidence to us. This violates one of the most fundamental rights of all human beings: to be treated with respect and to be protected from mental and physical violation.
One of our key recommendations is that the policy of indefinite mandatory detention should cease. We make this recommendation with the full awareness that it was an ALP government that introduced the mandatory detention policy. However the committee believes that circumstances have now changed. It is time this policy changed too. The committee fully understands that there is a need to detain an unlawful arrival while security and health checks are undertaken, but we believe that 90 days should be more than sufficient for that purpose. Any further deprivation of liberty should be subject to judicial supervision and only permitted on specific identifiable grounds such as where the person poses a danger to the community.
I also draw attention to the way in which Australia manages claims for asylum that go outside the definitions under the refugee convention. Australia has human rights obligations not to return a person to a country where there is a serious risk of a violation of human rights or substantial grounds for believing that the individual will be subject to torture. However, under the current system, the only way this protection is available is by a non-reviewable ministerial discretion to grant protection. This only happens after a person has pursued their claims for asylum under the refugee convention. This approach causes significant delays and results in unnecessary and lengthy periods of detention for people with legitimate protection claims who do not fall within the strict definition of the refugee convention. The discretionary approach to this issue also lacks the elements of transparency and accountability. Recommendation 33 therefore recommends that ‘complementary protection’ be put on a proper statutory footing so that all claims can be dealt with simultaneously.
A related issue is management of immigration detention centres. We received evidence on many aspects of the management of detention centres, but for me the bottom line is an abiding belief that there is a fundamental conflict in a private company, whose prime consideration is profit, managing such establishments. Recommendation 48 therefore suggests:
... that, as a fundamental overarching principle, direct responsibility for the management and provision of services at immigration detention centres in Australia should revert to the Commonwealth.
In concluding my comments, I say that it is only today that I have seen the dissenting report from the government members on this committee and I want to make a few comments very quickly. For the government members on this committee this has been a missed opportunity to provide some meaningful and practical changes to the management of the immigration system. There is only one witness who can actually defend the department, and if you look at the government senators’ contribution to their report you will see that DIMIA says, ‘Everything’s okay.’ So if you want to know that everything happening is all right in the immigration department, ask the department themselves. It is a classic case of Yes Minister. The government’s dissenting report fails to quote any of the 233 other witnesses that we heard from; they only quote from the department to defend their stance. It is unfortunate that most of the members of the committee missed the hearings in Adelaide and Sydney and, of course, the trip to Villawood. (Time expired)
",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,26,2
"Fierravanti-Wells, Sen Concetta",LP,2006-03-02,"—The majority report of the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee on the operation of the Migration Act was, in our view, substantially flawed. It suffers from a biased and highly selective use of the evidence presented during the inquiry. The dissenting report sets out criticisms of the majority report, but four stand out. Firstly, the majority report consistently fails to see the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs in its wider context. DIMA is a department which makes in excess of four million decisions a year—yes, four million decisions. It administers large and complex migration and refugee programs.
In addition to the 43 per cent of Australians who were either born overseas or have at least one parent who was born overseas, Australia is host to a very large number of temporary entrants. In December 2005, for example, there were around three-quarters of a million people in the country on a temporary visa. In the 10 minutes or so that I speak today, the department has considered and granted around 90 visas and around 550 people have entered or left our country. That is almost one every second. This is a department with a very wide portfolio responsibility, which includes migration and settlement, multicultural issues, community harmony and citizenship objectives. As a consequence of these wide-ranging responsibilities, the department necessarily engages in legal activities. The costs of litigation to the Commonwealth in the immigration sphere are quite significant and have been significant for a number of years.
During my years of employment with the Australian Government Solicitor, I saw first-hand the nature of the legal work undertaken by the department. Indeed, my representation of the department has spanned across 20 years, from the time of judicial review of matters in the 1980s under Labor administrations to the more recent cases of alleged damage claims arising out of detention. Just in response to Senator Crossin, I have seen what this department has done, not just recently but over the last 20 years. The department’s litigation costs are due largely to the number of cases which are undertaken in any year.
I think it is important to note some telling statistics. Currently, the department has a litigation caseload of around 3,500 active cases before the courts and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. It receives approximately 5,000 new cases each year, and this has been the trend in recent years. It resolves just over 5,000 cases each year. These are significant figures. For the last financial year, 2004-05, the department’s spending on litigation external to the department was in the order of $36.8 million and the internal cost of managing that litigation was somewhere in the order of $5½ million.
The department’s success rate in litigation is very high. The department takes great care to seek to defend only those cases where it has reasonable grounds for success. This indeed was my experience also, and I think that is reflected in its success rates before the courts and tribunals. In the financial year 2002-03 the department was successful in 92.5 per cent of the cases it defended; in 2003-04 that improved to 94 per cent; and in 2004-05 it was 95 per cent. Inevitably, in managing such a large number of matters, any agency will make a certain number of mistakes. While it is quite proper to examine these mistakes and take measures to address them, the majority report makes no attempt to see the department’s decision making in a wider context. Indeed, it arrives at general conclusions based on isolated specific examples.
The second major defect of the report is its resolute fixation on the past. Large tracts of text are devoted to a detailed rehashing of information and allegations contained in previous inquiries, blind to the quite extensive changes announced by the minister as a result of, among other things, the recent Palmer and Comrie inquiries. Consequently, many of the issues and criticisms presented in the report are out of date and no longer relevant. Thirdly, the majority report is characterised by what can only be described as a biased and uncritical approach to evidence. In particular, many allegations are passed off as evidence of fact without any attempt to test the accuracy of the claims being made or the motives of the individuals making them. This error is compounded by those allegations then being used to justify sweeping generalisations and recommendations. Fourthly, the majority report seems largely concerned with the management of asylum seekers and immigration detention to the exclusion of the wider operation of the act.
I remind those opposite that the system of mandatory detention was introduced in 1992 by the Keating Labor government. In one of the many classic examples of partisan myopia, the majority report fails to mention, much less objectively examine, detention statistics prior to 1996. The period 1992-1996 is conveniently left absent from discussion in the majority report—four years when the foundation of detention was established. I refer senators to the annual reports of the department—for example, the 1992-93 annual report, which reflected the increases in compliance activity then and the increase in the number of people passing through immigration detention centres.
The report has other failings. These include selective quoting, with unreasonable weight given to comments made by avowed critics of not only the policy of mandatory detention but also the Howard Government in general; selective quoting of statistics; and an unbalanced presentation of material, with chapters containing evidence that is overwhelmingly critical of the department but fails to include comprehensive material provided by the department in response to the hearings and subsequently in answers to questions on notice. The majority report contains paragraph upon paragraph of assertions and allegations on a range of matters and then little of the material provided in response. This gives an unbalanced and distorted view, as it does not put the evidence into proper context.
The majority report is written in an accusatory and negative tone, using over-the-top language rather than giving an unembellished account of the facts. It fails to give proper weight to the reasons why people stay in detention, often for lengthy periods, due to—for example—litigation commenced by them or delays due to applicants seeking adjournments. Indeed, in my years of representing the department, I saw matters prolonged for these very reasons, especially in relation to information the department was seeking to have verified by overseas sources. Another failing of the majority report is that, given that migration agents play an important role, it should have included information about the problems with unscrupulous agents and their impact on cases, as well as the exorbitant fees they charge.
One of the majority report’s main failings is its failure to highlight the key elements of the government’s reform program announced since the Palmer and Comrie inquiries. Indeed, yesterday we saw further announcements by the minister. An important starting point in this process was the minister’s referral to the Commonwealth Ombudsman of all cases of detention that might be in any way doubtful. In light of the Rau and Alvarez cases, this was a justifiable precaution. Supported by a commitment of $231 million, the department has implemented a road map for change which includes the creation of an open and accountable organisation with obligations to government and the community; fair and reasonable dealings with clients; and well-trained and supported staff.
I would remind the Senate of a series of changes, including a restructure of the national office of the department. There are improved and stronger governance arrangements, including a new values and standards committee working with the Ombudsman, the Privacy Commissioner and others. The Audit and Evaluation Committee has now been expanded, with an external chairman.
In addition to the staff training initiatives mentioned in the majority report, substantial improvements have been initiated for the immigration detention centres. These go well beyond the recommendations made in the Palmer report. There is an active case management framework and a community care pilot is also being developed for clients in exceptional circumstances. All detainees are now screened for mental health problems, and mental health plans are developed where appropriate. Vast physical improvements have also been made at Baxter and other immigration detention centres.
Independent reviews of the department’s information technology systems have been implemented, examining business information needs, governance and records management. To these should be added the wider groundbreaking work that the department is doing in developing computerised systems for visa applications. The department has also expressed an ongoing commitment to building on all its reforms, progressing projects and continuing to engage, listen and respond to community concerns.
In combination, these amount to a substantial and systematic response by the government to the flaws identified by the inquiry. The failure of the majority report to properly consider these changes casts serious doubts on the accuracy and relevance of the recommendations it makes. The majority report ignores the wider context of the essential, complex and difficult work that the department does in controlling Australia’s borders. This task is essential to Australia’s security. The dissenting report points out the many flaws in the majority report. Consequently, government senators are unable to agree with the analysis or findings of the majority report.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,26,2
"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2006-03-02,"—The scandalous treatment of Cornelia Rau and the discovery that Vivian Solon had been detained and deported continue to raise serious questions in the minds of the public about the competence and the humanity of Australia’s immigration system. The almost universal call for a royal commission to investigate a department that has been described as being out of control and that seriously damages the lives of so many Australians was ignored by the government. Instead, two private inquiries with limited terms of reference were set up. But even these two inquiries, the Palmer inquiry and the Comrie inquiry, indicated there were ‘systemic failures’ and ‘cultural problems’ within the department of immigration.
Due to the government’s refusal to establish a royal commission, the Senate inquiry was set up. The evidence that came before the Senate inquiry, including over 200 submissions, was a litany of disasters—disasters and tragedies where lives were significantly impacted on or destroyed by the actions of this government and this department. The evidence indicated that the cases of Cornelia Rau and Vivian Solon were not isolated incidents. Throughout the inquiry, we heard of widespread instances where such behaviour had gone almost unnoticed and unreported because it was occurring in remote or offshore detention centres. The evidence indicated that the department of immigration was failing to administer the Migration Act in a way that afforded people fairness, justice and proper process. More disturbingly, it was failing in its duty of care to the people in its custody. Indeed, there was compelling evidence that the department and the private companies administering the immigration detention centres were administering the act in a way that was hostile to people and that in some instances led to their abuse.
The evidence also indicated that parts of the Migration Act itself contribute to the failures of the department, particularly the failure of some sections of the department to ensure that officials can use appropriate discretion and commonsense in making the decisions that they make. Parts of the Migration Act that contribute to these failures by the department are section 189, which deals with reasonable suspicion in requiring people to be detained; section 501, which requires people to be deported; and the provisions in the act that deal with temporary protection visas. A further failure of the act is that there is no proper complementary protection scheme in place.
The evidence to the Senate inquiry came under two broad themes. The first relates to the cultural attitudes within the department. We were told of the culture of suspicion and hostility towards asylum seekers—of attempts by department officials to try to catch people out, to look and probe for inconsistencies and to search for reasons to reject applications.
The second theme in the evidence brought before the inquiry was the failure of the policy of mandatory detention and the impact that it has on people’s lives, particularly on their mental health. What was meant to be detention for purely administrative purposes has turned into a system of punitive detention without any of the same safeguards that exist within the criminal justice system. The power to detain unlawful noncitizens has meant that cultural hostility towards asylum seekers has manifested itself in cruel behaviour toward detainees behind razor wire in remote immigration detention centres. Instead of the department making impartial, unbiased and well-considered decisions and treating the individuals in its care with dignity and respect, the policies of this government have led to a virtual criminalisation of asylum seekers.
The Australian Greens lay the blame for the criminalisation of asylum seekers directly on this government. The Prime Minister, the former minister, Mr Ruddock, and the current minister, Minister Vanstone, all bear responsibility for the current cultural and policy problems of the department of immigration. The trails from Cornelia Rau suffering untreated schizophrenia in the Baxter isolation cell and Vivian Solon enduring her injuries in a hospice in the Philippines lead directly to the Prime Minister’s door.
The exploitation of xenophobia by this government and the demonisation of asylum seekers and refugees has led to the culture of hostility that exists within the department of immigration. Continual public comments, some of which have been found to be untrue, from the Prime Minister and the ministers about the security threat posed by boat people and the need to repel and deter asylum seekers, and the discrediting of asylum seekers as non-genuine or queue jumpers, have directly led to the culture problems evident in the recent actions of departmental officials in the department of immigration. It should be no surprise that the bureaucracy have taken on cultural attitudes that have been so vehemently and stridently expressed through government ministers and have subsequently administered the act in the way in which they thought the government desired.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,26,2

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2006-03-02,"—I would like to speak briefly to document No. 1, which deals with the inquiry into the Vivian Alvarez matter, the report by Mr Comrie and reports to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs from the secretary of the department on the implementation of the recommendations of the Palmer report. There is a whole range of documents further down the list dealing with the Commonwealth Ombudsman’s reports into individual cases, and I might speak on a few of those later, but I think the opportunity needs to be grasped whenever possible to highlight just how appalling this case was.
I note the comments made by the Ombudsman to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Committee in its hearings examining this case. He said this was one of the more damning reports that the Ombudsman has produced about a Commonwealth department. He said it is about the most damning report that has been prepared. Some of the reports that he has produced about other individual cases are certainly not as comprehensive—they are only a few pages long—but they also provide some very horrifying stories. It is worth emphasising that sometimes there were suggestions in statements made by members of the government that the Cornelia Rau and Vivian Alvarez cases were oddities, rarities and exceptions that prove the rule. There are continual references to the huge number of visa decisions the department has to make each year and that, obviously, you will get a few of those wrong.
That is all true, but there is a difference between getting a decision wrong, inflicting monumental injustice on people, and having no regard for the suffering that that has caused. That is probably the worst aspect of this report. Beyond the incompetence, beyond the flawed interpretation of the act, the worst aspect was the total disregard for this person’s wellbeing and the appalling actions of a few departmental officials who, when they found out what had happened—that this woman, an extremely ill Australian citizen, had been wrongfully deported from Australia and left on her own—ignored it and looked the other way. An extra two years of suffering occurred that would not otherwise have occurred.
That has to be emphasised as often as possible, because that is the absolute nadir of the culture of the immigration department at that time. I am ashamed to say that at least a couple of those people were from the DIMIA office in my home town of Brisbane. We have to ensure that such an attitude is completely and utterly eradicated. My concern, as I have said a number of times, is that until we change the act and some of the underpinnings of the government’s policy we will not be able to change that culture and completely eradicate mind-sets like that.
I also emphasise another comment the Ombudsman made at that time when he said:
Nearly all of the problems of administration that are highlighted in the Alvarez ... [report] have been raised in the past. The Ombudsman’s office, prior to my time, did an own-motion investigation, for example, on the conditions in detention centres. The human rights commission did a report a year or so ago on children in detention.
As our annual report indicates every year, there are problem areas such as record keeping; lack of clarity in memoranda of understanding ... issues about the adequacy of medical and health diagnoses in detention centres ... the regularity of visits by mental health professionals ...
He went on to say that there were problems with compliance and missing notebooks, problems with people not being fully cognisant of the legislation and privacy being used as an inappropriate obstacle to the circulation of information. They are all quotes from the Ombudsman about issues that have been raised, as he said, in their annual reports every year, and many other reports as well, including Senate committee reports. The real problem is not that the government did not know what was happening; the real problem is that, like those public servants, they were told what was happening but they ignored it. These sorts of injustices are the consequence.

"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,2006-03-02,"—I rise tonight to speak on this report. I was the chair of the Senate Finance and Public Administration References Committee that considered the matters relating to the Gallipoli peninsula. I have spoken previously on this when I tabled that report. That report is very comprehensive, dealing with the problems that arose surrounding the construction of the roads on the Gallipoli peninsula. I also note that the government members presented a minority report which I think was about two or three times longer than the majority report, which is pretty unusual. I suppose it could be said that that was a very comprehensive minority report. The problem was that just about every conclusion that was drawn in that minority report was inaccurate.
The first point I wish to make in that regard is that the government senators and other representatives of the government have continued to argue that, because this is sovereign Turkish territory, Australia has no authority or power at the end of the day to get involved in the matter. By implication, these people say: ‘It really wasn’t our fault. It must have been the fault of the Turkish authorities.’ I particularly recall the Prime Minister making those sorts of assertions. I also recall that, at the time, the then minister when these works were being approved in the early days was the Hon. Danna Vale, the then Minister for Veterans’ Affairs. She was the only minister that did not survive the 2004 election as a minister. That was largely due to her atrocious performance over the three years that she had stewardship of that portfolio. What we know is that these works were carried out at the request of the Australian government. It is on the record. The then minister wrote to the Turkish authorities and requested that the work be done. Of course, the government dropped the ball. They did not really take much of an interest in trying to ensure that those works were being carried out in an appropriate manner. It all spilled out when some bone fragments were found. That led to media publicity and claims that they were human remains. That in turn led to a cessation of the works whilst hurried talks were arranged between the Australian and Turkish authorities to try to sort the issue out.
One of the myths that is put about here is that, because Gallipoli is part of Turkey, this work falls under Turkish sovereignty and, as such, we really do not have any influence or power at the end of the day. I cannot deny that this is Turkish sovereign land. We are in many respects treated as guests of the Turkish government. They certainly go to great lengths to ensure that the Anzac Day ceremonies that take place there—and I have been honoured to have attended and participated in those ceremonies—are conducted with the greatest of respect and honour being paid to all the fallen on that peninsula, whether they be Turkish, Australian or from whichever other nations fought at the time.
What is also true is that there is a treaty called the Treaty of Lausanne, which was entered into after the end of World War I and which Turkey is bound by. It contains provisions that require the nation where the battlefields and war graves are located—in this case, Turkey—to meet certain obligations with the maintenance of those war graves. In that respect, countries such as Australia, the United Kingdom and New Zealand, us through the Commonwealth War Graves Commission, have a major role to play in what work is ultimately done on that peninsula and how those memorials, grave sites and other facilities are maintained.
So you simply cannot dismiss this issue by saying, ‘Well, at the end of the day, Australia really couldn’t do anything to solve the problem.’ That is just fallacious nonsense. Unfortunately that was put forward. I might say—and I have spoken about this before—that when we tried, during this hearing, to get some detail from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade as to the application of this treaty, we were denied that information. Firstly it was denied to us because it was said that it is legal advice and we were not entitled to ask for it. And, when we pointed out to the department that that was an erroneous argument and that we were entitled to ask for it, the next response was: ‘Well, there is a longstanding practice that we don’t provide this advice; therefore we are not going to give it to you.’ So they changed the reason for not giving us the advice but they still declined to give it to us.
Of course the real point here is that the second reason is nonsense as well because there is no longstanding practice. In fact, there is a joint committee of this parliament, the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, which does this very sort of work. It looks at the provisions of international treaties that Australia may enter into. It follows that we as a parliament are entitled to be given advice on the intended application of treaties.
The other point I wanted to make, which has come about subsequent to the publication of this report but is very relevant to it, was that a committee of the UK parliament also has considered this matter. I want to read into the Hansard a letter from the Chairman of the All Party War Graves and Battlefield Heritage Group, which consists of members of both houses of the UK parliament. The chairman of that committee is Lord Faulkner of Worcester. He writes to the secretary of our committee, and this has now been made public as a document of the committee:
I am writing to you in my capacity as chairman of the All Party War Graves and Battlefield Heritage Group (APWGBHG), which consists of Members from both Houses of the UK Parliament. The Group exists to support the Commonwealth War Graves Commission, and to further educational programmes aimed at increasing knowledge of battlefield heritage, to support the conservation and promotion of such heritage, and to encourage best practice in multi-disciplinary battlefield archaeology.
My All Party Group has taken a strong interest in the recent developments at Anzac Cove and associated areas on the Gallipoli Peninsula. On behalf of the Group I have made at least three enquiries of both the Australian and New Zealand High Commissions in order to obtain a clearer view of the potential risks and damage to the archaeological and cultural heritage of the Gallipoli battlefields. I have also sought the views of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission. Having taken advice from experts in the UK, Australia, and on the ground in Gallipoli, my Group had been concerned that the construction works were of a scale likely to damage the integrity of this most sensitive of all battlefields.
I am gratified that an inquiry into the matter of the road construction at Anzac Cove has been carried out promptly, and note its comments regarding the damage to the Anzac battlefield. The results of your inquiry were discussed at the last meeting of the APWGBHG. These results confirmed the advice we had received regarding damage, and are therefore of some concern to my Group.
However, I am convinced that the summary recommendations achieved by your inquiry are highly appropriate in order to safeguard the Anzac, and indeed other battlefields of the Gallipoli Peninsula. As such I write to offer the continued support of the APWGBHG in the furtherance of the conservation of these most historically significant battlefields.
Yours sincerely, Richard Faulkner
I think that says it all. The joint committee of the UK parliament has supported the recommendations of this Senate committee.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Finance and Public Administration References Committee</title>,Committees,31,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2006-03-02,"—I will try not to take up my full 10 minutes, but I think that this is an important matter and that the extra information that was tabled contains further worthwhile material for people to examine. There are a few aspects of this issue of roadworks at Gallipoli peninsula, specifically at Anzac Cove. Firstly, there is no doubt that it is significantly noticeable. I had the great fortune and privilege to be able to visit Gallipoli towards the end of last year—in a delegation headed by the current Acting Deputy President, Senator Ferguson—and get a very good look at parts of the Gallipoli battlefields. It is quite a large area, so we did not get to look at all of it, but we certainly looked around the Anzac section. There is no doubt that the roadworks make a significant and fairly noticeable cut into the slope of the hill.
I suppose the most important aspect from here on is to recognise that what has been done has been done. Also, I think that it should be said that some degree of roadworks was probably necessary for public safety, given the way the park operates at the moment. I think the big problems with what occurred were that the work was not done as sensitively as it could have been done—it was a bit crude—and also the refusal of the relevant ministers in the federal government to acknowledge that they were involved in it. So we had this continuing obfuscation and running out of the line: ‘Oh, well, it is all up to the Turks. We can’t do anything about it.’ Obviously, at the end of everything, it is up to Turkey what they do with their own land. But we as a nation, as a government, do have input into what happens there and the Turks, quite laudably, enable Australia to have input into what happens in that area.
Clearly, we were involved in requesting the roadworks and were aware they were going to happen. It was the refusal to acknowledge that, and the continual red herrings to distract attention from that, that I found most frustrating. I think the roadworks were less than ideal and the process was less than ideal. As Senator Forshaw just said, that is an opinion shared by others from the UK, who we could suggest have perhaps a bit more of an impartial view than any of us in this chamber.
The big issue is where we go from here with the whole Anzac Cove area and, indeed, the Gallipoli peninsula itself. That is something that I think more attention needs to be paid to, rather than having a continuing political controversy about the roadworks and doing a lot of finger pointing about that and ignoring the whole future of the Gallipoli peninsula and the Anzac Cove area. There are significant issues that really do need to be tackled. And there is work being done on those; I am not suggesting that there is not. But I think there needs to be more acknowledgement of and greater priority given to what needs to be done, greater recognition of some of the challenges that are coming and less sensitivity about the concerns that people rightly have about whether the area is being properly protected.
While it is not always acknowledged in Australia, it has to be emphasised that the Gallipoli peninsula is immensely significant to the Turkish people as well. It is not so much Anzac Cove; they are more interested in the top of the ridge line where all the Turks were, repelling the Australians, rather than where the Australians ran onto the beach and up the hills. Nonetheless, the whole area was the site of the slaughter of many Turks, over 100,000 from memory—enormous carnage. The site is also very significant in the development of what one might call the mystique surrounding the modern Turkish republic’s founder, Kemal Ataturk. So it is not as though Turkey does not care what happens there.
It has to be said that the battlefield in many ways has been significantly altered—it has been over 90 years now—and not just because of the passage of time. Sadly, that includes cemeteries, monuments and roads all across the battlefield. It is simply not realistic to suggest that the whole place can be kept in some sort of time capsule, the same as it was in 1915. The beach itself of Anzac Cove has changed dramatically. It is much shallower now than it was 90 years ago. A bit of erosion from the roadworks may have contributed to that, but it was certainly already the case anyway. So we have to acknowledge that and recognise that we cannot keep it in a time capsule.
Another aspect of this issue, a point that I like to emphasise whenever I get the opportunity, is the future management of the area. The numbers of visitors to the Gallipoli peninsula have skyrocketed in recent years. The high numbers of Australian visitors are well noted and there are growing numbers of Turks visiting. Those sorts of visitor numbers put enormous pressure on the site, particularly around Anzac Day, of course, when there are hordes of people all over the place for the dawn service and the like.
What I believe we need to look at is shifting it away from a place that people can drive all over, where buses drive in and out and all over the place, and moving towards setting up a visitors centre at the entrance to the park. Perhaps people could be ferried around on shuttle buses with commentary and interpreting services and those sorts of things. Some of these things have been suggested in the past and adopted up to a point, but for various reasons the infrastructure has not advanced as far as is desirable. I think that is where the effort needs to be from here.
I think it is important to recognise that our relationship with Turkey should be about a lot more than Gallipoli, but it does present a unique bonding opportunity for us and that very significant country. It is a good platform for Turkish attitudes towards Australians; we can start a little bit ahead of people from other nations because we already have that positive appreciation of Australia from many of the Turks. Turkey is going through a very important period, including its potential entry into the European Union, a goal in which I hope very much it succeeds. It has an absolutely critical geopolitical role in the region as the bridge between Asia and Europe. It has a very significant role as a heavily Islamic country but one that is a secular democracy. It certainly has difficulties and issues that it has to work through; it could probably do with being a little less sensitive to criticism as well—in fact, it definitely could.
But it is in our interests as a country to make use of the advantages we have in our relationship with Turkey. Whilst that relationship has to be about more than just Gallipoli, Gallipoli is always going to be a key part of it. We should make sure for the sake of our future relationship, as well as out of respect for the memory of the many Australians who died there and the role that Gallipoli has in our nation’s psyche and history, that we do more to protect the Gallipoli peninsula into the future—not just Anzac Cove but the whole area surrounding it. I think we should also make it more accessible and presentable, so people can be more aware of the story and the facts surrounding the events there. As an aside, I take the opportunity to recommend Les Carlyon’s book Gallipoli, a history of Gallipoli. It is very insightful. Getting the truth out about what happens in war is not always easy, but I think we need to do that as well—not just the legends and the myths but also some of the facts, because they are very useful for us to learn from.
So I hope that in amongst all the political finger-pointing around this issue, some of it justified, we do not lose sight of the main game, which is the future protection of the entire Gallipoli peninsula and the opportunity to present it positively to future generations of Australians and, indeed, to future generations of Turkish people.

"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,2006-03-02,"—I rise tonight to speak on this report.

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2006-03-02,"—I would like to continue my remarks on this report. I am very pleased that the ANAO has done this very important report. Leading by example and using purchasing policy is a very good way of not only setting an example about environmental practice but also practising what you preach. I am pleased that, as outlined in the report, ‘the Australian government has indicated that it aims to be at the forefront of environmental purchasing practice’, and the report goes on to list some measures.
I was grossly disappointed, when I read the audit report, to see that the government are actually not practising what their policy has in place. The report points out that Australian government agencies purchased goods and services to the value of $17 billion in 2003-04. That is a lot of money, and that is a lot of purchasing power that could be used to set a very good example by leading the way in environmental practices.
The report goes on to look at some of the key findings. It explains that chief executive instructions and internal policies, as you could imagine, are critical for ensuring that government officers practise environmental purchasing. Unfortunately, the report points out that half of the respondents indicated they did not have instructions or internal policies in relation to whole of life cycle costing. The report found:
In addition, less than half of respondents had references to minimising environmental impacts and compliance with government policies and targets.
That is absolutely shameful. Here we have a government that claims that it aims to be at the forefront of environmental purchasing practices, and half the respondents do not have any references in their policies to minimising environmental impacts or compliance. The report goes on to say:
… 25 per cent of respondents commented that green procurement policy was not sufficiently clear or precise in terms of what is required …
In other words, of those respondents that do have policies, 25 per cent of them are inadequate. That is extremely disappointing. When you go on through the report to look at environmental management systems—which are another key requirement for ensuring environmental purchasing and environmental practice—you see that only 45 per cent have an environmental management system in place. In other words, less than half have these practices in place.
If you look at some of the big areas that can deliver environmental outcomes—for example, motor vehicles—not only had government services not improved, they had got worse. Environmentally sensitive vehicles had decreased from 17.9 per cent to 12.5 per cent.
If you look at energy efficiency, another key area where we could practise what we preach, protect the environment and lead by example, only 21 per cent of office tenancies had energy efficient lighting installed. That is one of the simplest things to do. You just have to go down to the supermarket to buy energy efficient bulbs. Let us start there. Of course, you should have an energy audit done, but you can start the process just by going out and buying energy efficient bulbs. There are other things you can do to ensure an energy efficient office, but you could go down to the supermarket to start this process. With only 21 per cent having energy efficient lighting, it scares me to think what they do with their computer monitors, leaving things on standby—those basic things you can do to establish a green office.
This report is extremely disappointing in that it does not go any stretch of the way to ensuring that the Australian government is at the forefront in environmental purchasing practice. I am hoping that after the next audit the ANAO will have a much more positive report and that the government will have taken a much stronger, more proactive approach to ensure that, across portfolios, all agencies are striving to meet that aim and that they are truly putting in place a green office and green office procurement practices. I hope that each agency head will, as a requirement, meet green office procurement policies, have a demonstrable practice in place, and have targets that each of their agencies is required to meet. I think it is disgraceful that this report could be so bad when the government had 10 years to get this process right. It is disappointing that we could have such a negative outcome. I encourage the government to take a more proactive approach to green office procurement.

"Watson, Sen John",LP,2006-03-02,"—I wish to take this opportunity to acknowledge the outstanding contribution of Senator Hill and to add my sincere personal best wishes to Robert on his departure from this place today after what can be described as nothing less than a quite remarkable parliamentary career. Few people leave this place having occupied as high an office for as long as Robert did not scarred by political misadventure or involvement in covert political acts.
Robert and I have known each other, and shared challenges and successes as colleagues, for many, many years. Robert has a very lively, intelligent mind and a great sense of humour. But as you probably know personally, Mr Acting Deputy President Ferguson, he always sought to be in control of all situations through thorough preparation. In this parliament it is not easy to develop close friendships but I can genuinely say that Robert and I were close friends. I value this fact and will continue to do so after he leaves parliament to pursue the next phase of his life. Because of this, I am saddened to see him leave, as I believe he has been one of the most valuable and constructive contributors to the operation of the Liberal Party and this parliament for so many years.
Robert has occupied one of the most challenging roles in this parliament, that of Senate leader of the coalition, both in opposition and, then, for a decade, in government. For most of that decade, he has had the job of facilitating the smooth operation of a coalition government which did not always have a controlling majority in the Senate. I believe it is a compliment to his skills as a negotiator and diplomat that he was able to carry out this role so successfully. He will take these valuable skills to his next role and will hopefully find them to be of equal use in New York, although in a very different environment.
Senator Hill first arrived in Canberra with a level of enthusiasm and reforming zeal seldom seen in new senators. He had an enlightening, lively and questioning approach to many of the tasks he confronted. It is most satisfying to be able to acknowledge that he maintained this refreshing approach throughout his time here. It is not surprising he was so popular. Robert and his wife, Diana, honoured me with their presence at a dinner to note my own 25 years in the Senate, an occasion facilitated and hosted by the President of the Senate, the Hon. Paul Calvert. It was an occasion at which I was able to personally express my appreciation for his personal and professional friendship and the meaningful relationship we had developed sharing long-term roles as senators in this place and, earlier, at Old Parliament House.
I said it was sad to see Robert depart from the Senate because I know that he has always been a positive and active contributor to so many areas of debate and, more importantly, to the development of policy issues. He has always had a particular expertise and interest in foreign affairs, and he has put this interest to good in many of the roles that he has been given in parliament. He has occupied an extraordinary number of offices in this place. I believe that he will also put his interests and skills to good use in his new role, hopefully reforming and rejuvenating the United Nations. That will certainly be a great challenge. I am sure that the outcome will be just as positive as his achievements in this place.
Robert, in your absence, I wish you every success in your new role and in your life after politics. I know that you will continue to serve the Australian nation and people with verve, dignity and honour. Thank you for your friendship, your immense contribution to the work of this Senate and your uniquely refreshing positive outlook on life. I wish you all the very best.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Senator Robert Hill</title>,Adjournment,33,1
