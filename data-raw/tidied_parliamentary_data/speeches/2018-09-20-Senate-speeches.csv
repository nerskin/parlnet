 (Victoria) (09:31):  by leave—I move:


That—


That the Senate— 


(a) notes the claim of public interest immunity in response to the order for the production of documents relating to the Religious Freedom Review Expert Panel; 


(b) cites the Senate's Grounds for public interest immunity claims, which states that: 'It is accepted that deliberations of the Executive Council and of the cabinet should be able to be conducted in secrecy so as to preserve the freedom of deliberation of those bodies. This ground, however, relates only to disclosure of deliberations. There has been a tendency for governments to claim that anything with a connection to cabinet is confidential'; 


(c) acknowledges that the report does not relate to the deliberations of cabinet; and therefore 


(d) insists that the order for the production of documents be complied with by 3 pm 20 September 2018.



The PRESIDENT:  Senator Rice, is that the actual motion?




Senator RICE:
  That's the motion.



The PRESIDENT:  Could you please get us a copy so that the motion may be circulated?




Senator RICE:
  I think the motion is being circulated.



An honourable senator:  We haven't got it yet.



The PRESIDENT:  It hasn't come around yet. We'll follow it up. Continue, Senator Rice.




Senator RICE:
  The Senate yesterday passed an order for production of documents, for the final report of the Religious Freedom Review Expert Panel. This was rejected by the government late last night, on the grounds that the report informed and was the subject of cabinet deliberation, and therefore the public interest immunity claim was made. The reason for moving this motion today is that we reject that, for the reasons that I just outlined in the motion. The community needs to see this report. In fact, it is in the public interest for this report to be tabled. It is not in the public interest for this report to continue to be hidden. The government, by hiding this report, is putting people's lives—particularly the lives of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex people—on hold. 


The government has had the final report of the Religious Freedom Review Expert Panel for four months now. We all know the circumstances in which the Ruddock review, the expert panel, was set up. It was as a consequence of the successful passing of the marriage equality legislation. The marriage equality legislation, as we know, removed the largest state-sanctioned discrimination against LGBTIQ people, in allowing us to get married. In response to that, there was some unhappiness on the government benches, particularly among those in the right wing on the government benches. There was a bit of a sense that we need to work out the whole issue of balancing the issue of religious freedom and religious discrimination. That's why the Ruddock review was set up. It is extremely important for LGBTIQ people, in particular, to know what that review has found, to know what Mr Ruddock is recommending to government and then to see what the government's response is, because this review and the government's response to it have potentially huge impacts on the lives of LGBTIQ people. At the moment, they are being kept in the dark. They are being left in the lurch. We do not know whether the Ruddock review is recommending further discrimination against LGBTIQ people, further discrimination that would allow schools, hospitals, aged-care centres, florists and bakers to further discriminate against LGBTIQ people.


The reason why it is now so important that the Australian people know this is the comments of Prime Minister Morrison in recent weeks, where he has indicated that he, in fact, wants to further discriminate against LGBTIQ people. He wants to wind back some of our antidiscrimination laws which protect LGBTIQ people from discrimination. It is extremely important that lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex people know the extent of the recommendations from Philip Ruddock and to what extent the Prime Minister is planning to further discriminate against them. We know that this debate, about how religious freedom and religious discrimination weigh up against each other, is something that is of critical importance in our antidiscrimination laws going forward. In the Senate inquiry into marriage equality last year there was universal recognition that we need to protect religion as a protected attribute. Of course everybody should have the right to hold a religion and express their religion, but there is a great deal of debate about how the impacts of the manifestation of their religion upon other people should be managed.


The Greens position is that we need to have a charter of rights, so that we can balance people's right to have a religion versus people's right to not be discriminated against. That's the direction we need to be heading in. They're the discussions that the community needs to be having. If we had that charter of rights discussion we could be moving forward. We were hopeful that the Ruddock review might provide some information that would work out where the community debate should go, but in order to provide that information we need to see the report. We do not need to be kept in the dark. We need to let that report see the light of day. It is four months now that the government has had that report. Why isn't it releasing it now? We have been told for a number of months to expect it quite soon, but one has to ask: what is the government hiding?


There are questions around the fact that we have a by-election in Wentworth coming up in a month's time. The debate has been that the government's not going to release the Ruddock review before the Wentworth by-election. We know that the people of Wentworth are very strong supporters of LGBTIQ rights, so one could surmise that maybe the government are keeping this report in secret because they actually don't want the people of Wentworth to realise what their true agenda is. The true agenda is further discrimination against LGBTIQ people in the name of religious freedom. That's what you could actually surmise. That's the ulterior motive of keeping this report hidden. If they weren't planning on doing this then why not release the report? Why not release it so we can see what Mr Ruddock has recommended. And why not then respond to it and lay to rest all these people's concerns and fears?


I really want to go to the point of the importance of seeing the report of the Ruddock review, because there is a lot of fear in the community. LGBTIQ people across the community are worried. They are concerned. They know that achieving marriage equality was a big step forward, but they are very fearful that their rights are going to be wound back. It's not just a theoretical thing that they are worried about; it's people's actual lives—people employed as teachers in faith based schools, who are fearful of no longer having jobs; people employed in aged-care centres or hospitals, who are fearful of not even getting jobs because of their sexuality or gender identity or fearful that they will lose their jobs because of those things. Again, the Greens would like to see our laws strengthened so that people are better protected from discrimination, but we are worried, and the community is worried, that there are going to be further grounds to discriminate against people because of their sexuality or gender identity. You only have to look at the interventions of our Prime Minister over the last month to see that their fears seem to be very well grounded. When the Prime Minister sees fit to retweet an appallingly homophobic and transphobic article in The Daily Telegraph, saying that we don't need gender whisperers in our schools, one can see the sort of intolerance the government seems to be heading to. That's what people are fearful about. They are thinking: if a Prime Minister sees fit to retweet something like that, what has he got in mind? What is he planning to do? What legislation is this government planning to put up to further vilify and discriminate against people just on the basis of their sexuality and their gender identity?


The issue of protecting people's rights is of fundamental importance. All people, regardless of their gender identity, regardless of their sexuality, need to be treated as equals. They need to have all the opportunities other people in our society have. It's clearly going to be an ongoing debate in our community, but it needs to be a debate informed by evidence, rather than an emotive discussion based on prejudice. We need to have the basic information. The government, in initiating and setting up the review into religious freedom in the first place, had the opportunity, through doing the consultation the review has done, to put on the table a body of evidence with which we can move forward. That's the evidence we need to have. In particular, it's evidence that is needed before the people of Wentworth go to the polls in a month's time. They need to know what the Ruddock review recommended and what the government's plans are. So the motion I am moving today says: can we please move this forward? It asks all of our senators here to make sure the information is available so that we know where the power lies; so that we know what the government has planned; so that we know whether it's the fair treatment of LGBTIQ people that's on the government's agenda or whether the government's response to the question of religious freedom is one where the far right of the party have won the day and the government is planning further discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex and queer Australians.

"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2018-09-20,"



Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance and the Public Service, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (09:43):  The government will oppose this motion. That is because, as has long been recognised by the Senate and as has been practised by governments of both political persuasions, we believe that the principle of cabinet confidentiality, the confidentiality of cabinet deliberations, is a very important and long-established principle under the Westminster system. It is designed to ensure that cabinet ministers can debate policies and proposals freely so that the ultimate decision that is made is the best possible decision. I hasten to add here, in relation to the report of the Religious Freedom Review Expert Panel, which has been received by the cabinet, that the government has not as yet made any decisions on the way forward. The cabinet continues with its deliberations. This is obviously a matter which is highly sensitive. It's very important for the government, in its response, to get the balance right, to get its decisions right. I think it would make it inappropriately more difficult for the government to get the balance right and to make the best possible decision in relation to this issue if the longstanding principle of cabinet confidentiality was breached in the way as is suggested in this motion. That is why I call on the Senate—and I certainly would call most respectfully on the opposition, which has acted in consistency with the principles of cabinet confidentiality under the Westminster system during its periods in government, and is likely to do so in the future—to join with the government in preserving, whether on this topic or any other topic, a very important principle: to ensure that cabinet ministers, as they deal with often very complex, sensitive and difficult issues, are in the right position to debate policy proposals and other proposals freely and, indeed, in confidence, without essentially the additional difficulty in reaching the best possible decision that would come with a premature debate in the context of no decision yet having been made. Once the government has made a decision, all of the information, quite rightly, ought to be in the public domain, but this is not yet the time, given that the cabinet has not yet made a final decision and the deliberations are ongoing.

"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2018-09-20,"



Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria—Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate) (09:46):  Labor, too, has concerns with the government's claim of public interest immunity on this occasion. As the minister has outlined, Labor as a party of government does regard seriously issues around cabinet confidentiality and cabinet deliberations. But there are a few issues on this occasion that I think I should highlight as to why our concerns remain on this particular matter. Firstly, in claiming public interest immunity, in response to the Senate's call of yesterday, the government hasn't outlined what harm it suggests may occur. That's a critical element of any claim of public interest immunity—to outline what harm is envisaged by this report being released. I would highlight to Minister Cormann that there are many occasions on which a government releases a report of a review before it concludes its response to that review. So we have yet to hear why, on this occasion, in relation to this review, the release of the review itself, as opposed to the cabinet's deliberation of the review, cannot be made available.


I would like to remind the Senate that there's some history to this matter. Some senators may recall that, in addressing the legislation around same-sex marriage and amendments that were put before the Senate by some senators on that occasion, I made the point that it would have been helpful to have been able to give more serious consideration to these religious freedom matters, but that the Prime Minister at the time, Prime Minister Turnbull, had, in a sense, kicked these matters down the road by establishing the Ruddock review. When that review was established, a number of senators who might've been inclined to support further work to occur in relation to introducing protections around religious freedom essentially folded into supporting the Ruddock review process as the appropriate forum under which these matters should be addressed. Remember, though, this is quite some time. The Greens have highlighted some of the concerns in relation to how we, as a nation, might proceed in the future to protect religious freedom, but there are, of course, a myriad of other concerns that the Ruddock review has considered.


Let me highlight for the Senate, for instance, that, at the commencement of the Ruddock review process, there were concerns from a number of parties that submissions were not being made public, that people weren't able to follow the proceedings, that some of the proceedings were unnecessarily secret and that the process itself had been somewhat clouded. I join with those who hold the view that the findings of that review have remained closed for too long now.


You might have some sympathy for concerns that say, 'Well, we've got a new Prime Minister and a new cabinet, and it needs to consider these things,' but it has been some time. I don't think this issue should be beholden to the uncertainties within the Liberal coalition government and its changes of leadership. I think these issues are more important than that, and we should have a broader, measured consideration of what was considered within the Ruddock review.


Unfortunately, I need to reflect on issues that have been raised in a sense anecdotally around the review, because we still can't see it. One element of those reflections has been that Mr Ruddock went into that review process with an approach that was essentially: 'Where's the nuisance? I don't see the nuisance here. So, not being able to see the nuisance, I don't really see that we need to do much more than the status quo.' I was subsequently told, 'Well, no, actually the review board did identify that there was some level of nuisance, not only the issues that have been highlighted by the Greens but also issues highlighted by members of various religious communities.'


On that note, I would like to say that I'm disappointed that this process appears to be becoming politicised. Prime Minister Morrison said he wasn't going to become the Christian warrior, but, by taking as long as he has and by shrouding this review still in secrecy, these issues are now becoming politicised in a quite unnecessary way. I would like to see an opportunity for all of those who have a multitude of different views to air those views, and the best way to do that is for the review report to now be made public so we can have what I would hope would be an open, measured discussion around what those recommendations are. For that reason, Labor will be supporting the motion.

"Patrick, Sen Rex",CA,2018-09-20,"



Senator PATRICK
 (South Australia) (09:52):  Orders for the production of documents are a key oversight tool for this Senate. We've seen a number of OPDs refused by this government on very dubious grounds. I accept the principles laid out by Senator Cormann that cabinet in confidence is a well-respected doctrine in the Westminster system of government. I don't challenge him on that.


However, let me just go to the claim that has been made by the government in this instance. They've made the claim that they can't provide the documents, on the grounds that these documents informed and are the subject of cabinet deliberations. Of course, cabinet deliberations are protected, but not necessarily things that are subject to deliberations—only the deliberations themselves. If this has not been through cabinet, it can't be a deliberation of cabinet, and it cannot attract that claim.


I will make another point, a very important point: we are a house that complies with the laws of this land. The laws of this land say that, in order for a document to be considered cabinet in confidence, it must have at birth a dominant purpose for submission to cabinet. I would like the government to come back to this chamber with some evidence that shows that, when they commissioned this report, it was intended exclusively for cabinet.


You would also note that, in accordance with the Cabinet Handbook, cabinet submissions take a particular form, and typically cabinet submissions are limited to 50 pages. I would like to get an answer from the government in respect of this: how many pages are in this particular report? You cannot simply pass a document through the cabinet room in order to obtain a protection of cabinet in confidence. That's inappropriate.


The other point I would make is that there are very strict handling requirements for documents that are cabinet in confidence. There are very strict tracking requirements for documents that are cabinet in confidence. I would like the government to bring to this chamber evidence that this document has been held confidential and has been tracked in accordance with the Cabinet Handbookso that we can be satisfied that the claim that is being made by the government is bona fide. We cannot simply have an aroma-of-cabinet defence fettering the Senate in its legitimate oversight role.


I note that this government has consistently made claims of public interest immunity in this chamber. It should be of great concern to every member of this Senate, because when there's a change of government the people sitting on the government side will end up on the opposition side of the chamber and will want to do their job properly, informed by the documents that are paid for by the taxpayer and are commissioned for public purpose. I respect what Senator Cormann has said. I respect the claim that is made, but it must be a proper claim. I suspect in this instance that it is not. 


We have a situation at the moment where the government is in the ACT Magistrates Court claiming that the matters before that court are secret. We've had a number of instances in this chamber where the government have done the same thing, only to have their rulings overturned by people such as the Information Commissioner and the AAT. By making these false claims you undermine proper process—the very process Senator Cormann relies on not to bring these documents to the chamber. I ask for more information to be provided to the chamber. I'm inclined to support the Greens' motion.



The PRESIDENT:  The question is that the motion moved by Senator Rice be agreed to.

I was subsequently told, 'Well, no, actually the review board did identify that there was some level of nuisance, not only the issues that have been highlighted by the Greens but also issues highlighted by members of various religious communities.'


On that note, I would like to say that I'm disappointed that this process appears to be becoming politicised. Prime Minister Morrison said he wasn't going to become the Christian warrior, but, by taking as long as he has and by shrouding this review still in secrecy, these issues are now becoming politicised in a quite unnecessary way. I would like to see an opportunity for all of those who have a multitude of different views to air those views, and the best way to do that is for the review report to now be made public so we can have what I would hope would be an open, measured discussion around what those recommendations are. For that reason, Labor will be supporting the motion.

"Patrick, Sen Rex",CA,2018-09-20,"



Senator PATRICK
 (South Australia) (09:52):  Orders for the production of documents are a key oversight tool for this Senate. We've seen a number of OPDs refused by this government on very dubious grounds. I accept the principles laid out by Senator Cormann that cabinet in confidence is a well-respected doctrine in the Westminster system of government. I don't challenge him on that.


However, let me just go to the claim that has been made by the government in this instance. They've made the claim that they can't provide the documents, on the grounds that these documents informed and are the subject of cabinet deliberations. Of course, cabinet deliberations are protected, but not necessarily things that are subject to deliberations—only the deliberations themselves. If this has not been through cabinet, it can't be a deliberation of cabinet, and it cannot attract that claim.


I will make another point, a very important point: we are a house that complies with the laws of this land. The laws of this land say that, in order for a document to be considered cabinet in confidence, it must have at birth a dominant purpose for submission to cabinet. I would like the government to come back to this chamber with some evidence that shows that, when they commissioned this report, it was intended exclusively for cabinet.


You would also note that, in accordance with the Cabinet Handbook, cabinet submissions take a particular form, and typically cabinet submissions are limited to 50 pages. I would like to get an answer from the government in respect of this: how many pages are in this particular report? You cannot simply pass a document through the cabinet room in order to obtain a protection of cabinet in confidence. That's inappropriate.


The other point I would make is that there are very strict handling requirements for documents that are cabinet in confidence. There are very strict tracking requirements for documents that are cabinet in confidence. I would like the government to bring to this chamber evidence that this document has been held confidential and has been tracked in accordance with the Cabinet Handbookso that we can be satisfied that the claim that is being made by the government is bona fide. We cannot simply have an aroma-of-cabinet defence fettering the Senate in its legitimate oversight role.


I note that this government has consistently made claims of public interest immunity in this chamber. It should be of great concern to every member of this Senate, because when there's a change of government the people sitting on the government side will end up on the opposition side of the chamber and will want to do their job properly, informed by the documents that are paid for by the taxpayer and are commissioned for public purpose. I respect what Senator Cormann has said. I respect the claim that is made, but it must be a proper claim. I suspect in this instance that it is not. 


We have a situation at the moment where the government is in the ACT Magistrates Court claiming that the matters before that court are secret. We've had a number of instances in this chamber where the government have done the same thing, only to have their rulings overturned by people such as the Information Commissioner and the AAT. By making these false claims you undermine proper process—the very process Senator Cormann relies on not to bring these documents to the chamber. I ask for more information to be provided to the chamber. I'm inclined to support the Greens' motion.



The PRESIDENT:  The question is that the motion moved by Senator Rice be agreed to.

"Cameron, Sen Doug",ALP,2018-09-20,"



Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (10:04):     Labor supports the measures in the Treasury Laws Amendment (Tax Integrity and Other Measures) Bill 2018, although we will move two small but important amendments.    The bill contains four tax measures.    Schedule 1 to this bill amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 to ensure that the Multinational Anti-Avoidance Law applies appropriately to artificial or contrived arrangements involving trusts and partnerships entered into by multinational entities to avoid the taxation of business profits in Australia.


This measure applies on or after 1 January 2016 in connection with a scheme, whether or not the scheme was entered into, or was commenced to be carried out, before that day. However, the measure does not apply in relation to tax benefits that a taxpayer derives before 1 January 2016. This is consistent with the date from which the Multinational Anti-Avoidance Law applied, and the purpose of the law.


In order for this extension to apply, the trust or partnership must have: a relationship with a foreign entity that means they are not independent of that entity at the time they make the relevant supply or supplies to their Australian customer; and a foreign entity participant at any time in an income year in which income is derived from the supply.


As noted in the explanatory memorandum, the schedule implements a technical integrity measure underpinning the Multinational Anti-Avoidance Law.    At this point, I just want to remind the Senate that the government regularly makes misleading statements that Labor voted against the Multinational Anti-Avoidance Law. This is untrue. In the House, Labor voted against government-Greens political party amendments that watered down tax transparency reporting requirements for large private companies. Labor, throughout debate, supported the MAAL.


I should also note that the Senate has now passed Labor's private senator's bill regarding tax transparency. This will allow proper scrutiny and help restore the trust in the integrity of the tax system that was brought about when the Gillard government passed tax transparency reforms in June 2013. The Senate has voted to lower the tax transparency threshold to $50 million for all firms—public and private.


The bill also removes a grandfathering exemption for certain financial reports for approximately 1500 large companies. Labor supported this when former Senator Ricky Muir moved it during the Multinational Anti-Avoidance Law debate in 2015, where it was opposed by the Liberals and the Greens. That private senator's bill stands alongside other Labor transparency measures, including disclosure of tax haven activity in government tenders, public reporting of country-by-country reports and protection for whistleblowers who uncover tax dodging by multinationals.


Schedule 2 to the bill amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to include additional conditions that must be satisfied to apply the small business CGT concessions to capital gains. The new conditions ensure that the small business CGT concessions in division 152 are only available for capital gains tax assets that are either used or held ready for use in the course of a small business or are an interest in a small business. These amendments implement the measure announced in the 2017-18 budget as 'Tax integrity package—improving the small business capital gains tax concessions' and apply to capital gains tax events that occur on or after 1 July 2017. That announcement followed issues raised with Treasury by the Australia Taxation Office that legislative loopholes were being exploited. The budget proposal was vague in its details. Numerous tax professionals and stakeholders have said it was not until the release of the exposure draft legislation that those affected would become aware of how they were affected. Stakeholders make the reasonable claim that, due to a lack of detail, taxpayers have conducted their tax affairs in good faith and will be caught by changes that go beyond what was flagged in the budget. In light of the stakeholder concerns, Labor is moving a detailed amendment to make the start date 8 February 2018, the date on which the exposure draft legislation was released, as proposed by the tax professional community. I will detail our amendment later in my remarks.


Schedule 3 of the bill amends the income tax law and the Venture Capital Act 2002 to ensure that the venture capital tax concessions are available for investments in fin-tech businesses. These amendments apply in relation to investments made on or after 1 July 2018. This schedule partially implements the National Innovation and Science Agenda measure, expanding the new arrangements for venture capital limited partnerships from the 2016-17 budget. In the light of feedback received in the course of our consultations, Labor will be moving an amendment to this schedule of the bill. This amendment will require the minister to instigate an impact assessment of the venture capital tax concession provisions overhaul, and include the measures in schedule 3 to this bill to ensure that they are operating as intended.


Schedule 4 to this bill amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to exempt from income tax the payments received from the Commonwealth as reparation for abuse by Australian Defence Force personnel. This measure applies to the 2017-18 income year and later income years, and implements the tax consequences from the 2017-18 budget of the Defence Force Ombudsman continuation and expansion measure. The Defence Abuse Response Taskforce was established on 10 April 2011 to assess and respond to individual cases of sexual and other abuse in the Australian Defence Force. The Defence Abuse Response Taskforce administered reparation payments through the Defence Reparation Scheme of up to $50,000 to complainants who likely suffered abuse in the Australian Defence Force. Reparation payments were not paid as compensation for loss or damage for any asserted, perceived or possible legal liability on behalf of the Commonwealth or for any injury, disease or impairment. The payments did not affect complainants' statutory common law or other legal rights. This measure amends the tax law to exempt from income tax the payments made in accordance with a recommendation of the Defence Force Ombudsman in relation to abuse by Australian Defence Force personnel. Labor supports this measure in schedule 4.


I now turn to the two amendments that Labor will move to this bill in relation to schedule 2 and schedule 3. Labor will move an amendment relating to the small-business capital gains tax concession measures in schedule 2. Stakeholders have informed Labor that the additional conditions for eligibility for the capital gains tax concessions are detailed in a way that make the changes more akin to a policy change rather than an integrity change, and, as such, capture taxpayers who engaged in good faith according to the intent of the concessions. Further, the active asset tests for eligibility interact with a longer run issue of tax office interpretation and application of the active test. This issue flared up when the ATO appeared to change its interpretation of 'act of business/asset' in a footnote to the draft taxation ruling TR2017/D2—a matter that has not been resolved. Chartered Accountants of Australia and New Zealand noted in language comparable to other stakeholders:


The proposed measure would deny ""access to the concessions for assets which are unrelated to [a taxpayer's] small business, for instance through arranging their affairs so that their ownership interests in larger businesses do not count towards the tests for determining eligibility for the concessions"". No further information was released until the publication of this exposure draft.


The measures contained in the exposure draft are extraordinarily complex. More importantly, in our view they go beyond what taxpayers could reasonably have expected from the Budget announcement designed to address ""integrity"" concerns. They reduce what many stakeholders would regard as the intended scope of the concessions.


… … …


… taxpayers have in good faith sold, or entered into agreements to sell, interests in entities on the basis that they qualified for the concessions but will not now do so.


The Tax Institute, Chartered Accountants of Australia and New Zealand, partners at large accounting firms and small businesses have all argued that, to prevent adverse consequences for taxpayers who have acted in good faith but could not reasonably have been expected to foresee the detailed amendments that were finally unveiled in the exposure draft, the implementation date should be changed from 1 July 2017, as per the budget announcement, to 8 February 2018, the date of the exposure draft release.


In light of the stakeholders' concerns, Labor is moving a detailed amendment to make the start date 8 February 2018. We flagged the need for this change when the bill was debated in the House. Labor will also move an amendment in relation to schedule 3. This amendment requires the minister to instigate an impact assessment of the venture capital tax concession provisions overall and to include the measures in this bill to ensure they are operating as intended. This impact assessment would be conducted by Treasury and Innovation and Science Australia.


For the benefit of the Senate, I want to note some comments by the member for Chifley in the other place when debate was underway on this bill. The member for Chifley said:


The sector and people in the sector have raised with me that they're not entirely happy with what's been put forward in this bill. Again, it's a straightforward measure, but they still don't think that it's picked up their concerns. For example—and I had highlighted to me—in 3.26 of the explanatory memorandum it states that a fin-tech may be eligible for the tax concession when developing its technology. However—and this is what has been raised with me—it then goes on to say that when a business is commercialising the technology it would no longer be eligible. As has been raised with me: 'This hardly seems like a certain, longer term platform for a venture capital firm to make an investment in a fin-tech, given that the VC is only making the investment because it's hoping the fin-tech will be able to commercialise and profit from the technology.' This is what they're raising with me, and I'm sure they have raised it with Treasury.


The member for Chifley raised important concerns about the government's processes. This reflects why we believe it is important to have a review. We also note concerns about the government's process. The member for Chifley noted in the other place:


… what I have been finding out when talking with stakeholders about this is how long it took to get to this point—how long it took for this straightforward move to happen.


I note that FinTech Australia put out a policy paper on this issue on in February 2016. The government announced this in their 2016-17 budget, but it was not until October 2017 that the government started to consult on amendments. It is concerning that this whole process has taken so long.


Labor's position strikes the right balance: we support this particular measure, but we will also be moving an amendment requiring the government to have a comprehensive and transparent review of the venture capital tax concession framework. In conclusion, Labor supports the measures in the Treasury Laws Amendment (Tax Integrity and Other Measures) Bill 2018. However, we will be moving sensible amendments to the bill, which we commend to the Senate.

"Brockman, Sen Slade",LP,2018-09-20,"



Senator BROCKMAN
 (Western Australia) (10:20):  I rise to speak on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Tax Integrity and Other Measures) Bill 2018. I thank Senator Cameron for his contribution and the fact that those opposite will be supporting this bill, albeit they will be moving some amendments to it.


Why is tax integrity important? Tax integrity is vital because it gives people confidence in our economic system and it means that taxes can be maintained at as low a level as possible. If everyone is paying the amount of tax they are required to pay then taxpayers are not burdened. Those who do pay their tax, who follow the rules, are not burdened with unduly high taxes. So tax integrity is an essential measure of fairness in a modern economy.


This government has a strong track record of defending the integrity of the tax system, to make sure it collects the tax that is required to be paid—and no more than that—so that no-one in society is burdened with an unfair level of taxation because others are breaking the rules. The government has a strong track record of defending the integrity of the tax system not just in this bill but previously, and before I go into this bill in detail I'll just run through some of the things that this government has done.


Legislation passed includes such things as the Banking Executive Accountability Regime, the BEAR, ensuring that senior executives are accountable for the decisions they make. That was a very significant reform in Australia's financial services history. It imposed a higher standard of behaviour on banks and their senior executives and directors. It strengthened the leadership of financial system regulators through enabling ASIC and APRA each to have a second deputy chair position. That is the case at APRA, where John Lonsdale, a 30-year Treasury veteran, has been appointed. And Daniel Crennan QC has already started in his role at ASIC as a special prosecutor focusing on enforcement.


We have created a one-stop shop for dispute resolution with the establishment of the Australian Financial Complaints Authority, enabling more consumers to access fast and free dispute resolution. We have increased the powers of APRA in relation to crisis management and non-bank lenders to ensure the resilience and ongoing stability of the Australian financial system. We have capped commissions paid on life insurance products to prevent unnecessary churn. We have raised the professional education and ethical standards of financial advisers. We have put a ban on excessive credit card surcharges, to protect consumers from being granted excessive credit limits and building unsustainable debt across credit cards, and simplified how interest is calculated. We have implemented funds for Australian regional transport. We have moved to establish a crowdsourced equity funding regime to allow new businesses to get access to funding in new and innovative ways. We have introduced industry funding for ASIC through levies and fees for regulatory activities. We are also looking to strengthen protection for whistleblowers who expose corporate and tax misconduct. We have enhanced ASIC's ability to attract and retain the best staff by removing ASIC employees from the Public Service Act.


There is also the relaxation of the legislative 15 per cent ownership cap as well as establishing a streamlined approval path for recent entrants so as to reduce barriers to innovative new fin-techs in the banking sector. There is extending the crowdsourced equity funding regime to propriety companies to help smaller financial institutions to grow and become more significant players in the banking sector. We're improving superannuation accountability and member outcomes, including strengthening regulator powers, improving disclosure, removing restrictions on choice of funds and lifting governance standards.


We're also moving to protect individual superannuation savings from disproportionately high fees and insurance premiums and empowering the ATO to reunite people with their lost and inactive super. This is a strong track record of delivering positive outcomes in the financial services space particularly and, obviously, in tax integrity. Making sure that all parts of the economy pay the correct amount of tax through tax integrity measures is vitally important. We've already taken significant action on this, particularly as regards multinationals, and that is, in part, what the bill in front of us goes to.


Schedule 1 of this bill toughens the multinational anti-avoidance law—the MAAL law. This schedule makes technical amendments to ensure that the multinational anti-avoidance law operates as it was intended to. As a result of this amendment, multinationals will no longer be able to use corporate structures with foreign trusts and partnerships to avoid the application of the multinational anti-avoidance law. These changes were announced in last year's budget. The government is committed to ensuring that multinational entities pay their fair share of tax. The OECD estimated that, globally, between $100 billion and $240 billion of corporate tax revenues is lost annually due to base erosion and profit-shifting strategies used by multinationals. As part of the global effort to combat multinational tax avoidance, the OECD/G20 Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Project has delivered a number of recommendations to strengthen tax integrity rules and ensure that the international tax system works as intended.


Since 2015, Australia has implemented a range of such actions. The government has also taken action on multinational tax avoidance beyond the OECD recommendations, including implementing the multinational anti-avoidance law and the diverted profits tax, both of which discourage large multinationals from artificially diverting profits offshore. The multinational anti-avoidance law took effect from 1 January 2016 and prevents multinationals from escaping Australian tax by using artificial or contrived arrangements to avoid having a taxable presence in Australia. The ATO has observed a significant change in how multinational companies are approaching their Australian tax obligations as a result of the tough new anti-avoidance laws put in place by this government. The ATO estimates more than $7 billion in sales revenue annually is already being added to the Australian tax base as a result of these changes. Thirty-eight multinational entities have changed, or are in the process of changing, their tax affairs to bring their Australian source sales back onshore in compliance with the multinational anti-avoidance law, including Google and Facebook. Obviously, taxing these large multinationals with innovative models of doing business—the way they're structured and the way their businesses operate—is different to what the tax system was used to dealing with. So it's important that, as the business environment changes, governments are responsive enough to change the tax environment with it to ensure that everyone does pay their fair share of tax.


Schedule 2 improves the integrity of the small-business capital gains tax concessions. In the 2017-18 budget the government announced that it would improve integrity and ensure that the small-business capital gains tax concessions are appropriately targeted. The goal was to ensure that the concessions continue to benefit those who need them most—hardworking small businesses. The proposed amendments will mean the small-business capital gains tax concessions can only be accessed in relation to assets used in a small business or ownership interests in a small business.


The government is committed to supporting small businesses through tax cuts and initiatives such as the $20,000 instant asset write-off, which was extended in last year's budget for a further 12 months to 30 June 2018. The small-business capital gains tax concessions assist owners of small businesses by providing relief from capital gains tax on the disposal of assets related to their business. This helps them to reinvest and grow as well as to contribute to their retirement savings through the sale of the business. The concessions themselves are not changing and will be available to genuine small-business taxpayers with an aggregated turnover of less than $2 million or business assets less than $6 million.


Key features of the new law include: a limitation on the size of the company or trust being disposed of, to ensure that it is a genuine small business; clarifying that a taxpayer is required to be a small business entity at the time they dispose of their interests in the company or trust, to ensure that taxpayers do not benefit from the concession where the relevant business activities are too remote; and modifying the active asset test so that it looks through shares to companies or interests in trusts to the activities and assets of the underlying entities. That prevents the concessions from being available when most of the value of the company or trust is unrelated to small-business activity. Additional integrity rules also apply to ensure that the new tests cannot be manipulated or avoided.


Schedule 3 of the bill covers amendments to the fin-tech and venture capital arrangements. This delivers on a key commitment in the government's fin-tech statement, removing ambiguity from the tax law and clarifying that early stage venture capital limited partnerships can invest in Australian fin-tech businesses. This bill builds on the government's $1.1 billion National Innovation and Science Agenda and highlights our commitment to support innovative businesses in Australia and build a culture of entrepreneurship and risk-taking. It will improve access to venture capital for fin-tech start-ups and assist these businesses to grow and succeed. I certainly know that in my home state of WA we are seeing a lot of very exciting developments in these kinds of spaces where venture capital and financial tech firms are seeking to access and innovate based on new technologies—things like blockchain, which many of us have heard about and probably not very many of us understand. Giving these businesses the opportunity to invest, take a risk and build a business that hasn't existed in the past are things this government very much supports.


Schedule 4 covers the tax exemption for payments under the Defence Force Ombudsman scheme. This commends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to continue to exempt from income tax payments made as reparations to victims of abuse in the Australian Defence Force. Unlike compensation, a reparation payment represents an acknowledgement by Defence that the abuse suffered by the complainants was wrong, that it can have a lasting a serious impact and that, in the past, Defence was not positioned appropriately to respond to that abuse in many cases. The recipient of a reparation payment should receive the full benefit of that payment and, as such, the payment should be exempt from income tax. Previous reparations made under the former Defence Abuse Response Taskforce were tax exempt. The task force concluded on 31 August 2016 and, in the 2017-18 budget, the government announced it was expanding the Defence Force Ombudsman role to make recommendations on reparation payments in relation to complaints of abuse in Defence. The Defence Force Ombudsman may make recommendations on historical cases of abuse occurring on or before 30 June 2014.


Obviously, just as we want those who should pay their correct amount of tax to do so, we don't want people who are receiving a payment from the government to have to pay tax where it is inappropriate for tax to be paid. A reparation payment of this sort to victims of abuse in the Australian Defence Force falls into that category. We want to collect tax from those who should pay it and we don't want to be taxing those who shouldn't. In that way, we'll be able to keep our tax system as fair as we can and only claim the minimal amount of tax we need to deliver those essential services that Australians want and need and not a penny more.


The government has also announced a number of other significant reforms in this area. Again, we see that this is a government getting on with the job of delivering for all Australians. It announced reforms including increasing the civil and criminal penalties for financial misconduct—the most significant increases for the maximum civil penalties in many cases in more than 20 years. These include criminal penalties for individuals of up to 10 years imprisonment and, for corporations, criminal penalties the larger of $9.45 million, three times the benefit or 10 per cent of annual turnover. So there are significant increases in the potential penalties that will be faced both by individuals and corporations. Other reforms announced include imposing design and distribution obligations to ensure products sold by financial institutions are designed for and marketed to an identified target market to minimise the likelihood of consumers purchasing unsuitable products. Also announced was a product intervention power for ASIC to enable the regulator to intervene where products could pose significant consumer harm. Obviously, we want a system where people understand what they are purchasing and purchase things that are appropriate for their financial circumstances. The more information we have in the marketplace about these products, the more informed decisions consumers can make.


We've announced a move to extend unfair contract term protections to insurance contracts. We've also announced further reforms to combat illegal phoenixing activity. Phoenixing is the activity where a business closes down and restarts pretty much on the same day and in the same premises. We've also allowed the early release of superannuation rules on compassionate grounds and financial hardship grounds. The government has also recently increased ASIC's funding by $70 million to equip it with the resources and powers it needs. We need to detect, deter and punish those who do the wrong thing. We need to ensure that all companies pay the correct amount of tax under the law. In that way, we can keep taxes as low as possible for everybody.

"Storer, Sen Timothy",IND,2018-09-20,"



Senator STORER
 (South Australia) (10:36):  The Australian economy needs entrepreneurs. The parliament should foster an entrepreneurial spirit and give a fair go to those who are weighing up the risks of starting a business. Entrepreneurs are prepared to take risks to be successful and drive the economy. Entrepreneurs and small businesses should be supported and given confidence to invest and grow—for example, in collaborative structures with other businesses. We should not punish those entrepreneurs who worked hard in small businesses and made substantial contributions to Australia's economy in the process. It is unfortunate that that will be a consequence of Treasury Laws Amendment (Tax Integrity and Other Measures) Bill 2018 as currently drafted. I will return to that in a moment.


The new rules would act as a disincentive to growth, hurting thousands of small businesses—the very people our Prime Minister says are the engine of economic growth and jobs. Whilst I agree with the intention of the bill—that big businesses and wealthy individuals should not be able to access tax concessions designed to help small businesses grow—the bill also unintentionally smuggles in policy by stealth. It's actually misleading to suggest that these changes are merely an integrity measure. No-one wants to see loopholes in the law erode the tax base, but this legislation does appear to have adverse consequences for some small-business people who deserve support to grow and be successful.


The fact is that there are genuine small-business people who will no longer be able to claim appropriate tax relief as a result of this bill. I've had numerous consultations with business groups, in particular with Business SA, on this issue. They have cited that many of their members now face capital gains tax of hundreds of thousands of dollars each when they sell their share in their businesses, which can often be their entire retirement nest egg. The amendment I will seek to have passed will remedy that concern by making the new restrictions only apply to taxpayers who have significant other wealth, not to genuine small-business people who have worked hard to grow a business and employ Australians along the way.


At the same time as we debate these issues, a review is taking place by the Board of Taxation that will provide recommendations into precisely the issues being put forward in the bill. That review will:


… identify ways to improve small business tax concessions to ensure they remain effective, easily accessible, and well-targeted. … including how the small business tax concessions complement retirement savings policy.


It makes no sense to me that we would rush this bill through the Senate before that analysis is made available next month. The Senate could make an informed decision.


The Prime Minister has declared, as the benchmark for his administration, that he will give 'a fair go to those prepared to have a go'. According to Business SA, there are thousands of people in South Australia alone who have demonstrably had a go, who are inadvertently affected by this bill as it currently stands. Through their enterprises they have built businesses, employed South Australians and contributed to the prosperity of the state. What they now face, should this legislation be passed as currently drafted, is anything but a fair go. I urge the Senate to support the amendment I will be proposing or, at the very least, to delay passage of the bill until proper consideration can be made and consultations with stakeholders are held, in particular in reference to the Board of Taxation recommendations, to ensure that people who have made a lifetime contribution to the economy do not suffer the unintended consequences of this legislation.

"Stoker, Sen Amanda",LP,2018-09-20,"



Senator STOKER
 (Queensland) (10:40):  I rise to speak in support of the Treasury Laws Amendment (Tax Integrity and Other Measures) Bill 2018. We on this side of the chamber believe in lower taxes and in entrepreneurship. We believe in the hard work and aspiration of everyday Australians who want to get ahead. We know that lower taxes and more entrepreneurship are good for the economy, good for jobs and good for innovation. That's why this government has committed to and has delivered tax relief for small and medium-sized businesses, as well as for working families, through reductions in company and personal income tax.


This agenda of lowering taxes is working. Australia's unemployment rate is at 5.3 per cent, the lowest level since the peak of the mining boom. Well over one million jobs have been created since the coalition government was elected five years ago, and we have the strongest economic growth in the OECD. But, while we firmly believe that taxes should be low, we also believe that taxes must be paid. That's why this government has legislated a range of measures to combat multinational tax avoidance. They include a diverted profits tax; the establishment of a tax avoidance task force; strengthened international transfer pricing rules; increased penalties for multinationals who engage in profit shifting; and new whistleblower protections. The Australian Taxation Office expects that an additional $7 billion in sales revenue each year will be returned to the Australian tax base because of these reforms. The actions already taken by the government show its firm belief that while taxes should be low, they must also be paid.


This bill continues to deliver on the goal by further cracking down on multinational tax avoidance while, at the same time, providing tax relief for both innovative venture capital investors and Australian Defence Force personnel who receive reparations. For instance, schedule 4 amends the Income Tax Assessment Act to exempt payments made as reparation to victims of abuse in the Australian Defence Force. This will ensure that payments that are made as reparations to these victims will be exempt from income tax. The government previously made similar payments to victims of abuse in the ADF through the Defence Abuse Response Taskforce. The task force administered reparation payments of up to $50,000 to complainants who likely suffered sexual or other abuse by a member of Defence. These payments were specifically exempted from income tax because there was a possibility that the payments could be seen as arising from employment with Defence and understood, were it not for this legislation, to be income in the hands of the recipient.


The task force concluded on 31 August 2016. However, this bill will ensure that the important work it carried out is continued by expanding the role of the Defence Force Ombudsman to include the ability to make recommendations for reparation payments, which the government has already provided some $19.5 million to deal with. From now on, these reparation payments will be made on the recommendation of the Defence Force Ombudsman and will be exempt from income tax. This is because the government believes that the recipient of a payment of this kind should receive the full benefit of it, particularly the men and women who so honourably serve and protect our country in our Australian defence forces.


Furthermore, the government is committed to encouraging innovation and entrepreneurship through the Australian economy. Key to this is fostering competition. We know that greater competition leads to greater innovation, and that's what grows economies and creates jobs and wealth for their citizens.


While Australia has a sophisticated financial sector underpinned by a strong regulatory system, our financial services are at risk of becoming uncompetitive if they fail to keep pace with technological disruption and the global change in this field. That's why the government has already introduced new tax incentives for early-stage venture capital investors in relation to investments in financial technology, as a part of the $1.1 billion National Innovation and Science Agenda. This is an important step in ensuring the competitiveness of the fintech sector, as venture capital is a vital mechanism for financing new innovative enterprises at the start-up and early expansion stages of their commercialisation. Venture capitalists invest funds in such enterprises in return for an equity share or the equivalent of partial ownership. The funds provided to the enterprise are used to develop their ideas in the early stages of development and ensure early-stage commercial viability. These tax concessions support high-risk fintech businesses at the start-up and early expansion stages where it would otherwise be difficult to attract investment using normal commercial means.


The fintech sector is a largely new industry composed of companies that use technology to make financial services more efficient. These innovators are harnessing technology to deliver services in more relevant and convenient ways to Australian businesses and consumers. In a recent study, Fintech in Australia—trends, forecasts and analysis 2015–2020, research firm Frost & Sullivan says the Australian fintech sector is poised to contribute $3 billion of new revenue to the Australian financial services sector by 2020, while it is also estimated that fintech investment reached US$20 billion in 2015. It's clear that developing our fintech industry here will not only drive expansion and growth in our financial exports but will also deliver benefits to Australians through new services that will create value or bring efficiencies and convenience to the market. Indeed, with our financial services sector being the largest contributor to the financial economy, advancements in research and development represent a crucial opportunity for innovation in a key services sector of our growing economy.


However, current uncertainties about tax concessions have restricted the access of the fintech sector to venture capital investment, which could potentially create stagnation if it's not dealt with in this vital sector of the economy. So schedule 3 of this bill amends the Income Tax Assessment Act to ensure that the venture capital tax concessions are available for investments in fintech businesses. This clarification means that early-stage venture capital partnerships can receive tax concessions when they invest in new fintech businesses that are developing new technology, including using technology that might already exist but in a new and novel way. The removal of ambiguity from the tax law will help to foster a culture of entrepreneurship and encourage the necessary early-stage risk-taking while improving access to capital for Australian business to ensure that they grow and succeed. Innovation and Science Australia will be enabled to make public and private findings on the eligibility of investments, while banks that split their obligations in order to receive the benefits of the tax concessions, should they choose to take that path, will be excluded under anti-avoidance rules.


While Labor is promising a $200 billion tax increase across the Australian economy, the government is creating an environment to make Australia's fintech sector more internationally competitive through lower taxes. While we want lower taxes, as I said before, we're also serious about compliance. If taxes are due, they have to be paid, and that's why we're committed to ensuring that multinational entities pay their fair share of tax. The OECD has estimated that, globally, between US$100 billion and US$240 billion of corporate tax revenue is lost annually due to base erosion and profit-shifting strategies.


Some multinationals artificially structure their company to avoid Australian tax by booking revenue from Australian sales offshore. When that happens, they have an unfair advantage as against local businesses, families and small businesses, who have no choice about where they pay their tax and are inevitably left to shoulder more of the tax burden when those who are multinationals don't bear their share. Our already implemented multinational anti-avoidance laws allow the Commissioner of Taxation to treat the multinationals as though they have a taxable presence in Australia and were subject to Australian tax on their Australian income. As a result, 38 multinational corporations have changed or are in the process of changing their tax affairs to bring their Australian-sourced sales back onshore, including businesses like Google and Facebook.


However, the Australian Taxation Office has identified that certain partnership arrangements have been designed to avoid these laws. The bill will ensure that the original laws operate as intended. For example, schedule 1 of the bill toughens our multinational anti-avoidance laws by ensuring corporate structures involving foreign trusts and partnerships are subject to the law. This measure involves a technical amendment to prevent large multinationals from avoiding the application of the anti-avoidance laws by interposing partnerships that have foreign resident partners, trusts that have foreign resident trustees or beneficiaries, or foreign trusts that temporarily have their central management and control in Australia. This will continue to ensure fairness in this sector. Importantly, this measure will not negatively impact on investment by multinationals in Australia, as the measure is targeted towards those that attempt to avoid being subject to anti-avoidance laws by manipulating a certain target structure.


Furthermore, the government believe in and are committed to supporting small and family business. That's why we have consistently delivered support to small businesses through the life of this government. Whether that's initiatives such as the $20,000 instant asset write-off or company tax reductions for small and medium-sized businesses—which I believe the Labor Party have a policy to take away if they're successful at the next election—this government stands side by side with small businesses every day of the week. I'm glad to see that Prime Minister Scott Morrison has dedicated a minister for small and family business to his cabinet table.


Small businesses can also attract capital gains tax concessions to assist owners by providing relief from capital gains tax when they dispose of assets related to their business. This helps them to reinvest, to grow, to employ more Australians and to contribute to their own retirement savings. However, it is important to the integrity of our tax system that these capital gains tax concessions are appropriately targeted. We want to ensure that the concessions continue to benefit those who need them most—hardworking small and family businesses.


Unfortunately some taxpayers are currently able to access the small business capital gains concessions for assets that are unrelated to their small business. For example, it's possible to arrange one's affairs so that ownership interests in larger businesses don't count towards the tests for determining eligibility for the concession. So schedule 2 of the bill tries to deal with that, improving the integrity of these concessions. The concessions themselves aren't changing, and they'll continue to be available to genuine small business taxpayers. The proposed amendments will mean the small business capital gains tax concessions can only be accessed in relation to assets that are used in a small business or for ownership interests in a small business.


Key features of this new law will include a limitation on the size of the company or trust being disposed of to ensure that it is genuinely a small business in the Australian market, and clarifying that a taxpayer is required to be a small business entity at the time they dispose of their interest in the company or trust. This ensures taxpayers don't benefit from the concession where the relevant business activities are too remote. It will involve modifying the active asset test so that it looks through shares in companies or interests in trusts to the activities and assets of the underlying entities. This prevents concessions from being available where most of the value of the company or trust is in fact unrelated to small business activities.


This bill is just another example of how the Liberal-National government is taking action in a space where Labor failed to do so. While those on the other side love to talk about multinational corporations and tax integrity, it's been the Liberal-National government who has taken action to tackle multinational tax avoidance every day of the week. In doing so, it enables us to lower taxes for all Australians. I support this bill because it will ensure a more effective and targeted tax system while continuing our agenda of providing tax relief, equipping us to reduce more taxes for more Australians.

"Hume, Sen Jane",LP,2018-09-20,"



Senator HUME
 (Victoria—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (10:55):  I rise today to speak on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Tax Integrity and Other Measures) Bill 2018. It is, indeed, an honour and a privilege to be able to speak on yet another treasury laws amendment bill that has been introduced in this place, for this is an area in which the Morrison coalition government and both the Turnbull and Abbott governments before have given considerable thought and have taken action that has actually made a considerable difference to the budget bottom line.


Before I begin my remarks, I'd like to acknowledge the good work of the Commissioner of Taxation, Chris Jordan, who has, within nearly five years in the role, made a significant impact on the ATO, on its operations, on its personnel and also, particularly, on its approach to collecting tax revenue on behalf of the government. You would know, Acting Deputy President Marshall, that the Liberal-National coalition will always be a government of lower taxes. The Liberal Party in particular prides themselves on being a party that values lower taxes and that wants to keep more of what you earn in your pockets. But, at the same time, we are committed to ensuring that those who do earn income in Australia pay their fair share of tax in Australia.


Commissioner Chris Jordan is equally committed to that cause. He is certainly a man that does not take tax avoidance or tax evasion lightly. In fact, at the last Senate estimates he revealed that, particularly in the area of multinational tax avoidance, the new measures that this government have taken, whether it be through the diverted profits tax or the multinational anti-avoidance legislation, have already netted around $5 billion in additional revenue to the ATO and therefore to the budget bottom line. In fact, the ATO said that about 70 companies were being looked at very closely under that multinational anti-avoidance legislation because they were deemed to have a medium to high risk of avoiding a taxable presence in Australia and that 25 companies—I think this was nearly a year ago—had already started to restructure to fall in line with the multinational anti-avoidance legislation. That was because of the tough stance that Commissioner Jordan and the ATO had taken, backed by the federal government's multinational anti-avoidance law.


Microsoft, for example, had previously booked revenue for many of its sales in Australia in low-tax Singapore. But about 12 or so months ago it reached a settlement with the ATO under which it would book a much higher proportion of sales and therefore tax in Australia. Mr Jordan had said that this crackdown on foreign multinationals had very quickly achieved the desired results. As I said, in the 16 months until the end of October—and that was last year—it had flushed out retrospective tax liabilities of more than $5 billion from a swag of global giants operating in Australia. Nearly $1 billion of that was raised in four months alone. Of course, this came ahead of the imminent launches of companies like the retail giant Amazon in Australia, which would have walked into the Australian market with a completely different understanding of its obligations to pay tax in this country than if it had come into the market only 12 or 18 months beforehand. Google is another one of the companies that is targeted. In fact, the Multinational Anti-Avoidance Law and the diverted profits tax were dubbed the 'Google tax'. Facebook, of course, is the other one. It was particularly targeting those very large and quite opaque international companies. In fact, Mr Jordan said that they had an 'intellectual might' associated with them. And prior to this particular piece of legislation, those companies had attempted to intimidate the ATO to some extent to give them lower tax assessments. Mr Jordan noted that some of those multinationals attempted to bamboozle him and bamboozle ATO officials with financial fairytales and they tried to intellectually browbeat the ATO with great big piles of reports and spaghetti diagrams on white boards saying things like, 'Look, we have the greatest experts in the world.'




Senator Cameron:
  Not the dreaded whiteboard!




Senator HUME:
  Yes, the dreaded whiteboards, Senator Cameron. The world's greatest experts would say, 'This particular tax structure works. Who are you at the ATO to challenge us?' So Mr Jordan, applying these new multinational anti-avoidance laws and also the diverted profits tax, made sure his officials weren't boxed into a corner by the technical analysis and the intellectual might and legal and financial power of these very large companies. He has done so particularly successfully because he is as committed as the coalition to these companies paying the right amount of tax on profits that are earned in Australia.


Schedule 1 of this particular legislation toughens those Multinational Anti-Avoidance Law that has been so successful over the term of this government. The first schedule of the bill amends the Income Tax Assessment Act to improve the integrity of the Multinational Anti-Avoidance Law, the MAAL. Currently large multinationals can avoid the operation of that Multinational Anti-Avoidance Law by putting certain kinds of partnerships and trusts between the global entity and the consumer. The kinds of partnerships that are used are those that have foreign resident partners or foreign resident trustees or beneficiaries or are foreign resident trusts that can temporarily have central management and control in Australia. You can see how complicated those sorts of spaghetti diagrams on a whiteboard would be, which is why it's so important to dethatch the complexities of the tax arrangements of these companies. The use of these sorts of structures contravenes the original policy intent of the Multinational Anti-Avoidance Law, so this particular bill that we have before us in the chamber today ensures that the Multinational Anti-Avoidance Law acts as it was originally intended.


You may recall that the original anti-avoidance laws were enacted in December 2017 to prevent those very large multinationals from avoiding the tax on their Australian business profits by artificially structuring their affairs in a way that results in them not having to have that taxable presence in Australia. As I said earlier, since that legislation was enacted on January 12016, it has been highly effective and highly beneficial. It has achieved a significant intake of tax to the ATO and therefore to the budget bottom line.


On 15 December 2016, the ATO published its concerns with certain restructures involving those foreign partnerships undertaken in response to the implementation of the multinational anti-avoidance legislation, so this was like a post-implementation review. It was entirely appropriate that the ATO, which implements this particular piece of legislation, should review its efficacy. And while the ATO said it is highly effective and will achieve its objectives, it does have some tweaking where there potentially are loopholes remaining.


This particular bill affects the large multinationals that fall within the scope of the multinational anti-avoidance legislation. In general those entities have a global income of more than $1 billion, so we're certainly not dealing with the small end of town here. As to the date of effect, the schedule will apply from 1 January 2016, which of courses is the original date of the effect of the multinational anti-avoidance legislation. There has been public consultation—a public consultation paper was released on 12 February 2018—and the Treasurer received a number of submissions from groups as diverse as Deloitte, the Tax Justice Network and the Australian Retailers Association. There was a general consensus of support for the proposed amendments to this bill, and Deloitte in fact also provided some minor technical amendments to the exposure draft legislation. The financial impact of this is estimated to be unquantifiable, but it will result in a gain to revenue over the period 2017-18 to 2020-21.


Schedule 2 is about improving the integrity of the small-business capital gains tax concessions. It gives effect to the 2017-18 budget announcement that the government would amend the small-business capital gains tax concessions to ensure that they could only be accessed in relation to assets used in a small business or ownership interests in a small business so that the capital gains tax concessions that are available are only used and accessed appropriately. The object of those small-business capital gains tax concessions is to provide relief from capital gains tax on the disposal of assets related to a small business. Currently the problem, of course, is that some taxpayers are able to access those concessions for assets which are entirely unrelated to their small business. For example, they can arrange their affairs so that their ownership interests in larger businesses do not count towards the tests for determining eligibility for these concessions. As of 1 July last year, additional basic conditions have to be satisfied to ensure that small-business capital gains tax concessions are only available to genuine small businesses. This includes testing the size of the company or the trust that is being disposed of to raise that capital gain.


The proposed amendments tighten the eligibility criteria for the small-business capital gains tax concessions and ensure that they are better targeted to those to whom it is relevant. The concessions themselves, it should be noted, are not changing; they will continue to be available to genuine small-business taxpayers with an aggregated turnover of less than $2 million or business assets of less than $6 million. The intention here is that the measure will apply retrospectively from 1 July 2017, and the application is consistent with the budget announcement on 9 May 2017 about ensuring that those concessions can only be accessed in relation to the assets used in a small business or ownership interests in a small business. As you can see, this is little more than an integrity measure to shore up measures that have already been put into place. There was public consultation on this particular legislation as well. The accompanying explanatory material was circulated in February this year, and feedback from the consultation has been incorporated into the final drafting of the bill. While it's hard to quantify the financial gain that will inevitably come from this particular measure, again, it will be over the forward estimates period.


There is a further schedule around fin-tech and venture capital amendments—schedule 3. This is a particularly important amendment for my home state of Victoria, where the fin-tech industry is booming. Schedule 3 of this bill amends the Income Tax Assessment Act to clarify that early-stage venture capital limited partnerships, also known as ESVCLPs—rather a mouthful—and venture capital limited partnerships, VCLPs, can make investments in fin-tech firms. This will ensure that fin-tech businesses have better access to the capital that they need to grow and succeed.


This is part of a suite of financing alternatives that the coalition government, the National-Liberal Morrison coalition government, have been putting together for some time. You will recall that last week we discussed crowdsourced funding arrangements. Not that long ago, we established the ASIC sandbox to allow fintechs to operate temporarily without a full financial licence to see whether their businesses are viable. This is all part of the suite of laws that allow fintechs the best chance of getting established, growing and thriving in this country. It is a new industry and a very exciting industry that's growing not just in Australia but worldwide. It's very important that we compete for the best and brightest minds in this space.


The government is clearly committed to encouraging innovation throughout the Australian economy. To this end the $1.1 billion National Innovation and Science Agenda, NISA, was announced, you will recall, in December 2015. It included enhanced tax concessions for these early-stage venture capital limited partnerships and also for venture capital limited partnerships. These particular programs encourage venture capital investment in Australian start-ups, providing these businesses with the funds that they need to grow and to prosper. This particular schedule will clarify that early-stage venture capital limited partnerships and also venture capital limited partnerships can invest in fintech businesses that are developing the new technology, including using technology in a novel way, such as through developing new products and services, by removing the ambiguity from the tax law and also providing certainty for venture capital investors. The amendments outlined in schedule 3 will impact both investors and participants in early-stage venture capital limited partnerships and also venture capital limited partnerships regimes.


The amendments are supported by stakeholders and will provide particular benefit to venture capital investors in fintech businesses, providing certainty that they can invest in fintech, and it will also benefit the fintech businesses themselves as they will have better access to improved venture capital funding as a result of these changes. The fintech amendment was announced as part of the Treasurer's fintech statement, which was released in March 2016. The Treasury conducted an initial public consultation into this particular bill, on the amendments in schedule 3, and received a number of responses from key stakeholders, including the Australian Private Equity and Venture Capital Association, some law firms, some accounting firms and Innovation and Science Australia. The consultation process started in October last year and concluded in November. Following that particular consultation process, the Treasury worked with the stakeholders, the Department of Industry, Innovation and Science, Innovation and Science Australia, AusIndustry and the ATO to refine the current bill to reflect a number of the suggestions made by stakeholders. I should mention that those stakeholders were broadly very supportive of the changes that were being made to fintechs. The financial impact of these changes is hard to quantify, but it's all about having the right policy settings to allow these particular firms, fintech firms—this growing industry—to grow, thrive and prosper.


There is another schedule to this particular legislation, schedule 4, which is about tax exemptions for payments made under the Defence Force Ombudsman scheme. This is to exempt from income tax payments the reparations to victims of abuse in the Australian Defence Force. That is very important. The government previously made similar payments to victims of abuse in the Australian Defence Force through the Defence Abuse Response Taskforce. The taskforce administered reparation payments of up to $50,000 through the Defence Abuse Reparation Scheme to complainants who likely suffered sexual and other abuse by a member of Defence. These payments were specifically exempted from income tax as there was a possibility that the payment could be seen to arise from employment with Defence and considered income in the hands of the recipient. The task force concluded on 31 August 2016 and assessed any abuse that occurred prior to 11 April 2011.


In the budget this year the government announced that it would continue the existing functions of the Defence Force Ombudsman and expand its role to include the ability to make recommendations for reparation payments. The government announced that it would provide $19.5 million over four years from 2017-18 for the reparation payments. The previous functions that were undertaken by the task force and the scheme are effectively being replicated and will now be executed by the Defence Force Ombudsman. It affects only the victims of abuse in the Australian Defence Force who receive reparation payments.


The Treasury Laws Amendment (Tax Integrity and Other Measures) Bill 2018 covers a number of quite diverse areas, all of which are important, and I commend this bill to the Senate.

"Seselja, Sen Zed",LP,2018-09-20,"



Senator SESELJA
 (Australian Capital Territory—Assistant Minister for Treasury and Finance) (11:15):  I want to very much thank senators for their contributions and for their support for what is a very, very important bill, the Treasury Laws Amendment (Tax Integrity and Other Measures) Bill 2018, as I think was so eloquently outlined by Senator Hume and others.


I want to go through a couple of the key elements of the bill before summing up. Schedule 1 of the bill strengthens the integrity of the Multinational Anti-Avoidance Law and ensures that it operates as intended. This amendment will further deliver on what has been a very tough stance from this Liberal-National government against multinational tax avoidance, as demonstrated by the successive measures implemented in recent years to ensure that multinationals pay their fair share of tax in Australia.


Unlike the opposition, the Labor Party, who have talked a big game in opposition on multinational tax avoidance, this is something that we deliver on in government. We deliver on it as a principled position for a number of reasons. We deliver on it because, by having everyone pay their fair share, by ensuring that large multinationals can't profit-shift offshore, by having them pay their fair share, Australian taxpayers—the hardworking men and women who are working hard every day and paying a lot of income tax or those who are building up their small and medium enterprises and paying their fair share of tax—can rely on services to be delivered by the Australian government. The way that we can do that, while growing the economy and putting the budget back into balance, is to have everyone pay their fair share. So, as a matter of principle, we have a stance that says multinationals must pay their fair share. Schedule 1, by strengthening the integrity of the Multinational Anti-Avoidance Law, ensures that we get fairness in the system.


If you look at the budget measures we have undertaken and the approach that the coalition has taken to economic policy, you see that these are always built on those pillars. We do everything we can to grow the economy. We grow the economy by lowering taxes, whether that's by getting rid of things like the mining tax and the carbon tax, whether that's by lowering people's electricity bills, whether that is by lowering income tax for hardworking taxpayers, whether that's by lowering taxes for small business so they can grow their business and employ more Australians, or whether that's by getting rid of red tape—as we have done every year since we came into government. All of that has helped Australians who are having a go to do better and has helped our economy to thrive.


We've put in place measures, such as our free trade agreements, which deliver more economic activity and more jobs into the Australian economy and help get spending under control. We have shown in every budget, successive budgets, that, by limiting the growth of spending, we will be able to get the budget back into balance next year—all the while cutting taxes for small business; all the while cutting taxes for low- and middle-income earners; and all the while being able to deliver record investment in really important areas such as defence, health, education, infrastructure and a range of other very important areas.


This has been our economic approach, and getting multinationals to pay their fair share is part of those integrity measures. We've had integrity measures in other parts of the system. We've moved a record number of people from welfare into work. We've had those people who have been rorting the welfare system taken off the welfare system so that those who need it because they're doing it tough for various reasons have access to it and so we can deliver on things like the NDIS. This has been at the heart of what we've done. We don't just talk about it; we get it done.


Schedule 2 of this bill amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to give effect to the government's 2017-18 budget announcement. It will improve integrity and better target the small-business capital gains tax concessions. Again, making sure there's integrity in the system ensures that we can continue to deliver tax relief for small businesses, as opposed to the Labor Party who wants to up taxes for small and medium enterprises. It allows us to deliver that income tax relief and it allows us to deliver the services that Australians expect and Australians want their government to be able to deliver.


These amendments are designed to ensure that the concessions can only be accessed in relation to assets used in a small business or ownership interests in a small business. Why is this important? It's because the amendments introduce a test on the size of the business being disposed of to prevent inappropriate access to the concessions for assets unrelated to a small business, so it brings them in. This ensures that these important concessions continue to benefit those who need them most—and that's hardworking small businesses. Any number of measures that we put in place to support small business is because we know that these are hardworking Australians and these are hardworking men and women who put their capital on the line, who often put their house on the line, who often work 50-, 60- or 70-hour weeks, and who often have a family business where everyone contributes. At every turn, the Liberal-National government seeks to make things a little bit easier for those hardworking men and women. It says to them, 'We'll lower your tax burden, we'll lower the amount of red tape, we'll work hard to lower your energy bills, we'll build a framework of a strong economy through free trade and other things, and we'll control our own spending so that you're not burdened with excessive taxes down the track and so we can deliver the infrastructure and the services that are necessary for you to thrive.'


The government is committed to establishing Australia as a leading global financial technology, or fintech, hub. This is a major area of potential growth. Schedule 3 of this bill builds on this work. It builds on the work of our government to ensure that we have the right policy settings in place to foster innovation. This has been a key focus of our government, and one of the reasons it's a key focus of our government is because we know that Australians have some of the best examples of innovation, invention, and research and development in the world. But, because of some of the challenges in getting capital, we haven't always been able to fully exploit and build on those great innovations and that great entrepreneurship that exists and is in the DNA of the Australian people. We see it as a partnership and a way of assisting businesses and entrepreneurs who come up with those amazing ideas to then be able to get the capital that they need so that they can then employ people, grow their businesses, have profitable businesses, reinvest in those businesses, employ more people, grow our economy and provide the opportunities that we want to see for Australian men and women as they come into the workforce and as they stay in the workforce.


Schedule 3, to that end, amends the early-stage venture capital limited partnership, the venture capital limited partnership and tax incentives for early-stage investor regimes of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997. What this does is it clarifies that early-stage venture capital limited partnerships and venture capital limited partnerships can invest in innovative fintech businesses, removes ambiguity from the tax law and provides certainty for venture capital investors.


As I said earlier, we've got extraordinary entrepreneurs. If you go to our universities and many of our small businesses, and if you meet our scientists who are coming up with the research and development, the ideas and the great technological breakthroughs, we invest so much. We've got a great record as a government in things like the Medical Research Future Fund. That is one area of extraordinary innovation that will see jobs grow and, just as importantly, will save lives. It will see Australians living longer and living healthier lives through medical research. We think there is a major economic advantage in that as well as people live longer lives and as we develop these products and sell them to the world.


We've got these extraordinary scientists and innovators, and we want to bring more capital behind them so that they can indeed have the opportunity to develop those products. Instead of people having to go offshore in order to fully develop their ideas and their products, as has unfortunately happened in many cases in the past, we want them developing here. We're seeing more of that. We're seeing that with collaborations in partnerships between our research organisations and our universities. We do it with things like CRCs. One of the innovations we have brought in is the CRCPs, which is a great addition to the cooperative research centres. The cooperative research centres are a way of bringing all those entities together. It is world-leading. The CRCPs are shorter-term and more focused. The industry response—I had responsibility in that area—has been very positive. We're able to do things again in a slightly quicker and a more innovative way, and do some of those shorter-term smaller projects which can still have absolutely substantial benefits.


As I said, this will clarify those early stage venture capital limited partnerships—and venture capital limited partnerships can invest in innovative fintech businesses—and it remove ambiguity from the tax law. That is important for attracting that investment. We want to see that investment continuing to come from Australian investors and also from foreign investors in some of our great ideas and backing our entrepreneurs.


This again demonstrates the government's continuing commitment to promoting a culture of entrepreneurship and risk-taking in Australia, and it will help ensure that innovative Australian businesses have access to the capital and expertise that they need to grow and succeed. It works hand in hand with those other aspects of policy that I have outlined. When you allow capital to come in, when you encourage entrepreneurship, when you have those industry partnerships, when you lower taxes for small and medium businesses, when you allow free trade to thrive and when you cut red tape and encourage Australians to get ahead and employ more people, then these things come together in a very positive way—as we are seeing with the record number of jobs that we have created. We very much believe in this.


Going back to the 2017-18 budget, the government announced, on another aspect of this bill, that it would expand the role of the Defence Force Ombudsman to make recommendations for reparation payments. All complains of abuse in Defence made to the Defence Force Ombudsman will now include an assessment for a reparation payment. Previously, similar reparation payments were administered by the Defence Abuse Response Taskforce, which concluded on 31 August 2016. The reparation payments made by the Defence Abuse Response Taskforce were specifically exempt from income tax. This is an important change, and it builds on some of this good work. It's another way of honouring the amazing work that our Defence Force personnel do.


We are committed not just to the defence of our nation but to the health and welfare of our Defence personnel. I think we have learnt a lot in recent years about where we have let them down from time to time as a nation. We have learnt where we can do better. We always strive to make sure that we look after the welfare of those men and women who put their lives on the line for the sake of our nation and our freedom.


In addition, schedule 4 of this bill responds to the government's expansion of the existing functions of the Defence Force Ombudsman. Similar reparation payments were previously administered by the Defence Abuse Response Taskforce, which concluded on 31 August 2016. Reparation payments made by the task force, as I said, were specifically exempt from income tax.


Schedule 4 ensures that the new reparation payments recommended by the Defence Force Ombudsman are exempt from income tax. Reparation payments are not intended to be compensation, and complainants will not be required to release the Commonwealth from liability. These amendments ensure the recipients get the full benefit of such a payment free from the obligation to pay income tax. For all of these reasons, all of those schedules come together for some important reforms. I've outlined a number of the reasons. They build on a number of earlier reforms that the Liberal-National government have been proud to deliver, and I look forward to the hopeful passage of this bill thorough the Senate. I commend this bill to the Senate.

"Cameron, Sen Doug",ALP,2018-09-20,"



Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (11:31):  I move opposition amendment (1) on sheet 8437:


(1) Schedule 2, item 3, page 8 (line 14), omit ""1 July 2017"", substitute ""8 February 2018"".


This amendment changes the start date for the small business capital gains tax concession measure in schedule 2. Labor flagged our position on this issue during debate on this bill in the other place. Stakeholders have informed Labor that the additional conditions for eligibility for the concessions are detailed in a way that makes the changes more akin to a policy change rather than an integrity change and captures taxpayers who engage in good faith, according to the intent of the concessions. These changes only came to light when the detailed amendments were released in the exposure draft bill on 8 February 2018. Accordingly, Labor's amendment would change the implementation date from 1 July 2017, as per the budget announcement, to 8 February 2018. That is the date of the exposure draft release. 


The reality is that this bill could have probably been dealt with and passed an hour ago. We know exactly what's happening here. This is a government with no agenda. This is a government that really have got no legislative agenda of any substance before the Senate. They are in a situation where they are too busy continuing to knife each other, attacking each other, moving from one Prime Minister to another to actually deal with the issues of importance to the Australian people. That's why we had these filibusters take place, where backbench senators stand up and try to talk out 20 minutes on a bill that could have been dealt with in a short period of time. I understand there's no controversy, that we've got agreement on the amendments—there's agreement on this amendment. We should actually get on with the business of this Senate. The problem is that if we do get through the business of the Senate, we will probably run out of legislation. This rabble of a government—their own Prime Minister describes them as 'muppets'—can't get their act together. We had Senator Stoker stand up and tell us about how great things are under a Liberal government. We had Senator Seselja just stand up and tell us how great things are going under this coalition government—they are going swimmingly, aren't they? Things are going swimmingly, going so well under the coalition. What an absolute joke, what an absolute rabble of a government you lot are. 


We get told about how they want to deal with the integrity of the tax system. Integrity was so important back in the 2014-15 budget that they actually cut $120 million out of ASIC. That's how much they cared about integrity—$120 million out of ASIC. The Hon. Steven Ciobo, the then Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, said this:


… there is scope for the financial services industry … to self-regulate more. 


That's where they were. That's how much they cared about integrity. They wanted the financial services sector to self-regulate more. What a joke. What an absolute joke. Maybe that explains what their real position is. Maybe that explains why current Prime Minister Morrison actually voted against the royal commission into the banks on 26 occasions. Maybe he wanted the banks to have more self-regulation. Maybe he thought the banks could look after regulation better than the government. Well, under the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison government that we've got now, they probably could. But look at what they've left. 


On 26 occasions this Prime Minister voted against the royal commission into the banks. And people were saying, 'This is a problem. This will mean that ASIC will not be able to carry out its responsibilities as the corporate regulator.' Maybe that's what they wanted, and that's why Prime Minister Morrison voted against the banking inquiry on 26 occasions. 


I see Senator Williams has just come into the chamber. At least Senator Williams was consistent: he called for a royal commission into the banking sector. Unfortunately, he could not convince his counterparts in the National Party or Liberal Party to actually implement the royal commission into the banking industry. So, I just don't buy these lectures that we're getting from Senator Stoker and other senators about the great job this government is doing. They are an absolute rabble of a government. They are pathetic. They are a terrible government. They are just—

Let's deal with this legislation. Stop trying to filibuster. Stop standing up here for 20 minutes. Each government senator stands up and rabbits on for 20 minutes, rabbits on with a prepared speech, while Senator Seselja gets up and wanders all over the place. This amendment is before us. We should support this amendment. We should deal with this bill and get on with the business of government.

Senator SESELJA
 (Australian Capital Territory—Assistant Minister for Treasury and Finance) (11:38):  I'm fascinated by the tactics of Senator Cameron taking eight minutes, waffling on about anything other than this bill, to tell us about a filibuster. He's claiming a filibuster, and he spent seven or eight minutes going on about what he didn't like about the 2014 budget and quoting the parliamentary secretary at the time, Steven Ciobo, rather than dealing with the bill. 


Senator Cameron claims the economy's not going well. That's absolute rubbish. Senator Cameron didn't like Senator Stoker's contribution—or Senator Hume's outstanding contribution—because he wouldn't want the opportunity to put on the record why this kind of legislation is important and how it builds on the Liberal-National government's agenda and achievements of delivering over one million jobs for our economy. Those one million jobs came despite the Labor Party's opposition. Every major measure we took, you were there to oppose it. When we got rid of the carbon tax and when we got rid of the mining tax, you were there to oppose it. When we were cutting back taxes for small and medium enterprises, you were there to oppose it. When we were dealing with union corruption, which holds our economy back, Senator Cameron and the Labor Party were there to oppose it.


Senator Cameron gets up and gives us a lecture. He takes several minutes—in fact eight or nine minutes—on an amendment to give us a lecture about filibustering, and then he claims that those economic credentials and those achievements aren't real. They are real. They haven't come about by accident. They've come about through sound economic policy, through the right legislation and through the right settings. They've come about despite the Labor Party. As we have fixed your economic mess and as we've fixed your budget mess, at every turn you have opposed us.


We will make no apology for talking about our legislative agenda, which is about tax integrity. We have delivered when it comes to multinationals, when you did nothing. What did the Labor Party do on multinationals when they were in government? Absolutely nothing. We had Senator Dastyari come in opposition and talk about what he wanted to do, which they did nothing about when they were in government. They had six years and they didn't get it done. The economy absolutely stagnated. We have taken a different approach, and that has delivered over one million jobs, lower taxes, and services we need for Australians. We've secured our borders. We've built up our defence industry. We are delivering a balanced budget. Those are things the Labor Party could only dream of when they were in government. We're not going to be lectured to by Senator Cameron on this or anything else.


I will now turn to Senator Cameron's and the opposition's amendment. The government announced, in the 2017-18 budget, an integrity measure to ensure that the small business CGT concessions are appropriately targeted to genuine small businesses with effect from 1 July 2017. The opposition's amendment would defer the start of this measure to 8 February 2018. Delaying the start would allow a further period of time in which to transition into the new arrangements. We believe this is an important integrity measure. The government needs to balance any request for a delayed start against the risk of providing more scope for entities to inappropriately access the small business CGT concessions. Notwithstanding these concerns, the government is willing to support the amendment proposed by the opposition to delay the start to 8 February to 18. The small business CGT concessions are not changing. These concessions provide valuable relief from taxation for small business owners on capital gains on the disposal of assets related to their business, allowing them to reinvest and grow as well as contribute to their retirement savings. Passing this bill will ensure small business CGT concessions are appropriately targeted so they can continue to benefit those that need it the most—hardworking Australian small businesses.

"Cameron, Sen Doug",ALP,2018-09-20,"



Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (10:04):     Labor supports the measures in the Treasury Laws Amendment (Tax Integrity and Other Measures) Bill 2018, although we will move two small but important amendments.    The bill contains four tax measures.    Schedule 1 to this bill amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 to ensure that the Multinational Anti-Avoidance Law applies appropriately to artificial or contrived arrangements involving trusts and partnerships entered into by multinational entities to avoid the taxation of business profits in Australia.


This measure applies on or after 1 January 2016 in connection with a scheme, whether or not the scheme was entered into, or was commenced to be carried out, before that day. However, the measure does not apply in relation to tax benefits that a taxpayer derives before 1 January 2016. This is consistent with the date from which the Multinational Anti-Avoidance Law applied, and the purpose of the law.


In order for this extension to apply, the trust or partnership must have: a relationship with a foreign entity that means they are not independent of that entity at the time they make the relevant supply or supplies to their Australian customer; and a foreign entity participant at any time in an income year in which income is derived from the supply.


As noted in the explanatory memorandum, the schedule implements a technical integrity measure underpinning the Multinational Anti-Avoidance Law.    At this point, I just want to remind the Senate that the government regularly makes misleading statements that Labor voted against the Multinational Anti-Avoidance Law. This is untrue. In the House, Labor voted against government-Greens political party amendments that watered down tax transparency reporting requirements for large private companies. Labor, throughout debate, supported the MAAL.


I should also note that the Senate has now passed Labor's private senator's bill regarding tax transparency. This will allow proper scrutiny and help restore the trust in the integrity of the tax system that was brought about when the Gillard government passed tax transparency reforms in June 2013. The Senate has voted to lower the tax transparency threshold to $50 million for all firms—public and private.


The bill also removes a grandfathering exemption for certain financial reports for approximately 1500 large companies. Labor supported this when former Senator Ricky Muir moved it during the Multinational Anti-Avoidance Law debate in 2015, where it was opposed by the Liberals and the Greens. That private senator's bill stands alongside other Labor transparency measures, including disclosure of tax haven activity in government tenders, public reporting of country-by-country reports and protection for whistleblowers who uncover tax dodging by multinationals.


Schedule 2 to the bill amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to include additional conditions that must be satisfied to apply the small business CGT concessions to capital gains. The new conditions ensure that the small business CGT concessions in division 152 are only available for capital gains tax assets that are either used or held ready for use in the course of a small business or are an interest in a small business. These amendments implement the measure announced in the 2017-18 budget as 'Tax integrity package—improving the small business capital gains tax concessions' and apply to capital gains tax events that occur on or after 1 July 2017. That announcement followed issues raised with Treasury by the Australia Taxation Office that legislative loopholes were being exploited. The budget proposal was vague in its details. Numerous tax professionals and stakeholders have said it was not until the release of the exposure draft legislation that those affected would become aware of how they were affected. Stakeholders make the reasonable claim that, due to a lack of detail, taxpayers have conducted their tax affairs in good faith and will be caught by changes that go beyond what was flagged in the budget. In light of the stakeholder concerns, Labor is moving a detailed amendment to make the start date 8 February 2018, the date on which the exposure draft legislation was released, as proposed by the tax professional community. I will detail our amendment later in my remarks.


Schedule 3 of the bill amends the income tax law and the Venture Capital Act 2002 to ensure that the venture capital tax concessions are available for investments in fin-tech businesses. These amendments apply in relation to investments made on or after 1 July 2018. This schedule partially implements the National Innovation and Science Agenda measure, expanding the new arrangements for venture capital limited partnerships from the 2016-17 budget. In the light of feedback received in the course of our consultations, Labor will be moving an amendment to this schedule of the bill. This amendment will require the minister to instigate an impact assessment of the venture capital tax concession provisions overhaul, and include the measures in schedule 3 to this bill to ensure that they are operating as intended.


Schedule 4 to this bill amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to exempt from income tax the payments received from the Commonwealth as reparation for abuse by Australian Defence Force personnel. This measure applies to the 2017-18 income year and later income years, and implements the tax consequences from the 2017-18 budget of the Defence Force Ombudsman continuation and expansion measure. The Defence Abuse Response Taskforce was established on 10 April 2011 to assess and respond to individual cases of sexual and other abuse in the Australian Defence Force. The Defence Abuse Response Taskforce administered reparation payments through the Defence Reparation Scheme of up to $50,000 to complainants who likely suffered abuse in the Australian Defence Force. Reparation payments were not paid as compensation for loss or damage for any asserted, perceived or possible legal liability on behalf of the Commonwealth or for any injury, disease or impairment. The payments did not affect complainants' statutory common law or other legal rights. This measure amends the tax law to exempt from income tax the payments made in accordance with a recommendation of the Defence Force Ombudsman in relation to abuse by Australian Defence Force personnel. Labor supports this measure in schedule 4.


I now turn to the two amendments that Labor will move to this bill in relation to schedule 2 and schedule 3. Labor will move an amendment relating to the small-business capital gains tax concession measures in schedule 2. Stakeholders have informed Labor that the additional conditions for eligibility for the capital gains tax concessions are detailed in a way that make the changes more akin to a policy change rather than an integrity change, and, as such, capture taxpayers who engaged in good faith according to the intent of the concessions. Further, the active asset tests for eligibility interact with a longer run issue of tax office interpretation and application of the active test. This issue flared up when the ATO appeared to change its interpretation of 'act of business/asset' in a footnote to the draft taxation ruling TR2017/D2—a matter that has not been resolved. Chartered Accountants of Australia and New Zealand noted in language comparable to other stakeholders:


The proposed measure would deny ""access to the concessions for assets which are unrelated to [a taxpayer's] small business, for instance through arranging their affairs so that their ownership interests in larger businesses do not count towards the tests for determining eligibility for the concessions"". No further information was released until the publication of this exposure draft.


The measures contained in the exposure draft are extraordinarily complex. More importantly, in our view they go beyond what taxpayers could reasonably have expected from the Budget announcement designed to address ""integrity"" concerns. They reduce what many stakeholders would regard as the intended scope of the concessions.


… … …


… taxpayers have in good faith sold, or entered into agreements to sell, interests in entities on the basis that they qualified for the concessions but will not now do so.


The Tax Institute, Chartered Accountants of Australia and New Zealand, partners at large accounting firms and small businesses have all argued that, to prevent adverse consequences for taxpayers who have acted in good faith but could not reasonably have been expected to foresee the detailed amendments that were finally unveiled in the exposure draft, the implementation date should be changed from 1 July 2017, as per the budget announcement, to 8 February 2018, the date of the exposure draft release.


In light of the stakeholders' concerns, Labor is moving a detailed amendment to make the start date 8 February 2018. We flagged the need for this change when the bill was debated in the House. Labor will also move an amendment in relation to schedule 3. This amendment requires the minister to instigate an impact assessment of the venture capital tax concession provisions overall and to include the measures in this bill to ensure they are operating as intended. This impact assessment would be conducted by Treasury and Innovation and Science Australia.


For the benefit of the Senate, I want to note some comments by the member for Chifley in the other place when debate was underway on this bill. The member for Chifley said:


The sector and people in the sector have raised with me that they're not entirely happy with what's been put forward in this bill. Again, it's a straightforward measure, but they still don't think that it's picked up their concerns. For example—and I had highlighted to me—in 3.26 of the explanatory memorandum it states that a fin-tech may be eligible for the tax concession when developing its technology. However—and this is what has been raised with me—it then goes on to say that when a business is commercialising the technology it would no longer be eligible. As has been raised with me: 'This hardly seems like a certain, longer term platform for a venture capital firm to make an investment in a fin-tech, given that the VC is only making the investment because it's hoping the fin-tech will be able to commercialise and profit from the technology.' This is what they're raising with me, and I'm sure they have raised it with Treasury.


The member for Chifley raised important concerns about the government's processes. This reflects why we believe it is important to have a review. We also note concerns about the government's process. The member for Chifley noted in the other place:


… what I have been finding out when talking with stakeholders about this is how long it took to get to this point—how long it took for this straightforward move to happen.


I note that FinTech Australia put out a policy paper on this issue on in February 2016. The government announced this in their 2016-17 budget, but it was not until October 2017 that the government started to consult on amendments. It is concerning that this whole process has taken so long.


Labor's position strikes the right balance: we support this particular measure, but we will also be moving an amendment requiring the government to have a comprehensive and transparent review of the venture capital tax concession framework. In conclusion, Labor supports the measures in the Treasury Laws Amendment (Tax Integrity and Other Measures) Bill 2018. However, we will be moving sensible amendments to the bill, which we commend to the Senate.

"Brockman, Sen Slade",LP,2018-09-20,"



Senator BROCKMAN
 (Western Australia) (10:20):  I rise to speak on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Tax Integrity and Other Measures) Bill 2018. I thank Senator Cameron for his contribution and the fact that those opposite will be supporting this bill, albeit they will be moving some amendments to it.


Why is tax integrity important? Tax integrity is vital because it gives people confidence in our economic system and it means that taxes can be maintained at as low a level as possible. If everyone is paying the amount of tax they are required to pay then taxpayers are not burdened. Those who do pay their tax, who follow the rules, are not burdened with unduly high taxes. So tax integrity is an essential measure of fairness in a modern economy.


This government has a strong track record of defending the integrity of the tax system, to make sure it collects the tax that is required to be paid—and no more than that—so that no-one in society is burdened with an unfair level of taxation because others are breaking the rules. The government has a strong track record of defending the integrity of the tax system not just in this bill but previously, and before I go into this bill in detail I'll just run through some of the things that this government has done.


Legislation passed includes such things as the Banking Executive Accountability Regime, the BEAR, ensuring that senior executives are accountable for the decisions they make. That was a very significant reform in Australia's financial services history. It imposed a higher standard of behaviour on banks and their senior executives and directors. It strengthened the leadership of financial system regulators through enabling ASIC and APRA each to have a second deputy chair position. That is the case at APRA, where John Lonsdale, a 30-year Treasury veteran, has been appointed. And Daniel Crennan QC has already started in his role at ASIC as a special prosecutor focusing on enforcement.


We have created a one-stop shop for dispute resolution with the establishment of the Australian Financial Complaints Authority, enabling more consumers to access fast and free dispute resolution. We have increased the powers of APRA in relation to crisis management and non-bank lenders to ensure the resilience and ongoing stability of the Australian financial system. We have capped commissions paid on life insurance products to prevent unnecessary churn. We have raised the professional education and ethical standards of financial advisers. We have put a ban on excessive credit card surcharges, to protect consumers from being granted excessive credit limits and building unsustainable debt across credit cards, and simplified how interest is calculated. We have implemented funds for Australian regional transport. We have moved to establish a crowdsourced equity funding regime to allow new businesses to get access to funding in new and innovative ways. We have introduced industry funding for ASIC through levies and fees for regulatory activities. We are also looking to strengthen protection for whistleblowers who expose corporate and tax misconduct. We have enhanced ASIC's ability to attract and retain the best staff by removing ASIC employees from the Public Service Act.


There is also the relaxation of the legislative 15 per cent ownership cap as well as establishing a streamlined approval path for recent entrants so as to reduce barriers to innovative new fin-techs in the banking sector. There is extending the crowdsourced equity funding regime to propriety companies to help smaller financial institutions to grow and become more significant players in the banking sector. We're improving superannuation accountability and member outcomes, including strengthening regulator powers, improving disclosure, removing restrictions on choice of funds and lifting governance standards.


We're also moving to protect individual superannuation savings from disproportionately high fees and insurance premiums and empowering the ATO to reunite people with their lost and inactive super. This is a strong track record of delivering positive outcomes in the financial services space particularly and, obviously, in tax integrity. Making sure that all parts of the economy pay the correct amount of tax through tax integrity measures is vitally important. We've already taken significant action on this, particularly as regards multinationals, and that is, in part, what the bill in front of us goes to.


Schedule 1 of this bill toughens the multinational anti-avoidance law—the MAAL law. This schedule makes technical amendments to ensure that the multinational anti-avoidance law operates as it was intended to. As a result of this amendment, multinationals will no longer be able to use corporate structures with foreign trusts and partnerships to avoid the application of the multinational anti-avoidance law. These changes were announced in last year's budget. The government is committed to ensuring that multinational entities pay their fair share of tax. The OECD estimated that, globally, between $100 billion and $240 billion of corporate tax revenues is lost annually due to base erosion and profit-shifting strategies used by multinationals. As part of the global effort to combat multinational tax avoidance, the OECD/G20 Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Project has delivered a number of recommendations to strengthen tax integrity rules and ensure that the international tax system works as intended.


Since 2015, Australia has implemented a range of such actions. The government has also taken action on multinational tax avoidance beyond the OECD recommendations, including implementing the multinational anti-avoidance law and the diverted profits tax, both of which discourage large multinationals from artificially diverting profits offshore. The multinational anti-avoidance law took effect from 1 January 2016 and prevents multinationals from escaping Australian tax by using artificial or contrived arrangements to avoid having a taxable presence in Australia. The ATO has observed a significant change in how multinational companies are approaching their Australian tax obligations as a result of the tough new anti-avoidance laws put in place by this government. The ATO estimates more than $7 billion in sales revenue annually is already being added to the Australian tax base as a result of these changes. Thirty-eight multinational entities have changed, or are in the process of changing, their tax affairs to bring their Australian source sales back onshore in compliance with the multinational anti-avoidance law, including Google and Facebook. Obviously, taxing these large multinationals with innovative models of doing business—the way they're structured and the way their businesses operate—is different to what the tax system was used to dealing with. So it's important that, as the business environment changes, governments are responsive enough to change the tax environment with it to ensure that everyone does pay their fair share of tax.


Schedule 2 improves the integrity of the small-business capital gains tax concessions. In the 2017-18 budget the government announced that it would improve integrity and ensure that the small-business capital gains tax concessions are appropriately targeted. The goal was to ensure that the concessions continue to benefit those who need them most—hardworking small businesses. The proposed amendments will mean the small-business capital gains tax concessions can only be accessed in relation to assets used in a small business or ownership interests in a small business.


The government is committed to supporting small businesses through tax cuts and initiatives such as the $20,000 instant asset write-off, which was extended in last year's budget for a further 12 months to 30 June 2018. The small-business capital gains tax concessions assist owners of small businesses by providing relief from capital gains tax on the disposal of assets related to their business. This helps them to reinvest and grow as well as to contribute to their retirement savings through the sale of the business. The concessions themselves are not changing and will be available to genuine small-business taxpayers with an aggregated turnover of less than $2 million or business assets less than $6 million.


Key features of the new law include: a limitation on the size of the company or trust being disposed of, to ensure that it is a genuine small business; clarifying that a taxpayer is required to be a small business entity at the time they dispose of their interests in the company or trust, to ensure that taxpayers do not benefit from the concession where the relevant business activities are too remote; and modifying the active asset test so that it looks through shares to companies or interests in trusts to the activities and assets of the underlying entities. That prevents the concessions from being available when most of the value of the company or trust is unrelated to small-business activity. Additional integrity rules also apply to ensure that the new tests cannot be manipulated or avoided.


Schedule 3 of the bill covers amendments to the fin-tech and venture capital arrangements. This delivers on a key commitment in the government's fin-tech statement, removing ambiguity from the tax law and clarifying that early stage venture capital limited partnerships can invest in Australian fin-tech businesses. This bill builds on the government's $1.1 billion National Innovation and Science Agenda and highlights our commitment to support innovative businesses in Australia and build a culture of entrepreneurship and risk-taking. It will improve access to venture capital for fin-tech start-ups and assist these businesses to grow and succeed. I certainly know that in my home state of WA we are seeing a lot of very exciting developments in these kinds of spaces where venture capital and financial tech firms are seeking to access and innovate based on new technologies—things like blockchain, which many of us have heard about and probably not very many of us understand. Giving these businesses the opportunity to invest, take a risk and build a business that hasn't existed in the past are things this government very much supports.


Schedule 4 covers the tax exemption for payments under the Defence Force Ombudsman scheme. This commends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to continue to exempt from income tax payments made as reparations to victims of abuse in the Australian Defence Force. Unlike compensation, a reparation payment represents an acknowledgement by Defence that the abuse suffered by the complainants was wrong, that it can have a lasting a serious impact and that, in the past, Defence was not positioned appropriately to respond to that abuse in many cases. The recipient of a reparation payment should receive the full benefit of that payment and, as such, the payment should be exempt from income tax. Previous reparations made under the former Defence Abuse Response Taskforce were tax exempt. The task force concluded on 31 August 2016 and, in the 2017-18 budget, the government announced it was expanding the Defence Force Ombudsman role to make recommendations on reparation payments in relation to complaints of abuse in Defence. The Defence Force Ombudsman may make recommendations on historical cases of abuse occurring on or before 30 June 2014.


Obviously, just as we want those who should pay their correct amount of tax to do so, we don't want people who are receiving a payment from the government to have to pay tax where it is inappropriate for tax to be paid. A reparation payment of this sort to victims of abuse in the Australian Defence Force falls into that category. We want to collect tax from those who should pay it and we don't want to be taxing those who shouldn't. In that way, we'll be able to keep our tax system as fair as we can and only claim the minimal amount of tax we need to deliver those essential services that Australians want and need and not a penny more.


The government has also announced a number of other significant reforms in this area. Again, we see that this is a government getting on with the job of delivering for all Australians. It announced reforms including increasing the civil and criminal penalties for financial misconduct—the most significant increases for the maximum civil penalties in many cases in more than 20 years. These include criminal penalties for individuals of up to 10 years imprisonment and, for corporations, criminal penalties the larger of $9.45 million, three times the benefit or 10 per cent of annual turnover. So there are significant increases in the potential penalties that will be faced both by individuals and corporations. Other reforms announced include imposing design and distribution obligations to ensure products sold by financial institutions are designed for and marketed to an identified target market to minimise the likelihood of consumers purchasing unsuitable products. Also announced was a product intervention power for ASIC to enable the regulator to intervene where products could pose significant consumer harm. Obviously, we want a system where people understand what they are purchasing and purchase things that are appropriate for their financial circumstances. The more information we have in the marketplace about these products, the more informed decisions consumers can make.


We've announced a move to extend unfair contract term protections to insurance contracts. We've also announced further reforms to combat illegal phoenixing activity. Phoenixing is the activity where a business closes down and restarts pretty much on the same day and in the same premises. We've also allowed the early release of superannuation rules on compassionate grounds and financial hardship grounds. The government has also recently increased ASIC's funding by $70 million to equip it with the resources and powers it needs. We need to detect, deter and punish those who do the wrong thing. We need to ensure that all companies pay the correct amount of tax under the law. In that way, we can keep taxes as low as possible for everybody.

 (South Australia) (10:36):  The Australian economy needs entrepreneurs. The parliament should foster an entrepreneurial spirit and give a fair go to those who are weighing up the risks of starting a business. Entrepreneurs are prepared to take risks to be successful and drive the economy. Entrepreneurs and small businesses should be supported and given confidence to invest and grow—for example, in collaborative structures with other businesses. We should not punish those entrepreneurs who worked hard in small businesses and made substantial contributions to Australia's economy in the process. It is unfortunate that that will be a consequence of Treasury Laws Amendment (Tax Integrity and Other Measures) Bill 2018 as currently drafted. I will return to that in a moment.


The new rules would act as a disincentive to growth, hurting thousands of small businesses—the very people our Prime Minister says are the engine of economic growth and jobs. Whilst I agree with the intention of the bill—that big businesses and wealthy individuals should not be able to access tax concessions designed to help small businesses grow—the bill also unintentionally smuggles in policy by stealth. It's actually misleading to suggest that these changes are merely an integrity measure. No-one wants to see loopholes in the law erode the tax base, but this legislation does appear to have adverse consequences for some small-business people who deserve support to grow and be successful.


The fact is that there are genuine small-business people who will no longer be able to claim appropriate tax relief as a result of this bill. I've had numerous consultations with business groups, in particular with Business SA, on this issue. They have cited that many of their members now face capital gains tax of hundreds of thousands of dollars each when they sell their share in their businesses, which can often be their entire retirement nest egg. The amendment I will seek to have passed will remedy that concern by making the new restrictions only apply to taxpayers who have significant other wealth, not to genuine small-business people who have worked hard to grow a business and employ Australians along the way.


At the same time as we debate these issues, a review is taking place by the Board of Taxation that will provide recommendations into precisely the issues being put forward in the bill. That review will:


… identify ways to improve small business tax concessions to ensure they remain effective, easily accessible, and well-targeted. … including how the small business tax concessions complement retirement savings policy.


It makes no sense to me that we would rush this bill through the Senate before that analysis is made available next month. The Senate could make an informed decision.


The Prime Minister has declared, as the benchmark for his administration, that he will give 'a fair go to those prepared to have a go'. According to Business SA, there are thousands of people in South Australia alone who have demonstrably had a go, who are inadvertently affected by this bill as it currently stands. Through their enterprises they have built businesses, employed South Australians and contributed to the prosperity of the state. What they now face, should this legislation be passed as currently drafted, is anything but a fair go. I urge the Senate to support the amendment I will be proposing or, at the very least, to delay passage of the bill until proper consideration can be made and consultations with stakeholders are held, in particular in reference to the Board of Taxation recommendations, to ensure that people who have made a lifetime contribution to the economy do not suffer the unintended consequences of this legislation.

"Stoker, Sen Amanda",LP,2018-09-20,"



Senator STOKER
 (Queensland) (10:40):  I rise to speak in support of the Treasury Laws Amendment (Tax Integrity and Other Measures) Bill 2018. We on this side of the chamber believe in lower taxes and in entrepreneurship. We believe in the hard work and aspiration of everyday Australians who want to get ahead. We know that lower taxes and more entrepreneurship are good for the economy, good for jobs and good for innovation. That's why this government has committed to and has delivered tax relief for small and medium-sized businesses, as well as for working families, through reductions in company and personal income tax.


This agenda of lowering taxes is working. Australia's unemployment rate is at 5.3 per cent, the lowest level since the peak of the mining boom. Well over one million jobs have been created since the coalition government was elected five years ago, and we have the strongest economic growth in the OECD. But, while we firmly believe that taxes should be low, we also believe that taxes must be paid. That's why this government has legislated a range of measures to combat multinational tax avoidance. They include a diverted profits tax; the establishment of a tax avoidance task force; strengthened international transfer pricing rules; increased penalties for multinationals who engage in profit shifting; and new whistleblower protections. The Australian Taxation Office expects that an additional $7 billion in sales revenue each year will be returned to the Australian tax base because of these reforms. The actions already taken by the government show its firm belief that while taxes should be low, they must also be paid.


This bill continues to deliver on the goal by further cracking down on multinational tax avoidance while, at the same time, providing tax relief for both innovative venture capital investors and Australian Defence Force personnel who receive reparations. For instance, schedule 4 amends the Income Tax Assessment Act to exempt payments made as reparation to victims of abuse in the Australian Defence Force. This will ensure that payments that are made as reparations to these victims will be exempt from income tax. The government previously made similar payments to victims of abuse in the ADF through the Defence Abuse Response Taskforce. The task force administered reparation payments of up to $50,000 to complainants who likely suffered sexual or other abuse by a member of Defence. These payments were specifically exempted from income tax because there was a possibility that the payments could be seen as arising from employment with Defence and understood, were it not for this legislation, to be income in the hands of the recipient.


The task force concluded on 31 August 2016. However, this bill will ensure that the important work it carried out is continued by expanding the role of the Defence Force Ombudsman to include the ability to make recommendations for reparation payments, which the government has already provided some $19.5 million to deal with. From now on, these reparation payments will be made on the recommendation of the Defence Force Ombudsman and will be exempt from income tax. This is because the government believes that the recipient of a payment of this kind should receive the full benefit of it, particularly the men and women who so honourably serve and protect our country in our Australian defence forces.


Furthermore, the government is committed to encouraging innovation and entrepreneurship through the Australian economy. Key to this is fostering competition. We know that greater competition leads to greater innovation, and that's what grows economies and creates jobs and wealth for their citizens.


While Australia has a sophisticated financial sector underpinned by a strong regulatory system, our financial services are at risk of becoming uncompetitive if they fail to keep pace with technological disruption and the global change in this field. That's why the government has already introduced new tax incentives for early-stage venture capital investors in relation to investments in financial technology, as a part of the $1.1 billion National Innovation and Science Agenda. This is an important step in ensuring the competitiveness of the fintech sector, as venture capital is a vital mechanism for financing new innovative enterprises at the start-up and early expansion stages of their commercialisation. Venture capitalists invest funds in such enterprises in return for an equity share or the equivalent of partial ownership. The funds provided to the enterprise are used to develop their ideas in the early stages of development and ensure early-stage commercial viability. These tax concessions support high-risk fintech businesses at the start-up and early expansion stages where it would otherwise be difficult to attract investment using normal commercial means.


The fintech sector is a largely new industry composed of companies that use technology to make financial services more efficient. These innovators are harnessing technology to deliver services in more relevant and convenient ways to Australian businesses and consumers. In a recent study, Fintech in Australia—trends, forecasts and analysis 2015–2020, research firm Frost & Sullivan says the Australian fintech sector is poised to contribute $3 billion of new revenue to the Australian financial services sector by 2020, while it is also estimated that fintech investment reached US$20 billion in 2015. It's clear that developing our fintech industry here will not only drive expansion and growth in our financial exports but will also deliver benefits to Australians through new services that will create value or bring efficiencies and convenience to the market. Indeed, with our financial services sector being the largest contributor to the financial economy, advancements in research and development represent a crucial opportunity for innovation in a key services sector of our growing economy.


However, current uncertainties about tax concessions have restricted the access of the fintech sector to venture capital investment, which could potentially create stagnation if it's not dealt with in this vital sector of the economy. So schedule 3 of this bill amends the Income Tax Assessment Act to ensure that the venture capital tax concessions are available for investments in fintech businesses. This clarification means that early-stage venture capital partnerships can receive tax concessions when they invest in new fintech businesses that are developing new technology, including using technology that might already exist but in a new and novel way. The removal of ambiguity from the tax law will help to foster a culture of entrepreneurship and encourage the necessary early-stage risk-taking while improving access to capital for Australian business to ensure that they grow and succeed. Innovation and Science Australia will be enabled to make public and private findings on the eligibility of investments, while banks that split their obligations in order to receive the benefits of the tax concessions, should they choose to take that path, will be excluded under anti-avoidance rules.


While Labor is promising a $200 billion tax increase across the Australian economy, the government is creating an environment to make Australia's fintech sector more internationally competitive through lower taxes. While we want lower taxes, as I said before, we're also serious about compliance. If taxes are due, they have to be paid, and that's why we're committed to ensuring that multinational entities pay their fair share of tax. The OECD has estimated that, globally, between US$100 billion and US$240 billion of corporate tax revenue is lost annually due to base erosion and profit-shifting strategies.


Some multinationals artificially structure their company to avoid Australian tax by booking revenue from Australian sales offshore. When that happens, they have an unfair advantage as against local businesses, families and small businesses, who have no choice about where they pay their tax and are inevitably left to shoulder more of the tax burden when those who are multinationals don't bear their share. Our already implemented multinational anti-avoidance laws allow the Commissioner of Taxation to treat the multinationals as though they have a taxable presence in Australia and were subject to Australian tax on their Australian income. As a result, 38 multinational corporations have changed or are in the process of changing their tax affairs to bring their Australian-sourced sales back onshore, including businesses like Google and Facebook.


However, the Australian Taxation Office has identified that certain partnership arrangements have been designed to avoid these laws. The bill will ensure that the original laws operate as intended. For example, schedule 1 of the bill toughens our multinational anti-avoidance laws by ensuring corporate structures involving foreign trusts and partnerships are subject to the law. This measure involves a technical amendment to prevent large multinationals from avoiding the application of the anti-avoidance laws by interposing partnerships that have foreign resident partners, trusts that have foreign resident trustees or beneficiaries, or foreign trusts that temporarily have their central management and control in Australia. This will continue to ensure fairness in this sector. Importantly, this measure will not negatively impact on investment by multinationals in Australia, as the measure is targeted towards those that attempt to avoid being subject to anti-avoidance laws by manipulating a certain target structure.


Furthermore, the government believe in and are committed to supporting small and family business. That's why we have consistently delivered support to small businesses through the life of this government. Whether that's initiatives such as the $20,000 instant asset write-off or company tax reductions for small and medium-sized businesses—which I believe the Labor Party have a policy to take away if they're successful at the next election—this government stands side by side with small businesses every day of the week. I'm glad to see that Prime Minister Scott Morrison has dedicated a minister for small and family business to his cabinet table.


Small businesses can also attract capital gains tax concessions to assist owners by providing relief from capital gains tax when they dispose of assets related to their business. This helps them to reinvest, to grow, to employ more Australians and to contribute to their own retirement savings. However, it is important to the integrity of our tax system that these capital gains tax concessions are appropriately targeted. We want to ensure that the concessions continue to benefit those who need them most—hardworking small and family businesses.


Unfortunately some taxpayers are currently able to access the small business capital gains concessions for assets that are unrelated to their small business. For example, it's possible to arrange one's affairs so that ownership interests in larger businesses don't count towards the tests for determining eligibility for the concession. So schedule 2 of the bill tries to deal with that, improving the integrity of these concessions. The concessions themselves aren't changing, and they'll continue to be available to genuine small business taxpayers. The proposed amendments will mean the small business capital gains tax concessions can only be accessed in relation to assets that are used in a small business or for ownership interests in a small business.


Key features of this new law will include a limitation on the size of the company or trust being disposed of to ensure that it is genuinely a small business in the Australian market, and clarifying that a taxpayer is required to be a small business entity at the time they dispose of their interest in the company or trust. This ensures taxpayers don't benefit from the concession where the relevant business activities are too remote. It will involve modifying the active asset test so that it looks through shares in companies or interests in trusts to the activities and assets of the underlying entities. This prevents concessions from being available where most of the value of the company or trust is in fact unrelated to small business activities.


This bill is just another example of how the Liberal-National government is taking action in a space where Labor failed to do so. While those on the other side love to talk about multinational corporations and tax integrity, it's been the Liberal-National government who has taken action to tackle multinational tax avoidance every day of the week. In doing so, it enables us to lower taxes for all Australians. I support this bill because it will ensure a more effective and targeted tax system while continuing our agenda of providing tax relief, equipping us to reduce more taxes for more Australians.

"Hume, Sen Jane",LP,2018-09-20,"



Senator HUME
 (Victoria—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (10:55):  I rise today to speak on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Tax Integrity and Other Measures) Bill 2018. It is, indeed, an honour and a privilege to be able to speak on yet another treasury laws amendment bill that has been introduced in this place, for this is an area in which the Morrison coalition government and both the Turnbull and Abbott governments before have given considerable thought and have taken action that has actually made a considerable difference to the budget bottom line.


Before I begin my remarks, I'd like to acknowledge the good work of the Commissioner of Taxation, Chris Jordan, who has, within nearly five years in the role, made a significant impact on the ATO, on its operations, on its personnel and also, particularly, on its approach to collecting tax revenue on behalf of the government. You would know, Acting Deputy President Marshall, that the Liberal-National coalition will always be a government of lower taxes. The Liberal Party in particular prides themselves on being a party that values lower taxes and that wants to keep more of what you earn in your pockets. But, at the same time, we are committed to ensuring that those who do earn income in Australia pay their fair share of tax in Australia.


Commissioner Chris Jordan is equally committed to that cause. He is certainly a man that does not take tax avoidance or tax evasion lightly. In fact, at the last Senate estimates he revealed that, particularly in the area of multinational tax avoidance, the new measures that this government have taken, whether it be through the diverted profits tax or the multinational anti-avoidance legislation, have already netted around $5 billion in additional revenue to the ATO and therefore to the budget bottom line. In fact, the ATO said that about 70 companies were being looked at very closely under that multinational anti-avoidance legislation because they were deemed to have a medium to high risk of avoiding a taxable presence in Australia and that 25 companies—I think this was nearly a year ago—had already started to restructure to fall in line with the multinational anti-avoidance legislation. That was because of the tough stance that Commissioner Jordan and the ATO had taken, backed by the federal government's multinational anti-avoidance law.


Microsoft, for example, had previously booked revenue for many of its sales in Australia in low-tax Singapore. But about 12 or so months ago it reached a settlement with the ATO under which it would book a much higher proportion of sales and therefore tax in Australia. Mr Jordan had said that this crackdown on foreign multinationals had very quickly achieved the desired results. As I said, in the 16 months until the end of October—and that was last year—it had flushed out retrospective tax liabilities of more than $5 billion from a swag of global giants operating in Australia. Nearly $1 billion of that was raised in four months alone. Of course, this came ahead of the imminent launches of companies like the retail giant Amazon in Australia, which would have walked into the Australian market with a completely different understanding of its obligations to pay tax in this country than if it had come into the market only 12 or 18 months beforehand. Google is another one of the companies that is targeted. In fact, the Multinational Anti-Avoidance Law and the diverted profits tax were dubbed the 'Google tax'. Facebook, of course, is the other one. It was particularly targeting those very large and quite opaque international companies. In fact, Mr Jordan said that they had an 'intellectual might' associated with them. And prior to this particular piece of legislation, those companies had attempted to intimidate the ATO to some extent to give them lower tax assessments. Mr Jordan noted that some of those multinationals attempted to bamboozle him and bamboozle ATO officials with financial fairytales and they tried to intellectually browbeat the ATO with great big piles of reports and spaghetti diagrams on white boards saying things like, 'Look, we have the greatest experts in the world.'




Senator Cameron:
  Not the dreaded whiteboard!




Senator HUME:
  Yes, the dreaded whiteboards, Senator Cameron. The world's greatest experts would say, 'This particular tax structure works. Who are you at the ATO to challenge us?' So Mr Jordan, applying these new multinational anti-avoidance laws and also the diverted profits tax, made sure his officials weren't boxed into a corner by the technical analysis and the intellectual might and legal and financial power of these very large companies. He has done so particularly successfully because he is as committed as the coalition to these companies paying the right amount of tax on profits that are earned in Australia.


Schedule 1 of this particular legislation toughens those Multinational Anti-Avoidance Law that has been so successful over the term of this government. The first schedule of the bill amends the Income Tax Assessment Act to improve the integrity of the Multinational Anti-Avoidance Law, the MAAL. Currently large multinationals can avoid the operation of that Multinational Anti-Avoidance Law by putting certain kinds of partnerships and trusts between the global entity and the consumer. The kinds of partnerships that are used are those that have foreign resident partners or foreign resident trustees or beneficiaries or are foreign resident trusts that can temporarily have central management and control in Australia. You can see how complicated those sorts of spaghetti diagrams on a whiteboard would be, which is why it's so important to dethatch the complexities of the tax arrangements of these companies. The use of these sorts of structures contravenes the original policy intent of the Multinational Anti-Avoidance Law, so this particular bill that we have before us in the chamber today ensures that the Multinational Anti-Avoidance Law acts as it was originally intended.


You may recall that the original anti-avoidance laws were enacted in December 2017 to prevent those very large multinationals from avoiding the tax on their Australian business profits by artificially structuring their affairs in a way that results in them not having to have that taxable presence in Australia. As I said earlier, since that legislation was enacted on January 12016, it has been highly effective and highly beneficial. It has achieved a significant intake of tax to the ATO and therefore to the budget bottom line.


On 15 December 2016, the ATO published its concerns with certain restructures involving those foreign partnerships undertaken in response to the implementation of the multinational anti-avoidance legislation, so this was like a post-implementation review. It was entirely appropriate that the ATO, which implements this particular piece of legislation, should review its efficacy. And while the ATO said it is highly effective and will achieve its objectives, it does have some tweaking where there potentially are loopholes remaining.


This particular bill affects the large multinationals that fall within the scope of the multinational anti-avoidance legislation. In general those entities have a global income of more than $1 billion, so we're certainly not dealing with the small end of town here. As to the date of effect, the schedule will apply from 1 January 2016, which of courses is the original date of the effect of the multinational anti-avoidance legislation. There has been public consultation—a public consultation paper was released on 12 February 2018—and the Treasurer received a number of submissions from groups as diverse as Deloitte, the Tax Justice Network and the Australian Retailers Association. There was a general consensus of support for the proposed amendments to this bill, and Deloitte in fact also provided some minor technical amendments to the exposure draft legislation. The financial impact of this is estimated to be unquantifiable, but it will result in a gain to revenue over the period 2017-18 to 2020-21.


Schedule 2 is about improving the integrity of the small-business capital gains tax concessions. It gives effect to the 2017-18 budget announcement that the government would amend the small-business capital gains tax concessions to ensure that they could only be accessed in relation to assets used in a small business or ownership interests in a small business so that the capital gains tax concessions that are available are only used and accessed appropriately. The object of those small-business capital gains tax concessions is to provide relief from capital gains tax on the disposal of assets related to a small business. Currently the problem, of course, is that some taxpayers are able to access those concessions for assets which are entirely unrelated to their small business. For example, they can arrange their affairs so that their ownership interests in larger businesses do not count towards the tests for determining eligibility for these concessions. As of 1 July last year, additional basic conditions have to be satisfied to ensure that small-business capital gains tax concessions are only available to genuine small businesses. This includes testing the size of the company or the trust that is being disposed of to raise that capital gain.


The proposed amendments tighten the eligibility criteria for the small-business capital gains tax concessions and ensure that they are better targeted to those to whom it is relevant. The concessions themselves, it should be noted, are not changing; they will continue to be available to genuine small-business taxpayers with an aggregated turnover of less than $2 million or business assets of less than $6 million. The intention here is that the measure will apply retrospectively from 1 July 2017, and the application is consistent with the budget announcement on 9 May 2017 about ensuring that those concessions can only be accessed in relation to the assets used in a small business or ownership interests in a small business. As you can see, this is little more than an integrity measure to shore up measures that have already been put into place. There was public consultation on this particular legislation as well. The accompanying explanatory material was circulated in February this year, and feedback from the consultation has been incorporated into the final drafting of the bill. While it's hard to quantify the financial gain that will inevitably come from this particular measure, again, it will be over the forward estimates period.


There is a further schedule around fin-tech and venture capital amendments—schedule 3. This is a particularly important amendment for my home state of Victoria, where the fin-tech industry is booming. Schedule 3 of this bill amends the Income Tax Assessment Act to clarify that early-stage venture capital limited partnerships, also known as ESVCLPs—rather a mouthful—and venture capital limited partnerships, VCLPs, can make investments in fin-tech firms. This will ensure that fin-tech businesses have better access to the capital that they need to grow and succeed.


This is part of a suite of financing alternatives that the coalition government, the National-Liberal Morrison coalition government, have been putting together for some time. You will recall that last week we discussed crowdsourced funding arrangements. Not that long ago, we established the ASIC sandbox to allow fintechs to operate temporarily without a full financial licence to see whether their businesses are viable. This is all part of the suite of laws that allow fintechs the best chance of getting established, growing and thriving in this country. It is a new industry and a very exciting industry that's growing not just in Australia but worldwide. It's very important that we compete for the best and brightest minds in this space.


The government is clearly committed to encouraging innovation throughout the Australian economy. To this end the $1.1 billion National Innovation and Science Agenda, NISA, was announced, you will recall, in December 2015. It included enhanced tax concessions for these early-stage venture capital limited partnerships and also for venture capital limited partnerships. These particular programs encourage venture capital investment in Australian start-ups, providing these businesses with the funds that they need to grow and to prosper. This particular schedule will clarify that early-stage venture capital limited partnerships and also venture capital limited partnerships can invest in fintech businesses that are developing the new technology, including using technology in a novel way, such as through developing new products and services, by removing the ambiguity from the tax law and also providing certainty for venture capital investors. The amendments outlined in schedule 3 will impact both investors and participants in early-stage venture capital limited partnerships and also venture capital limited partnerships regimes.


The amendments are supported by stakeholders and will provide particular benefit to venture capital investors in fintech businesses, providing certainty that they can invest in fintech, and it will also benefit the fintech businesses themselves as they will have better access to improved venture capital funding as a result of these changes. The fintech amendment was announced as part of the Treasurer's fintech statement, which was released in March 2016. The Treasury conducted an initial public consultation into this particular bill, on the amendments in schedule 3, and received a number of responses from key stakeholders, including the Australian Private Equity and Venture Capital Association, some law firms, some accounting firms and Innovation and Science Australia. The consultation process started in October last year and concluded in November. Following that particular consultation process, the Treasury worked with the stakeholders, the Department of Industry, Innovation and Science, Innovation and Science Australia, AusIndustry and the ATO to refine the current bill to reflect a number of the suggestions made by stakeholders. I should mention that those stakeholders were broadly very supportive of the changes that were being made to fintechs. The financial impact of these changes is hard to quantify, but it's all about having the right policy settings to allow these particular firms, fintech firms—this growing industry—to grow, thrive and prosper.


There is another schedule to this particular legislation, schedule 4, which is about tax exemptions for payments made under the Defence Force Ombudsman scheme. This is to exempt from income tax payments the reparations to victims of abuse in the Australian Defence Force. That is very important. The government previously made similar payments to victims of abuse in the Australian Defence Force through the Defence Abuse Response Taskforce. The taskforce administered reparation payments of up to $50,000 through the Defence Abuse Reparation Scheme to complainants who likely suffered sexual and other abuse by a member of Defence. These payments were specifically exempted from income tax as there was a possibility that the payment could be seen to arise from employment with Defence and considered income in the hands of the recipient. The task force concluded on 31 August 2016 and assessed any abuse that occurred prior to 11 April 2011.


In the budget this year the government announced that it would continue the existing functions of the Defence Force Ombudsman and expand its role to include the ability to make recommendations for reparation payments. The government announced that it would provide $19.5 million over four years from 2017-18 for the reparation payments. The previous functions that were undertaken by the task force and the scheme are effectively being replicated and will now be executed by the Defence Force Ombudsman. It affects only the victims of abuse in the Australian Defence Force who receive reparation payments.


The Treasury Laws Amendment (Tax Integrity and Other Measures) Bill 2018 covers a number of quite diverse areas, all of which are important, and I commend this bill to the Senate.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,4,2,speech
"Seselja, Sen Zed",LP,2018-09-20,"



Senator SESELJA
 (Australian Capital Territory—Assistant Minister for Treasury and Finance) (11:15):  I want to very much thank senators for their contributions and for their support for what is a very, very important bill, the Treasury Laws Amendment (Tax Integrity and Other Measures) Bill 2018, as I think was so eloquently outlined by Senator Hume and others.


I want to go through a couple of the key elements of the bill before summing up. Schedule 1 of the bill strengthens the integrity of the Multinational Anti-Avoidance Law and ensures that it operates as intended. This amendment will further deliver on what has been a very tough stance from this Liberal-National government against multinational tax avoidance, as demonstrated by the successive measures implemented in recent years to ensure that multinationals pay their fair share of tax in Australia.


Unlike the opposition, the Labor Party, who have talked a big game in opposition on multinational tax avoidance, this is something that we deliver on in government. We deliver on it as a principled position for a number of reasons. We deliver on it because, by having everyone pay their fair share, by ensuring that large multinationals can't profit-shift offshore, by having them pay their fair share, Australian taxpayers—the hardworking men and women who are working hard every day and paying a lot of income tax or those who are building up their small and medium enterprises and paying their fair share of tax—can rely on services to be delivered by the Australian government. The way that we can do that, while growing the economy and putting the budget back into balance, is to have everyone pay their fair share. So, as a matter of principle, we have a stance that says multinationals must pay their fair share. Schedule 1, by strengthening the integrity of the Multinational Anti-Avoidance Law, ensures that we get fairness in the system.


If you look at the budget measures we have undertaken and the approach that the coalition has taken to economic policy, you see that these are always built on those pillars. We do everything we can to grow the economy. We grow the economy by lowering taxes, whether that's by getting rid of things like the mining tax and the carbon tax, whether that's by lowering people's electricity bills, whether that is by lowering income tax for hardworking taxpayers, whether that's by lowering taxes for small business so they can grow their business and employ more Australians, or whether that's by getting rid of red tape—as we have done every year since we came into government. All of that has helped Australians who are having a go to do better and has helped our economy to thrive.


We've put in place measures, such as our free trade agreements, which deliver more economic activity and more jobs into the Australian economy and help get spending under control. We have shown in every budget, successive budgets, that, by limiting the growth of spending, we will be able to get the budget back into balance next year—all the while cutting taxes for small business; all the while cutting taxes for low- and middle-income earners; and all the while being able to deliver record investment in really important areas such as defence, health, education, infrastructure and a range of other very important areas.


This has been our economic approach, and getting multinationals to pay their fair share is part of those integrity measures. We've had integrity measures in other parts of the system. We've moved a record number of people from welfare into work. We've had those people who have been rorting the welfare system taken off the welfare system so that those who need it because they're doing it tough for various reasons have access to it and so we can deliver on things like the NDIS. This has been at the heart of what we've done. We don't just talk about it; we get it done.


Schedule 2 of this bill amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to give effect to the government's 2017-18 budget announcement. It will improve integrity and better target the small-business capital gains tax concessions. Again, making sure there's integrity in the system ensures that we can continue to deliver tax relief for small businesses, as opposed to the Labor Party who wants to up taxes for small and medium enterprises. It allows us to deliver that income tax relief and it allows us to deliver the services that Australians expect and Australians want their government to be able to deliver.


These amendments are designed to ensure that the concessions can only be accessed in relation to assets used in a small business or ownership interests in a small business. Why is this important? It's because the amendments introduce a test on the size of the business being disposed of to prevent inappropriate access to the concessions for assets unrelated to a small business, so it brings them in. This ensures that these important concessions continue to benefit those who need them most—and that's hardworking small businesses. Any number of measures that we put in place to support small business is because we know that these are hardworking Australians and these are hardworking men and women who put their capital on the line, who often put their house on the line, who often work 50-, 60- or 70-hour weeks, and who often have a family business where everyone contributes. At every turn, the Liberal-National government seeks to make things a little bit easier for those hardworking men and women. It says to them, 'We'll lower your tax burden, we'll lower the amount of red tape, we'll work hard to lower your energy bills, we'll build a framework of a strong economy through free trade and other things, and we'll control our own spending so that you're not burdened with excessive taxes down the track and so we can deliver the infrastructure and the services that are necessary for you to thrive.'


The government is committed to establishing Australia as a leading global financial technology, or fintech, hub. This is a major area of potential growth. Schedule 3 of this bill builds on this work. It builds on the work of our government to ensure that we have the right policy settings in place to foster innovation. This has been a key focus of our government, and one of the reasons it's a key focus of our government is because we know that Australians have some of the best examples of innovation, invention, and research and development in the world. But, because of some of the challenges in getting capital, we haven't always been able to fully exploit and build on those great innovations and that great entrepreneurship that exists and is in the DNA of the Australian people. We see it as a partnership and a way of assisting businesses and entrepreneurs who come up with those amazing ideas to then be able to get the capital that they need so that they can then employ people, grow their businesses, have profitable businesses, reinvest in those businesses, employ more people, grow our economy and provide the opportunities that we want to see for Australian men and women as they come into the workforce and as they stay in the workforce.


Schedule 3, to that end, amends the early-stage venture capital limited partnership, the venture capital limited partnership and tax incentives for early-stage investor regimes of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997. What this does is it clarifies that early-stage venture capital limited partnerships and venture capital limited partnerships can invest in innovative fintech businesses, removes ambiguity from the tax law and provides certainty for venture capital investors.


As I said earlier, we've got extraordinary entrepreneurs. If you go to our universities and many of our small businesses, and if you meet our scientists who are coming up with the research and development, the ideas and the great technological breakthroughs, we invest so much. We've got a great record as a government in things like the Medical Research Future Fund. That is one area of extraordinary innovation that will see jobs grow and, just as importantly, will save lives. It will see Australians living longer and living healthier lives through medical research. We think there is a major economic advantage in that as well as people live longer lives and as we develop these products and sell them to the world.


We've got these extraordinary scientists and innovators, and we want to bring more capital behind them so that they can indeed have the opportunity to develop those products. Instead of people having to go offshore in order to fully develop their ideas and their products, as has unfortunately happened in many cases in the past, we want them developing here. We're seeing more of that. We're seeing that with collaborations in partnerships between our research organisations and our universities. We do it with things like CRCs. One of the innovations we have brought in is the CRCPs, which is a great addition to the cooperative research centres. The cooperative research centres are a way of bringing all those entities together. It is world-leading. The CRCPs are shorter-term and more focused. The industry response—I had responsibility in that area—has been very positive. We're able to do things again in a slightly quicker and a more innovative way, and do some of those shorter-term smaller projects which can still have absolutely substantial benefits.


As I said, this will clarify those early stage venture capital limited partnerships—and venture capital limited partnerships can invest in innovative fintech businesses—and it remove ambiguity from the tax law. That is important for attracting that investment. We want to see that investment continuing to come from Australian investors and also from foreign investors in some of our great ideas and backing our entrepreneurs.


This again demonstrates the government's continuing commitment to promoting a culture of entrepreneurship and risk-taking in Australia, and it will help ensure that innovative Australian businesses have access to the capital and expertise that they need to grow and succeed. It works hand in hand with those other aspects of policy that I have outlined. When you allow capital to come in, when you encourage entrepreneurship, when you have those industry partnerships, when you lower taxes for small and medium businesses, when you allow free trade to thrive and when you cut red tape and encourage Australians to get ahead and employ more people, then these things come together in a very positive way—as we are seeing with the record number of jobs that we have created. We very much believe in this.


Going back to the 2017-18 budget, the government announced, on another aspect of this bill, that it would expand the role of the Defence Force Ombudsman to make recommendations for reparation payments. All complains of abuse in Defence made to the Defence Force Ombudsman will now include an assessment for a reparation payment. Previously, similar reparation payments were administered by the Defence Abuse Response Taskforce, which concluded on 31 August 2016. The reparation payments made by the Defence Abuse Response Taskforce were specifically exempt from income tax. This is an important change, and it builds on some of this good work. It's another way of honouring the amazing work that our Defence Force personnel do.


We are committed not just to the defence of our nation but to the health and welfare of our Defence personnel. I think we have learnt a lot in recent years about where we have let them down from time to time as a nation. We have learnt where we can do better. We always strive to make sure that we look after the welfare of those men and women who put their lives on the line for the sake of our nation and our freedom.


In addition, schedule 4 of this bill responds to the government's expansion of the existing functions of the Defence Force Ombudsman. Similar reparation payments were previously administered by the Defence Abuse Response Taskforce, which concluded on 31 August 2016. Reparation payments made by the task force, as I said, were specifically exempt from income tax.


Schedule 4 ensures that the new reparation payments recommended by the Defence Force Ombudsman are exempt from income tax. Reparation payments are not intended to be compensation, and complainants will not be required to release the Commonwealth from liability. These amendments ensure the recipients get the full benefit of such a payment free from the obligation to pay income tax. For all of these reasons, all of those schedules come together for some important reforms. I've outlined a number of the reasons. They build on a number of earlier reforms that the Liberal-National government have been proud to deliver, and I look forward to the hopeful passage of this bill thorough the Senate. I commend this bill to the Senate.

"McKim, Sen Nicholas",AG,2018-09-20,"



Senator McKIM
 (Tasmania) (11:46):  I want to briefly touch on the recommendation of the Selection of Bills Committee in Report No. 11 of 2018 that the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Police Powers at Airports) Bill 2018 not be referred to a committee. What we will get here—I'll make a confident prediction—is that this will end up with the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, which, as we all know, is a closed shop between the two establishment parties in this place. I'll also confidently predict that the committee will ultimately recommend supporting this piece of legislation.


The Australian people and all senators should understand that this bill contains highly coercive powers. It is proposing that Australian Federal Police officers be able to wander up to any person at a designated airport in Australia and say to them, 'Papers, please.' We've seen, historically, what happens when societies go down this route. This is a dangerous piece of legislation. If it's enacted through this parliament, it will join the over 200 pieces of legislation in the last 20 years that have removed fundamental rights, freedoms and liberties in this country. It will be a continuation of the slow shuffle of the major establishment parties, leading this country down the road towards an authoritarian police state. Again, this bill deserves to be examined and should have been recommended for examination by the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee. It should have been subject to significant public hearings and it should have been able to be inquired into through a committee that is transparent and a committee that has a fine record of doing its job with regard to assessing legislation. Instead, it has been referred to a committee that is a closed shop, that no member of the crossbench of this Senate, whether it be Greens senators, Centre Alliance senators or any other senators on the crossbench, has the opportunity to participate in. Once again, we see the closed shop that occurs in the PJCIS that I confidently predict will occur this time.


I believe it's likely that the committee will recommend rasping off a few of the roughest edges of this legislation, because that's often what happens on similar bills, but we will be presented—once again, I confidently predict—with a recommendation to pass the bill. It will pass with the combined LNP-ALP votes through both houses of the parliament, based on a PJCIS recommendation, and it will again remove fundamental rights, freedoms and liberties that many people on the government side of this chamber like to claim they believe in and support, but they can't get together quick enough in the PJCIS to erode those fundamental rights, freedoms and liberties, for which we used to send Australians overseas to fight and die in order to protect and enhance.

(d) recognises that, as a non-nuclear armed nation and a good international citizen, Australia can make a significant contribution to promoting disarmament, the reduction of nuclear stockpiles, and the responsible use of nuclear technology, and has historically done so, including through the Canberra Commission in 1995 and the International Commission on Nuclear Non-Proliferation and Disarmament (ICNND).

Senator RUSTON:
  The Nobel Peace Prize is a singular honour. The Australian government shares with the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons the goal of a world free of nuclear weapons. However, the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons risks undermining the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty of Nuclear Weapons by creating competing obligations. It has nonproliferation safeguard standards weaker than those established under the NPT, and it is vague or silent on verification and enforcement. Australia strongly supports more practical measures for nuclear disarmament, including a fissile material cut-off treaty, the entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and further developing verification processes.

  The Greens absolutely welcome the Nobel Peace Ride riders to Canberra. I look forward to meeting with them hopefully later today. The former Prime Minister of the country may not have had the good grace to congratulate them on this remarkable achievement, but let me say on behalf of the Australian Greens: a huge congratulations to ICAN, a small group of committed activists based in Melbourne who came together and achieved remarkable things. Thank you for all of your hard work. Thank you to those people right across civil society who are working to rid the world once and for all of nuclear weapons. Of course, the best way to say thank you to those people is to unequivocally support Australia signing and ratifying the Nuclear Weapon Ban Treaty. After all, the whole point of the ride is for this place to support that treaty. We support you in your endeavours, and we urge the government and the Labor Party to do the same.

Senator RUSTON:
  The first priority of the government is to keep Australian citizens safe. Noncitizens who commit crimes are subject to visa cancellations and deportations. Since being elected, the government has cancelled the visas of over 3,700 noncitizens on character grounds, including more than 190 bikies, 300 for child sex offences and almost 1,200 people for assault and other violent crimes. Australian citizens who commit crimes including terrorist offences are subject to criminal prosecution. The government has passed legislation to strip the Australian citizenship of dual nationals who commit terrorism or acts contrary to their allegiance to Australia. So far a total of six dual nationals have been stripped of their Australian citizenship.

Senator CHISHOLM:
  Labor has repeatedly called for the Liberal-National government to release the latest data on the home care package waitlist, which is now weeks late. Disappointingly, the minister for aged care delayed the last set of data, March 2018, by more than three months. What is the government trying to hide? The delayed 2018 quarter of data on the home care package waitlist revealed more than 108,000 older Australians are waiting for care. This includes around 88,000 older Australians waiting with high needs, many with dementia. This is now a crisis made under the watch of the Liberal-National government. This government now needs to act and fix the growing waitlist. Labor will support this motion but calls on the Minister for Senior Australians and Aged Care to release this data immediately.

Disappointingly, the minister for aged care delayed the last set of data, March 2018, by more than three months. What is the government trying to hide? The delayed 2018 quarter of data on the home care package waitlist revealed more than 108,000 older Australians are waiting for care. This includes around 88,000 older Australians waiting with high needs, many with dementia. This is now a crisis made under the watch of the Liberal-National government. This government now needs to act and fix the growing waitlist. Labor will support this motion but calls on the Minister for Senior Australians and Aged Care to release this data immediately.

  The Commonwealth government introduced the National Housing and Homelessness Agreement in the 2017-18 budget to provide $1.5 billion annually to support state governments in delivering frontline services. State governments maintain primary responsibility for housing and homelessness initiatives and frontline services.

The PRESIDENT:  Leave is granted for one minute.




Senator FARUQI:
  It is a real shame that this government has failed to commit to any specific targets to reduce homelessness despite such disturbing numbers in the last census, with more than 100,000 people now without a home. People are sleeping rough, have no roof over their head, no bed to sleep in. They're on the streets and on park benches, and this number is up by 20 per cent. Here we have a government that doesn't care about the people they represent because they're so caught up in themselves. They're more committed to fighting each other than to anything else. People are suffering and bearing the brunt of an unfair system, caught in a cycle of disadvantage, and the Liberal-National coalition has no interest in breaking that cycle.



The PRESIDENT:  The question is that the motion, as moved by Senators Faruqi, be agreed to.

 (Western Australia—Minister for Small and Family Business, Skills and Vocational Education) (12:46):  I move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard.


Leave granted.




The speech read as follows—



The Criminal Code Amendment (Food Contamination) Bill 2018 strengthens penalties for existing offences, and amends the nation's sabotage offences, to deal with acts of food supply contamination that pose a risk to the safety of the Australian community.


The consequences we have witnessed from the contamination of strawberries demonstrate the public anxiety, economic loss and real-world harm that a rogue actor can cause.


This harm has been amplified by copycat offenders and the perpetrators of hoaxes. 


The bill sends a very clear message. This behaviour is not a joke. It is not funny. It is a serious criminal offence which we denounce, and offenders will face serious consequences. 


Contamination of goods


It is already illegal to intentionally contaminate goods with the intention of causing public alarm or anxiety, widespread or nationally significant economic loss, or harm to public health. It is also a crime to threaten to contaminate goods, or make false statements about the contamination of goods for one of those purposes.


However, recent events have demonstrated that the existing maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment is not high enough. 


The bill will address this by increasing the maximum penalty to 15 years' imprisonment.


This will send a strong signal to would-be offenders by placing the penalty at an equivalent level to child pornography and funding a terrorist organisation.


There is a real risk that recent events will inspire hoaxes and copycat offenders. These people need to know that if they engage in this conduct, they will be committing a crime.


The bill will create new offences that apply where a person contaminates goods, threatens to contaminate goods or makes false statements about the contamination of goods and is reckless as to causing public alarm or anxiety, economic loss, or harm to public health. 


These offences will attract a maximum penalty of 10 years' imprisonment.


Sabotage


The government recently modernised Australia's sabotage laws to address the unprecedented threats that we now face. These threats are constantly evolving, and our laws must keep pace.


These laws currently apply to the sabotage of public infrastructure and carry maximum penalties of between seven and 25 years' imprisonment. 


Australia's food supply infrastructure is of critical importance to our national security and the wellbeing of our citizens. 


The bill will expand the sabotage offences so that they would cover the sabotage of Australia's food supply, where such conduct is intended to prejudice our national security. 


Further action


The bill marks an important step towards ensuring that our food supply infrastructure is afforded the same protection as other pieces of our critical infrastructure. 


This work must continue. I will raise the issue with my state and territory counterparts and encourage them to strengthen their laws to ensure a robust, nationally consistent approach to the protection of our food supply.


It is important to remember the human toll this is having on Australian farmers, and indeed a whole range of participants in the agricultural sector, who are already doing it tough. Helping our farmers and farming communities is this government's number one priority, and we have committed $1 million to deal with this crisis and help get the industry back on its feet.


Conclusion


The events of this week represent large scale criminality relating to food products in Australia. 


Strong action is required to deter and punish those who would target our food supply infrastructure. Their actions hurt the Australian community. They sabotage the livelihoods of growers, communities, towns and whole regions. They frighten people away from enjoying the beautiful, fresh, healthy produce our farmer's grow. This Bill demonstrates that the Government will not stand for it.


It is the first duty of every Government is to keep its people safe, and we are committed to doing so.

"Farrell, Sen Don",ALP,2018-09-20,"



Senator FARRELL
 (South Australia—Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (12:46):  As all Australians would be aware, since 13 September this year there have been a number of confirmed cases of people finding needless in strawberries. While the initial reporting concerned Berry Licious and Berry Obsession strawberries from Queensland, police and health authorities have warned of copycat cases across Australia.


On 19 September, it was reported by the AAP that Australia's strawberry contamination scare has now spread across six states. The Home Affairs minister said on Wednesday that there were up to 100 reported cases, although many of these were believed to be hoaxes. In response to these and other stories of needles being found in fruit, some supermarkets have pulled their strawberries from their shelves. We know that our farmers are suffering and we are reaching a critical point where lasting damage to the industry could be done. This is a completely unacceptable situation and is having a devastating impact on strawberry farmers.


The Morrison government has responded by making some changes to Commonwealth laws that it hopes will assist in deterring and prosecuting the individuals who have engaged in these recklessly destructive behaviours. According to a search of the Commonwealth Sentencing Database conducted by the Parliamentary Library on 19 September, there are no cases recorded against any of the existing offences in part 9.6 of the Commonwealth Criminal Code which deal with food contamination. Those offences were first introduced in 2004. While we have not had time to ascertain the reasons for this, it may be that the authorities have not used the existing Commonwealth offence provisions because of the existence of equivalent state and territory criminal offences in relation to the contamination of food. Those state and territory offences have a broader application than the equivalent Commonwealth offences due to the constitutional limitations on the Commonwealth's legislative powers. Those people who have caused the current crisis should face the full force of the law. What they have done is a despicable act with far-reaching consequences. I would urge all members in this place, when they leave Canberra today and tomorrow, to support the Australian farmers by buying a few punnets of strawberries at home and sticking it up on social media. Things like this matter.


I would like to note that the opposition has been asked to consider and agree to this legislation in an extraordinarily short period of time. It's highly unusual for amendments to be made, in particular to our Criminal Code, without any consultation at all. We do not want to set this as a precedent for future legislation. On this occasion, we recognise the gravity of the situation at hand. Labor will be supporting the Criminal Code Amendment (Food Contamination) Bill 2018.

"McKim, Sen Nicholas",AG,2018-09-20,"



Senator McKIM
 (Tasmania) (12:50):  The Australian Greens utterly condemn any tampering with food in a dangerous way in our country, as we have seen recently around strawberries. We regard that kind of action as completely unacceptable. As such, we are very open to supporting reasonable legislative change to do what we can to ensure a strong legislative framework in this area. But, let's face it, to describe the Criminal Code Amendment (Food Contamination) Bill 2018 as a rushed job would be an understatement.


I want to acknowledge the officers of the Attorney-General's Department who briefed Mr Bandt and me on this bill this morning. I thank them for the time they provided to us and for the professional way they engaged with us. However, it needs to be on the record that this bill has been subject to no consultation whatsoever. It has not and will not be subject to any kind of parliamentary inquiry. As Senator Farrell has just said, it is most unusual for amendments to the Criminal Code to be made in such a short time frame. We have concerns about potential unintended consequences of this legislation, and we haven't had time to do the consultation that we need to do with our stakeholders and with people who we seek advice from with regard to legislation such as this. This leaves us in a very difficult position.


On balance, we've determined not to support this legislation at this stage, simply because the government has not provided enough time for us to conduct consultations or for the normal inquiry processes of the Senate to take place. We regret that that has occurred. We want to, and do, strongly support our primary producers, including, in this case, strawberry farmers. We understand the impacts that the events of the last few days have had on them. However, due to our concern about the indecent haste with which the government is proceeding and due to the lack of opportunity for us to consult and for the Senate to do the job it would normally be able to do on legislation such as this, we are not in a position to support the bill at this stage.

Senator CASH
 (Western Australia—Minister for Small and Family Business, Skills and Vocational Education) (12:53):  I thank senators for their contribution to the debate on the Criminal Code Amendment (Food Contamination) Bill 2018. This bill urgently addresses significant gaps in Australia's current contamination laws. The bill tackles distressing recent events relating to the tampering of strawberries in Australia that have posed a risk to the safety of the Australian community and the livelihood of significant parts of our agriculture sector. It is a strong and necessary response to circumstances which demand nothing less. Families need to have the assurance that the Australian produce that they are buying is safe for their kids, safe for themselves and safe for their loved ones. Australian farmers need our support to ensure that their livelihoods are not put at further risk.


As you are aware, we have not relied solely upon legislation in response to this challenge. The government has also committed $1 million to make more food safety officials urgently available to increase detection, fast-track recalls and assist the strawberry industry to rebuild confidence. It is essential that we in this place act quickly and decisively—and that is exactly what the government is doing—to ensure our criminal laws are appropriately adapted to the threats that we face. This bill reflects the absolute commitment of this government to do all that it can to keep Australians safe as they go about their everyday lives. The Criminal Code Amendment (Food Contamination) Bill 2018 strengthens penalties for existing offences and amends the nation's sabotage offences to deal with acts of food supply contamination that pose a risk to the safety of the Australian community.


The consequences we have witnessed from the contamination of strawberries demonstrates the public anxiety, economic loss and real-world harm that a rogue actor can cause.

It is also a crime to threaten to contaminate goods or make false statements about the contamination of goods for one of those purposes.

The bill will address this by increasing the maximum penalty to 15 years imprisonment.

Their actions hurt the Australian community. They sabotage the livelihood of growers, communities, towns and whole regions, and let us not forget the impact on small and family businesses. Their actions frighten people away from enjoying the beautiful, fresh, healthy produce that our farmers grow.


This bill demonstrates that the government will not stand for this type of behaviour. It is the first duty of every government to keep its people safe, and this government is committed to doing this. With that, I commend the bill to the chamber.

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance and the Public Service, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (14:00):  We will continue to consider all options to help boost women's superannuation. But let me point out that the coalition has a very proud track record when it comes to introducing real, tangible measures to help women save for their retirement, including of course the low-income superannuation tax offset, which benefits around 1.9 million women by over $500 million; levelling the playing field by scrapping restrictions on who can make personal deductible contributions, benefitting 800,000 Australians, including those women who are working in roles without access to formal salary sacrificing arrangements—



The PRESIDENT:  Senator O'Neill, on a point of order.




Senator O'Neill:
  Mr President, the question required a response to some specific requests. I asked whether the minister could confirm that women retire on 42 per cent less super than men or $113,000 less. Could the minister go to the detail of the question and say whether he will support Labor, rather than go on with his list?



The PRESIDENT:  Senator O'Neill, I cannot instruct the minister how to answer the question, as long as he is being directly relevant. He is being directly relevant to the question.




Senator CORMANN:
  Thank you very much, Mr President. In response to the substantive question at the end of the Senate's question, I said that the government would continue to consider all options to help boost women's super. But I am also pointing out our very strong track record, including our measure to enable catch-up concessional contributions, which will benefit 230,000 Australian, including those women with interrupted work patterns or irregular income, such as farmers and carers.


Of course, what Labor will do is increase taxes on superannuation, abolish the flexibility afforded by the government's catch-up contributions and keep restrictions on who can make personal deductible contributions. This will hurt the retirement savings of anyone with irregular income or work patterns, including mothers and carers who have taken time out of the workforce.


The government has introduced the comprehensive Protecting Your Super Package, which will stop the rorts and rip-offs in the superannuation sector, providing significant benefits to the financial security of millions of Australian women. Around two million women who hold low-balance inactive accounts will be protected from erosion through excessive fees and inappropriate insurance. Around 1.6 million women who are still contributing to low-balance accounts will also see hundreds of millions of dollars— (Time expired)

But, of course, under Labor, women, including and in particular older women, will be worse off. Remember who announced the granny tax. Who announced the granny tax? Who wants to put their hands into the pockets of older women around Australia and increase taxes on their retirement savings? It is none other than Mr Shorten. That is what he did when he was the Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation when Labor were last in government. He kept using people's retirement savings as his personal ATM. He used to—

Senator O'Neill:
  The question was about homelessness and poverty, and those words have not passed the minister's lips. I call your attention to the relevance of his response.

Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (15:04):  Under standing order 74(5)(b), I move:


That the Senate take note of the explanation.


In this country there has been a long tradition of a professional public service. There's been a long tradition of an impartial and accountable public service. Under the coalition, this impartiality has been attacked. It has resulted in this government appointing their mates, their advisers and their people who will do their bidding in the public service to senior public service positions. The Liberal Party commenced this approach when former Prime Minister Tony Abbott sacked Martin Parkinson, an independent, well-respected secretary.




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  Left-wing!




Senator CAMERON:
  This is the problem we have here. Senator Macdonald interjects that he was left-wing. I don't think anyone that looks at the service that Martin Parkinson has given to this country would say he's left-wing. The only reason Senator Macdonald would interject in such a way is that Martin Parkinson was dealing with the issue of climate change under the previous government. That's what you get from this bunch of muppets—that's how their own Prime Minister describes them; a government full of muppets—and we just heard from one of the muppets how they feel contempt for professional, well-accomplished public servants.




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  In your view!




Senator CAMERON:
  It is not only my view, Senator Macdonald; it's the view of people that have worked with Mr Parkinson. Mr Parkinson was seen to be so effective that he was appointed secretary of Prime Minister and Cabinet.


Let's get a bit of reality here. It's no wonder the Prime Minister calls this lot 'muppets'. These are the extremists in the coalition. They deny climate change, and they went out and knifed their last Prime Minister on the basis that they didn't think that he should have even been mentioning the words 'climate change'. This is an appalling situation. Senator Macdonald epitomises the nonsense that goes on in this divided government that is on its last legs and cannot focus on the real issues for working people in this country. It's an absolute disgrace.


We had the current Prime Minister, when he was Treasurer, commission and selectively release Treasury work that purported to attack Labor's economic and tax policies. A number of examples of that have been seen over the last year. This is an example of the politicisation of the public sector.


It is just unacceptable that we have to wait this length of time to get answers from the government to reasonable questions. I know why they couldn't give the answers—they were too busy knifing each other. They were too busy putting the numbers together to try and get rid of former Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull. But, when they got the numbers together, the Leader of the Government in the Senate couldn't even count and his preferred candidate couldn't get up. This is the nonsense we have here.


A public service should be professional. A public service should be impartial and accountable. When you put your mates in there, when you put an ex-adviser like Mr Gaetjens in as Treasury secretary, then you know there is a problem. How can Mr Gaetjens be impartial and accountable? He can't do it. Scott Morrison appointed his chief of staff as Treasury secretary. What a joke. How can Labor and other parties in the parliament have confidence in a Treasury secretary who spent the last few years attacking the opposition's policies? The main attack dog on Labor policies has now been appointed as secretary of the Treasury. It's an absolute disgrace.


Treasury is supposed to put together a blue book for an incoming government. If we are fortunate enough to win the next election then Mr Gaetjens, the person put in there to basically run the government's agenda in Treasury, will be putting together the advice to the Labor opposition. How can we accept advice from a partisan player? How can we accept advice from someone who has—and I use the word loosely here—the pedigree of being the adviser to the worst Treasurer this country has ever had, former Treasurer Peter Costello? How can we have any confidence in this Treasury secretary? He's supposed to provide frank and fearless advice. He's supposed to be frank and fearless in what he does for government. We can have no confidence in that. This is a partisan political player. This is typical of this government.


The Public Service is supposed to be ethical. It's supposed to be values driven and it's supposed to act in the public interest. Mr Gaetjens cannot operate in a non-partisan way. It's clear that he has been the behind-the-scenes attack dog on Labor's policy. The culture of this government is to politicise the Public Service. It is just unacceptable. I'll look with interest at the responses that we have from Senator Cormann in relation to the questions that we asked. We did ask a whole range of questions that went unanswered, so Senator Cormann's responses will make interesting reading. And I must say I think they will point to the problems that we have with this government. Not only did it sack one of the most prestigious public servants in Martin Parkinson; it has also given us Senator Cash, this disgraced minister who misled the Senate on at least five occasions, who will not cooperate with the Australian Federal Police and who has spent hundreds of thousands of dollars trying to cover up her involvement in the raid on the AWU offices and the use of the Registered Organisations Commission to attack her political opponents and the union movement. How can we trust this government when it gets down to that level?


You've only got to look at Senator Cash's appointments in the past. To the Australian Building and Construction Commission she appointed Nigel Hadgkiss. Nigel Hadgkiss spent years attacking the trade union movement on a massive salary, appointed by this government. This is a supposedly independent public servant who breached his own legal requirements as a commissioner. These are the types of people that this government appoints in senior Public Service positions. He had to resign in disgrace, but not before Senator Cash and this government, with the ABCC, ploughed, again, hundreds of thousands of public dollars into trying to cover up the breaches of the act that this public servant was supposed to be the guardian of. What a joke. What an absolute joke.


Then we had the appointment of the Public Service Commissioner, John Lloyd, who was nothing more than a partisan political player in all of his appointments ever in this parliament. He led the attack on working people in Western Australia through his appointments to the public sector in Western Australia. This is the modus operandi of this government: put your mates and your ideological attack dogs in senior public service positions and ensure that they deliver the government's agenda to attack their political opponents. It's an absolute disgrace. When the Public Service was closing in on him and his actions were being exposed, the Public Service Commissioner John Lloyd resigned in disgrace and resigned in ignominy. These are the types of people that this government appoint to positions.


Then we've got the Registered Organisations Commission itself. The Registered Organisations Commission are supposedly an independent organisation, but now we see quite clearly that they are nothing more than another attack dog for the Liberal Party and the coalition against the trade union movement, workers' rights and workers' capacity to actually bargain effectively. The coalition appointed Mr Mark Bielecki as the head honcho of the Registered Organisations Commission. This guy couldn't even tell me in estimates where the offices of the Registered Organisations Commission were. He is nothing more than a figurehead and a front for the Registered Organisations Commission.


The person who is in there to do this government's bidding is a Mr Chris Enright. Mr Chris Enright is the attack dog in the Registered Organisations Commission to attack working people, to attack their trade unions and to try and make sure that the union movement is on the defensive continually under this government. Mr Chris Enright is the very Chris Enright who put together, while he was a member of the Australian Crime Commission, a secret file on a Labor frontbencher.


These are the types of disgraceful appointments that this government make continually, and what they do is they diminish the Public Service. They mean that Labor and the public generally can have no confidence in what the Public Service does in terms of fearless advice. The ethics of the Public Service get dragged down with these types of appointments. You've just got to look at what some of the press have been saying about these appointments. Bernard Keane says that the appointment of Phil Gaetjens has degraded the Public Service to 'a partisan think tank'. Imagine the Treasury being seen as a partisan think tank—one that, as Bernard Keane says, 'contributes little to the polity and the public life of this country'. Bernard Keane goes on to say:


The many problems of Costello's treasurership -- the short-term and long-term fiscal indiscipline, the corruption of the retirement incomes system, Costello's inability to see anything outside the leadership prism—


were all done when Mr Gaetjens was a senior policy adviser to Mr Costello. What Bernard Keane says is that there were some impeccable candidates.


I've been on the economics committee. I've been on estimates committees. I've seen some of the Treasury officials—highly competent, non-partisan—bring the position that they should have impartiality and accountability—even though it's difficult to get them to be accountable sometimes at estimates! But they do bring the position that the Public Service should bring—impartiality—to the table. When you put someone like Mr Gaetjens in as the Treasury secretary—who has been a political warrior, a political attack dog, a political friend of the coalition—in a senior position, the highest position in economic thinking in this country, then it is a disgrace. That's why we can have no confidence in Mr Gaetjens. We had no confidence in Nigel Hadgkiss, and he ended up resigning in disgrace after being given a golden handshake by the coalition to give him a reward for breaching the legislation that he was supposed to enforce! You can't trust these political attack dogs and you can't trust the muppets across this chamber. You cannot trust them. There is Mr John Lloyd. Instead of the government taking action to make sure that he applied himself in an impartial way, they simply allowed him to resign. They allowed him to resign over his disgraceful behaviour. His partisan behaviour, in handing information to the Institute of Public Affairs, was a disgrace.


So here we are. Those are the types of people that this government is putting in key positions in the Australian Public Service. This has diminished the Australian Public Service. It's good to know that the shadow Treasurer, Chris Bowen, has said that one of the key things that he has to do is restore the independence and non-partisan nature of this most important body: the Treasury. It is a disgrace that the coalition would plant political partisan appointments in key positions in the Australian Public Service to actually push their agenda and attack their political opponents.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Minister?




Senator Cormann:
  Just to assist Senator Cameron in the chamber, I can now also table all the Treasury answers.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Minister. Senator Macdonald, are you seeking a point of order?




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  No, I'm wanting to speak on the motion.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Cameron is not finished yet. He still has two minutes.




Senator CAMERON:
  Yes. Just sit down.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Cameron, resume your seat for a minute.




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  Sorry—what was the last intervention, then? I thought Senator Cameron had stopped and that's why Senator Cormann—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Minister Cormann tabled further documents pursuant to the matter that Senator Cameron raised. He probably should have waited. I thought he was calling a point of order, so I waited respectfully.




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  I thought Senator Cameron had finished.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  No, he hasn't, Senator Macdonald. The clock tells us he hasn't. Please continue, Senator Cameron.




Senator CAMERON:
  No, Senator Cameron has not finished. I'm not surprised that Senator Macdonald can't concentrate long enough to even know what's happening in the Senate. It's no wonder that the people who appoint and support the senators in Queensland don't think there is enough confidence in him to continue for another term in the Senate. If you can't even keep your mind on what's happening, I suppose that might have been one of the reasons that you got the punt by coalition members, the LNP in Queensland.


I'll go back to what I was saying. The shadow Treasury spokesperson, Chris Bowen, has said that he is about restoring the independence and non-partisan nature of the Treasury. What could be more important than an independent and non-partisan Treasury? Yet this government, which their own PM describes as 'muppets', are in there destroying the independence of the Treasury, destroying the independence of the Public Service. I've only given you some examples. The disgraced Nigel Hadgkiss, the disgraced John Lloyd, the disgraced Chris Enright are in there as partisan political players for the coalition, attacking their political opponents and using government institutions to attack their political opponents. This is a government whose time has long gone, like Senator Macdonald—his time has come and he is going. He couldn't even go on his own terms. He had to be chipped out, thrown out by the electorate of the Liberal National Party in Queensland—a disgraceful government; time's up.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2018-09-20,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (15:25):  What a despicable, gutless speech this chamber has just heard. It's typical of the Labor Party and someone like Senator Cameron, who was a great mate of Eddie Obeid and the Ian Macdonald from the New South Wales Labor Party, who are currently serving time in jail for corruption and who are great mates of Senator Cameron. They're the sort of gutless, despicable comments you can expect from the Labor Party.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Macdonald, please resume your seat. Senator Cameron.




Senator Cameron:
  That is a clear reflection. It should be withdrawn. ICAC even indicated I was an honest and upstanding witness. I assisted ICAC. I assisted all of the areas that had to be assisted. So that should be withdrawn.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Cameron, please resume your seat. That's a debating point.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Thank you, Madam Deputy President. It certainly is a debating point, and Senator Cameron is denying he was a mate of Eddie Obeid's and the bad Ian Macdonald, the Labor Party minister from New South Wales. Is Senator Cameron denying that? What a gutless, despicable speech from Senator Cameron. He's a bit like former Senator Conroy, attacking public servants who have no way of responding. And Senator Cameron is typical of the Labor Party. Public servants aren't in this chamber and they cannot get up and defend themselves as I can. Senator Cameron won't stay to hear my responses to his despicable attacks.


Public servants are there to do a job. They are not part of the political process. Senator Cameron, Senator Conroy before him, and most Labor politicians and senators at estimates will attack public servants personally, knowing that they cannot respond to these vicious, personal and deliberate attacks by members of the Australian Labor Party. They are disgusting in the way they do that. I remember how Senator Conroy made an accusation to General Campbell, who everybody knew was an honest, reliable, first-class soldier, currently Chief of the Defence Force but in those days doing the job that his government had given him to do. He was subject to the sort of despicable comment you've just heard from Senator Cameron on public servants.


He speaks about a number of other public servants who are simply not in a position to defend themselves, although one of those he named—I can't be more specific than this—has sought to respond in the rules of the Senate to some of the despicable, personal and untrue allegations that were made by members of the Australian Labor Party.


And for Senator Cameron to talk about others making political appointments to the Public Service is just laughable. We have no better example than one who has just walked into the room—my good friend Senator Watt—who was a failed Labor member of parliament in the Queensland parliament and appointed then into the Queensland Public Service. I mean, if Senator Cameron wants to talk about examples like this, he only has to look over his shoulder and see that the Labor Party is full of this. 


I've been in this chamber for a long time and, regrettably, I've lived through 12 years of Labor governments. They continually politicise the Public Service. Not often were they ever criticised by our side of parliament, because these political appointees, having been appointed, are public servants, and it's not our wont to actually politicise them. But the Labor Party know no bounds. I don't know all the other public servants that were mentioned by Senator Cameron, but I know Mr Hadgkiss did a wonderful job as an Australian bringing law and order to a very disorderly part of our economy—disorder that was promoted by the union movement, who put Senator Cameron in this chamber here. Mr Hadgkiss did a wonderful job in bringing law and order to an industry that had been unlawful.


I think Senator Cameron mentioned Mr Mark Bielecki. I believe he is from the commission that is looking into union rorts! More union rorts, and more Labor Party rorts—




Senator Williams:
  He'll be flat out looking into the unions!




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Well, it will be a full-time job, you're right, Senator Williams. But that is typical of the Labor Party. When decent, honest, God-fearing officials—be they police, public servants, people with a specific role—look into the rorts, corruption and illegality of the union movement—



Senator O'Neill interjecting—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order!




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Senator O'Neill, no doubt, is supported by the CFMEU, who are continually fined by the courts of the land for illegal activity. The CFMEU are defended by the likes of Senator O'Neill and Senator Cameron. That's the sort of despicable conduct you get from Labor Party senators who support and promote these law-breakers—these people who say they don't have to bother following the laws of the land. That's what the union movement say. 



Senator O'Neill interjecting—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order!




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Those are the sorts of people that Senator O'Neill continues to support in this place. I'm sorry that she is following the actions of her colleague Senator Cameron in this chamber.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Macdonald, please resume your seat. I remind senators—and, Senator O'Neill, I have called a number of times—that Senator Macdonald has the right to be heard in silence. 




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  This is not a subject I particularly want to raise, but Senator Cameron keeps on and on about my position in this parliament. Well, Senator Cameron—as with everything else—gets it completely wrong. I am on the ticket for the next election. He is not. He didn't even have the guts to face preselection with the Labor Party in New South Wales, because the union had tapped him on the shoulder and said: 'Sorry, mate, you're so useless, you're so ineffective, you get the boot. Off you go to Tasmania. We don't even want you back in New South Wales.' That's the sort of person who makes these sorts of accusations against me. 



Senator Cameron interjecting—




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Senator Cameron miscategorises the preselection panel of the Liberal National Party in Queensland. I wasn't thrown aside by the Liberal National Party. Of the 14,000-odd members of the Liberal National Party, there was a preselection panel of 253—200 of whom came from Brisbane, I might say—and they didn't select me in that No. 1 position.




Senator O'Neill:
  Deputy President, on a point of order: I'm sure that the senator appreciates the opportunity to tell his personal story, but I thought we were debating the government's abuse of its authority in putting partisan people into senior roles in the Public Service. He should speak to the issue.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Debate has been wide-ranging on the motion that Senator Cameron moved, so there's no point of order. Please continue, Senator Macdonald.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Thanks, Deputy President. I would just say on that spurious interjection and interruption by Senator O'Neill that I was actually responding to comments that her colleague Senator Cameron had made in this debate—and the debate is not on government principles; it is a debate to take note of something that Senator Cormann did.


I can assure members of the Labor Party that I'll be back after the next election. I will be back, and I will be doing that in the same way as your colleague Senator Singh did on one occasion—and I suspect will do again. I know that there is a lot of disloyalty, disruption, backbiting and division within the Labor Party, but I think Senator Singh will be back—and I'll be glad. She is a senator who shows the strength of her convictions. She is prepared to buck the machine, and good on her. It just shows the absolute division within the Labor Party. If you want to speak more about the division in the Australian Labor Party, let's have a look at their position on trade matters. Half of them are on one side and half of them are on the other side. They don't know where they are at. And, of course, Mr Albanese is there pushing on all this disunity because Mr Albanese sees that his time as Leader of the Opposition is fast approaching.


That brings me to a point that Senator Cameron always makes in attacking a female minister, one of the best ministers, who just so happens to be a female minister. You don't see Senator Cameron attacking too many male ministers in this place. In attacking Senator Cash, one of the best ministers we have had, Senator Cameron told mistruths about her, saying that she was disgraced and that she had misled the parliament. She is certainly not disgraced. I don't know if Senator Cameron thinks that if he says the word 'disgraced' often enough someone will eventually believe him. She is a brilliant minister. She is not at all disgraced; in fact, she is revered. She is looked up to by most Australians, because she did such a wonderful job in exposing the union movement for all of the rorts, dishonesty and illegality that it is involved in. Senator Cash did that, and because of that she has paid the ultimate price. The union movement, with their pockets of gold, are determined to get rid of her—and Mr Dutton, another very effective minister who stands up for what is right. The union movement, with their pockets of gold, will do everything they can to destroy Senator Cash and Mr Dutton—but it won't work in either case.


The unions will continue to attack Senator Cash. Why? Senator Cameron often talks about a raid on a union office. He seems to think that that is a problem. The police got a warrant to go and raid, to investigate criminal activity. And what was the criminal activity that they were investigating? It was whether or not Mr Bill Shorten, then a leading unionist, had misappropriated funds that had been given to the union movement into his campaign account for his tilt at being elected to parliament.



Senator O'Neill interjecting—




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  I don't know whether that's true or not, Senator O'Neill, but we do know, on the record, what that was all about. It was a police investigation—properly done with warrants—into a parliamentarian's office to see whether there had been criminality in the transfer of funds from the union movement to Mr Shorten's campaign account prior to his election here.


Of course, the last thing Senator Cameron or the Labor Party want to discuss is that particular issue. They are doing everything possible to derail the investigation into that alleged criminality. Senator Cameron will come in here and attack Senator Cash every day of the week. Why? It is because Senator Cash was the minister—she didn't make the decision of course; it was the authorities—who the authorities in her department decided needed to look into those allegations of criminality. But you never hear that from Senator Cameron; it's always, 'Oh, this raid on a member of parliament's office.' That's not the issue; the issue is: was there criminality by Mr Shorten in transferring, without authority, funds from the union movement to his campaign account? That's the question. Suddenly everyone has gone quiet. That's the issue that Labor Party senators don't want to be raised at this time.


All I can say is that Senator Cash has done a wonderful job, as has Mr Dutton in his role as border protection minister. He is the home affairs minister, who keeps Australians safe and keeps our migration policy operating properly. GetUp! and the unions, who fund the Labor Party and the Greens, don't like that, so they'll do everything they can to destroy those people. I see they're even trying to destroy my friend and deputy leader. He has been a wonderful minister in every portfolio that he has touched, whether in government or opposition. He has done a wonderful job. He's being attacked now for being promoted. I can't follow the logic of Senator Wong's attack on Senator Birmingham for his well-deserved promotion in the last reshuffle.



Senator Birmingham interjecting—




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Don't thank me, Minister. I only speak the truth on these sorts of things, as I always do.


I return to my real point here. I have been here a long time and I have seen some robust debates in this chamber, but never have I seen these sorts of despicable, gutless attacks you get from members of the Australian Labor Party on public servants, who have no way of answering back. Senator Cameron can and does attempt to bully me, shout me down, accuse me and tell lies about me all the time. I don't mind that. I'm in this business, I have a thick hide and I can defend myself—I have the opportunity to speak. But Senator Cameron's regrettable, gutless and despicable attacks on public servants have happened only in recent years. I think it shows a lack of leadership in the Labor Party that those sorts of personal attacks on public servants are allowed to continue. The Senate and the Australian parliament are worse for that action.


It is one of the unwritten laws or conventions always followed that in this chamber you do not attack people who are not in a position to defend themselves. That is particularly so with public servants, who because of their roles always show—the word is not properly used—deference to parliamentarians because they see that parliamentarians are elected by the people, and they pay respect to them. They won't argue with politicians, because that's not their role or part of their appointment criteria. Politicians who come in and personally attack public servants, who they know have no ability to respond, deserve the contempt of the Australian people and I might say do achieve the contempt of the Australian people.


The previous speaker comes from a branch of the New South Wales Labor Party that has many of its politicians and ministers in jail for corruption and dishonesty. I'm amazed that Senator Cameron ever has the gall to mention this subject. Senator Cameron has never and can never deny that he was a good mate of Eddie Obeid, who is now serving time in jail, and the man who regrettably has my name—Ian Macdonald—and was a Labor minister in a New South Wales government I think of Senator Keneally. Senator Cameron was mates of these people. I understand that they protected his preselection. They helped him knife in the back his colleague George Campbell. I remember Senator George Campbell, a Labor senator here—not a terribly effective one, but he did the job and he did it honestly. Senator Campbell was a nice enough fellow. I understand he thought that Senator Cameron was a friend of his. But we all know from reading the newspapers that Senator Cameron knifed him in the back to get his position here in the parliament. And Senator Cameron well knew that, had he stood for preselection for the next election, he would have been beaten because people have long memories in the New South Wales Labor Party and the knives were out for Senator Cameron. He didn't even have the guts to fight.




Senator O'Neill:
  What a load of absolute nonsense!




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Senator O'Neill—well, I don't think you were part of that group—continues to protect those who bring politics generally into disgrace but, more importantly, the New South Wales Labor Party into despair. 


Madam Acting Deputy President Lines, this debate is to take note of Senator Cormann tabling some answers on time. Senator Cameron wanted to know where those answers were, and Senator Cormann said, 'Well, here they are.' Yet, we've still had a one-hour debate because Senator Cameron likes to use these sorts of opportunities to smear those who cannot defend themselves. As I say, it's this sort of gutless, despicable activity by some politicians that leads the whole profession to be viewed in a poor state by most Australians.


Question agreed to.

"O'Neill, Sen Deb",ALP,2018-09-20,"



Senator O'NEILL

 (
New South Wales
) (
15:46
):

 I move:


That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Finance and the Public Service (Senator Cormann) to a question without notice asked by Senator O'Neill today relating to superannuation.


I rise to take note of the answer given by Senator Cormann to a question I asked a long time ago at the beginning of question time. My question was about the fundamental right that Australians now have, have come to expect and perhaps think this country has always had—that is, the right to expect when you work that your employer will contribute superannuation. There was a time when that didn't exist. Certainly, I grew up in a part of the country where superannuation wasn't anything that was discussed around the kitchen table in Curran Street, Blacktown, where I lived. But the Labor Party instituted superannuation for all Australians, a universal scheme, and those opposite in government—and you just heard a speech from one of their representatives—were so out of touch at the time we set it up that they said it could never work, that businesses would fail and the whole economy would fall apart. 


They're still out of touch, because today when I asked Senator Cormann to actually recognise the fact that, right now in Australia, Australian women will retire with 42 per cent less in their superannuation balance than Australian men who are working in the same country, the same economy—42 per cent less. The calculation of that amount is about $113,000. 


Senator Cormann, the Leader of the Liberal-National party who will seek the vote from the Australian people to come back in here, couldn't even answer that question and confirm those facts. Part of the reason he can't confirm those facts, and perhaps he doesn't care about those facts, is that his coalition are going to—and this is what he said—continue to consider all options. That's what they've been doing for five, nearly six years—considering all those options. And do you know who they've been leaving out the whole time? Australian women. They haven't got enough women who want to join their party, who want to stay in their party or who want to be a voice in their party because it's dominated by men who simply think that they know better and refuse to acknowledge the reality. 


If you looked around this chamber at question time, you would have seen 15 women here in the Australian Labor Party out of a team of 26—15 of us—standing up for women. It's not just the team that's here—and I want to acknowledge the great work of Labor parliamentarians, men and women, over years who have advanced the cause for women to get fair and decent superannuation. We've come up with a policy to address that. And the voice of women has been loud in that debate inside our party.


On the other side, there are 30 Liberal-National party members. Only eight of them—only eight—are women. Having an absence of a women's voice in your political party in this day and age is absolutely a failure. This government is failing on women's representation and, because of that, it's failing to provide adequately for the women of this nation.


My second question was to Senator Cormann asking him if he will invest the $400 million that Australian Labor are going to invest to make sure that women are going to have a secure financial future so that, when they go on maternity leave, they'll get their maternity leave, which Labor delivered, but they'll also get a superannuation payment on that of $1,100—roughly that amount. That's going to translate to a massive improvement in the amount of money that they will have on retirement. I will just go to the example of a woman who gives birth to a child at 27 and another at 29—two children; she's under 30. The difference that this policy of Labor—this $400 million investment in the women of this country—will make is $24,350. That is no small amount. We understand, as the Labor Party, with the strong voice of strong women, that we have to do better for 50 per cent of this population, who are retiring in poverty.


My second question was to ask the minister if he knows, if he can verify that older, single women are one of the fastest-growing groups falling into homelessness. If they spent just a minute or two at their local real estate agents and saw who was coming in and the desperate state that Australian older women are in, they'd know that they need to change their policy. They could have matched Labor. They're the government. They could have said on Monday that they were going to institute it straight away. But they didn't. What they're doing to do is what Senator Cormann said—they're going to continue to consider all options. Well, they've been considering the wrong options for too long, and Australian women deserve better.

"Williams, Sen John",Nats,2018-09-20,"



Senator WILLIAMS
 (New South Wales—Nationals Whip in the Senate) (15:52):  I'm glad Senator O'Neill has raised the issue of superannuation. It's been very interesting, the royal commission, hasn't it, Senator O'Neill, when we look at superannuation there? Of course, we're well aware that, if Labor had put the terms of reference forward for the royal commission, superannuation would not have been included—you could bet on that.


There are questions to be asked about superannuation and who's earning what and what they're going to retire on. Senator O'Neill might answer a question for me, when I asked why, years ago, in 2007, Australian Super donated $27½ thousand to the Australian Workers' Union. It is quite amazing. Who were the directors of Australian Super then? You wouldn't believe it, Madam Deputy President: Senator Cameron was a director! And it goes on. Who was another director? Former Labor minister Greg Combet!



Senator McAllister interjecting—




Senator WILLIAMS:
  You've picked the next one. I'm getting to it; you'll just have to be patient, Senator McAllister. And another director was? Mr Bill Shorten! So the superannuation fund donates $27½ thousand to the Australian Workers' Union and they list it as 'a donation', in 2007, to the Australian Workers' Union. What did they do shortly afterwards? The Australian Workers' Union donated $25,000 to where? To the election campaign fund of one Mr Bill Shorten. Of course, 10 years later, in 2017, the AWU changed it from 'a donation' to 'other'. So if we want to talk about superannuation and how much money is left, Senator McAllister, I'm glad we've got it in the terms of reference in the royal commission—which you never would have done.


Talking of working women, I want to see them earn more super and have a better retirement as well. But one person we should be thanking is this minister sitting in front of me for his change to day care subsidies and allowances. When it peaked out at $7,000, when half of the women went to work what was the story? They were working for taxation and for child care, and for nothing else; they were working for, basically, nothing. So isn't it great that Minister Birmingham did that? And congratulations to him on his promotion to trade minister.


As to the question from Senator Wong—well, if Senator Wong's going to keep Senator Keneally on the back bench, she's going to have to do better than that, because I know Senator Keneally. As I said, she's not used to riding down at the back of the bus; she wants to be up the front of the bus—in fact, she wants to be driving the bus. So if Senator Wong wants to keep those divisions from behind her away, she's going to have to do much, much better than that.


It's quite amazing that the coalition has a proud record of introducing real, tangible measures to help women save for their retirement, including the low-income superannuation tax offset, which benefits around 1.9 million women by over $500 million. Do those opposite give any praise for that? Of course not. Levelling the playing field by scrapping restrictions on who can make personal deduction contributions benefits 800,000 Australians, including those women working in roles without access to formal salary sacrifice arrangements. Catch-up concessional contributions will benefit 230,000 Australians, including those women with interrupted work patterns or irregular income, such as farmers and carers.


Of course, we know what Labor will do. It will simply hike taxes. We know there are $200 billion worth of taxes planned if it were to win the next election—an extra $200 billion on the Australian people. That's what Labor has done all its life—spend, spend, spend; tax, tax, tax; borrow, borrow, borrow; and run up government debt. It doesn't matter whether it is at state level. It doesn't matter whether it is at federal level. Labor has a history of building debt, big time. Its then Treasurer, Mr Wayne Swan, was going to have the budget in the black years ago. As I've said in this place before, black print at the bottom of a budget is something Labor simply does not understand.


Under the coalition, there are more women working than ever before and more women working full-time than ever before. Working women, of course, are getting superannuation. What we've got to do is get the snouts out of the trough of the superannuation. The royal commission has made it very clear that there are institutions out there that are simply robbing and ripping off people's superannuation, and hence their retirement fund is so much lower. I hope the royal commission makes some serious recommendations about superannuation, about seeing that not only the women but the male workers as well have a much better retirement fund, because that's what it's for. The coalition has done a good job on benefiting working women. I commend, as I said, the day care support now, which is a real incentive for women to work and to work longer, not only to earn their wage and benefit their family but to earn superannuation as well.

"McAllister, Sen Jenny",ALP,2018-09-20,"



Senator McALLISTER
 (New South Wales—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (15:57):  More than two years ago, a Senate Economics References Committee inquiry, which I chaired, published its report titled 'A husband is not a retirement plan'. That reflected the very words said to our committee by an older woman who wanted to make it clear to younger women that they would need to take responsibility for their own financial future. The truth is, of course, that a third of Australian women enter retirement single. Many other Australian women may enter retirement with a partner, but their partner, like them, has a very modest superannuation account. The idea, in any case, at the level of principle, that a woman ought to be dependent on a man in her retirement just does not fly in 2018.


Last month, the government released their response. It took them two years to come up with their response to the recommendations made by that Senate inquiry. The shorthand version of what that response said to the proposition that a husband is not a retirement plan is basically this. They said, 'Well, actually, ladies, a husband is your best bet.' That is essentially the response that was provided by the government to the more than 18 recommendations that were in that report.


Today in question time, I asked about whether or not the government would match Labor's commitment to pay superannuation for women when they are on parental leave. All we got was waffle. The truth is that they don't have any meaningful response whatsoever when it comes to the appalling state of women's economic security in retirement.


There are a couple of measures that the coalition like to point to when we raise this issue. I want to just take the time to point out how the answers that they provide, the things that they say answer this question, are no answers at all. Senator Williams pointed to the opportunity for people to make catch-up concessional superannuation contributions. What the government claim is that this measure will help women by allowing them to make additional tax-free super contributions when they're working to make up for the period of time that they spend out of work caring for someone else. The problem is that the majority of Australian women, and particularly those who spend extended periods of time out of the workforce, do not make the kind of money that allows them to make these catch-up contributions.


Industry Super Australia did the numbers. They ran the numbers on this proposition and they said that this measure would assist less than two per cent of women who have super accounts. They said that it would mostly help women with superannuation balances of over $600,000 a year. Well I can tell you that's not your average woman who's been off on maternity leave. And your average woman doesn't have $30,000 lying around that she's just going to chuck into her super account now that these arrangements have been relaxed by the government. This is a measure that will benefit high-income men. This is not a measure that benefits women, and it is absolutely shameful that, time and time again, Senator Cormann comes into this chamber and asserts that this is a measure for women. It is actually a lie and he should stop saying it.


They also say that they will provide measures to allow men, essentially, to tip money into women's super accounts. They'll change the arrangements to make that easier. I tell you what: this tells you a lot about the Liberals' view of gender relations, but it doesn't do a lot for women who cannot or do not want to rely on a husband or a partner for economic security. Economic independence is the thing women need if we are to escape generations of subordination to men.


Senator Cormann likes to talk about the fact that they reinstated the low-income superannuation contribution. I'll tell you what actually happened. This was a Labor initiative that made sure that low-income women didn't pay more tax on their super than other people were paying. The government abolished it. They abolished it. So when they say that this is their initiative, what they've actually done is put our tax concession back and they've given it a new name. It used to be the LISC and now they call it the LISTO. It is exactly the same measure that was introduced by Labor. It is no new measure at all. They're the three measures that they say help women, and every single one of them is either a Labor measure or has no impact on women at all. It is disgraceful, and they ought to be ashamed of themselves.

"Martin, Sen Steve",Nats,2018-09-20,"



Senator MARTIN
 (Tasmania) (16:02):  It was interesting that Senator O'Neill mentioned women becoming homeless. Back in 1998 there were 100,000 people in Australia sleeping rough—transient; between different people's places, on their couches; sleeping under bridges—and the age group covered anywhere between six years of age right up to about 95 years of age.


Today the Deputy Prime Minister, Michael McCormack, and the Prime Minister, Scott Morrison, assisted the efforts of young people to attack the scourge of homelessness in this country. They did so by donating one of their own personal coats to a group called Enormity, which bases itself in Ulverstone in Tasmania. At the time, these young people were the age of about 15, and one of their friends became homeless. They borrowed a coat and provided it to this young person, who was sleeping in doorways with no possessions, no money and no food. They thought they would provide that person with protection from the winter elements and some warmth. That's what they thought they could do. But in questioning these young people about whether there were any more homeless people that they knew out there, they said they did know of more. So they set about creating a public appeal for the donation of winter coats. Today the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister donated the 99,999th coat and the 100,000th coat to a young adult, Mr Jack Crawford, who was a member of Enormity six years ago. This marks 20 years of hard work by these young people who went out in the winter elements and collected coats from people who were kind enough to donate their own winter coat to help those who were homeless and in need. They came in all sizes and all shapes. We even had members of the public going to local stores and actually buying new coats and donating them to help the homeless. We even had visitors—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Williams
):  Order! Resume your seat, Senator Martin, please. Point of order, Senator Urquhart?




Senator Urquhart:
  Yes, a point of order. The taking note was on the first question that was asked to Senator Cormann in relation to women's superannuation. I would ask that you draw the senator's attention to that. Thank you.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  You make a point, Senator Urquhart. In the debate by Senator O'Neill, she did refer to homelessness, but I will draw your attention back to the issue of superannuation, once you've wound up on the point you're trying to make, please, Senator Martin.




Senator MARTIN:
  Thank you. One hundred thousand coats in 20 years is an extremely huge target and a very proud moment for these young people, especially receiving that from the leader of the country. Over the last 20 years, they've collected a coat from every Prime Minister, starting with Prime Minister John Howard. This investment by these young people shows that they are caring and that they know. The learnings that they got from that has enabled them to move into life and into the workforce to earn money and contribute to our community. They've been able to build a better life for themselves and for others. The contribution that they've made is not only through their volunteer work but also through their working life and productivity. They earn money so that they can put it into superannuation themselves.


It's funny: as we go along, we talk about putting money into superannuation and we talk about the government assisting people. The Labor Party, when they were in government not so long ago, had the opportunity to assist young people in their working life to be able to earn money and invest in superannuation, but, instead, there was a knee-jerk reaction to an issue and they said, 'We're going to build new school halls. We're going to invest in that. Instead of investing in young people themselves, we're going to build unneeded and unwanted school halls,' and they did. They built them and they weren't up to specifications. They built them and they weren't able to be used multipurposely. It was a poor investment. That's what's happening at the moment: we're wasting a lot of money through knee-jerk reactions. We're wasting a lot of money— (Time expired)

"Kitching, Sen Kimberley",ALP,2018-09-20,"



Senator KITCHING
 (Victoria) (16:07):  I rise to take note of the answers given by Senator Cormann today. The minister's answers reveal, in stark terms, the complete failure of the shambolic Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison government to understand the problems facing working women in Australia today. That's not surprising, because the government have no interest in working women, do nothing to promote talented women and do not respect the women they do have in this place. That's why Julie Bishop, the member for Curtin, the most high-profile woman in the coalition parties, polled only 11 votes when she contested the Liberal leadership; that's why the member for Chisholm has been driven out of parliament; and it's why the member for Gilmore is quitting politics.


In 1994, the coalition parties had more women in this parliament than Labor did. On both sides, fewer than 20 per cent of members were women. Today, more than 45 per cent of Labor members are women, while the coalition is still stuck on 20 per cent. They are on track with their current preselections to ensure Australia has fewer women in the parliament than they have in the Saudi Arabian legislature. This is not just a matter of symbolism; it explains why the coalition government disregards issues of primary importance to women. It explains the policy vacuum revealed by Senator Cormann's answers today. It's why the coalition government is doing nothing to address the gross inequalities that still face working women today, still face older women and still face retired women in Australia.


Far too many older Australian women are living in poverty despite having worked for most of their lives. This is because women disproportionately work in lower-paid jobs, because many women are still not getting equal pay for equal work—which is an utter disgrace—and because many women take time out from work to raise children, a task which still falls almost entirely on women.


But there is good news. A Shorten Labor government, if elected, will help women plan for a secure financial future. It will strengthen Australia's superannuation system and boost women's superannuation balances. In summary, the measures will pay superannuation on Commonwealth paid parental leave and dad and partner payments. They will phase out the $450 minimum monthly income threshold for eligibility for the Superannuation Guarantee. They will make it easier for employers to make extra payments into a woman's superannuation fund, and they will consider the impact that any future changes to super that might occur might have on women.


One of the effects of the current superannuation system is that women retire with $113,000 less, on average, in their super than men. The average superannuation balance at the moment for women upon retirement is $157,000. For men, it's $270,000. Older women, particularly single, divorced or widowed women, are more dependent than men on the aged pension. Older women are the fastest-growing cohort of homeless in Australia. In our large cities and, indeed, in smaller towns, we have seen an increase in homelessness. In the city of Melbourne, my hometown, you can see this on the streets in the CBD area.


The coalition government won't even acknowledge these realities, let alone do anything about them. This is a government which has little knowledge of and interest in the lives of working Australians, particularly working women. This 'muppet show' of a government is more interested in its own internal feuds and hatreds than it is in the lives of Australian women.


Labor understands the lives of working women. They are the people we represent in our electorates. They are the union members. They are the women who have responsibilities in trade unions. They are the women in our branches. They are the strong and capable women who we have brought into this parliament and elected to senior positions. Some of the best women in all of the parliaments of the world are Labor members and senators in this very parliament, and we should be very proud of that. We are never going to treat issues of importance to women as second-order issues, as this coalition does. The other part of this policy change is that we will amend the Sex Discrimination Act to ensure that businesses are able to make higher superannuation payments for female employees if they wish to do so.

 (Western Australia—Minister for Small and Family Business, Skills and Vocational Education) (16:29):  I move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard.


Leave granted.




The speech read as follows—



The Government Procurement (Judicial Review) Bill will implement recommendation 11 of the July 2014 Senate Finance and Public Administration References Committee's report into Commonwealth procurement procedures, for the Department of Finance to establish an independent and effective complaints mechanism for procurement processes. 


The Bill is consistent with obligations in the World Trade Organisation Agreement on Government Procurement, to which Australia has submitted a bid to accede, and the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP-11), which was signed on 8 March 2018.


These obligations require Australia to maintain an impartial and independent body to review and provide remedies for government procurement complaints. 


The text of these obligations, and the broader agreements, are publically available for the consideration of Senators. 


Beyond meeting international obligations, the Bill will also ensure that regional suppliers and small and medium enterprises have timely access to justice to raise complaints about procurement processes and seek remedies. 


The Bill designates the Federal Circuit Court (FCC) with jurisdiction (concurrently with the Federal Court of Australia) to receive and review local and international supplier complaints in relation to a breach of the Commonwealth Procurement Rules (CPRs).


The Bill requires the supplier to first complain to the Commonwealth entity responsible for conducting the procurement. The entity must investigate the complaint and, if the supplier is not satisfied with the outcome of the procuring entity's investigation, they can seek remedies from the FCC, including compensation.


Compensation will be limited to the reasonable costs for the preparation of the tender, or the costs relating to the challenge, or both. 


The FCC, with its streamlined processes, will provide an accessible way to lodge complaints, particularly for regional suppliers as it maintains a continuous presence outside major capital cities. Suppliers from rural and regional Australia will not need to travel to major cities to lodge a complaint.


The Bill is not intended to fully prescribe the procedures by which the FCC hears procurement complaints, but rather address three key areas where the FCC will need different jurisdiction and procedures than its current functions.


I will briefly outline the key elements of the Bill:


Jurisdiction


The Bill will confer jurisdiction on the FCC to hear government procurement complaints where a supplier considers that the CPRs have been breached. 


Suppliers must provide evidence of their complaint, including that they have attempted to resolve the complaint with the procuring entity in the first instance. 


Timely, Transparent and Effective Review Procedures


The Bill will ensure that the FCC can facilitate timely, transparent and effective review of complaints. Timeliness is an important feature for current procurements, where there still may be an opportunity for the supplier to continue to participate. 


The Bill specifies a 10-day timeframe for suppliers to make an application to the FCC to encourage timely efforts to resolve any concerns about a procurement process. 


However, the Bill also provides flexibility for the FCC to allow a longer period for applications if there are genuine reasons for the delay.


Remedies and Corrective Action


The Bill will preserve a supplier's ability to participate in procurements by offering remedies and/or compensation if the FCC finds that the CPRs have been breached. Any compensation ordered would be limited to the supplier's reasonable costs incurred in preparing the tender and/or seeking to resolve their complaint. The FCC will not be able to overturn awarded contracts. 


The decision to vest jurisdiction in the FCC was informed by extensive consultation between the Department of Finance and the Attorney-General's Department. This included a scoping study, which considered three options for a body to hear supplier complaints. The study considered vesting a federal court with jurisdiction, designating an existing administrative entity and establishing a new tribunal, and concluded that the FCC was the most efficient and accessible mechanism to administer this function. 


This Bill shows the Government's commitment to transparent and competitive procurement by giving suppliers the opportunity to seek remedies and improve Commonwealth procurement practices. 


I commend the Bill to the Senate.

Leader of the Government in the Senate



Dear Mr President


I write with regard to a question I took on notice from Senator Bernardi on Wednesday 19 September 2018, on the matter of the expansion of foreign interference in Australia.


I am advised that the Department of Home Affairs is overseeing the development of a comprehensive, whole of government strategy to counter foreign interference. The Government has appointed a National Counter Foreign Interference Coordinator within the Department of Home Affairs to ensure a whole of government approach to counter foreign interference efforts.


Furthermore, in June 2018, the Government passed the National Security Legislation Amendment (Espionage and Foreign Interference) Act and Foreign Influence Transparency Scheme Act. These two Acts strengthen existing espionage offences and increase penalties, and introduce the new offence of unlawful foreign interference.


I have copied this letter to the Prime Minister, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Minister for Home Affairs, and Senator Bernardi.


Kind regards,


Mathias Cormann

Senator POLLEY
 (Tasmania) (16:31):  I move:


That the Senate:


(a) notes that:


   (i) the former Treasurer, Mr Scott Morrison, was the architect of significant cuts to aged care to the tune of $1.2 billion in the 2016-17 Budget,


   (ii) Mr Morrison's $1.2 billion cut to aged care came on top of the almost $500 million from aged care funding Mr Morrison cut in the 2015 MYEFO,


   (iii) you don't fix aged care by cutting funding to it, and


   (iv) after 5 years of cuts, dithering and inaction on aged care, the Government has essentially called for a royal commission into itself;


(b) condemns:


   (i) the Morrison Government for failing to take responsibility for these cuts, and


   (ii) the current Prime Minister's refusal to rule out further cuts to aged care in Australia;


(c) calls on the Federal Government to ensure the Royal Commission into Aged Care examines the impact of the Liberals' years of cuts; and


(d) calls on the Federal Government not to wait for the royal commission to start fixing the crisis it has created.


I rise to speak about the current Prime Minister's shameful record on aged care. What do you get when you cross an inept government, which has spent five years ignoring aged care, with a new Prime Minister who was the architect of cuts that have absolutely gutted aged care? You get an aged-care sector in crisis. That's what you get.


He can deny it all he likes, but it was Mr Morrison's cuts to aged care that brought us to the aged-care crisis we're seeing now. It's mystifying that this out-of-touch government have decided that something is terribly wrong in aged care. I've been pushing for and calling on those opposite to take ageing and aged care seriously for years, but my calls have fallen on deafened ears. They were too busy trying to get the numbers for the former Prime Minister's job to focus on what really matters. But now, with an election around the corner, we've got a new Prime Minister acting like he's a friend to older Australians and proclaiming that aged care is a priority for him. Well, I don't buy a word of it and neither does the Australian community.


Mr Morrison, if aged care is such a priority for you, why keep it out of cabinet? If aged care is really a priority for you, when are you going to respond or action the dozens of reviews and reports on aged care that are sitting collecting dust? If this is really a priority for you, why haven't you committed funding to the Aged Care Workforce Strategy Taskforce you so proudly announced last week? And, if you really care about older Australians, when are you going to provide an adequate solution to the home care package waitlist crisis?


As I said, the new Prime Minister is the man behind cuts that have gutted aged care and put the sector under immense pressure. Mr Morrison's cuts to aged care as Treasurer have been listed in this place all week, but I will keep going through them until those opposite step up and take responsibility. One of Mr Morrison's first acts as Treasurer was to slash almost $500 million from the aged-care funding in the 2015 MYEFO. He followed this with an even bigger cut—$1.2 billion from the aged-care funding in the 2016 budget. And, even as the waiting list for home care packages blew out to more than 108,000, Mr Morrison's budget this year did not deliver one extra dollar of funding to aged care—not one extra dollar. And don't forget the 26,000 residential aged-care places he also cut in this year's budget.


The Prime Minister must take responsibility for his part in this. He cannot pretend his cuts as Treasurer were nothing to do with him or that they have had no impact in the community. Mr Morrison's response to his cuts has been appalling. He spent this week belittling his cuts to aged care and accusing us of lying for calling him out on them. You only have to look at the budget papers signed off by the Prime Minister when he was Treasurer. His name is on the papers in black and white. These are the cuts that he's denying. Page 101 of budget paper 2 says, 'The Government will achieve efficiencies of $1.2 billion over four years'. The budget papers don't lie. Under Mr Morrison, aged care received one of the harshest cuts in his budget: $1.2 billion slashed from residential aged-care subsidies for residents. In his budget speech on 3 May 2016, Mr Morrison said, 'In this budget we will continue to cut unnecessary waste'. Mr Morrison, do you still consider aged care to be unnecessary waste?


In budget estimates hearings the same year, the government made it clear that it expected aged-care providers to ensure the same high quality of care would be delivered despite the huge funding cut. Let's be clear: you cannot slash aged care and expect the same level of care to be provided. It just can't happen. You do not fix aged care and the crisis that it's in by cutting the funding.


I remind you that Mr Morrison made this $1.2 billion cut without any idea of the impact it would have on the most vulnerable older members of our community. Well, I can tell you that older Australians are feeling the full impact of this cut. Just look at Monday night's Four Corners program. When Mr Morrison made this cut, he was cutting from those in aged-care homes with the highest and most complex needs. That's what this Prime Minister cut when he was Treasurer. This cut was not about aged-care residents missing out on a glass of wine with their dinner; it was about the frailest and most vulnerable people missing out on things like physiotherapy to manage chronic pain, or the oversight of specialist medications for cardiac conditions, dementia and Parkinson's disease. Mr Morrison's cuts were the difference between receiving physiotherapy to manage chronic pain and living with chronic pain. What a disgrace! The fact that the new Prime Minister could stand in front of the cameras and in the House of Representatives all this week and deny his cuts is unbelievable. Frankly, it tells you everything you need to know about the new Prime Minister and what he's all about. He's a wolf dressed up as a sheep crying crocodile tears. Older Australians deserve better than a Prime Minister who cuts funding to aged care and then lies about it.


Those opposite had it pretty good when they came into government. Labor had done all the heavy lifting to transform our aged-care system with the Living Longer Living Better reforms, and the opposition at that time were part of those deliberations. All those opposite had to do was oversee the rollout of our reforms in a timely manner. But that was too hard for them. They bungled it because they never had their eye on the ball. They've always treated aged care as an afterthought. You only have to think back to when Bronwyn Bishop was the minister, and the kerosene baths, and the Howard government's reputation for the way they treated older Australians. When Mark Butler became the Minister for Mental Health and Ageing, he set about transforming the aged-care sector with the sector, to lead the way. Those who have come after him, the three ministers in the last five years, have failed older Australians.


Those opposite have always underestimated the level of leadership required to oversee the rollout and implementation of aged-care reforms. Mr Morrison says aged care is a priority, but the portfolio still doesn't have a seat at the cabinet table. The current Minister for Aged Care, Ken Wyatt, has good intentions but has been left screaming from the sidelines to progress the reforms that are needed in the aged-care sector. The pattern is clear: Mr Morrison is following in Mr Turnbull's and Mr Abbott's footsteps and he cannot be trusted with aged care. We are in the midst of an aged-care crisis because of the lack of actions by those on the other side of the chamber. 


The government's call for this royal commission is frankly an admission of failure. They have essentially called a royal commission into themselves because they've been in charge. They've had the responsibility as the government for five years, and we have nothing to show for it except an aged-care sector that is in crisis. They've done nothing but fail older Australians at every turn for the past five years, and now they don't know what to do or how to do it. That's what this royal commission is all about. 


The Prime Minister must guarantee that: (1) he will not wait for the royal commission to finish before he starts acting on the issues facing the sector now; and (2) that the royal commission examines the impacts of reduced funding through the Aged Care Funding Instrument; the adequacy of short- and long-term funding of the-aged care sector; the challenges around ensuring there is long-term sustainability of the aged-care system; the adequacies of care requirements for residents in aged-care homes; retirement village living arrangements; poor access to aged-care services in regional, rural and remote Australia, including the dislocation of families; improving transparency of information to consumers, their families and carers; the challenges around ensuring there is a viable well-paid and trained work force now and into the future; and reducing stigma for older Australians. 


This royal commission cannot become their latest excuse to do nothing. There are about 14 reviews, reports and inquiries still sitting on the minister's desk without action, collecting dust. The government has cherrypicked its way through a number of key reports and reviews, but piecemeal solutions for an aged-care system in a deepening crisis are just not good enough. Older Australians and their families deserve better than this. 


The government's lack of response to the dozens of reviews and reports speaks volumes about where they position older Australians on its list of priorities. Take, for example, the interim report from the Senate inquiry into what happened at Oakden in South Australia—the government has had this interim report for almost a year, but has done nothing about it. The committee was presented with overwhelming, heartbreaking reports from families of the poor quality of personal care. The stories and evidence were harrowing and heart-wrenching, and should have been the trigger for the government to take immediate action. Senator Smith, who's in this chamber, was there and heard the same evidence as I did. It was heartbreaking and soul-destroying for those families to have to go through it again. 


Those families have never given up on ensuring that the system is changed—they have been on social media actually commending this government for finally taking some action and calling for this royal commission. But, once again, this government failed to act. It sat on that report. We're at a crucial time in the reform agenda. Older Australians deserve good policies and leadership from government when it counts. After years of inaction, Australia's aged-care system doesn't need more quick fixes from this government; it needs genuine reform backed by real investment. 


Equally concerning in the five years of inaction on workforce development, with the exception of scrapping Labor's $1.5 billion Workforce Compact, the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison governments have shown a complete lack of commitment to Australia's aged-care workforce. Aged-care workforce development is one of the biggest challenges facing the sector. With the workforce expected to increase by 300 per cent in the next 30 years, we have to get this right. 


Disappointingly, despite saying aged care would be a focus of his new government, Mr Morrison has been silent on workforce development and the Aged Care Workforce Strategy Taskforce's strategy, which is also sitting on the minister's desk. His silence on this strategy shows his commitment to his policy area will be little better than his Liberal predecessors. The lack of a response on this strategy fits a disturbing pattern of cover-ups and inaction on aged care from successive Liberal governments. If the Morrison government is truly serious about aged care, it will respond to this strategy immediately and commit funding to it.


The Turnbull government's top priority must be a real plan to address the waiting list for home care packages. If today's response by the representing minister in question time was anything to go by, heaven help us all, particularly those on the waiting list. I have spoken about the waiting list all week. There are 108,000 people waiting. That's from the government's own figures. They were released months after the due date, but they are the most accurate that we have. The June figures are now due to be released but, once again, the government are sitting on them, hoping that they can scratch a few names off them. But the figures the minister quoted today were some 74,000. The real figure is 108,000, with 54,000 of those waiting not receiving any support at all from the Commonwealth government. Some 88,000 of those people on that waiting list are living with dementia. I hope the minister is listening to this. The waiting list for home care packages is no longer tolerable. The minister and this government have a history of delaying this important data. As I said, the June 2018 data is now late, so we can only imagine the 108,000 would be somewhere closer to 115,000 by now. What are you trying to hide? Are you going to sit on this data for another three months while you try to reduce the names on the waiting list so it doesn't look so bad?


Under the government's watch, there are now over 108,000 people who are waiting for home care packages to be able to stay in their own home. This is much better for them as individuals and it's certainly much better for the bottom line of any federal government. These numbers are absolutely shocking; they're appalling. Mr Morrison's aged-care package in the budget was an absolute hoax. It was a joke and it was absolutely inadequate. The waiting list grows by almost 4,000 older Australians in just three months. The 3,500 new home care packages a year you committed in the budget won't come close to keeping pace with the demand.


The minister has already publicly admitted the government will need to consider other interventions to reduce the waiting list. Now is your chance to live up to your words, Prime Minister, and to do something. Failure to act will only see more and more older people passing away on your watch or going into residential care or acute hospitals while they wait for home care packages. As the list grows longer and longer, fresh stories emerge daily of older Australians waiting years for home care. The average wait time according to the government's data for a level 3 or 4 package is not what the minister today responded to in question time when he was saying there's a three month wait for level 1 or 2. Levels 3 and 4 have a 12 month wait, and we know from those who are contacting our offices that it can be up to 18 months. How can the Prime Minister say it's okay for a 94 year old with high-level needs to be told they'll have to wait years for care? The reality is he probably won't be here.


Finally, the Prime Minister must rule out cuts to aged care. The latest leak reported earlier this week revealed that the government is considering a further cut to the Aged Care Funding Instrument of up to $5.4 billion. The Prime Minister's response is to bury his head in the sand—'Nothing to see here; move on; business as usual'—while his ship is sinking. This is shameful. The Liberals are too busy fighting amongst themselves, instead of focusing on what matters. The Prime Minister may have changed, but the government is falling apart at the seams; they're self-imploding. And the people of Australia are sick of it. They are sick of this government's deception and dysfunction. They want a government focused on the issues that matter to them, a big one being the aged-care sector in Australia. I see lots of worried faces on the other side of the chamber, and the reason is that they can't stop talking about themselves; they can't stop fighting amongst themselves.


The Australian people turned off a long time ago. They've given up on this government because every day they see the chaos that reigns on that side of the chamber. What the Australian people want is a strong government, and I don't believe this government can provide it. They can't provide the security that older Australians need. What we need is an election so that we can elect Bill Shorten. He will have a minister for ageing in the cabinet. He will, as he has already committed to, put dementia and ageing as a national priority. What we need is a minister in cabinet who will argue for older Australians. (Time expired)

"Gichuhi, Sen Lucy",LP,2018-09-20,"



Senator GICHUHI
 (South Australia) (16:51):  I'm here today to contribute to this very important debate. This government, our government, takes aged care as one of its top priorities. There is no doubt that Australia's demography is one of an ageing population. The demand for aged-care services is driven by the size and health of the older population.


There are currently over 5.5 million people in this country who will need aged-care services in the next 10 to 20 years. This is what this government is planning about and is funding on. The Australian population is ageing rapidly, with the proportion of people aged 65 years or over in the total population projected to increase from 15.3 per cent in 2017 to 21.8 per cent in 2056, according to the ABS.


This government is very committed to strategically funding this ageing population issue. To accommodate the needs of the rising older population will require a quadrupling of the aged-care workforce by 2050. Our government, this government, is very much aware of the workforce needs. Recent reports on the ageing of baby boomers show that they are eight times more likely to have health problems than the previous generation.


Our government, this government, is so focused on this issue that it has given it a strategic approach that covers not only the short-term and the medium-term but the long-term needs of older Australians. Currently, the number of people over the age of 65 receiving aged-care services exceeds 1.2 million. Of those, 83 per cent are classified as requiring high-level care needs. This government, our government, has recognised that the systems and priorities of those opposite are not enough to cater for the high needs of this ageing population. An estimated 60 per cent of the residents needing high-level care have dementia, at least 40 per cent suffer from chronic pain, over 50 per cent are incontinent and 45 per cent have a sleeping disorder. This government, our government, is aware of these facts. In light of these statistics, it's clear that aged-care funding remains a key and very critical factor to support the welfare of the most vulnerable people in our community.


I am sure that everyone in this chamber agrees that aged care is an issue that hits home for each and every one of us. This should be one of the bipartisan issues. We should come together in a bipartisan fashion and manner to put our heads together and work for all Australians. We all know someone who is receiving some form of aged-care service, whether it is our parents or grandparents. This is not the time to take political capital or capitalise on issues that affect all of us Australians. Old and young: we are all affected by ageing processes.


I'm particularly passionate about aged care because I was honoured to look after my grandmother, who still holds a special place in my heart. She was a woman of strength and wisdom and one of my solid rocks that I stood on. I see so many grandmothers on the streets of this country every day, every hour, and we cannot turn a blind eye or take political capital or take advantage to capitalise on an issue that should be one of the most bipartisan issues this parliament has ever handled at such a critical time. I talk about my grandmother because I link my experience with her to the experience of so many families with elderly parents, elderly grandparents, elderly relatives or just elderly neighbours. In Australia, I encountered aged care while training aged-care workers and nurses. I have had the opportunity to look into the eyes of ageing Australians and wonder if we will be able to give them the dignity and respect that I saw with my grandmother. I wonder how they feel. I wonder what they think.


The need to value and look after our seniors is so central to Australia as a civil and noble society. The need for dignity, respect and freedom has to be maintained and preserved, and we can't afford to make political gains and capital and mileage out of our seniors. As a society, we can never forget that older Australians are the people on whose shoulders we stand. We are whom we are today because they worked, they paid taxes and they looked after us when we were younger. Now it is our time to come together in a bipartisan fashion and give back to our seniors.


Because of this, our government, this government, is providing record aged-care funding of $19.8 billion this year. Our government is not—and I repeat 'is not' with 'not' in capital letters—planning any changes that will reduce funding to aged-care services. Annual funding will increase to record levels by $5 billion—yes, $5 billion—over the forward estimates, from $18.6 billion in 2017-18 to $23.6 billion in the 2021-22 financial year. For this government, aged-care spending has increased by more than an average of six per cent each year. That is an average of $1 billion of extra support for older Australians each year. Our government is adding an additional 13,500 residential aged-care places and 775 short-term restorative places. Since the last budget, this government has been delivering 20,000 new high-level home-care packages to support senior Australians to remain at home longer.


This government is doing what it can, what is needed, to support our senior older Australians remain in their homes for as long as they can and for as long as they want. By 2021-22 more than 74,000 high-level home care places will be available, an increase of 86 per cent from 2017-18. Over $100 million investment in mental health services for ageing Australians in the community and in residential care has been provided, consisting of a $20 million trial to improve mental health services for Australians over 75 years of age, and $82.5 million in new mental health services for people with a diagnosed mental disorder living in residential aged-care facilities.


Last week, this government announced an additional $16 million to police the quality in aged-care services and providers. This government is also bringing forward $90 million this financial year to support quality in residential aged care and aged-care capital works in regional, rural and remote Australia. The government is also examining options for a more stable, certain and efficient residential care funding tool to replace the current Aged Care Funding Instrument, which has been recognised by the independent Aged Care Financing Authority as no longer being contemporary and as inefficient, too subjective and lacking stability in outcomes. Development of a new funding tool is being led by the University of Wollongong, who will provide a report to the government by the end of this calendar year. Any new tool adopted by our government will involve a better and more efficient way of allocating the funding pool. Let me reiterate once more that our government is not considering any options that would reduce, in any way, manner, form or shape, the funding pool.


This government is committed to ensuring that Australians in the aged-care system are better cared for. The need to value and look after our seniors is central to any civil and noble society. Their need for dignity, respect and freedom has to be maintained and preserved. We cannot afford to take political gains or political capital from such an issue affecting very vulnerable members of the community. This government knows that our older Australians are the people on whose shoulders we all stand on. This government has demonstrated that senior Australians' needs are a top priority.

"Bilyk, Sen Catryna",ALP,2018-09-20,"



Senator BILYK
 (Tasmania) (17:06):  I welcome the fact that Senator Polley has raised this very important issue for debate this afternoon. Before I begin my contribution, I would like just to congratulate my two colleagues the shadow minister for ageing and mental health, the Hon. Julie Collins MP, and Senator Polley, for the great job they've done in the area of aged care, holding the government to account and developing our policies, because we need a strong alternative to this government. The government's cuts in recent budgets to the aged-care sector have been cruel and unwarranted, and they need to be looked into.


Labor has been saying for a long time that the aged-care system is in a state of national crisis. Unfortunately, when the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Bill Shorten, raised the crisis in the sector in parliament earlier this year, the government attacked him and accused him of fearmongering. They even claimed his comments were akin to elder abuse.


Australians think of our country as a caring nation. We should respect our older Australians for all they have contributed to the nation and all that they contribute still. Sadly, we have seen the concerning images in the recent Four Corners program, and it is clear—very, very clear—that actions need to be taken. Labor is appalled and angry about the vision and stories that aired during Four Corners recently.


Like every other Australian that saw that, I was saddened to see the crisis in our nation's aged-care system, particularly the standard of care being delivered in some nursing homes. Australians, across our nation, are genuinely shocked about the abuses that have happened to elderly Australians—beloved elderly family members who deserve quality care. We must give elderly Australians the love, the care and the respect that they so mightily deserve.


Labor welcomes the aged-care royal commission. It is an important instrument that will get to the heart of the issues in the aged-care sector. We're glad that the government has called for one, but it wasn't that long ago that Minister Wyatt and the government were claiming that we didn't need a royal commission. However, just before that episode of Four Corners was aired, suddenly they were calling for a royal commission. Let me say, that does not absolve the government of their own contribution to this crisis.


After five years in government, every one of those people opposite must accept some responsibility for what's happening today in the aged-care system. The Prime Minister, Mr Morrison, must take responsibility for much of the crises that we are seeing. As Treasurer of Australia, it was he who was responsible for the cuts of $1.2 billion from the aged-care sector in the 2016-17 budget. This cut to aged care came on top of the almost $500 million from aged-care funding Mr Morrison cut in the 2015 MYEFO. This money was taken out of the aged-care budget and hasn't come back. Although the government keeps disputing the $1.2 billion figure, let me make it clear that it's in the government's own words that we can actually confirm the cut. You only have to look at the budget papers signed off by the current Prime Minister when he was Treasurer. His name is on these papers in black and white. The cuts he's denying can be found on page 101 of the 2016-17 budget paper 2, where it says:


The Government will achieve efficiencies of $1.2 billion over four years through changes to the scoring matrix of the Aged Care Funding Instrument (ACFI) that determines the level of funding paid to aged care providers. The Government will also reduce indexation of the Complex Health Care component of the ACFI by 50 per cent in 2016‑17 and establish a $53.3 million transitional assistance fund to support providers.


Further, on the same page, the government states:


The savings from this measure will be redirected by the Government.


So how do you get savings without a cut? Of course at the time of the 2016-17 budget, there were strong voices in the sector opposed to this $1.2 billion cut. Those voices including the AMA, the Aged Care Guild and Catholic Health Australia. At the time, the Sydney Morning Herald reported:



The Turnbull government's $1.2 billion of aged care funding cuts could force smaller providers to close down or sell up and may lower standards of care for the elderly, industry groups warn.


Even the share market reacted, with the same article stating:


Investors reacted negatively to the news, sending the shares of listed aged care providers Regis, Japara, and Estia down 6.6 per cent, 3.8 per cent, and 2.6 per cent respectively.


The government cannot rewrite history, no matter how much they would like to and no matter how much they've tried. It's clear that Mr Morrison as Treasurer used aged-care funding to prop up his budget without considering the elder Australians who would be impacted. We have now had five years of the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison government, but when will they start taking responsibility for the outcomes of government? Have they forgotten that they've controlled the Treasury purse strings all this time?


The royal commission must examine the impact of the Liberals' years of cuts, because you can't fix aged care by cutting funding to it. It's sadly inevitable that, in some areas, standards in the care of older Australians have begun to slip under the weight of these cuts. This government has failed to take the care of older Australians seriously enough, and you can see that through their ministerial arrangements. The coalition does not have a minister for ageing, and the aged-care portfolio is not even included in the cabinet. And due to their continuous infighting, we have seen three different aged-care ministers across the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison governments, who have had carriage of the Living Longer Living Better reforms for five years but who have all failed to do little if any reforms across the ageing portfolio.


Sadly, the current minister for aged care, Mr Ken Wyatt, has struggled to progress further reform that is needed in aged care because Mr Morrison, the current PM, appears to view aged-care funding as a commodity to be cut and used elsewhere. There have been several inquiries into the aged-care sector which the government hasn't acted on. More than a dozen reviews, reports and inquiries still sit on the minister's desk without being actioned. They just sit there collecting dust. Maybe they're being used as book ends. Maybe he rests a cup of coffee on them, who knows, but what's happening is they're not being acted on.


The government's cherrypicked its way through a number of key reports and reviews leading to aged-care reform now being piecemeal in nature. The quality standards and reporting system aren't working. There aren't enough aged-care workers and they aren't given enough pay, respect or support. The role of nurses and personal care workers in the care of our older Australians is critical and will only become increasingly important. The number of people aged 85 years is rapidly increasing and it's projected to double by 2032. We'll need to see a tripling of the aged-care workforce in the next 30 years to provide a high standard of living and care for this growing proportion of older Australians. It's predicted that the aged-care workforce requirements will need to increase from around 366,000 currently to around one million people in 2050. It is clear that the government's got to ensure that we have an adequately skilled and equipped aged-care workforce to care for our rapidly ageing population.


The savage cuts hit older Australians in residential aged-care facilities the hardest, with a 50 per cent cut to the indexation of complex health care subsidies. Prime Minister Morrison and the Liberals cannot be trusted to ensure that older Australians get the aged-care services that they need.


Outside of residential aged care, we also have the majority of older Australians who are receiving care in their homes. This is another area that's been mismanaged by the government—the home care package waitlist. The government has a history of delaying reporting on this important data. The March 2018 quarter was delayed by three months and the June 2018 data is now late, even after the minister committed to releasing this data on time. They're just sitting on the data, and I'm not sure why. I have to ask: why are they just sitting on that data? Is it something that they don't want us to see? Whatever the reason, it's completely unacceptable.


Under the government's watch there are now more than 108,000 people on the home care package waiting list, including 88,000 people with high needs, many of whom are living with dementia. Around 54,000 of these older Australians who are waiting have no home care package at all. Those are 54,000 Australians who are not getting the support they need to shower and get ready in the morning or with cleaning around their homes or with any number of issues. That support could make life just a little bit easier for them. Those are 54,000 Australians who do not receive the dignity or live with the dignity that they deserve. We should judge ourselves as a nation by how we treat our elderly. How can the government say it's treating older Australians with dignity when more than 100,000 of them are waiting for care? Labor's called on the government time and time again to fix this crisis but, like the 108,000 older Australians, we're still waiting for action.


Today in question time I asked the Minister representing the Minister for Senior Australians and Aged Care, Senator Scullion, three simple questions. These questions were very straightforward: how many older Australians are currently on the government's home care package waitlist; how many older Australians currently on the government's home care package waitlist are receiving no home care package at all; and how long are some older Australians being forced to wait for their approved package level or, worse still, are without any home care package at all? I was hugely disappointed by Minister Scullion's answers to my questions on this issue—hugely disappointed!—because he just made motherhood statements about keeping senior Australians in their homes, and his answers, when he finally got to some numbers, used outdated data to try and understate the demand. He wouldn't even use an accurate figure. He used a figure from 31 December 2017, almost nine months out of date, when his own minister had used the 108,000 figure earlier. That's the government's own number. That's Minister Wyatt's own number, and Minister Scullion couldn't use it. They were absolutely shameful and disastrous answers to three very simple questions.


Then we had Minister Canavan arguing that asking for this information in question time shouldn't even be allowed—seriously!—and that the minister shouldn't even be expected to answer any question that involves statistics. It was utterly unbelievable, but I know why Senator Canavan did that. He did it because he was trying to save Minister Scullion from his own ineptitude and the rest of the nation from seeing it. If the minister isn't able to answer a basic question, maybe he should consider a different career choice.


Australia needs a national dementia strategy to help it deal with the growing toll that this disease is taking on senior Australians. Many older Australians living in aged-care facilities have dementia, and they're simply not getting the high level of care that they need. A very dear friend of mine recently spent her final weeks and months living with dementia in an aged-care facility. Over the past few years and months, I've seen a lot of what happens in this area. I've seen the limitations of staff. I've seen that staff aren't able to take the time they would like to care for their clients. I've seen the understaffing and overworking of the carers and staff who are doing their very, very best under huge pressure to save both time and money.


We can't wait for the results of the royal commission to start undertaking important reforms. They have to start now. The quality standards and the reporting system aren't working. There aren't enough aged-care workers, as I have said before—and I gave the numbers earlier about how much the system needs to grow because we've got such an ageing population. They aren't given enough pay, respect or support. 


Just earlier this week, I met with representatives from the Health and Community Services Union who cover workers in this area in Tasmania. Their members are passionate about providing high-quality care for the senior Australians that they look after. Can you imagine though how hurt these members were when former Prime Minister Turnbull told them to get a better job. That tells us what this government thinks about aged-care workers and aged care in general. No wonder the sector's in crisis, if this is the attitude of the government towards workers. 


The union and their members are extremely concerned about the crisis the aged-care sector is in because, unfortunately, not all operators do the right thing by their clients or their staff. The union emphasised to me just the other day the need for accredited training and increasing the size of the workforce. We also need to ensure workers get appropriate levels of pay which will drive professionalism in the industry and give workers the security to make major decisions and to stay in the industry. It's not good enough to tell aged-care workers to get a better job. They already have a good job; they just need to be recognised for it and provided with the resources they need to be able to do it well. 


In conclusion, the Prime Minister has been the architect of cuts that have gutted aged care and put the sector under immense pressure. We're in the midst of an aged-care crisis because of the actions, and the lack of actions, by those on the other side of the chamber. And when the now Prime Minister cut $1.2 billion from the funding for people with complex and higher needs in the 2016 budget that actually contributed dramatically to the problems in the system. The Prime Minister must take responsibility. He cannot pretend his cuts as Treasurer were nothing to do with him or that they had no impact. He cannot keep misleading people. The cuts were in his own budget papers, and the stakeholders reacted to the cuts at the time. 


The royal commission must investigate the impact of the Prime Minister's cuts to the sector when he was Treasurer. The government must not exclude their cuts from the royal commission's terms of reference and hide from the responsibility that will lie at their feet. So, while the chaotic and divided Liberals have fought amongst themselves, the care of older Australians has been sadly neglected. We must fix this crisis now, because it would be a great injustice to our vulnerable senior Australians to do otherwise.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2018-09-20,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (17:23):  I'm delighted the Labor Party have raised this matter for debate because it allows me to, first of all, congratulate all of those community and other aged-care facilities that do such a wonderful job for our older Australians. It allows me to recognise carers in aged-care facilities and those who help with home help, and I congratulate them on the wonderful work they do. 


This also allows me to talk about the bill coming before the parliament in the not too distant future, the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission Bill. It allows me to talk about the royal commission into aged-care issues that's been announced by our government and it also allows me to remind older Australians about the 'granny tax', as it's called, that the Labor Party propose imposing upon older people. It allows me to talk about the abolition of franking credits, which impact very, very considerably on the incomes of older Australians who are self-funded retirees and who have shares that they get a small income from. They depend on those franking credits, which the Labor Party propose to take away from them.


I think older people well recognise that, from the days when Liberal governments first introduced the age pension to Australia many, many decades ago, it is the Liberal and National parties that have done more for older people and continue to do so. That is because we want to help people who've made a major contribution to our country over many years. We want to reward those who've done such sterling work for our country during their working lives and who now are entitled to their senior years in good care and condition.


I speak with a little authority. My late sister was in an aged-care facility for a number of years in my home town of Ayr, in a facility that was run by the community funded Lower Burdekin Home for the Aged. My mother was there several decades ago, and I still remember the care she got there.


I have an older sister who receives home care, and I'm conscious of what she receives, and my brother-in-law also receives home care. Whilst at times he has some complaints about the service, by and large he recognises—as I recognise and everyone recognises—that it's a wonderful service, supported by the government, which allows people to stay in their homes longer than would have been the case in the past.


A niece of mine actually works in an aged-care facility. I know what a wonderful, caring person she is, and she tells me often about the great experience it is—how it is not just a job but helping people. Most of the staff at the facility have that experience.


I'm also quite well familiar with the Bowen Old People's Home Society, who over the years have provided a wonderful service for that community. Again it's a community run and community funded organisation, with some help from the federal government. I know the one in my own home town. I know the Good Shepherd Home, in Townsville, which does wonderful work there. I know the facility in Ingham. I have had a bit to do with the facility in Tully, further north, and in Innisfail—a great organisation which was the recipient of quite substantial federal government assistance just recently. I'm even conscious of smaller communities to the west of Townsville, out towards Mount Isa, smaller towns whose councils have done wonderful work in providing aged-care facilities—on a very limited status, I might say—to their residents so that those residents don't have to leave the community they've lived in all their lives and go into one of the bigger cities to get care in their advancing years.


I've certainly heard stories of some problems at times, but by and large these facilities, particularly those I mentioned but facilities everywhere, do a wonderful job looking after older people. We should recognise the work that is done and thank those who are involved in that particular line of business.


Again, the Labor Party's approach in getting rid of franking credits would have a huge impact on older people. I'm not quite sure where Labor's current policy is. It changes every day or so, depending on what's popular today and what's not popular. I understand they made some changes to it, but that doesn't address the real problem that the Labor Party's policy of taxing older people has evolved.


I do have some more specific points I want to make, but before doing that can I just respond to the previous speaker. I thought her lettuce-leaf style attack on Senator Scullion in this chamber was most disingenuous. She was asking Senator Scullion—who is not the minister for aged care; he represents the minister for aged care—detailed questions about statistics, and she took umbrage at the fact that he didn't immediately have those in his head. Had the question been on Indigenous affairs, on which he is the expert, I'm sure he would have had all of the figures and statistics and the policies and approaches at the front of his mind. But, as he represents the minister for aged care and a number of other ministers, I'm not surprised that he didn't have these detailed, estimates-type questions immediately to mind. As it's turned out from the speech that Senator Bilyk just gave, she had the information anyhow. It amazes me that she was wasting question time asking Senator Scullion for numbers and statistics which she already had. Clearly the Labor Party have very little to ask about and are just filling in time at question time.


I was amused that a previous Labor speaker spoke about how we, being the government, were concentrating on internal matters of our party, when, except for today, every question asked by the Labor Party at question time this week has not been about jobs, aged care, the economy, workers or infrastructure; they've all been about the Liberal Party. And the Labor Party have the gall in this debate to attack us for looking inwardly at ourselves, when their complete focus this week has been on anything but the issues that are of importance to Australians!


The home care industry has over the years had some problems—as I say, in the minority of cases. But, as a result, our government set up an inquiry into that. We got Ms Kate Carnell, a well-known public figure and former Chief Minister of the Australian Capital Territory, and Professor Ron Paterson to have a look at the industry and make recommendations about what needs to be done. As a result of the recommendations of the Carnell-Paterson review, the government made some announcements in the 2018-19 budget to establish a new commission from 1 January 2019, and that is what is dealt with in the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission Bill, which I understand has been introduced into the other place.


The commission brings together the functions of the Aged Care Quality Agency and the Aged Care Complaints Commissioner. Further work will be undertaken next year to bring the aged-care regulatory functions of the Department of Health into the commission from 1 January 2020. This reform is part of a two-year agenda to strengthen and enhance the care regulation to protect and assure the quality of care provided to aged-care consumers. Consumers, of course, are at the heart of the reforms, and the commission's objectives will be to protect and enhance the safety, health and wellbeing, and quality of life of aged-care consumers to promote confidence and trust in the provision of aged care and to promote engagement with aged-care consumers about the quality and care of services.


The commissioner will take on the functions currently performed by the Aged Care Complaints Commissioner and the CEO of the Aged Care Quality Agency, with specific functions that also set out and relate to engaging with aged-care consumers in developing and promoting best-practice models for engagement and providers, and also seeking and receiving clinical advice in relation to the functions of the commissioner, which is envisaged to occur through the engagement of the Chief Clinical Adviser, with an expert clinical panel to be established to support the Chief Clinical Advisor.


On aged-care funding reform, the Labor Party, in speeches in this chamber during the week, have clearly showed that, regrettably, they cannot even understand the budget papers. In spite of valiant efforts by various ministers during the week to explain this to Labor Party people, it's clear that they don't know how to pick up one of the budget documents and actually read it. If they did that, they would see that the facts of the matter—not their political misinformation campaign but the facts of the matter—are that annual funding will increase to record levels by $5 billion over the forward estimates, going up from $18.6 billion in the current financial year to $23.6 billion in the 2021-22 financial year. Our government is providing record aged-care funding of almost $20 billion this year.


Aged-care spending has increased by an average of more than six per cent each year during the term of coalition governments. That is, on average, $1 billion of extra support for older Australians each year. We're adding an additional 13,500 residential aged-care places and another 775 short-term restorative places. Based on the latest data, in the current financial year the average Australian government payment, that is subsidy plus supplements, for a permanent resident in residential care was $66,000 per resident. This compares with $53,100 in 2012-13, which listeners might recall was Labor's last full financial year. This is an increase of $12,900 per resident, or a 24.3 per cent increase.


I emphasise again that these are the facts. Labor, unfortunately, as I said, can't read the budget papers. They don't really understand what they say. But anyone listening to this debate, and I'm sure there are a lot of people in the chamber and around Australia who would be interested in this subject, will well remember the Labor approach to figures and benefits that coalition governments give. The Labor approach is: tell any lie you like and make up any story you like; say it often enough and advertise it often enough, and hopefully the public will believe it. You've got to look no further than the last federal election where the Labor Party invented this 'Mediscare' campaign, where one of the bright sparks in the back room said: 'Let's go out and say the government's going to sell Medicare and privatise Medicare. Let's do that. That should get a headline.' They made a major campaign on that falsity. There was not a skerrick of truth in it, as evidence subsequently showed and as we tried to say at the time.


The Labor Party work on the proposition that you can tell any lie at all and that if you say it often enough then enough people might believe it, might agree with it, and change their vote at election time and perhaps change the government. That's what the Labor Party is doing with these aged care attacks. They're not supported by facts. The facts are as I've given them and as my colleague Senator Gichuhi clearly enumerated in the wonderful address she gave to the chamber. I'm sure my colleague Senator Fierravanti-Wells will also elaborate on the facts and figures of the good things that the government is doing.


I conclude my remarks by saying I'm delighted to take part in the debate. It does allow us to highlight the good things our government has done. It does also allow us to clearly demonstrate that Labor has no interest in older people except for how they can tax them to bring in more revenue for the crazy schemes that the Labor Party come up with at election time.

"Fierravanti-Wells, Sen Concetta",LP,2018-09-20,"



Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS
 (New South Wales) (17:41):  I'll start by saying that it's good that Senator Polley has brought this notice of motion on aged care because it does afford me the opportunity to go back in history and put on record, Senator Macdonald, some additional facts—most especially going back to when Labor was in power and what they actually did in the aged-care space. At the 2010 election, then Prime Minister Gillard said that if she was re-elected then aged-care reform would be her second term priority. Of course, during the 2007-2013 term, Labor presided over 20 reviews and inquiries into aged care and ageing issues, including three by the Productivity Commission. Like many of the Gillard government's goals, this was yet another empty statement masked as an achievement.


As I indicated, there were all these reviews when Labor were in government. One of these reviews was, very importantly, the landmark report of the Productivity Commission, which was delivered in 2011. It was a two-volume report entitled Caring for older Australians. At that time, as shadow minister for ageing and for mental health, it was certainly a document that I was very familiar with. Senator Polley comes in here and says, 'Those opposite haven't responded to the latest inquiry.' Let me remind the chamber that it took the Gillard government over 250 days to respond to the 58 recommendations within the Productivity Commission's landmark 2011 report. That response took the form of a $3.7 billion package over five years—of which, can I just underline, less than $580 million was new money. Of course, like most things that those opposite do, the package was announced in April 2012 and it represented an assortment of cherrypicked recommendations with lots of political spin. You can't have a Labor announcement without lots of political spin, can you, Senator Macdonald?



Senator Ian Macdonald interjecting—




Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS:
  Of course, there was myriad fine print that the stakeholders started to understand only after the election. This report was comprehensive and it looked at and recommended a total overhaul of the system. It referred to the structural changes that were going to be needed to meet the needs of our ageing population into the future, and it talked about an ageing population—a significant increase in the number of older people. It talked about the increasing incidence of age related disability and disease, especially dementia. It looked into the rising expectations about the type and flexibility of care that was being received. It looked at community concerns about variability in the quality of care. It looked at the relative decline in the number of informal carers and, most importantly, it looked at the need for significantly more nurses and personal care workers with enhanced skills, such was the breadth of this report. As I said, in the end, all those opposite did was cherry-pick this report and, may I say, not very successfully.


What was clear from their much-lauded Living Longer Living Better package was that everyone except full-paying pensioners would pay more for their care. At the time, we did not oppose this package but, in the end, what we are seeing is that, today, we are now paying the price of this policy and the failure of those opposite to take the necessary reform that they should have taken when they were given this opportunity. Of course, whilst we saw that packages were increased, nevertheless, it came at a price. We saw fees capped. We saw fees increased. Also, there was means testing for the cost of residential care. 


Senator Polley also asserted that we failed to look at retirement living. I would remind Senator Polley that retirement villages are actually under the auspices of state governments. They're not under the auspices of the federal government. If I recall my consultation with the sector at the time, I believe that there's actually been work done on this at the federal-state level and there is no appetite for retirement villages to be regulated by the Commonwealth.


I came, and have come, to this area with experience. At age 23, I was the founding board director of an aged-care facility in Wollongong. As I said, I was the shadow minister before the 2013 election. During my time as shadow minister, there were about 2,400 aged-care facilities in Australia at that time and I visited almost a third of those aged-care facilities. There is an overwhelming number of very, very good aged care-facilities in this country. Often you would walk into an aged-care facility and externally it may not be the most luxurious place, but what is vitally important in any aged-care facility is the level of care. It is the attention to the care needs of our older Australians that makes that place a very good aged-care facility.


My father also had dementia and, unfortunately, lost his battle with dementia. My mother is in an aged-care facility at the moment. In any discussion about aged care and aged-care reform, one has to take into account the changing cultural diversity of Australia. One of the things that has always been very dear to my heart is to ensure the care of our older Australians from culturally diverse backgrounds, especially those who get dementia. Often older Australians lose whatever English language they had and revert not just to their language of origin but, in many cases, to their dialect of origin, and that creates complications. 


Why have I gone through this? I have gone through this because, going back to the 2013 election when those opposite say that they undertook massive reform of the aged-care sector, we, at that time, understood the important work that the Productivity Commission had undertaken and our 2013 election policy took into account the Productivity Commission report and its implementation. That meant the system needed a major overhaul, not just tinkering.


I have to commend Minister Wyatt for the work he has done. He is certainly moving in this direction. There is, of course, more work to be done. But what is really important is the political will. It's all very well for those opposite to come in here and bleat about the need for reform, but any reform in this area needs to have strong bipartisan support, because you need political will to undertake this reform. We cannot have those opposite saying that they want reform but then, all of a sudden, when you do put forward propositions—which at times may be difficult—doing what they usually do, and that is politicise and scaremonger in relation to these issues, as they have done in the past.


Let me look at some of the issues. As has been said, annual funding will increase to record levels—by $5 billion over the forward estimates—from $18.6 billion in 2017-18 to $23.6 billion in 2021-22. We are providing record aged-care funding of almost $20 billion this year. Aged-care spending has increased by an average of more than six per cent each year. That is, on average, $1 billion of extra support for our older Australians each year. We are also adding an additional 13,500 residential aged-care places and 775 short-term restorative places. Since the last budget we are delivering 20,000 new high-level home care packages to support our older Australians to remain at home, and by 2021-22 over 74,000 high-level home care places will be available. That is an increase of 86 per cent on 2017-18. Also important is our investment in the mental health services of our older Australians in the community and in residential aged care to improve mental health services, especially for our older Australians who are aged 75 years and over, and provide new mental health services in residential aged-care facilities.


Of course, it is also necessary to police quality care in our aged-care system. We are also bringing forward $90 million this financial year to support quality in residential aged care and aged-care capital works in regional, rural and remote Australia. We are also examining options for a more stable, certain and efficient residential care funding tool to replace the current Aged Care Funding Instrument, which has been recognised by the independent Aged Care Financing Authority as no longer being contemporary—as being inefficient, too subjective and lacking the necessary stability in achieving outcomes. The development of the new funding tool is being led by the University of Wollongong—of which I am very proud; Wollongong having been where I was born and raised and where my electorate office is at the moment. The University of Wollongong will provide a report to the government by the end of this calendar year. Of course, any new tool that is adopted by the government will, of necessity, involve a better and more efficient way of allocating the funding pool. We are not considering any options that would reduce the funding pool.


I would now like to move to the specifics of the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission Bill, which contributes to our government's commitment to ensure that our older Australians in aged care will be better cared for. This bill gives effect to the government's announcement in the 2018-19 budget to establish the new commission from 1 January next year, as part of providing for better quality of care for consumers of aged-care services in Australia. At this point, I would like to pick up on a comment that Senator Bilyk made. She said that at the moment the current framework isn't working. I'd remind Senator Bilyk—perhaps she can think back to that time—that the current framework was part of the Rudd so-called health reforms. Remember those reforms that gave us 13 new agencies and a total blowout of bureaucrats? This was one of the agencies that was set up, which was lauded as part of this package that I spoke about before—the Living Longer Living Better package, which was supposed to ensure that this quality in our aged-care services would be maintained. Perhaps I can remind Senator Bilyk: it may not be working, but you set it up and so you do bear some responsibility for the issues that have arisen.


The introduction of this commission is also a direct response to the findings and recommendations of the review of the national aged-care regulatory process, which was undertaken by Kate Carnell and Ron Paterson. This commission will bring together the functions of the Australian Aged Care Quality Agency and the Aged Care Complaints Commissioner, and further work will be undertaken next year to bring the aged-care regulatory functions of the Department of Health into the commission from 1 January 2020. I have to say at this point, this will rectify some of the major errors that were made by those opposite when they set up these huge bureaucracies. In the end, these bureaucracies were falling over each other and overlapping responsibilities and all we ended up getting were more bureaucrats rather than more effective and efficient services.


This reform is part of a two-year agenda to strengthen and enhance aged-care regulation to protect and ensure the quality of care provided to our older Australians. And of course our older Australians, our consumers in this space, are at the very heart of our reforms. The objectives of the commission are to protect and enhance the safety, health, wellbeing and quality of life of aged-care consumers; to promote confidence and trust in the provision of aged care; and to promote engagement with aged-care consumers about the quality of care and services.


The commissioner will take on the functions which are currently performed by the complaints commissioner and the chief executive officer of the quality agency, with specific functions also set out that relate to engaging with aged-care consumers in the developing and promotion of best practice models for the engagement of providers; and seeking and receiving clinical advice in relation to the functions of the commissioner, which is envisaged to occur through the engagement of a chief clinical adviser. An expert clinical panel will be established to support the role of the chief clinical advisor. The commissioner will be supported by advice from the Aged Care Quality and Safety Advisory Council. The council will be made up of members with significant expertise in the relevant fields, and they will be empowered to provide the commissioner and the government with advice concerning the functions of the commissioner.


The Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2018 provides for the administrative matters required to transfer the functions and operations of the existing bodies into the new commission. Importantly, this bill provides for the continuation of the appointment of the members of the existing council as members of the new Aged Care Quality and Safety Advisory Council, and will enable the new council to commence operations immediately. It will provide stability and experience in the advice being provided to the commission and to the government. This forms part of the broader aged-care reform agenda announced in 2018-19, which includes further reforms to improve aged-care regulation and to provide greater transparency of the quality in aged care, which will continue to be implemented in the coming months and years.


I conclude with comments in relation to the royal commission. I think the royal commission is important because it will afford people the opportunity to put forward their stories. As I said, the overwhelming majority of aged-care facilities maintain very high standards. We have very dedicated aged-care workers, very dedicated nurses and personal carers that work in this space, and I've had the privilege to meet many of them, particularly at the time when I was the shadow minister in this space. But regrettably, there are instances where standards have fallen—

Senator DEAN SMITH
 (Western Australia—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (18:03):  Earlier in the week, the parliamentary delegation to the Republic of Indonesia provided its report to the parliament, and I'm delighted this evening just to make some comments with regard to that delegation that I participated in in late July this year. The delegation visited Jakarta from 29 July to 1 August and the province of South Sulawesi from 1 to 4 August. 


The delegation's primary objectives were opportunities to strengthen trade, economic cooperation and build cultural relationships through people-to-people links as well as Australia-Indonesia development partnerships for health, education, democratic governance and social inclusion. 


The delegation was of particular interest to me as a senator for Western Australia and someone who is an enthusiast for the Australia-Indonesia relationship but also because of our close geographical position to Indonesia.


The visit to Indonesia also reinforced some important observations recently remarked upon by Prime Minister Morrison. He said on his recent visit:


… Indonesia's success is our success. But it is bigger than that—it is important to our regional and global economy.


As the world's third largest democracy. Fourth most populous nation. The home to the largest Muslim population in the world. The prosperity, harmony and success of Indonesia is a 'must' for our shared global future.


This delegation visit was not only able to combine my deep interest in advocacy for stronger trade between Western Australia and Indonesia but also provided a deeper appreciation for some of the human rights challenges faced in Indonesia.


On the issue of trade, the delegation had an opportunity to explore agricultural issues important to Western Australia's cattle and wheat exports to Indonesia. It's worth reminding the Senate that Indonesia is Australia's largest market for live cattle, accounting for between 50 per cent to 60 per cent of all cattle exported. The delegation also discussed key issues that would ensure the future sustainability of live agricultural trade with both live cattle importers and Indonesian government officials. And it's worth emphasising that live trade is important to both Indonesia and Australia. Building on this key understanding, our discussions turned to the efforts and difficulties experienced by Indonesia in achieving self-sufficiency in meat production, how price sensitive the Indonesian fresh produce market is, the knock-on effects on imports and other important factors such as pricing in Australia, which can be caused by adverse events such as the drought we're experiencing. We discussed the importance of Australia's wheat exports to Indonesia and visited the third largest wheat mill in Indonesia, the PT Eastern Pearl Flour Mill in Makassar, which is part owned by WA grain cooperative, CBH Group. The operation employs over 600 people and has a combined output of 2,650 tonnes of processed grain per day.


The visit came at a significant time in the history of Australia's relationship with Indonesia, taking place just one month before our new Prime Minister, the Hon. Scott Morrison, made his own visit and, in doing so, made the Joint Declaration of Comprehensive Strategic Partnership between Australia and the Republic of Indonesia. It is a strategic partnership built on five pillars: first, enhancing the economic and development partnership between our nations; second, connecting people between our nations; third, securing our national and regional shared interests; fourth, developing deeper marine cooperation; and finally, jointly contributing to the Indo-Pacific's stability and prosperity.


This agreement brings significant economic benefits to all Australians. This agreement will allow over 90 per cent of Australian export goods to enter Indonesia either duty free or under significantly improved preferential arrangements by 2020. Indonesia will guarantee the automatic issue of import permits for live cattle, frozen beef, mutton, feed grains, rolled steel coil, citrus products, and potatoes. These highlights are critical as 575,000 live cattle will be duty free in one year. Dairy tariffs will be reduced or removed. Around 455 semi loads of oranges will be duty free in year 1. There will be duty free access every year for enough steel to make 176,000 Colorbond roofs or five Sydney Harbour Bridges and greater opportunities for our tertiary institutions, not only vocational education institutions but—increasingly importantly—our universities.


For Western Australia the upside is tremendous. Western Australian grain growers will be some of the biggest beneficiaries of this agreement. Despite exporting 25 per cent of our total annual wheat exports to Indonesia, Australia doesn't supply any feed wheat to Indonesia. This agreement will allow up to $150 million worth of agricultural feed grains to be supplied to Indonesia duty free, potentially adding up to 25 per cent of the value of wheat exports to Indonesia. This deepening of our trade relationship has been particularly well received by WA farmers and their farming associations in my home state of Western Australia. 


I'd like to extend my thanks to the officials in the Australian Embassy in Jakarta, particularly for the special efforts they took to introduce into the delegation visit a series of issues much more sensitive to Australia's relationship with Indonesia but very critical in Australia's global efforts to improve the human rights and conditions of people living across our region. As co-chair of the Australian group of Parliamentarians Against the Death Penalty and chair of the Parliamentary Liaison Group for HIV Blood-Borne Viruses and STIs, the opportunity to meet with various civil society groups about these issues was important and enlightening. The meetings gave the delegation an opportunity to highlight Australia's recent and long-standing work in pursuing the global abolition of the death penalty, Australia's strategy for abolition of the death penalty and our commitment to make this issue a focus of our work as a member on the Human Rights Council of the United Nations. In Australia, we recognise that, for some countries, the move towards abolition of the death penalty will be gradual and that a staged, sequenced approach may be the most effective, depending on a particular country's circumstances. This is an important and ongoing dialogue with all of our neighbours across the region.


We know that Indonesia appeared before the Human Rights Council for its Universal Periodic Review in May 2017. During that review, Australia made a number of recommendations to Indonesia, including that it enhance safeguards on the use of the death penalty, including adequate and early legal representation for cases which could attract the death penalty, nonapplication of the death penalty to those with mental illness, revising the criminal code to accord with relevant international human rights law and obligations, and reinstating a moratorium on the use of the death penalty; finalise the investigation of all human rights cases in Papua; prevent discrimination on any grounds, including sexual orientation and gender identity; and continue efforts to reduce violence against women and girls.


We also know that Indonesia is facing a serious challenge regarding efforts to prevent HIV transmission. Immediately prior to our visit, Human Rights Watch highlighted that the marginalisation of Indonesia's LGBTI community was fuelling a HIV epidemic and that HIV rates had increased fivefold since 2007. The prevalence of HIV among gay men in Indonesia surged from five per cent in 2007 to 25 per cent in 2015, despite the government making inroads against the disease in the broader population. From 2008 to 2016, Australia provided $126.5 million to HIV prevention testing and treatment in 14 provinces across Indonesia, including Papua and West Papua. Australia currently provides further funding to HIV in Indonesia through support to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria both bilaterally to support Indonesia's Country Coordinating Mechanism and multilaterally through the health strategies branch; and, most recently, to UNAIDS through a $320,000 grant from the health strategies branch in June of this year. These are issues that require careful and considered approaches which Australia may be able to bring the full extent of its own experiences, understanding and success to assist Indonesia in managing this critically important public health issue.


Finally, may I commend Australia's diplomats in Jakarta and Makassar for their professionalism and remark on the exemplary work they do for our nation. In Jakarta, a special thanks to Ms Kirsten Bishop, the acting minister counsellor for governance and human development; Ms Carly Main, who accompanied us across Indonesia; and the deputy head of mission, Mr Allaster Cox, who kept a watchful eye over the delegation in Jakarta. In Makassar, a special thanks to our consul general, Mr Richard Matthews; our consul, Mr Sean Turner; Mr Aaron Corbett; and Ms Paula Waring from the parliament, who acted as the delegation secretary.


There can be a no more important relationship for Australia than its relationship with Indonesia. It's one that brings significant opportunities. It's also one that brings significant challenges, but, as demonstrated by the new Prime Minister's most recent visit to Indonesia, the future is one of brightness, strength and cooperation, and great shared interest in the peace and prosperity of the Asia-Pacific region.
