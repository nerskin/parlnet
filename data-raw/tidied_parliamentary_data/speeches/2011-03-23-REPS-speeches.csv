"Ferguson, Martin, MP",ALP,2011-03-23,"—On behalf of the Minister for the Arts, I move:
That, in accordance with section 5 of the Parliament Act 1974, the House approve the following proposal for work in the Parliamentary Zone which was presented to the House on 21 March 2011, namely: Installation of “The Prime Ministers” artwork.
In doing so I indicate that the National Capital Authority has received a works approval application from Arts ACT for the installation of the Prime Ministers artwork to be located at the intersection of Walpole Crescent and Queen Victoria Terrace, Parkes in the Parliamentary Zone.
The artwork comprises a lifelike reproduction in bronze of a 1945 photograph of former prime ministers John Curtin and Ben Chifley as they walk from the Kurrajong Hotel in Barton to work at the provisional Parliament House, now known as Old Parliament House.
Approval of both houses is sought under section 5(1) of the Parliamentary Act 1974 for the proposed works in the Parliamentary Zone.
I commend this motion to the House.

"Fletcher, Paul, MP",LP,2011-03-23,"—When I was rudely interrupted last night, I was saying all of us in this place are united by our pride. That is the point at which I stopped—and obviously that sentence could admit of many possible ways in which it might be completed—but the particular aspect that I wish to point to, in which I say that all of us in this place are united by our pride, is our pride in the fact that Australia is one of the world’s great democracies. We are one of the world’s oldest democracies and we are one of the world’s most successful democracies. Clearly, at the base, at the foundation, of being a successful democracy is to have a voting system of integrity—a system in which the people can have confidence and a system which is beyond reproach in its operation in reflecting the people’s will in selecting their parliamentary representatives.
It follows from that that it is of the first importance to protect the integrity of the voting system by ensuring that persons who claim to be entitled to vote can demonstrate that entitlement and that there is no risk of persons who claim to be entitled to vote but are not in fact entitled to vote being able to lodge a vote and having that vote counted. It is of the first importance that there is no risk that such a scenario can come to pass.
When you consider that it is often the case that there are results in particular divisions determined by very narrow counts, it adds weight to the conclusion that we must be scrupulous in protecting the integrity of the voting system and scrupulous in ensuring that not one person who is not entitled to do so under the law is able to cast a vote. Let me instance just one recent result which demonstrates that proposition. In the seat of Bowman in the 2007 election, if a mere 33 votes had changed direction, the result would have been different—and, I venture to suggest, this parliament would have been a vastly poorer place had the present member for Bowman not been returned, as he happily was, albeit only very narrowly.
In the ordinary course of events, persons who are on the roll and can demonstrate that—because their name is there in front of the returning officer or AEC officer when they turn up to vote—are permitted to vote with no further formalities required. They have carried out the necessary formalities in the exercise of getting on the roll. But that is not the scenario we are talking about in this legislation. We are talking about people wishing to cast a provisional vote, and a provisional vote, if I may remind the House, is a vote cast in circumstances where an elector’s name cannot be found on the roll or the name has already been marked off the roll. The law as it stands states that, in these exceptional circumstances, there is a requirement that the person who has turned up at the polling booth asserting a right to cast a vote but whose name cannot be found on the roll or whose name is on the roll but is marked off as having already voted, is required to provide proof of identity.
As I have already observed in the earlier proportion of these bifurcated remarks, it is not unusual in our society to be asked to produce identification. Frankly, it is slightly surprising to see the confected indignation from the other side of the chamber at the requirement that identification be produced in the circumstances I have just described—circumstances I think we can all agree are exceptional and very much in the minority.
The proposition that I put to the House is, first of all, that it is very important that we protect the integrity of our voting system. That is of the first importance, given the reputation that this nation has as one of the world’s great democracies, a reputation that I am sure all of us in this place are united in our determination to protect. The second proposition I wish to put to the House is that the costs of requiring identification in these circumstances are modest and the benefits are significant. The report of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters concludes that some 80 per cent of persons in this category—that is, seeking to cast a provisional vote—were able to provide identification. In other words, the claimed burden of this requirement is nowhere near as great as those on the other side of the chamber would have us believe.
We also heard further confected indignation about the remarkably onerous nature of this obligation—again remembering that it is a relatively small proportion of people who face this obligation because either their name is not on the roll or it is on the roll but when the official goes to cross out the name he or she finds it has already been crossed out. It is not, I would submit, an unusually onerous requirement of people in these circumstances to provide identification. As a requirement in terms of individual responsibility, I suggest it is not an onerous one. The costs of the present arrangement in public policy terms and in terms of the imposition on individuals are modest indeed. The benefits are significant, because they go to preserving the confidence of all Australians in the integrity of our voting system and, in turn, in the integrity of our democracy.
The third point I wish to make—and I do so with some reluctance, but the historical record commands me to make it—is that there are reasons, regrettably, to raise questions about the rationale of those on the other side of the chamber for putting forward this change in the first place. It gives me no pleasure to note that the Labor Party has form in bringing forward changes to the electoral system, the voting system and much of the regulatory apparatus dealing with our democracy which are supposedly motivated by a high-minded concern for the public good but which are in fact substantively driven by a desire to achieve partisan political advantage. You would appreciate, Mr Deputy Speaker Thomson, that it gives me absolutely no pleasure to make this point, but unfortunately the historical record is simply impossible to ignore.
We saw some years ago in Queensland the unedifying spectacle of a former state secretary of the Australian Labor Party, then a serving member of the Queensland parliament, appearing before the Shepherdson inquiry. When he appeared, he was asked about the address at which he had enrolled some years before as a younger man, when he was starting out in the pursuit of his political ambitions. He initially attempted to avoid the question, but after taking a break, presumably to receive legal advice, he returned to the box to advise that it was in fact correct that his name appeared on the roll at that address but it was also correct that he had never actually lived at that address. It was apparently an unfortunate administrative error—such an unfortunate administrative error that the consequence was that he abruptly resigned as a member of the Queensland parliament.
So there is very clear evidence of the Labor Party—including its most senior officials and, indeed, Labor parliamentarians—seeking to play games with the electoral system in this country for partisan political advantage. It gives me no additional pleasure to note with some concern that this gentleman has now been appointed as a senior executive of the National Broadband Network company at a salary of well over $400,000 a year—
 (Mr KJ Thomson)—I would ask the member for Bradfield to relate his remarks to this bill.
—his principal qualification apparently being that he was a good mate of the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy.
—The member for Bradfield will cease speaking while I make the observation to him that he needs to relate his remarks to the bill before the House, which is a bill concerning provisional voting.
—Mr Deputy Speaker, you are quite right—it is a bill concerning provisional voting. And amongst the policy matters to consider as we assess whether the change which is proposed in this bill is good policy are the implications it will have for the integrity of our voting system, and that necessarily asks us to consider what might be the possible motives of the political party that has brought forward this amendment.
In the state of New South Wales we have also seen the Labor government, after spending years enthusiastically hoovering up donations from certain categories of donors, now banning those donations from tobacco companies, from alcohol companies and from gaming and gambling companies. This is a remarkably late conversion to this new-found standard of virtue, and it could cause any objective observer to ask, ‘How could they be so shameless and transparent?’ Yet this is the party which is putting forward the set of amendments in this bill.
Our voting system is of the highest importance to the integrity of our democracy. The measures which this bill puts forward are not in the public interest. They undermine a well-established and important safeguard, and on this side of the House we say they should be rejected.",REPS,<title>ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM AMENDMENT (PROVISIONAL VOTING) BILL 2011</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,14,1
"Brodtmann, Gai, MP",ALP,2011-03-23,"—I rise today to speak in favour of the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Provisional Voting) Bill 2011. I do so because I fundamentally believe that what this bill will achieve is the correct and moral thing, despite the way that the former speaker was outrageously construing it. It is a fact that in the 2007 federal election over 27,000 votes were rejected at a preliminary scrutiny because of issues over the provision of identity. In 2010, more than 28,000 votes were eliminated—hardly the small number that was suggested by those opposite today. What concerns me about this figure is that, in a later examination of the votes, it was found that the name was in fact on the roll in over 12,000 cases.
I was also shocked to hear that the current state of provisional voting has not always prevailed. In the 2004 election, almost 50 per cent of provisional votes were included in the final count. In the 2007 election, this figure plummeted to 14 per cent. Of the more than 168,000 provisional votes cast, just over 24,000 were counted. Why was this so? Was there a sudden and dramatic increase in potential voter fraud? No, there was not. What actually happened was that the then Howard government decided to change the electoral laws. Perhaps, in a similar fashion to which it was motivated to make changes to laws on the closure of the electoral roll, the Howard government was motivated by the realisation that provisional voters have a tendency not to vote for the coalition. For example, following the 2004 election, the national two-party preferred vote was 53 per cent to 47 per cent in favour of the coalition. This contrasts with the exact opposite which is seen when analysing the two-party preferred breakdown of provisional votes.
Whether or not this was a conscious decision of the previous government to disenfranchise those voters who traditionally did not support them I do not know. What I do know is that, as a result of these changes to both provisional voting and the electoral roll, thousands of Australians who should have been given the chance to choose their government and their representatives were denied their political rights. The kinds of changes that came in 2006 disproportionably affected vulnerable groups—groups we should be encouraging to participate in our electoral system. These include the young, those voting for the first time and people with particular vulnerabilities: the marginalised. While I understand that there is a need to strike a balance between the integrity of the electoral system and the enfranchisement of the people, I do not believe those changes in 2006 were motivated by concerns of integrity, despite what the previous speaker was saying, and nor did they achieve it. It was not a victory for democracy in this country—quite the contrary.
It is a sad truth that in many countries various provisions have been used to disenfranchise voters at elections while still providing for universal suffrage in theory. I note in particular the various Jim Crow laws in the United States that were used so effectively in ensuring that African-Americans were prevented from enrolling and voting in elections. These kinds of laws create obstacle after obstacle that a potential voter must overcome in order to achieve what is a fundamental human right. Article 21.3 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states:
The will of the people shall be the basis of the authority of government; this will shall be expressed in periodic and genuine elections which shall be by universal and equal suffrage and shall be held by secret vote or by equivalent free voting procedures.
I believe it is our responsibility as members of this parliament to ensure that Australia lives up to this article. I believe we must, wherever we can, make such laws as enhance the enfranchisement of the Australian people.
There are a number of legitimate reasons why a voter may have to cast a provisional vote. First is if their name cannot be found on the certified list. Others are if their name is marked as already having voted, if there is some question about identity or if the voter is on the silent elector list. As the law stands, a voter is required to provide proof of identity by the first Friday following the polling day. If it is not provided, the vote is removed from consideration. There are any number of reasons why a voter may not be able to provide appropriate identity—for example, if they do not have a drivers licence or a passport and so have difficulty in supplying appropriate documentation. There is also a stunning contradiction at the heart of the law as it presently stands. This requirement to provide proof of identity applies only to provisional votes and to no other form of declaration vote. That is right: no other method of voting is subject to this rule. This leads to an absurd situation. If the voter had instead decided to lodge an absentee ballot, their vote would in fact have been counted. This contradiction exposes the incoherence of the provision and possibly also the discrimination that I fear lies behind it.
Significantly, the provision disproportionately affects more vulnerable groups compared to others in our society. There are those who for reasons of homelessness, disability or other vulnerability find it difficult to navigate the bureaucratic complexity of modern life. And it is not only the vulnerable who find this difficult; for many, the vicissitudes of life have placed burdens and responsibilities on them that consume all their energy. I have some sympathy for those labouring under the burdens of everyday life. Coming from the background that I do—being the daughter of a mother who single-handedly raised my sisters and me, I can readily understand that having the time to deal with bureaucratic niceties can be a bit of a luxury. For reasons that are sadly familiar, those who are in this situation are often, if not mostly, women. I can therefore understand why some people simply do not have the ability or time to provide the documentation required under the current legislation. This does not mean that they are any less deserving of a vote at our elections—any less entitled to that most fundamental of human rights: enfranchisement.
A number of organisations, including the Australian Electoral Commission, support this legislation. It would indeed be a cause for celebration if those opposite could bring themselves to join in with their support and atone for their imposition of a discriminatory obstacle to the exercise of a political right. Sadly, this does not seem to be the case. This legislation will enhance and modernise our electoral system and our democracy, and I commend it to the House.",REPS,<title>ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM AMENDMENT (PROVISIONAL VOTING) BILL 2011</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,14,1
"Briggs, Jamie, MP",LP,2011-03-23,"—I rise to speak on the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Provisional Voting) Bill 2011 and follow the member for Canberra in doing so. I hate to disappoint the member opposite, but we will not be supporting the bill. We think it is a bad bill. We have thought it is a bad bill the couple of times it has been presented to the parliament, and that is because in 2006 the Howard government did the right thing and brought in provisions ensuring the integrity of the electoral roll—and that is ultimately the question that we are debating here. On this side of the House, the understanding is that you need to have an electoral roll that has the utmost integrity and that enfranchises as many people as it can but ensures there is no fraud. That is important because we are very fortunate to have the wonderful democracy that we do in Australia. We have arguably the best democracy in the world. We have free and open elections that are free from questions about corruption and legitimacy and that allow governments even in questionable circumstances like last year’s, where we had the situation of this parliament—a hung parliament. There has been no question put in relation to the legitimacy of the government.
Even in the great democracy of the United States we have seen presidential elections which have dragged on for weeks and months because of questions about their electoral system and their electoral rolls. And it is not just the events surrounding George W. Bush’s election; well back even to the famous John F. Kennedy election in the early sixties there were questions about Lyndon Johnson’s accession to the Senate. We do not suffer from those same problems because we have an electoral roll which is protected from question. It is held above accusations that it has been rorted in some way. The problem with lessening the protections in it is that you raise questions about the validity or integrity of the roll. It is interesting that at the 2010 election, of the provisional voters who voted in that fashion, 80 per cent of them provided evidence of their identity at the polling place on the election day and a following 16 per cent provided evidence of their identification in the required time frame afterwards. So we are talking about a very small percentage who did not meet those requirements. And I do not think the requirements as put by the members opposite are as onerous as they would like us to believe.
We of course need identification for various things in our society: to access government payments, to drive a car or to travel, you need a form of identification—and rightly so. And rightly so we also should for our electoral roll. I think there is a reasonable discussion, which we have had in this place previously, about the requirements for voter identification when enrolling and voting on election day. I think we should do everything we can to ensure the roll is protected in that way. So the bill is based on a premise from the Labor Party that the voters they are supposedly trying to enfranchise are more likely to vote for the Labor Party than they are for the Liberal Party, and that is what this is about. This is not about improving our election system or improving our electoral roll. This is some sort of political view that by opening this up and making it easier you have more opportunity for the Labor Party to get more votes than this side of the House.
This Saturday we have another election in Australia and I do not think there will be too many questions about the integrity of the result. I think it will be pretty clear—in fact, I think some betting agencies have already decided what the result will be, which does seem to be a little early. Again, it goes to the confidence that people have in our electoral system. At a time when we are talking about using the internet more often, the AEC is walking down the path—I think rightly—of looking at the way that people can enrol and keep their details updated. I am sure all members in this place would appreciate that the quicker we get updates the better it is for members of parliament, the better it is for people to have the most recent updates, particularly for young people who move around a bit. The easier we make it for people to keep the AEC updated with their movements the better.
Again, it has to be done in a fashion that does not question the integrity of the roll and does not raise the risk of an election being brought into question at some time. We have very good processes for dealing with questionable elections, but we do not face them very often. We do not face them to the point where a government’s or parliament’s legitimacy is questioned, because of the strength of our electoral system. This is something that we on this side of the House have had a commitment to for a very long time. As I said earlier, in 2006 we decided this was important because it added to the strength of commitment to ensuring the integrity of the roll.
I think members on the other side are ill advised to move down this path. This is a bad decision. It is a bad bill because it undoes good changes to a system which is working very well. We have seen that it is working very well from the field evidence. If we look at the results from provisional voting at the last election we can see it did not cause some great dislocation in people’s ability to cast a provisional vote, as the previous member said. There are circumstances where provisional votes are required, and that should continue. But it should continue with the added protection that is in the system today. Overturning this protection, based on what I think are very questionable motives, is something that we should not support.
On the side of the House, we do not support it. We have had a commitment to this issue and we continue to maintain that commitment. Personally I continue to maintain that commitment because there is no more important thing in our electoral system than the roll and making sure it is protected from questionable voting and questionable tactics. It must be above repudiation in all those ways, ensuring legitimacy for governments and for all of us who are elected to this place. That is why we stand for these protections. We stand for the protections that were put into this system in 2006. There is no great need for change. The Labor Party is taking an ideological position. This is an unfortunate bill and it should be opposed.",REPS,<title>ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM AMENDMENT (PROVISIONAL VOTING) BILL 2011</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,14,1
"Melham, Daryl, MP",ALP,2011-03-23,"—I rise to support the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Provisional Voting) Bill 2011 and I do so in the knowledge that this bill is consistent with a principle under which this parliament should be operating when it comes to elections, and that is the principle of enfranchisement, not disenfranchisement. We have had two High Court decisions in recent times that have struck down legislation of the Howard government that went to the very heart of disenfranchising voters.
The first decision was in the Roach case to do with prisoner voting. It was a 4-2 decision of the High Court reinstating the principles as they were before the former government had legislated and in effect disqualified a class of prisoners from the vote. The second decision, and the most recent one to do with this election, was the 4-3 decision of the High Court in the case of Rowe, which was about the seven-day enrolment procedure. Talking about ideology, some of these people were appointed to the High Court by the former government. Justice Crennan could hardly be said to be a radical and she was in the majority of four. The joint judgment in that case of Justices Gummow and Bell went to the seven-day rule, which I think is a principle that we need to listen to. In paragraphs 166 to 167 they said:
In particular, the requirement in Roach that any disqualification be for a substantial reason cannot be answered simply by what may appear to have been legislative purpose. A legislative purpose of preventing such fraud before it is able to occur, where there has not been previous systemic fraud associated with the operation of the seven-day period before the changes made by the 2006 act, does not supply a substantial reason for the practical operation of the 2006 act in disqualifying large numbers of electors. That practical operation goes beyond any advantage in preserving the integrity of the electoral process from a hazard which so far has not materialised to any significant degree.
So what they then did was reinstate the seven-day provisions. In relation to provisional voting the same is true. The paranoia of those opposite who say, ‘We require proof of identity, we require a drivers licence before we’re going to let you have a vote or we’ll give you seven days to bring it back,’ has disqualified thousands of voters.
What did the Electoral Commission do in their submission to my parliamentary committee, the Joint Parliamentary Standing Committee on Electoral Matters? They nailed it. In paragraph 5.5.6 they said:
Of the 28 065 provisional votes rejected on the basis that the elector did not provide EOI, 12 227 of these were cast by electors who were actually enrolled.
Those voters took a provisional vote because their name could not be found on the day and that is the provision they were bound under. They were subsequently found to be on the rolls. But because the clerk did not pick that up on the day, maybe because of a misspelling or a wrong pronunciation—because a lot of this is non-English-speaking background—they were all knocked off the roll. What was the criterion before, which we are reinstating? We are reinstating the old provision that says that you sign when you get a provisional vote, it gets scrutinised, and there are scrutineers present, and if there is doubt as to the signature you get knocked out. Your signature becomes the proof of identity.
Today we heard from the National Party; they made a submission before our committee. Now, the signature provision still applies to declaration votes other than provisional votes; that is the nonsense here. And cop this, Mr Deputy Speaker: this is what they said, on page 5 of their submission, in relation to the signature provision:
The AEC has subsequently advised The Nationals that there were 5,549 PVCs rejected nationally due to signature mismatch.
What I say to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and to the member opposite is that there is a proof of identity provision that has always been there. It is the signature. These votes do not go into the ballot box on their own. They go into a packet, which is signed and lodged, and the details are checked. That is all that is required. What we have now is evidence before our committee from the independent Australian Electoral Commission, who, I might add, support what the government is doing on this provision. The party opposite that proclaims it hates red tape is using red tape to knock out legitimate voters. These are not people who do not want to vote; these are people who are showing up and want their vote to count. And in 12,000 cases they were actually on the roll and their votes did not count because of this provision, which really was a knockout provision put in for political purposes because provisional votes supposedly traditionally favour the Labor Party. That is not the way you operate the electoral system. I have always believed in enfranchising.
I am not saying, and the government is not saying, that these votes should go in as a normal, ordinary vote on the day of the election. What happens is that if your name is not on the roll or if there is a misspelling you have a provisional vote and there are certain provisions. Under the old act, which I have with me, section 336 required the elector to sign a paper with his own signature so there could be a signature check where doubts existed. I have scrutineered in more than one election in other divisions along these lines, whereas many opposite and even many on my side have not done it; they have not had that experience. That is why I say that this argument some people are making, that you need a drivers licence to get a video card or other things and so the same should apply to the Electoral Act on election day, is nonsense. We have had a High Court case in relation to the seven days that basically says that if you want to knock out legitimate voters, if you want to assert electoral fraud and if you want to say there is a problem with the system, produce evidence. That is why the High Court reinstated the seven-day rule in terms of the opportunity to enrol or change enrolment from when an election is called.
Of course, the conservatives argue that the seven-day period allowed a massive opportunity for fraud to occur. Another letter that the Electoral Commission sent to us said that they did a survey of eight or nine electorates. We will have it tabled publicly; I am entitled to talk about it in general terms. What it showed was that there were about 33 people surveyed who changed addresses back to their old address within a short period of time after the election. It does happen, but it is not fraud that is occurring. What they discovered was the overwhelming number of the 33 were young people, and they were going to make some further inquiries. We have got a good system. If there is electoral fraud, if those opposite say a particular division has miscarried because there has been a stack on the roll and that was a fraud, then they can challenge that election in the Court of Disputed Returns. But what I find offensive is that the party that says it does not believe in red tape continually puts blockers in to knock out tens of thousands of voters from having their vote counted.
We all condemned the first Bush election and the Florida hanging chad. This is Australia’s hanging chad. It was put in by the Howard government for a particular purpose, and, if anything, the fraud that was being perpetrated on the electorate was the basis upon which that provision was changed by the former government. It has been exposed for what it is—lacking in substance. And safeguards are there so that those provisional votes are properly checked and scrutineers from any particular party can question the identity of the person. It only goes back to whether they were inadvertently taken off the roll, and there are other things that are occurring in that regard. A whole lot of people who get a letter from the Electoral Commission and do not reply or whatever are being taken off the roll. In the old days they were reinstated, but under the former government this notion that you bear the responsibility, you bear the onus, has led to another 90,000 people not getting back on the roll and not getting their vote.
We support an incursion on the no-fly zone in Libya, we support what is happening in Afghanistan, to give people the right to elect their governments, the right to participate. What we have here is provision after provision put in by ideologues who in effect say that there is a presumption of guilt upon you before your vote will count. It is designed to attack the less advantaged in our community: Indigenous people; people who are not literate; the people of non-English-speaking backgrounds in south-west Sydney, where the top 12 electorates of informal votes are—and we will be looking at addressing that in our report. I cannot understand how those opposite can get up here with a straight face and say they want to maintain a provision when there is a submission before the electoral committee that says that this pernicious section resulted in 12,000 people at the last election who were legitimately on the roll not being able to have their vote exercised. That was as a result of polling-official error—not as a result of fraud—and the commission, to their credit, have admitted that and said that that is what this provision does. The commission have consistently said that this provision should not be there.
The next argument will probably be that the AEC are under the control of the government and the Labor Party and they are our mouthpiece. They are not. During the 21 years I have been in this place I have had nothing but the highest regard for the Electoral Commission and their officials. Occasionally they make mistakes.
—Who doesn’t?
—But, as my colleague says, who doesn’t? In this instance they gave evidence before the committee. It was not the first time; they did it before the last election, but the nature of the Senate was such that this would not get through.
It is about time that members of this House started to argue for enfranchising people, not disenfranchising them. At the federal level the Liberal-National parties have not done too badly out of compulsory voting and the provisions of the Electoral Act, because they have been in government for more than two-thirds of the time. This is not a situation where they could have argued, as they did in 2006, that it stopped them from getting elected in 1996, 1998, 2001 and 2004. No, they were spurious arguments and we now know, as a result of proper investigation, what those amendments mean.
That was why I was surprised by the High Court decisions in Roach and Rowe. The High Court basically put a limit on the parliament’s power to legislate because of the precious nature of the right to vote. The right to limit prisoners and the right to limit people getting on the roll in the seven-day period after an election was called were quite historic decisions by the High Court, but they were right. They were underpinned by enfranchisement, not disenfranchisement, which is what this current provision on provisional voting does.
It is separate to what happens with postal votes and other declaration votes. The signature is used to verify postal votes. As the National Party point out in their submission, for over 5,000 people there was a question over their signature. Signatures are used in the postal vote provision to determine identity. It might be a relative or someone else who has signed but, if there is a doubt, it is out. We do not have to listen to the garbage from the other side that this is going to be doom and gloom for our electoral system. They say there is going to be doom and gloom because they think there is a disadvantage to them because this class of people are not necessarily their supporters.
As I said, my principle has always been—and it has been on the record for 21 years; and I have been on the electoral committee for about 12 or 13 years—for enfranchising. Yes, we have to have safety nets. I support the reinstatement of the signature as the basis for provisional votes. If someone is not on the roll for two elections before the election they wish to vote in, they do not get a vote, so not every one of these votes gets put back into the count—don’t believe that either. Many get excluded for good reasons.

"Neville, Paul, MP",NATS,2011-03-23,"—I am a great friend of the member for Banks, but that was a very florid presentation that was full of emotion and not much logic. He is trying to make us believe that somehow these poor migrant people who struggle with English have been deprived of their democratic rights. In asking for identification, the rules lay down that you bring in your drivers licence, a passport, a birth certificate, a citizenship certificate, a Medicare card for God’s sake and various bank credit cards. If you are fair dinkum, is that an onerous provision for any long-term Australian or migrant? It is not a greatly onerous provision. It is a sensible thing that happens everywhere.
If you want to open an account at the bank, you have to rack up 90 points, which is all tied up with your identification and your past business. If you want to travel by air, you have to be able to show one of those items to get on the plane. No longstanding Australian or migrant argues with that. If you want to undertake hire-purchase or credit arrangements, it is required. Young people wanting to go in a nightclub have to have some form of identification. Even video stores, the most fundamental of all things, require you to have some form of identification. But for the most important thing we probably do every three years—voting for the government of our country—we want to water it down a bit. I do not think that is good enough.
What is provisional voting when you boil it down to the essentials? If you have been left off the roll unfairly or unjustly or by some form of bureaucratic error, you can claim a vote. That is essentially what it is. When you rock up to the polling booth on election day and find your name is not on the roll and say, ‘There is no reason for me not being on the roll. I have been in my house for many years. I have been unwittingly removed from the roll,’ if you present some form of identification away you can go.
This Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Provisional Voting) Bill 2011 proposes to remove all of that identity stuff and replace it purely with a signature. I do not know about that. I am putting my hand up and declaring a degree of self-interest because for many years I had the toughest seat in Australia and I watched everything in the way of voting. The one thing that stood out to me as not being as well regulated as the rest of the electoral system was provisional voting. I will give you a few examples of that shortly.
The member for Banks made a big song and dance about how many people had been excluded from their democratic right. I question that. Let us look at the figures across Australia as provided by the AEC—and it is good that the minister is at the table; I am sure he will correct me if I am wrong. Eighty per cent of people did provide identification on election day at the polling booths, with another 16 per cent providing it by the following Friday. So 96 per cent of all people who applied for a provisional vote had no trouble in coming up with the goods. The four per cent that for whatever reason missed out—it might have been just bone laziness; it might have been that they were in bed with the flu; it might have been that they had gone off to a job somewhere, who knows what—in my electorate was less than the informal voting rate. So it is hardly a disenfranchisement of a large section of the Australian population.
Fiddling with the rolls and the processes around the rolls is really a direct attack on the fundamentals of democracy, though you can dress it up any way you like. I am not having a crack at my political opponents, the government, in this. I have a lot of respect for the members in the House at present including the Special Minister of State, who is at the table, and my good colleague from western Sydney. I have great respect for them. But, hey, listen fellas, in your party, even over recent years, there have been some wicked examples of fiddling with the rolls.
In the Queensland parliament, you have had to tip members out of the parliament. Not just members but senior cabinet ministers were tipped out of the parliament for prostituting the rolls in one form or another. In fact, one party official in Townsville went to jail over it. It is not a very savoury record. The new member for Brisbane, then member for Petrie, told me of the time where, after one of the elections, she went out and checked some of the addresses from which votes had been claimed in her electorate and found they were vacant blocks of land. So there are people out there who use the processes around the electoral rolls to rort the system. I think anything you put in place that makes it harder for that to happen is an enhancement of democracy. It is not a denial of basic democracy if 96 per cent of people did not have any trouble providing identification. More to the point, it was a deterrent to those who would sneak in, claim a vote, sneak out and say: ‘We’ve got a fifty-fifty chance of pulling this off. They’re not going to check them all that thoroughly.’
The Special Minister of State, in his second reading speech, said there was no reason that provisional votes should be treated any differently from other forms of postal and absentee voting. I query that on the ground that with the other ones, especially the pre-polls and the absentees, voters are marked against the roll whereas with provisional voting the poll officer has to accept the voter’s word that they have been left off the roll. There was a great case in Bundaberg where someone walked up to one of the polling booths and, let us say, used the name of ‘John Smith of Brown Street’. As luck would have it, the person standing behind him was the real John Smith of Brown Street, who said, ‘Hey, wait a minute, mate; that’s my name.’ That was a million to one chance but it actually happened that somebody using his name was the person in front of him in the polling booth. So it goes on; make no mistake about that. As I have said, 96 per cent did not seem to have any trouble with it.
I would like to take you to my electorate. Mine has been, as I said, a pretty tough electorate over the years. It is not so bad at present. In one election I was down to 69 votes, 64 on recount. I know what a close election is like, so I take a particular interest in postals, pre-polls, absentees, provisionals and the like. It used to amaze me that I would poll somewhere between 55 per cent and 60 per cent for pre-poll, absentees and so on but, when it came to the provisionals, suddenly the vote dropped down to about 33 to 37 per cent. Why would that be? If these people, as the minister at the table says, are of similar character, why is it that three of those subgroups voted decidedly one way and the fourth group, over which the scrutiny at that time was probably less rigorous, voted another way?
I have got some figures here. In 2004 the figures for absentee, postal and pre-poll votes were 55 per cent, 62 per cent and 56 per cent. When we go to 2001, the figures for absentee, postal and pre-poll votes were 51 per cent, 54 per cent and 54 per cent, but suddenly provisionals were 37 per cent. That was for two-party preferred; when you took them down to the raw votes it was ALP 46 per cent, coalition 26 per cent. It was totally out of character with the rest of the voting in the election and in the other sectional voting. In 1998 the figures for absentee, postal and pre-poll votes were 50.6 per cent, 53.5 per cent and 52.8 per cent but—oh surprise!—provisional votes were 38 per cent for two-party preferred. Take them down again to the raw voting and it was ALP 47 per cent, coalition 27 per cent. Why did the result of 60-40 all of a sudden go 66-33 the other way? You would just have to say that there was something rather suspicious about it.
I am sure people would proffer all sorts of different reasons for that, but this is the interesting thing: when the new rule was brought in in 2007—in other words, the rorters were put on notice that they were going to be asked to identify themselves at the polling booth—that made a profound difference. More so in 2010 than in 2007, because in 2007 the ones who had been doing this over the years were probably were not quite ready for it. Again, suddenly, where I would poll in that 55 to 60 per cent of most of the sectional votes my vote came up from the low 30s—two-party preferred—to 44. That is extraordinary. Why did that just suddenly happen in the 2007 election when it had not happened in the previous four or five elections?
When you come to 2010, where this new system was well entrenched, my vote went not just to 44 but up to 47. It was getting up towards where all the other sectional votes were. I will be very interested to see, if the House and the Senate approve this bill, whether that vote slips back again. If it does, I think that is a fair indication that there has been some rorting going on.
I repeat: it is not an onerous burden to identify yourself, and it takes place now—as I outlined before—in many walks of life. You would not put on a tantrum at an airport and say, ‘I don’t want to show you my drivers licence.’ You show them the drivers licence, you get your ticket and you get on board. But suddenly this most important thing—the thing that we all cherish on both sides of the House, the role of democracy—is watered down. ‘Yes,’ we say, ‘We will do it by way of signature.’ I suppose that will be better than having no provision at all, but when my scrutineers went in to scrutinise the prepolls I used to get them to take a list of returned mail addresses. The number of votes that were claimed—we do not know what their votes were—before the envelope was opened that were from addresses from which we had had mail returned regularly was interesting. There was a bit of a suspicion in my mind that there was some undercurrent of rorting in those provisional votes.
I would prefer to see the system that was brought in towards the end of the Howard government retained. The government’s plan may work, but not to the same extent. (Time expired)
",REPS,<title>ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM AMENDMENT (PROVISIONAL VOTING) BILL 2011</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,14,1
"Jones, Stephen, MP",ALP,2011-03-23,"—It is an interesting debate that we are engaged in here today, because it really does lay bare the lie at the heart of the name of the party which those opposite purport to represent. It is a truly interesting debate when the party of liberty stands here and seeks to defend rorts which would deny citizens their votes. The party of liberty seeks to remove the rights of citizens.
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Seriously, impugning the rights of a political party in the House is clearly not appropriate under the standing orders.
 (Mr KJ Thomson)—The shadow minister was not here for the earlier debate. I can assure him that members on my left made exactly the same allegation, but of a different political party.
—I seek to make the point, plain and simple, that if those opposite who represent the party of liberty had the courage of their convictions then they would vote in favour of these proposed amendments to the electoral laws in the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Provisional Voting) Bill 2011. They would vote in favour of it because a party of liberty which truly stood for the principle that the people should choose those who represent them in this august body would want to extend the franchise and ensure that everybody has the right to exercise their citizenship rights as Australians to cast a vote in their electorate for their representatives in this place.
Of course, those opposite have form on this matter. Prior to the last election they had so distorted the electoral rolls as to ensure that many hundreds of thousands of Australians could not even enrol to vote because of the early cut-off of the electoral rolls on the day that the election was called. This rort—and it was a rort—has been overturned by the High Court, and for the first time in four years we saw at the 21 August 2010 election over 100,000 mostly young people enjoy their right to vote in a way that the High Court found was true and proper.
This reform which has been brought to the House by the Special Minister of State for the Public Service and Integrity is a continuation of our intent to ensure that we correct many of the wrongs that have been visited upon our electoral system by those opposite, and it should enjoy the support of all members of this House. For a country which was founded in relatively modern times, and as a nation of convicts, Australia has nevertheless had a proud history of democracy, and has played its part in exporting democracy to the countries of our region.
We are rightly proud of the conduct of our elections, which are done with integrity and a level of scrutiny and transparency that puts even the closest of election results to the test. Indeed there are some of us who even enjoy and look forward to the festive atmosphere of polling day, with the community out together enjoying a sausage sizzle, the sharing of our democratic values and the real contest of ideas that surrounds an election.
In Australia, we do not change governments frequently, but, when we do change governments, it is without the mayhem or bloodshed that accompanies the change of regimes or governments in many other countries. That is something that we on all sides of the House are rightly proud of. When you hear that the recently deposed President of Egypt, Hosni Mubarak, was in power for 30 years, you really do know that something is not working in the democratic system of that country.
Our system of compulsory voting means that everyone gets a say. It is a system that continually needs refining and sometimes we need to wind back the egregious limitations that are placed on that system by representatives of those opposite. It is a system which enables everyone to cast their vote and it is a system that is the envy of the world. These are all good features of Australia’s voting system. Even on a bitterly cold winter’s day, as was the case in August last year, we are able to get out with the customary enthusiasm and cast our vote in favour of the representatives of our choice.
The bill before the House today will remove the requirement for provisional voters to show proof of identity within a week of voting to allow their vote to be counted. These so-called provisional votes are declaration type votes cast at a polling place on polling day. There are four main reasons a person will be asked to cast to a provisional vote. The first is where a person’s name cannot be found on the electoral roll by the polling official; the second is where a mark appears on the certified list, which indicates that the person has already voted; the third is where the polling official doubts the person’s true identity; and the fourth is where the person is a silent elector and their address does not appear on the publicly available edition of the roll.
The Australian Electoral Commission has stated that over 200,000 provisional votes were cast in the 2010 election. Of these, 28,065 provisional votes were rejected because the voter did not provide evidence of identity by the first Friday following the polling day. Importantly, further examination by the AEC of these 28,000 votes found that in over 12,000 instances—nearly half of these instances—the name of the voter was found on the certified electoral roll. So here was a person who was fully entitled to cast a vote but because, for one reason or another—their busy life or many other reasons—they were unable to subsequently provide proper proof of their identity to the AEC their vote was not counted.
These are the people that the member for Hinkler recently chose to blithely disregard as rorters. I prefer to call them ‘citizens’ in my electorate, but he chooses to call them rorters. He really did bell the cat—and this goes to the heart of the opposition’s objection to these provisions—when he said that the real reason that he did not want to vote in favour of these proposals is that he thought the people who would cast a provisional vote in accordance with these proposed amendments would not vote for him; and this was coming from a representative of the party of liberty, the party of free speech, the party of democratic rights. The member for Hinkler could not have stated his case more clearly. The reason that he does not support these amendments is that he fears that the people who will use them will not vote for him. The over 12,000 people in the 2010 election who were precluded because of the Howard government rorts will be able to eligibly cast a vote in an election and have their vote counted—have their democratic say counted. The member for Hinkler and many others on the other side of the House choose to call these people rorters. We call them citizens and eligible enrolled voters. They will once again be enfranchised by this provision.
Indeed, it was a similar story in the 2007 federal election, where there were 167,500 provisional votes and 27,000 votes that were rejected at preliminary scrutiny because an elector did not provide proof of identity. This is a situation that was created by the coalition—and it is a sad state of affairs. It means a significant number of people turned up at polling booths on polling days in both 2007 and 2010, keen to have their say and cast their ballot, found that they were not on the electoral roll and then cast a declaration vote only to have it rejected because of unnecessary red tape and an onerous process.
Those opposite choose to laugh, but the reason that it is unfair is that these voters would have had their vote counted if they had instead stayed home and voted absentee. If they had cast a postal vote, a pre-poll declaration vote—their vote would have counted, with no need for proof of identity. There is simply no reason that otherwise valid provisional votes should be treated differently to other forms of declaration votes. The real reason—which was made crystal clear by the member for Hinkler—that they do not require proof of identity for pre-poll postal votes is that those opposite believe that the majority of those people are going to vote for the opposition. Those opposite fear that if we redress this rort, this discriminatory treatment of declaration votes on polling days, those people will not vote for them. That is a shameful exposition of your political philosophy. The party of liberty is the party of electoral rorts.
It is interesting to look back at how this disenfranchisement affected the outcome of the 2007 federal election. Some interesting research by Mr Peter Brent from the Australian National University contained in his paper on provisional voting rejections in the 2007 election claims that the ‘missing provisional votes’ might have affected the outcomes in two electorates, McEwen and Bowman, and added ‘0.1 per cent to Labor’s national vote’ in that election and probably would have turned the election the other way in those two electorates—two of Australia’s most marginal electorates.
There is no high principle here. The only principle that is in evidence here is that those opposite are afraid that people will not vote for them. They are afraid of this because, quite clearly, they do not have confidence in their ideas, so they are attempting to rort the system. They do not have confidence in their own ideas or in their own capacity to get out there and campaign.
As we know, it is a relatively uncommon outcome of our electoral system for one political party to hold the balance of power in both houses of parliament. It occurred in 2005 and that was the first time it had happened since 1981. We know that the first thing the Howard government did when it was presented with a blank cheque from the electorate was to get to work on an ambitious rewriting of Australian industrial relations laws—the odious Work Choices laws. Fortunately, the machinations of democracy saw off both those laws and the government that introduced them in 2007. But that was not the only piece of legislation that the Howard government rammed through the parliament during those unfortunate years. The Howard government’s agenda was driven by the coalition’s conservative ideology as it sought to gain political and electoral advantage over its opponents on this side of the House.
It is well known to many in this place that in December 2005 the coalition introduced the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Electoral Integrity and Other Measures) Bill. Like so much of the Orwellian doublespeak that characterised the Howard government’s term in office, it had nothing to do with electoral integrity and everything to do with rorting the electoral system. This bill had absolutely nothing to do with electoral integrity. The measures in the bill included raising the threshold for anonymous political donations to $10,000, which eroded an important transparency measure. It closed the electoral rolls early, as I have already stated; it disenfranchised some votes by prisoners; it made it harder to enrol to vote; and it disenfranchised provisional voters. It was all done for political advantage. It was all done for partisan politics. It was empty of ideology except the ideology which drives those opposite to cling to power at all costs. They junk their co-called liberal ideology in favour of an anti-liberal proposition to disenfranchise voters. We in this House have the opportunity today to fix this historical anomaly to ensure that those who truly do believe in liberty, in democratic values and in the right to vote will be able to exercise their right to vote—as is every Australian’s birthright. I call upon the House to support the bill.",REPS,<title>ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM AMENDMENT (PROVISIONAL VOTING) BILL 2011</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,14,1
"Tehan, Dan, MP",LP,2011-03-23,"—It gives me no joy to be speaking on the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Provisional Voting) Bill 2011 today, because all this bill will do is affect the integrity of our voting system. The honourable member who just spoke mentioned the 2007 election and the seat of McEwen. I had some experiences with the voting and the vote counting in the seat of McEwen. There were multiple votes cast in that election and there was nothing that the AEC could do about it. I will give one example which I think illustrates why we have to be so careful to maintain the integrity of our electoral system. There was a parish priest who received a note from the AEC inquiring as to why he had voted three times in the electorate of McEwen. It turned out that someone had voted under his name in New South Wales and then twice within the electorate of McEwen at different polling booths. There was nothing that the AEC could do about it, apart from giving him a ‘Please explain’. When he explained that he had voted only once and had voted within the local community where he works, that was the end of the story, and those other two votes were counted.
The interesting thing about the McEwen electorate during the election of 2007 was that there were multiple cases of people casting more than one ballot, and it was the first time that the union movement en masse had been up to scrutineer and to also hand out how-to-vote cards at polling booths in that electorate. During the Work Choices campaign they bussed union officials into the electorate so that they could hand out how-to-vote cards and do the scrutineering. And—surprise, surprise!—we also saw an increase in multiple voting.
—That is drawing a long bow.
—It is not a long bow. If you look at the historical facts you will see that that is what occurred. First the coalition candidate was declared the winner, then the Labor Party candidate was declared the winner, and eventually the coalition was. It was that close, and that multiple voting could easily have been the thing that decided who won that seat. It goes to the heart of why we need to protect the integrity of our electoral roll, and the changes in this legislation will do nothing to do that.
We are heading for a system whereby anyone will be able to turn up and vote and be able to vote on multiple occasions. We are not moving to protect the integrity of the electoral roll. In fact, we are looking to weaken it and, by weakening it, we will harm our democratic processes here in Australia. People will begin to wonder whether we truly do have a democratic system when it is possible for people to be able to vote on more than one occasion.
The honourable member who spoke previously talked about the 200,000 provisional votes which were cast at the last election: 28,000 of those were rejected under the changes introduced by the coalition in 2006, and 12,000 of those would have been eligible. What about the other 16,000? What was the situation with those votes? They were not found to be legitimate voters on the roll. Those 16,000 votes remain a mystery. How can we have a system whereby we allow people to cast their votes provisionally and not ask them to provide some identification? They do not have to do it on polling day. This change was a reasonable change; it just required them to provide some proof of who they are within seven days, to make sure there was not fraud and to protect the integrity of our system.
If you cannot provide identification in seven days, then you are not taking your vote seriously—the importance of that vote, the importance of our democratic system and the importance of providing integrity within that system. Sadly, in Third World countries, we see continual rorting of the democratic system and we have all seen what that leads to and the types of governments that we get from that. That is not what we want to see here in Australia. We want people to know that when they cast their vote every other citizen is casting their vote in exactly the same way. We want people to be confident that there are not some citizens voting maybe one, two or three times when others are doing the right thing. We need to have some safeguards, because, unfortunately, if you do not have the safeguards in the system, people will rort it. We as the coalition in 2006 did not make an onerous requirement. All we said was that people needed to provide some identification within seven days.
It is important to note that, at the 2010 general election, 80 per cent of provisional voters provided evidence of their identity at the polling place on election day and another 16 per cent provided evidence of their identification in the required time frame, the following Friday. So only four per cent of voters did not provide identification. We need to ask the question: why? Was it because they were frightened that it would be found out that they had voted earlier? If that is the case then surely we should keep this requirement within our electoral system. When people cast their votes in polling booths on polling day, we continually get attempts to rort the system. Sadly, some attempts to rort the system are bound to work. Why shouldn’t there be, especially when it comes to provisional voting, some measure to make sure that the person casting the vote is casting a legitimate vote?
We need to remind people what provisional voters are. These are the people who turn up and their name is not on the roll or there is a query on the roll about their identification. Why shouldn’t we be able to ask them a simple thing before we allow their vote to count: ‘Prove to us who you are. There is a query about who you are; therefore, we need you to do this.’ We do not do it to people who turn up on polling day or to people who cast a postal vote or to people who do a pre-poll vote. We only do it to these provisional voters. The reason we do it is that there is already some unease about whether this person has the right to cast that vote. So there is nothing wrong with asking them to provide some identification within seven days.
Our voting system is integral to our whole democratic system. We have seen, sadly, in other places—for instance in Florida—the unease and doubt caused by voting systems which were seen to be potentially able to be manipulated. We have seen what that can lead to and the distrust and general outrage from the community that a proper system is not in place. We do not want to see that occur here in Australia.
In the seat of McEwen in 2007, in an extremely close vote, we saw that there was the potential for rorting in our system. We have to make sure that we take steps to stop that from happening. We do not want it to lead to the situation where we disenfranchise people. This is not about disenfranchising people. This is about requiring people—if there is uncertainty and unease about whether they are qualified to vote—to prove that they are qualified to vote. This is not disenfranchising people; this is protecting the very integrity of our democratic system.
—What evidence?
—What evidence? The evidence the honourable member missed earlier on was just one example—but we saw numerous—of a parish priest being asked to explain why he had voted three times in the 2007 election in the seat of McEwen.
—Was he charged?
—No, he was not charged because he was able to demonstrate that he had only voted once, but the other two votes where people used his name to cast their ballot remained legitimate votes. They were not withdrawn because no-one knew who or what those ballots were or where the voters were. Two votes were counted, and no-one knows who cast them.
By making this amendment, we are saying: if you want to potentially rort the system, do it by turning up and casting a provisional vote, because no-one is going to check your identification as to whether you are legitimately able to cast that vote or not. This is not the type of electoral system that we need here in this country. People have confidence in our electoral system. The integrity of our electoral system is seen as world class; yet, this is an area that has been identified as having some risk of fraudulent behaviour. The government is saying, ‘We’re going to open it up and make it easier for fraud to take place. We’re not going to put in one little small requirement that you need to show identification after seven days.’ What this government needs to say is, ‘There seems to be some risk here of fraudulent behaviour.’ Instead it is going to make that risk greater and put that system at further risk of losing its world-class reputation.
Sadly, the fact that this change is coming from the Gillard government should make the Australian people very worried. Everything that the government do turns into a mess and the fact that they are meddling in our voting system, which is seen to be world class, sends shivers up my spine. Are we going to see a pink batts fiasco? Are we going to see a BER fiasco? Look at the record of the government: everything they touch turns into disaster. I am worried that we are going to see another disaster with this change to something that is absolutely vital to the very fabric of Australian society—our democratic processes.
These changes were brought about in 2006 because they were required to protect the integrity of our voting system The only reason the government want to change these laws is that they know that any rorting that will take place is more likely to benefit them than anyone else. This change is a sham.",REPS,<title>ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM AMENDMENT (PROVISIONAL VOTING) BILL 2011</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,14,1
"Husic, Ed, MP",ALP,2011-03-23,"—Thank you for the opportunity to participate in this debate, and I will start by acknowledging the number of people in the public gallery joining us here today—witnesses to, in effect, the democratic process in operation right now. It is also worth pointing out that this debate on the billthat is being discussed is about enhancing people’s participation in the democratic process in this country.
The Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Provisional Voting) Bill 2011 looks at repealing the requirement for provisional voters to provide evidence of identity as a precondition to their votes being included in an election. As has been reflected upon earlier in the debate, there are four main reasons that a person wants to cast a provisional vote: firstly, their name cannot be found on a certified list; secondly, a mark already appears on the certified list, which indicates a person has voted; thirdly, the polling official doubts the person’s identity; and, finally, the voter is a silent elector.
The Electoral Act and the referendum act currently require a person casting a provisional vote to provide evidence of identity by the first Friday following polling day, and if the voter cannot provide evidence of identity by the deadline the vote does not progress to preliminary scrutiny and is not counted. This requirement—again, this has been commented upon in the course of this debate—was put in place by the previous government in 2006. Mind you, a lot of those opposite had been elected to office in 1996, 1998, 2001 and 2004, but they decided in 2006 that this was such a significant issue that they needed to deal with it. This resulted in a situation where provisional votes were dealt with in a way inconsistent with the treatment of other types of declaration votes—namely, absentee votes, postal votes and pre-poll votes.
At the 2010 election, over 28,000 votes were rejected because the voter did not provide evidence of identity by the deadline. It is worth noting that about 14 million people in the 2010 election cast a vote, of which 28,000 were rejected under the system put in place in 2006 by the former government. Again, it is important to note: the requirement for a provisional voter to provide evidence of identity leads to an inconsistency in the treatment of different types of declaration votes. I want to emphasise the point and support the comment made by the member for Banks, where he indicated that the changes being put forward by the government are supported by the Australian Electoral Commission. The AEC are the independent authority that we all support in their ability to oversee and operate the democratic process during elections. They do that not just during federal elections but in other elections where they are called upon by third parties—namely in union ballots, I make the point—to ensure the integrity of the process.
On that word ‘integrity’: my ears always prick up when the opposition use that code word. They talk vigorously about the need to defend the integrity of the roll. Rather, I think it reflects paranoia about the processes, probably championing conspiracy theorists and their fascination with this issue of votes being counted or being excluded. We will often hear cited Dr Amy McGrath, who from time to time has made it her life’s work to deal with the issue of why some votes have been counted and others excluded. Again, I think it is important that the AEC is scrupulous in its defence of process. Frankly, the use of and overreliance on this word ‘integrity’ in relation to the roll is code for those opposite advancing mechanisms to prevent people from casting a vote and finding ways to exclude them from the roll—particularly young people, as has been evidenced in the past in terms of the conditions for ratifying their enrolment ahead of an election—including, as we have seen before, differentiating between declaration votes and putting forward these onerous issues in relation to identity.
We need to be vigilant about hurdles that prevent participation and, as the member for Melbourne Ports observed in this place last night, our challenge is to find a way to get the 2.5 million people who did not cast a vote in the 2010 election to vote. Fourteen million people did; 2.5 million did not. That is a serious issue. Obviously, there are a whole host of reasons why people might not participate in the voting process, and we can canvass them. It may be, in some part, a reflection of disillusionment in the democratic process that makes people opt not to cast a vote. But there are other reasons as well, and I would certainly advance the idea that we have placed before them hurdles that make the process more difficult. From my perspective, removing the ID hurdles is an important measure.
In the electorate that I have the great honour of representing, Chifley, the proportion of people who have drivers licences is amongst the lowest in Western Sydney, and there is a reason for that: the state government has changed the way you get a drivers licence. Bear in mind that those opposite have said: ‘What’s the problem? If you just present a drivers licence then your identity has been verified.’ I would dispute that. To come back to the point, in New South Wales learners—unlike many of us in here who obtained our licences in years past—have to undertake 100 hours of driving to obtain a drivers licence. Again, some would say, ‘It’s not that big a deal.’ But, in fact, if there is no-one in the house who has a drivers licence and/or the learner is from a low-income family—and in the electorate I represent there are a great deal of people from low-income families—there is no-one at home who can participate with them in the driving requirements that are mandatory for getting a licence. Their only alternative is to pay for driving lessons to obtain their licence, and that in itself is a problem because they will not have the funds for it. So they are the hurdles to getting your drivers licence in New South Wales. While those opposite are advancing the idea, ‘Merely present your drivers licence; that’s okay,’ the fact is that drivers licence requirements such as those in New South Wales present a big problem for us.
I return to the fact that we need to find a mechanism to get the 2.5 million people who did not cast a vote in the last election to vote. Australia does have complex systems of voting. There are the optional preferential differences between federal and state elections. For example, in the New South Wales election, you have optional preferencing; in the federal election, you are required to fill every box with a number. As an aside, I would say that our system is way better than the US system, where there are enormous complexities and differences between the states in the way that people cast their votes, and that does disenfranchise people. At this point, I am also mindful of comments made by former Prime Minister Whitlam, where he recommended—and I do not want to cause a collective heart attack in the chamber; wait for it—that federal, state and local government elections all be held on exactly the same day—

Mr Anthony Smith interjecting—
—It certainly caught my attention, Member for Casey! When Mr Whitlam made that point, he was looking at the US system, where people vote on the one day. Some of the reasons he made that point and the reason I make this point now is that there is an issue of voter education—that is, holding those elections all at the same time gives people the opportunity to be informed about and to better understand the processes in place, and what they need to do to cast a valid vote. From my perspective, the AEC needs to increase its focus on education.
As the member for Banks said today, the top 12 electorates in the country—many of them with high levels of informal voting—are located in Western Sydney, and the diversity within those seats is worth considering. There are different literacy rates. There are people for whom English is a second language. There are people who have come to Australia from backgrounds where democracy is not necessarily as strong a proposition as it is here. They may not know that, under a compulsory voting system, you need to undertake certain things to be able to obtain a vote. These are serious issues.
I do not think that advertising alone in the lead-up to a federal election is good enough—that is, using mass advertising mechanisms to educate people on how to cast a vote. While I understand it is considered an efficient way to get a message out, I think other ideas need to be considered to ensure that people understand the voting system and, thereby, that they cast valid votes.
One idea I would put forward for consideration by the AEC is that they identify seats where informal voting is high and where demographic triggers would warrant escalated education processes. By that I mean that the AEC conduct face-to-face briefings with people in those electorates to ensure that they do understand the democratic process—that is, the way that they can cast valid votes. That type of work could be done by divisional officers. I understand that, as always, budgets and the level of support provided to the AEC for this function will be a worthy point of consideration, but I think that AEC officials conducting face-to-face briefings with large groups of community members to better explain the democratic process would be enormously valuable. I note the presence of the Special Minister of State in the chamber, and I would hope that this would be something that could be considered for future election campaigns as a measure to improve voter education.
We also need to maintain close scrutiny of proposals to improve enrolment. I note that last night in the chamber the member for Mackellar made some points about this. I quote from Hansard, where the member for Mackellar said:
I am concerned, for instance, with the proposition that has been put forward that for future federal elections we might go the way of, say, the New South Wales Labor government, which has changed enrolment provisions to encompass automatic enrolment whereby people’s details will merely be taken from other agencies such as the Road Transport Authority, school rolls or whatever they decide can be dealt with.
The member for Mackellar, judging by the way she referenced it in debate, believes that this issue is a problem. But, in actual fact, the number of databases that exist within government provide an easier mechanism to enrol people to vote. Given that the identity requirements—the provisions that are put in place to validate a person’s identity through drivers licences or other forms of identification—sit in multiple databases, there is already an avenue for us to verify the person’s bona fides, their address et cetera and to improve enrolment processes. I think this is something that is worthy of consideration in improving people’s engagement in the process.
I note that those opposite often refer to the fact that it is easier to vote than it is to get a video card. There is a good reason for that—there are fewer video stores these days, because that mode of technology and people’s reliance on DVDs and videos is fast disappearing. There is also a commercial imperative for video store operators to put in place—
—That’s a killer point!
—What a demon debating point!
—Well, you guys advance it as some reason as to why—
—Well, it’s true.
—Well, you refer to video cards, and you are referring to an outmoded form of technology and the fact that there is a commercial imperative to establish the bona fides of people seeking membership. Whatever can be done to harness existing technology and modern processes to improve the ability of people to participate and to tackle the challenge of 2.5 million people who are not casting a vote needs to continue, and I would certainly urge the government to consider this in the years ahead.",REPS,<title>ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM AMENDMENT (PROVISIONAL VOTING) BILL 2011</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,14,1
"Smith, Anthony, MP",LP,2011-03-23,"—In speaking briefly on the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Provisional Voting) Bill 2011, the shadow special minister of state and other colleagues from this side of the House in defending the reforms that were put in place back in 2007. We are hearing the Labor Party state in the House today their long held view—a view which would lead to our electoral roll being left open to abuse. It is as simple as that. At present, if a voter attends polling booths on election day, and they not on the electoral roll and seek to cast a provisional vote, they are asked by virtue of the fact that their enrolment criteria and enrolment details are nonexistent or unclear to provide simple evidence of identity—the sort of evidence of identity that Australian citizens are asked for every day in the modern economy.
It was interesting how the previous speaker from the other side danced around that point with great awkwardness in his contribution. We are talking about electors who are not on the electoral roll or whose details are unclear turning up at polling booths and simply being asked to provide evidence of identity. If they are unable to provide that simple evidence of their identity at that time—and I say to the member opposite, who must have ignored the evidence or been oblivious to it, that we know from the statistics that that is absolutely not the case in the majority of instances—they have until the next Friday to provide it.
I am very familiar with these reforms. They were a recommendation of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, which I chaired back in 2004 and 2005, and they were then embodied in the legislative reform introduced by the government at that time. We have heard a lot of rhetoric from those opposite about the right to vote. We all cherish the right to vote. But with rights come responsibilities. For every voter whose details, for whatever reason, are out of date or who is not on the electoral roll and must cast a provisional vote, which by its very nature and definition is provisional and requires further checking, to be asked to provide stipulated identification—namely, a drivers licence—is not too onerous. The member opposite would have you believe that this will be news to his electors and that a drivers licence is a new thing, but we know that most people have a drivers licence, and we know from the statistics that, as the shadow minister pointed out, most had no problem providing it on the spot.
But of course the legislation as it exists at the moment makes provision for those without a licence. The absurd and incompetent notion from the member opposite that those without a licence would have to go and acquire a driver licence to vote is an unfortunate reflection on his lack of capacity to look at the detail of the act as it stands today. For those without a licence it is very clear they can provide alternative forms of identification if not on the spot then at some point within the next five working days. What those opposite are saying here in this House is that it is a fundamental belief of those in the Labor Party and those in the government that if someone casts a provisional vote, which by its very nature has an uncertainty about it at the time, it is too much to ask for some identification on the spot and too much to ask that voter to provide that simple information sometime in the next five days—information that should be asked for on a daily basis.
This reform was introduced in 2006. It has operated at two elections. The shadow minister made very clear that the statistics tell the story: the vast majority of electors in that situation had no problem providing the identification on the spot. Those who could not provide it on the spot had Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday to provide that information. In a democracy, with the right to vote comes responsibility. It is very interesting: back in 2005, when the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters reported on this and many other issues, the dissenting report from those opposite was quite long. It will not surprise you, Madam Deputy Speaker Burke, that the dissenting report dissented with most parts of the committee’s deliberations to improve the integrity of the electoral system. I know my friend and colleague Shadow Minister Hartsuyker would have thought that, given the vehemence of the debate he has witnessed from those on the other side, there would be a long, comprehensive, analytical, absolutely academic piece from those opposite about why this reform introduced in 2006 should not go ahead. When you look at their dissenting report and cut through the volume of those opposite such as the member for Banks and the member for Melbourne Ports, who return on these issues with the regularity of Thunderbirds episodes on a Saturday morning, you see that their big, compelling point was that, when they had considered it, there had not been any evidence provided that there had actually been fraud.
It was not that they were worried about fraud or the integrity of the electoral roll; it was that there had not been any evidence presented. I quote from the report: ‘No evidence was presented to the inquiry of fraud in the casting of declaration votes.’ This is very like saying, if you are working in a bank, ‘We’ve left the bank vault open, but nothing has happened up until now.’
This reform introduced in 2006 was a sensible reform. The Australian public, I believe, would find it a very straightforward reform. As a member representing a seat in Victoria I can say I have had no feedback from a provisional voter finding the provisions unnecessary or intrusive. They would be understood by Australians as something to protect the integrity of the roll. Those honestly voting and casting provisional votes would want to know and would understand that there are integrity provisions in place. The arguments we have heard from those opposite, particularly from the previous speaker, whom I have had more time to listen to, really demonstrate the hollowness of their opposition to this measure. It is a measure that does them no service at all.",REPS,<title>ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM AMENDMENT (PROVISIONAL VOTING) BILL 2011</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,14,1
"Slipper, Peter, MP",LP,2011-03-23,"—Looking through the Special Minister of State’s second reading speech, the best explanation for the proposals in this bill appears to be that the current arrangement for there to be evidence of identity provided with respect to provisional voting is inconsistent with the rules that currently relate to other forms of declaration voting such as postal voting and absent voting. So what the minister is proposing, I gather, is that there should be consistency by removing the need for electors to provide evidence of identity with respect to provisional voting. I do believe that there is a sense of logic in wanting to have the same rules apply to provisional voting as to other forms of declaration voting, but I make the submission to this House that a better way of doing that would be to require evidence of identity to be provided by basically everyone seeking to cast a vote pursuant to declaration voting. I think that would enhance the integrity of the electoral system and overcome the minister’s reason for introducing the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Provisional Voting) Bill 2011.
It is important that the electoral system of Australia has as much integrity as possible, and all honourable members would claim that they support an electoral system with integrity which would ensure that, following an election, the result as declared is in fact the result voted for by the Australian people. However, our side—that is, the Liberal-National team—takes a very strong view that we ought to continually upgrade the integrity of the electoral system. The government, while supporting in principle that idea, does through their Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Provisional Voting) Bill 2011 seek to undermine the integrity of the electoral system. The minister may not have heard what I said a moment ago, but now that he is back at the table I will repeat that the reason for this bill appears to be the lack of consistency in treatment of different sorts of declaration voting. Minister, the best way to bring that consistency in would be to require all declaration voters to provide evidence of identity.
Let us face it, anyone can go to an electoral office, a prepoll centre or a polling booth on or before polling day—whenever those offices are open—and claim to be a voter. I think that when we make an improvement with requirements that can be met by the overwhelming majority of voters, there seems to be little reason to take this step, if this bill were to become law, which makes the integrity of the electoral system less sound. I am advised that at the 2010 general election 80 per cent of provisional voters provided evidence of their identity at the polling place on election day—the honourable member for Casey indicated that most voters have a drivers licence—and another 16 per cent provided evidence of identification in the required time frame—that is, by the following Friday.
It is my submission that the government has not sufficiently convinced the parliament that the proposal contained in this bill is worthy of support. There are a number of situations where people are able to obtain a provisional vote. One might be where the person’s name is not on the electoral roll. Other situations could be where the person’s name has been marked off or where the polling official on the day has concerns about the identity of the would-be voter. We know that currently the provisional vote is not counted until the elector’s identity can be confirmed and a careful check made of the circumstances.
Failure to provide the identification presently means that the vote is not counted and the integrity of the electoral process is not endangered by including dodgy votes in the count. It is a sensible and strict system that is really a commonsense system. It is a system that was introduced by the former government in 2006. It has proven, during the two elections when it has operated, to be solid and sensible. It simply does not require changing. As I mentioned a moment ago, 96 per cent of those who cast provisional votes at the August 2010 federal election did provide identification either on the day or by the following Friday. That gives people plenty of time to dust off some form of identification and to front up to prove that the person actually exists and that he or she is not simply a nom de plume.
The Liberal-National opposition opposes the retrograde measures of this bill. I think it is a pity that the minister, for whom I have the highest personal regard, is introducing legislation which seeks to undermine the integrity of the electoral system. The bill introduces loopholes that can compromise the integrity of our electoral system and I think it is important that the government reconsider this matter. The amendments which were made by the former government in 2006 were positive. They have not received any opposition from the community. There does not seem to be any compelling reason to water down the integrity of the electoral system by removing the need for provisional voters to prove that they exist. I suggest that, instead, the minister should require other declaration voters to provide identity. While he is at it, it would not be a bad idea if before casting a vote on polling day everyone should produce evidence that he or she exists as well. We really ought to have a situation where people prove that they exist before they are able to cast a vote. That should apply to declaration voters of all sorts, including provisional voters. It should also, in my view, apply to people seeking to cast an ordinary vote on polling day. Regrettably, I must join my colleagues in opposing this retrograde legislation which has been introduced to the parliament by the minister and the government.",REPS,<title>ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM AMENDMENT (PROVISIONAL VOTING) BILL 2011</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,14,1
"Gray, Gary, MP",ALP,2011-03-23,"—in reply—I thank all the members who have spoken on this bill. In particular, I thank the member for Fisher for his observations, which are interesting in many ways. The Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Provisional Voting) Bill 2011 will repeal the requirement for provisional voters to provide evidence of identity as a precondition to their votes being included in the count for an election.
Provisional votes are a type of declaration vote cast at a polling place on polling day. There are four main reasons that a person will be asked to cast a provisional vote. First, the person’s name cannot be found on the certified list; second, a mark appears on the certified list which indicates the person has already voted; third, the polling official doubts the person’s identity; and, finally, the voter is a silent elector. When a provisional vote is cast, ballot papers are placed in an envelope and written on the outside of the envelope are the voter’s details, including name, address, date of birth and signature. This allows the Australian Electoral Commission to examine the eligibility of the voter before including the vote in the count. This is known as the preliminary scrutiny. The Electoral Act and the referendum act currently require a person casting a provisional vote to provide evidence of identity by the first Friday following polling day. If a voter does not provide evidence of identity by this deadline the vote does not progress to the preliminary scrutiny and is not counted.
This requirement was put in place by the previous government in 2006. It resulted in a situation where provisional votes were dealt with in a way that was inconsistent with the treatment of other kinds of declaration votes—namely, absent, postal and pre-poll votes. By repealing the requirement for provisional voters to provide evidence of identity, all declaration votes will be treated equally. The bill replaces the requirement to provide evidence of identity with a test which has been used in previous elections. The test provides for the divisional returning officer to compare the signature on the provisional vote envelope with the signature of the elector on previously lodged enrolment records if there is any doubt as to the bona fides of the elector.
This amendment is supported by the Electoral Commission which, in its submission to the inquiry by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters into the 2010 federal election and matters related thereto, recommended that the requirement for production of evidence of identity by provisional voters should be repealed. The Electoral Commission supports the measure in this bill for two substantive reasons. First, the Electoral Commission believes that the details provided on the outside of the envelope including the voter’s name, address, date of birth and a signature allow the Electoral Commission to examine the voter’s eligibility to have the vote included without the requirement for additional evidence of identity.
Second, at the most recent general election over 28,000 provisional votes were rejected because the voter did not provide evidence of identity by the deadline. Out of the 28,000 rejected votes the Electoral Commission found that over 12,000 were instances where the name of the voter was subsequently found on the certified list, so they were eligible voters. Whatever the grounds were for issuing the provisional vote, the result is that otherwise eligible votes were being excluded from the preliminary scrutiny. So in effect, the 2006 amendments were simply unworkable. What we do by this amendment is restore the custom and practice in dealing with provisional votes through this bill. I would like to thank all members who have contributed to the debate on this bill and I commend the bill to the House.
Question put:
That the motion (Mr Gray’s) be agreed to.",REPS,<title>ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM AMENDMENT (PROVISIONAL VOTING) BILL 2011</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,14,1
"Turnbull, Malcolm, MP",LP,2011-03-23,"—This Broadcasting Legislation Amendment (Digital Dividend and Other Measures) Bill 2011 introduces amendments to the Broadcasting Services Act 1992, the Radiocommunications Act 1992, the Australian Communications and Media Authority Act 2005 and the Copyright Act 1968. The bill has two main elements: to introduce measures to effectively implement a reorganisation of digital television channels to realise the digital dividend—that is addressed in schedule 1—and to amend the regulatory framework for free-to-air digital television services provided on the VAST satellite service, and the switch-over to digital-only television, which is addressed in schedule 2.
I will begin with schedule 1, dealing with the digital dividend. As a result of the switch to digital-only television, the government plans to release spectrum—known as the digital dividend—in the frequency range 694 to 820 megahertz inclusive. Digital television switch-over will be completed in Australia, it is intended, by 31 December 2013. The UHF spectrum currently used for broadcasting services is highly valued for delivering wireless communication services including super fast mobile broadband. The government has indicated that it aims to auction the digital dividend spectrum in the second half of 2012.
In order to free up this highly valued spectrum, broadcasting services will need to be relocated out of the identified digital dividend spectrum and reorganised more efficiently within the remaining broadcasting spectrum. This process is known as restacking. To assist the Australian Communications and Media Authority, ACMA, to plan and implement the restack of broadcasting services as efficiently as possible, the government proposes amendments to the Broadcasting Services Act and the Radiocommunications Act to modify the existing planning process for television broadcasting services.
While the coalition understands the need to provide ACMA with greater regulatory flexibility during the restack process, we do have some concerns around the realignment of the existing licence areas into new television licence area plans. The issue is with the extensive powers that the bill gives the minister to direct ACMA to make or vary a television licence area plan for a particular area. We note that it is not intended that every television licence area plan reflect all the characteristics of each of the existing licence plans and we are concerned that there is scope for rescuing of resources between the respective broadcasters. During the recent Senate inquiry the Department of Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy testified that this bill made ‘no express prohibition on ACMA allotting broadcasting spectrum in whatever way it sees fit’.
We note with concern that this means ACMA could have the discretionary power to allocate greater than two channels per television licence area plan to a more powerful broadcaster to the detriment of smaller players in the market. Despite departmental reassurances that the intention ‘is not to disadvantage any broadcaster and for ACMA to assign channels of equivalent utility to all broadcasters in a particular area’, the coalition remains concerned that, despite the best intentions, the provisions in the bill include broad and unchecked powers.
I will now move to schedule 2, which deals with the switch from analog television to digital. Members will be aware that the switch to digital is occurring on a region-by-region basis with Mildura and regional South Australia completed and regional Victoria and regional Queensland scheduled for the first and second half of 2011. The coalition has registered, both in this place and elsewhere on a number of occasions, its real concern with the government’s handling of the switchover, particularly in regional and remote Australia. In fact my colleague the member for Casey in May last year warned this House that the government’s inadequate planning and preparation would have significant consequences for consumers particularly in regional and remote Australia.
Those warnings seem to have fallen on deaf ears and here the coalition finds itself again urging the government to look at the problems with their implementation of the rollout of digital television. As an overall approach the government has decided to depart from the principle that wherever analog terrestrial television channels are transmitted a digital terrestrial transmission facility should be established. This means that many people will need to switch from terrestrial television reception to satellite reception. The government has decided to fund a satellite based service called VAST, at a cost of $375 million over 12 years, and has decided to discontinue funding support to local communities, typically local councils, to provide self-help retransmission services. In a paper provided to the consumer expert group meeting held on 26 August 2010 it was stated:
There are 680 self-help sites in Australia and broadcasters will convert a number of these to digital. However, about 570 sites will not be converted and will cease operation. This will affect around 127,000 households in over 700 communities. Households in these areas may need to install VAST satellite equipment in order to watch free-to-air television.
In its submission to the exposure draft of this bill, the Local Government Association of Queensland stated:
… converting many if not most existing analogue self-help retransmission sites to digital is a more convenient and cost effective way to approach a conversion to digital TV …
In Queensland, 56 councils have retransmitted analog television services to rural and remote communities for over 20 years. This convenient and low-cost service provides the simplicity of the delivery of major city television services without the need for individual satellite dishes and related equipment. The government acknowledges that there is a cost for consumers to move from terrestrial coverage to satellite and to that end they have developed a satellite subsidy scheme that reimburses eligible households to assist them with the cost of converting. The coalition urges the government to use the same rationale for communities wishing to establish their own digital terrestrial self-help transmission.
As put to the recent Senate inquiry by Mr Hoffman, the general manager of the Local Government Association of Queensland:
It has been acknowledged by the department that it is technically possible to undertake the self-help terrestrial retransmission. In fact, the department has advised a cost potentially between $110,000 and $270,000.
Allowing the subsidy to be pooled to create a lump sum would assist the local councils involved to upgrade their facilities to digital terrestrial service without requiring further government funding. This would represent a more flexible and constructive use of the satellite subsidy scheme amount already set aside as well as having the potential to substantially reduce the added household expenses associated with the conversion to satellite television. To date the government regrettably has refused the many sensible and practical requests to pool the existing satellite subsidy scheme, and the coalition urges the government to be flexible and allow councils the right to decide, in consultation with their communities, whether converting retransmission sites is a better option for them.
Further practical requests with respect to the satellite subsidy scheme have been made and ignored by the government. The coalition urges the government to consider providing subsidies for small businesses to transition to terrestrial digital television in remote Australia. The VAST satellite subsidy scheme only applies to private residential households not to hospitals, nursing homes, hotels or caravan parks or indeed any other businesses which might provide television services to their customers or guests. The government does not seem to have considered the likely substantial, if not prohibitive, cost that may otherwise have to be incurred by small businesses to procure digital television transmission. The cost to these small businesses to install multiple VAST service units is open ended and this is particularly relevant to towns and communities that rely heavily on tourism as a source of income activity. When giving evidence to the recent Senate enquiry, Mr Arnold, the manager of the Remote Area Planning and Development Board in Queensland said:
We are trying to assess on behalf of individual tourism businesses the likely cost. Some of them who have looked into it are estimating it is a substantial cost—$10,000 to $20,000.
In a statement to the Senate committee examining the Broadcasting Legislation Amendment (Digital Television) Bill 2010, the Department of Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy stated that broadcasters who have undertaken to convert a transmission site from analog to digital or to establish new digital transmission facilities, or gap fillers, are required to have the site active six months before the digital switchover date. As the department rightly pointed out, this six-month time frame is critical in providing residents and businesses with the necessary time to ensure they have adequate digital television reception and to properly convert their current equipment and free-to-air television aerials. The government did not observe the six-month rule in the case of the initial Sunraysia analog switch-off or the South Australian switch-off—nor did they make it for the Victorian switch-off, due on 5 May. The coalition will be watching closely to see that the disallowable instrument the minister needs to lodge to switch off regional Queensland ensures that there will be six months between the proposed switch-off date and when the last broadcaster owned and controlled digital terrestrial transmission facility is commissioned.
Turning to the specifics of schedule 2 of the bill, the coalition acknowledges that there are measures related to the VAST service in the bill that are critical to the rollout of digital television in Western Australia. We support ensuring that commercial broadcasters in remote and regional Western Australia are given the same opportunity to build the necessary infrastructure to deliver the full suite of digital television channels via terrestrial broadcast before allowing viewers in those regions to access the satellite service, thereby protecting the local terrestrial broadcast market.
However, we do wish to record our reservations with items 47, 50, 51 and 52 in the bill. These measures allow broadcasters to seek exemptions from existing obligations to roll out digital terrestrial facilities in certain circumstances and allow the minister to exempt applications from the ABC or SBS to roll out digital terrestrial facilities of their own in certain circumstances. Under these exemptions, any commercial broadcaster, the ABC or SBS could request exemption from providing digital terrestrial transmission facilities within their ACMA conversion scheme to communities of less than 500.
Under the current provisions of the Broadcasting Services Act 1992, broadcasters have no choice but to convert their analog facilities in such a way that provides for the same terrestrial signal coverage. The minister’s office has advised the coalition that, left unchanged, this may result in what they describe as ‘mixed reception outcomes’, where viewers need to install both terrestrial and satellite digital reception equipment to access the full range of digital television services. If this is the intention of the proposed change, the coalition is concerned that the bill actually goes well beyond this and could result in broadcasters applying for exemptions from upgrading or installing digital terrestrial services, especially in remote areas.
In conclusion, the coalition acknowledges that the passage of the legislation is necessary to continue to implement the government’s digital switchover policy, especially in regional and remote Western Australia. However, the coalition strongly urges the government to consider amending the bill consistent with the concerns that I have expressed. While there are no direct measures contained in this bill that would have any impact on the rollout of the satellite subsidy scheme or the six-month rule, the coalition asks the government to consider the comments that I and my colleagues, and indeed local communities, particularly in Queensland, have made, and to adjust the scheme to ensure smooth implementation of the switch to digital television, particularly for regional and remote Australians. It surely must be evident to the government, as it is to communities in regional Australia, that, notwithstanding the technical functionality and capacity of satellite services, it is clearly preferable where it is at all possible for digital services to be retransmitted terrestrially. To support local communities in doing that—enabling the VAST satellite subsidy to be pooled so that they have the wherewithal to convert to digital retransmission—is manifestly good policy, is in the public interest and would both improve the technical reliability of the service and reduce the cost of receiving the new digital services for householders in those regions.",REPS,<title>BROADCASTING LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (DIGITAL DIVIDEND AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2011</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,15,1
"Hayes, Chris, MP",ALP,2011-03-23,"—The Broadcasting Legislation Amendment (Digital Dividend and Other Measures) Bill 2011 will amend the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 and the Radiocommunications Act 1992 to provide the Australian Communications and Media Authority, ACMA, with improved planning and enforcement powers to implant the reorganisation of digital television channels as required. The bill will also allow for the realisation of a digital dividend of spectrum by 31 December 2014. I will go into what that means in the broader context a little later.
The bill will ensure the equalisation of television services for regional, rural and remote Australia, allowing all Australians the same degree of access to television channels. Allowing for regional Australians to have access to the same television channels as the rest of us is a key outcome of the government’s switchover program. The bill will enable viewers in remote and regional areas to access the VAST satellite communications service to receive the full suite of digital television channels. Providing equal access to television services to all Australians, regardless of where they live, is extremely important, and its importance has been known for some time. Before I came down to make my contribution I looked up the report of a committee inquiry that I participated in back in 2006, the House Standing Committee on Communications, Information Technology and the Arts inquiry into the update of digital television in Australia. Belatedly, I got my highlighter out and flipped through that document. I want to draw your attention to a couple of things I have noted. The report noted:
Not since the shift from black and white to colour has so radical a change in the nature of Australian television taken place. The ‘revolution’ is the introduction of digital television … and the planned switch-off of current analogue services.
DTV offers clearer, sharper pictures in widescreen format. As it requires less spectrum to broadcast, it also offers opportunities for many more channels, and additional features such as interactivity and datacasting.
In terms of dealing with digital television, the report says:
[Digital television] is a new television technology that is replacing existing analogue free-to-air television in Australia.
[Digital television] delivers television signals in a substantially more efficient way than the current analogue system. With analogue broadcasting, the signal is in the form of a continuous wave, whereas digital broadcasting signals are in the form of discrete bits of information.
Analogue television channels can transmit one continuous stream of programming … DTV is a broadcasting transmission system which uses digital modulation techniques to transmit television programs.
—You don’t sound convincing, Chris!
—I am getting to that. I am going to win you over yet, Luke. The report says:
Through compression technology, [digital television] broadcasting transmitters have the capacity to transmit an [high definition TV] picture, or to transmit multiple programs at the same time using the same amount of bandwidth as used for analogue television.
It concludes that digital television will allow for making available residual transmission capacity. And that is what has occurred.
I am glad the member for Cowper intervened. He was not on that particular committee, but I recall one of his colleagues who was on the committee and who sits on the opposition frontbench took the view that under no circumstances could she ever see analogue television been switched off. Obviously a lot of water has gone under the bridge since 1976, and we have certainly progressed a long way to deliver digital television in a meaningful way to the Australian public. But we are going further. This is where the member for Cowper would probably want to get up and support this piece of legislation. He represents a rural seat—including my parents, who are in that seat—and his constituents will all benefit from the application of digital television. They will see the vast array of new programming available and they will have the ability to see it in high definition. We are certainly moving with the rest of the world in being able to make these services available to the Australian people.
The bill also provides for a very important aspect—that is, the freeing up of some of the residual spectrum. That is scheduled to be auctioned in 2014. That spectrum is obviously very valuable space. It is something that was previously used through the analog transmission. It is now capable of being used for other activities in servicing the community. In fact, there are 106 megahertz of spectrum which has been freed up in what is known as the 700 band. It is an extraordinarily interesting band. This particular spectrum can carry large amounts of information, of data, at high speeds over very long distances and can penetrate buildings. As I have had the opportunity to have a discussion on the odd occasion with the minister, I have indicated to him that this is the very sort of capacity that both the police and the emergency services need to safeguard public interest, particularly during critical instances when communications systems are often congested or break down. I would highlight the experiences that we endured during the Victorian bushfires, the recent floods in Queensland, Cyclone Yasi and what occurred to our colleagues in Christchurch, where their 000 services went down for a period of five hours.
Police and emergency services need access to an appropriate spectrum. I am not saying how much, but I know each of the police commissioners has sought to articulate that particular position. I know they have written to the government seeking that 20 megahertz be quarantined in that 700 spectrum for the use of police and emergency services. At the moment our ambos, our firefighters and our police all communicate on the 400 megahertz spectrum. That is a spectrum limited to voice command, voice communication. It certainly is not an area of spectrum that is going to be capable of meeting the modern needs of law enforcement or emergency services. When you have to dispatch people to a particular scene or incident and, for instance, you have to provide them with data or provide them with maps, provide them with video streaming, the 400 megahertz spectrum will not do any more than what a police walkie-talkie does, quite frankly.
As I said, I know each of the police commissioners has made this matter known to government. Indeed, only recently Commissioner Negus of the Australian Federal Police, when he spoke to parliamentary officers of the law enforcement committee, indicated the AFP’s significant interest in having a measure of the 700 band reserved for discrete communications of police and emergency services. If this does not occur the telecommunication systems—presumably operated by companies such as Optus, Telstra, Vodafone—would all be out there and vying for this valuable piece of digital real estate, if I can put it that way. I just do not see that the police and the various fire and emergency services would be in a position to compete against those particular power players for that valuable spectrum. That is why the position has been put that a certain part of that spectrum should be quarantined from sale or auction.
I know this is not what occurs in this bill but, should the government eventually reserve part of the spectrum for police and emergency services, I suggest that it be done on the basis that requirements are made for national policing and that every state and territory police service, together with the AFP, and their respective emergency services counterparts, establish a fully functioning network within five years or that such spectrum should revert to the Commonwealth for commercial disposal—in other words, a provision of ‘use it or lose it’.
Fast, reliable communication and data exchange is needed by our emergency services personnel in order to provide them with the tools to do a job which is often in very, very difficult circumstances. Our police and emergency services are duty bound to protect the community at times of threats, emergencies, natural disasters and crises, and we all pay tribute to them in this place and say what an extraordinary job they do. But one of the things we also have to have central in our minds is that it is okay to give accolades to the police and emergency services but we must also make sure that, when they go and do the job that we want them to do on behalf of our community, we equip them with the appropriate resources and technologies to do just that. It is in the interests of community safety and also the safety of the 350,000 ambulance, police and fire officers and state emergency service personnel, for them to be equipped with such technology. Relying on a commercial provider does not meet the need of our public safety agencies, particularly during times of high usage or high threat, when the services of these providers could be congested to the point of failure.
Internationally, the switch to digital television has also resulted in a freeing up of additional spectrum. I think it is important for this place to note that both the European Union and the USA have targeted the 700-megahertz band for public safety and police communications networks—what I understand is referred to in the US as the D Block communications system. The Obama administration in the US has recently lent its full support to a proposal to give a valuable chunk of their radio waves to the emergency services and to build a national wireless high-speed broadband network for public safety. I think this is indicative of the way we are going with the application of technology—not simply in our viewing technology and how we can use it to the benefit of our communities but also in how we apply it for the issues of police, emergency services, law enforcement, and rescue and disaster response.
If we are going to be conscious of providing our police with the tools that they need for protecting society, we need to ensure that they have present technologies and emerging technologies capable of being used in their communication networks. It would a great shame, in my humble opinion, if we found that a young person with a smartphone has more advanced and better communications than the capability of police officers out there carrying their two-way radios and seeking to protect the Australian community.
As I indicated, I have raised these matters with the minister and he is very alive to my concerns in those areas. What I have sought to do from the outset is to show that we took what was identified in 2006, when people opposite were saying that the analog system would never be turned off, and moved this forward. We have taken the nation into the digital age not only in digital television but more recently in digital radio. We are showing the leadership that is required, and we will continue to do that. So I suggest to my colleagues opposite, including the member for Cowper, that they get on board, support this piece of legislation, support the member for Cowper’s community and, more importantly, support my parents.
 (Mr S Sidebottom)—Thank you for your contribution. The question is that the bill be now read a second time. I call the member for Cowper—probably in response as well.",REPS,<title>BROADCASTING LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (DIGITAL DIVIDEND AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2011</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,15,1
"Hartsuyker, Luke, MP",NATS,2011-03-23,"—Yes, I would certainly hasten to add that the member for Fowler can sit in this place in the full knowledge that his parents are very well represented, and I will certainly work hard to ensure that they stay that way. I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Broadcasting Legislation Amendment (Digital Dividend and Other Measures) Bill 2011. The bill is presented in two schedules, the first of which introduces measures to release the so-called digital dividend. The second is to amend the regulatory framework overseeing the services provided on the VAST satellite network as part of the switchover from analog to digital television.
Schedule 1 amends the Broadcasting Services Act to implement a reorganisation of spectrum management in order to release spectrum within the frequency range of 694 to 820 megahertz, which is referred to as the ‘digital dividend.’ Spectrum within the digital dividend is highly valued by the broadcasting and mobile telephony industries.
According to the government’s green paper on managing the digital dividend, the spectrum will allow the implementation of fourth-generation mobile wireless networks using Long Term Evolution technology and mobile WiMAX. These technologies will theoretically provide peak data speeds of 100 megabits per second and higher. By accessing the spectrum, telecommunications companies will be able to provide high-speed services to consumers and households whilst allowing those consumers the flexibility to stay mobile.
This legislation gives the Australian Communications and Media Authority improved planning and enforcement powers to rearrange digital television channels, a process known as restacking. The actual digital dividend will be released by restacking the current bands of spectrum allocated to analog television, which are being converted to digital television through the digital television switchover. Currently the frequency band between 582 and 820 megahertz is dedicated to the Ultra High Frequency band V, which is used to broadcast analog television. Switching over from analog to digital television frees this band by converting the broadcast of television to lower bands of spectrum.
The government aims to auction the digital dividend spectrum in the second half of 2012, and the actual spectrum will become available after all broadcasting centres are converted to digital television in December 2013. ACMA will be authorised to restack television services by realigning television licence area plans to new areas and within lower bands of the spectrum. The new license area plans will be defined by ACMA through legislative instrument and would specify the channels available in particular areas of Australia to provide television broadcasting services.
However, the legislation also gives the minister the power to issue a written direction to ACMA about the exercise of its powers to make or vary television licence area plans and to impose an obligation on ACMA to comply with such a direction. Ministerial directions to ACMA will be legislative instruments and tabled in parliament, but the explanatory memorandum to this bill makes it clear that the instruments will not be disallowable. This means that parliament will be able to read the ministerial direction to ACMA but will not be able to debate and vote on its content.
The coalition has some concerns with this approach. The legislation today is the very last chance this parliament will have to meaningfully debate the release of the digital dividend and restacking television broadcasts. At the moment, we are seeing one of the largest reorganisations of telecommunications services in Australian history through the digital dividend release and the National Broadband Network. Yet the government is operating in the dark, whilst industry operates in an environment of regulatory uncertainty.
The coalition is concerned that making ACMA’s management of the digital dividend subject to a non-disallowable ministerial direction only increases the uncertainty that is preventing the Australian telecommunications sector from making confident investment decisions. The NBN rollout is an example. As Pat Tapper, CEO of Internode, Australia’s largest privately-owned ISP, said in the Australian newspaper three weeks ago:
“The NBN is in the paper every day, but when you try to nut down on it and figure out what’s happening from what’s being said, there’s no path you can be confident in because it’s being planned and rolled out incrementally. There are a lot of variables in that.”
As is evident from submissions made to the Senate inquiry on this legislation, broadcasters have already been subject to uncertain ministerial directions concerning the digital dividend. The minister issued a direction to ACMA on 9 July 2010 for the purposes of providing policy guidance on the government’s digital dividend objectives. The direction was rushed through just before parliament was dissolved last year for the election. There was no opportunity for parliament to consider the direction and its importance. As Broadcast Australia says in their submission to the Senate inquiry, the direction issued on 9 July 2010:
… is shaping the future of all free-to-air broadcasting for decades to come.
Broadcast Australia argues:
… the Directions of 9 July should be inserted into the Broadcasting Services Act …
and says:
We still believe this would be the desirable way to allow Parliament to oversight and consider such important planning principles before their implications become a “fait accomplis”.
The Local Government Association of Queensland notes in their submission:
… the major policy issues concerning this enormous change in broadcasting and mobile voice and data services across Australia have been enshrined in little publicised Ministerial Directions of 9 July 2010. These … Objectives which, among other things may determine whether most areas of regional Queensland ever get digital radio, or whether a 6th free-to-air TV terrestrial frequency will be rolled out anywhere in regional Queensland deserve some debate at the Australian Parliament level.
Under this legislation, there is nothing to prevent the minister from issuing directions to ACMA that again shape the direction of broadcasting without any parliamentary oversight. The coalition is concerned that such an approach could add to the regulatory uncertainty already faced by the industry. Parliament would ideally be able to scrutinise future ministerial directions to ensure that any direction is in the best interests of consumers without placing unnecessary burdens on the industry. The coalition will certainly monitor any directions made by the current minister under this legislation and will revisit the issue of non-disallowable instruments as the need arises.
Schedule 2 to this bill introduces amendments to the legislative framework which the new VAST satellite service operates under. In particular, the amendments will allow broadcasters to request an exemption from providing digital terrestrial transmission facilities within the schemes operated by ACMA for broadcasters to convert their services to digital. Broadcasters will be able to request an exemption for any communication area, regardless of its population, which is not currently serviced by an analog terrestrial broadcast by local free-to-air entities. However, the minister is not authorised to grant an exemption unless the area contains fewer than 500 people in residence. The legislation provides that an exemption would need approval by the minister and would then be tabled as a legislative instrument in parliament.
The coalition is concerned that these provisions will allow commercial stations to refuse to provide television coverage to areas considered unprofitable. However, the Department of Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy has advised that the legislation in practice will only affect those areas receiving a broadcast solely from the ABC. According to the department, the provisions will allow the minister, on a case-by-case basis, to decide which areas can be excluded where an ABC tower is providing the ABC as the sole channel for the area and where VAST replicates what is currently available. This can be potentially applied to the 98 areas across Australia that are only served by an ABC tower. The VAST service will provide a superior television broadcast to these areas because it will contain all 16 digital channels, including the ABC which the viewer would currently receive. Viewers will also be provided with rolling local news channels, providing local news content from each regional broadcasting centre in Australia. As such, viewers in areas that currently only receive the ABC will be provided with an improved service after connecting to VAST. The coalition will be watching closely to ensure that the legislation delivers an appropriate outcome for viewers.
We believe that the government must do all it can to ensure that people are able to access terrestrial television regardless of where they live. The VAST satellite service should only be seen as a service of last resort. Regional groups and local councils across Australia have concerns about the quality of service provided by VAST and the fact that many of their communities will not receive a terrestrial digital signal. Broadcast Australia submitted to the Senate inquiry that there was a misconception that the VAST service provides a comparable level of service to terrestrial television. Broadcast Australia said that:
… receiving free-to-air digital TV channels (DTH) from the VAST satellite is more costly and offers less utility and convenience to homes than local terrestrial reception of those same channels.
Currently there are many regional and remote communities in Australia receiving television via self-help sites, which are retransmission sites operated by local councils or community groups. These sites receive a broadcast—either terrestrially from the nearest major centre or through the Aurora satellite service—and then rebroadcast the terrestrial signal in the local community. As television broadcasting is switched over to digital, these sites will require upgrading in order to receive and broadcast a new digital signal. According to the department, broadcasters have made a candidate list of 57 communities which will be provided with a terrestrial digital signal.
A further 34 regional communities currently relying on self-help sites will receive a digital signal through gap fillers, which will consist of either a stronger digital signal from nearby centres or a signal provided by the installation of signal boosters. But, according to the department, there are 16 regional communities relying on self-help sites that will not be upgraded to digital or receive a gap filler. These communities will be forced onto the VAST service. There are also 374 communities, classed as remote and which receive limited terrestrial signals, that will be forced onto the VAST service.
I attended a forum recently, with the member for Dawson, at Dingo Beach in the Whitsundays region of Queensland. Dingo Beach is a small community that receives terrestrial television through a self-help tower and is not a candidate for conversion to digital. It is proposed by the government that Dingo Beach will be provided with a VAST service. The community attending that forum unanimously wanted to receive reliable terrestrial television so that they could get the relevant local content; however, unfortunately to this point the government has been unwilling to accede to the request for the provision of a terrestrial service to Dingo Beach.
There are common issues across regional areas that will not be upgraded to digital. For instance, the Remote Area Planning and Development Board of Queensland lists three main concerns with the VAST service. Firstly, satellite television does not allow the portability of terrestrial television, which is preferred by tourists and travellers. Unless they have expensive satellite systems, caravan tourists in particular will not be able to receive a signal when travelling through areas where there is no terrestrial coverage.
Secondly, households that install a VAST satellite will be forced to move the satellite when vacating the home if they want to ensure satellite coverage in a new home without purchasing new satellite equipment. Thirdly, the government’s satellite subsidy scheme does not cover businesses important to regional areas such as hotels, motels, resorts and shops. Businesses struggling with tight margins and problems such as increasing electricity costs will find it difficult to pay the $10,000 to $20,000 that it will cost some businesses to convert.
For these reasons, the coalition has asked the government to complete an analysis of the costs and benefits of pooling the subsidy scheme available for households within each community that is currently serviced by a self-help site. The opposition strongly urges the government to consider this because many communities would certainly prefer that option. It may in the end turn out cheaper, depending on the size of the community involved.
Instead of providing the subsidy direct to households, the funding could be pooled and used to upgrade retransmission sites, allowing digital terrestrial broadcasts to the local community. The coalition recognises that in some sites an upgrade to digital simply would not be possible. These are the areas where VAST is an appropriate service to implement, when all other avenues have been exhausted.
The bill provides a means for broadcasters to rely on VAST without necessarily exhausting all avenues. The legislation as drafted provides much scope for broadcasters to refuse an upgrade, with little guidance on how this decision should be determined. The conversion to digital is a very important issue, and the coalition certainly is concerned about the prospect that some viewers in regional and remote areas may not get equity of access to high-quality digital television. It is a vitally important issue for regional and rural Australia that people be part of the digital switchover in the most efficient and most effective way. We are certainly concerned about the impact of costs on small business. The satellite subsidy scheme also only provides for the conversion of the first television, so each additional set-top box is 100 per cent at the cost of the household, which is a significant cost for some households. The coalition certainly is supportive of the move from analog to digital and will be watching the government’s performance in this area very carefully.",REPS,<title>BROADCASTING LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (DIGITAL DIVIDEND AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2011</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,15,1
"Rowland, Michelle, MP",ALP,2011-03-23,"—I will address some of the issues raised by the member for Wentworth and the member for Cowper and the concerns they say they have with the operation of the Broadcasting Legislation Amendment (Digital Dividend and Other Measures) Bill 2011. If you want to look at a party that addresses digital black spots, look at us on this side of the House. In fact, almost a year ago it was the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy who announced a landmark agreement about VAST—a landmark agreement that would provide digital TV services to viewers who could not receive terrestrial digital TV. What Senator Conroy said was very true—that is, that we are the party, the government, of equality of opportunity when it comes to the cities and the regions. He said:
This is a significant breakthrough in the provision of digital TV services to all Australians, particularly for those in remote and regional areas who for many years have had to put up with less choice than people in the cities.
The new VAST service will make available to all parts of Australia, for the first time, the same number of channels as those in the capital cities. So if you want to talk about equality of opportunity, if you want to talk about what is being done to ensure that viewers in regional and remote areas of Australia have the same opportunities as everyone else in the digital environment, you need look no further than us.
The member for Cowper comes in here and talks about this digital switchover, the digital dividend being conducted in Australia, as being rife with uncertainty. What absolute rubbish! I defy anyone in this place to find me a better strategy being executed anywhere else in the world. Where is the regulatory uncertainty? You will find that the fulfilment of this digital dividend has the support of all aspects of the communications sector, from broadcasters to telco operators, to carriage service providers—the list goes on.
It was recognised as early as January 2008, more than three years ago, that there would be an issue with the switchover timetable regarding black spots in self-help retransmission sites. So what did the government do? This government convinced broadcasters to upgrade more than 100 self-help sites to digital capacity. So it is not the first time that we have addressed this issue for the benefit of rural and remote constituents.
This proposed legislation forms part of one of the most significant developments in Australia’s digital economy and it is an integral step in the process of planning and enforcing the restack of certain broadcasting services that currently occupy what we call the digital dividend spectrum—the analog television spectrum which, when liberated, is going to enable all Australians to utilise the highest quality future communications services. As I said, when we look at developments in all aspects of this government’s ICT agenda that have led to this point—including the digital dividend consultation, the switchover, the National Broadband Network, the upcoming convergence review and the work being done by ACMA in its role of regulating the process of radio communications management, the auction of the digital dividend spectrum and the renewal of existing spectrum licences, which we legislated for in this place late last year with amendments to the Radiocommunications Act—one quickly realises there is a guiding goal towards which every agency, department policy maker and, may I say, element of the telecommunications and broadcasting sector is working. That goal is to maximise the benefits of the digital economy for all Australians: for all individuals, irrespective of where they live or work; in the utilisation of ICT by all sectors in our economy, both government and private and both large enterprises and small businesses; and for all types of players, such as the carriers, carriage service providers, ISPs, broadcasters and other innovators.
The spectrum path that is being pursued by this government is a fabulous opportunity for Australia to enjoy significant wireless broadband services, utilising the sweet spot of that liberated spectrum as a complement to the NBN. In fact, the two work hand in hand. You would think, given this, that it would be something that those opposite would be embracing, would be speaking on and would be welcoming. But, no, those opposite only have one strategic direction in relation to ICT, as we all know—that is, to destroy the NBN. On that point, I turn to the coalition’s policy platform on the digital dividend, and I use the term ‘policy platform’ loosely, because it is a bit hard to find any actual semblance of it. When you do look at their policy which they took to the last election, surprise! It is still their policy today. You look for some semblance of spectrum management, something that has to do with the digital dividend, and you actually do not find very much. You find statements such as:
To assist in achieving the most rapid possible rollout of services, the Coalition will take a proactive approach to spectrum allocation to support its broadband initiatives.
You actually do not see anything in that policy about the concerns that members opposite have brought here today. You do not see a single thing in that policy about rural and remote Australia having quality of access to digital television channels. You do not see anything in that policy about a strategic direction when it comes to fulfilling the digital dividend. It was so important to them that it does not even rate a mention in what is still their policy.
At this point I think it is very useful to look at the context of both this bill and the broader digital dividend framework, the fact that spectrum is a finite resource that is used but not consumed and the ways in which we regulate spectrum. We regulate spectrum to avoid interference. We want to ensure that appropriate rent is paid for a scare resource and we want to provide certainty for existing and future users of that valuable space. The objects of the Radiocommunications Act are very instructive on this point, and they include maximising, through the efficient allocation and use of the spectrum, the overall public benefit derived from using the radcomms spectrum. There are lots of public benefits at stake here and lots of public benefits in the decisions governments will make in fulfilling those statutory objects. We as a government—we as a legislature as a whole, in fact—bear those statutory obligations. Looking at the overall public benefit, I want to remind all of us here that one of the public benefits is to maximise the financial return on this spectrum. That is why we seek a return on this scare resource through a simultaneous multiple-round ascending auction process. In particular, I want to reiterate that we only get one opportunity to do this. We only get one bite at what is called the ‘sweet spot’ of the spectrum—one opportunity to get it correct.
Turning to the restack and the nature of this bill and its role in the realisation of the digital dividend, this government took the bold decision to put 126 megahertz of the 700 megahertz band into the digital dividend, using a process that is internationally harmonised with our neighbouring countries. The services that will be offered are significant and exciting, and we are already seeing Telstra trialling some of those services and looking to roll out wireless services of similar great potential. I want to turn to the process and the green paper that the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy released and consulted on which gave rise to the current strategy that is being pursued. In June last year, when he announced the size and location of the digital dividend, the minister noted:
Wireless broadband is an important complement to fixed line services, and the release of this spectrum will enhance and support the services that will be enabled by the Government’s investment in the National Broadband Network.
Extensive consultation was undertaken on the green paper, and what the minister announced reflects the importance of the decision that was made again—only having one chance to get this right when the liberated spectrum is reallocated. The release is in a contiguous block in the UHF band, and a contiguous dividend means substantial connectivity and productivity benefits will flow. It avoids what engineers will call the ‘swiss cheese’ problem: irregular holes in the spectrum that are not suitable for advanced wireless broadband services. As the minister said in his announcement, this is indeed a historic microeconomic reform. The auction process will be conducted in the second half of next year, and the clearance of that space will be as soon as possible after the analog switch-off on 31 December 2013. This process has been one of certainty and sound strategy—again, consistent with the imperatives of spectrum management.
I want to turn to the restack and the process of clearing out those broadcasting services currently occupying the sweet spot of the spectrum and how they are going to be organised more efficiently. ACMA has been working on these complex issues associated with the restack and the switch-off. There has been significant coordination with broadcasters. In terms of a digital dividend for television, there are essentially two ways of restacking in channels 52 to 69, commonly referred to the block approach versus the minimum move approach. Either everything above channel 52 gets moved or you have a block move—all six digital channels are moved next door to each other. You can see the good outcomes that could possibly flow from that option, such as all antennae being able to work. Amongst other things, ACMA is taking these things into account and is cognisant of the need to minimise viewer disruption. In fact, it is currently consulting on these two proposed planning approaches for the restack. ACMA has also made it clear that the broadcasting industry will need to coordinate its efforts to avoid disrupting services. This again reflects the very sound approach being taken by the regulator, working in conjunction with the industry, to ensure that all consumers benefit from the digital dividend.
I want to say some other things about the ACMA process. I think Giles Tanner from ACMA summed it up very well when he described the digital dividend and how the advances in digital communications technology allow us to do more with less. ACMA’s role in the digital dividend is threefold: the conversion process, moving from free-to-air analog to digital; the restack of those digital TV services into a smaller amount of the UHF spectrum band slots; and the reallocation of the liberated spectrum left vacant after the TV restack. As I said, that reallocation will take the form of spectrum licences.
In Australia our approach is to have an auction process, consistent with the recognition of the value of this spectrum and the imperative of achieving an appropriate rent for such a valuable, scarce resource. Also, consistent with the statutory objects of the act, 15-year spectrum licences will be auctioned. This reflects intelligent planning. It will avoid having a period when there is spectrum lying unused between the analog shutdown and the start date for the new uses of the digital dividend spectrum. Reallocation will occur in parallel with the planning and implementation of the restack.
I said earlier that I defy anyone to find a strategy that has been carried out in a more orderly and structured way. I want to turn to the overseas experience in this area and the importance of harmonisation. It is very useful to contrast the successful transition that is underway in Australia with the European experience. So much of the time European countries take action on certain policy issues only when they are directed to do so and are threatened with action under the European Union sanctions process. In contrast, Australia is actually helping with the harmonisation. We are reflecting the true nature of radcomms management as a global management issue of standardisation and interference management. In this radcomms area it is actually counterproductive to insist on a uniquely Australian solution. The result of the approach we have taken is that other countries actually are going to look to Australia as a model of how to do this task successfully. This is a very good news story for Australia.
The spectrum auction process will deliver benefits for consumers, including economies of scale, achieved by harmonising our use of the 700 megahertz spectrum with the uses in major overseas markets. There are headlines in Europe, for example, that say that the digital dividend may not pay off as well as it should. There are risks in some countries where spectrum is being freed up that only uses a fraction of that required for analog transmission. From initial auctions, the trend is not encouraging for consumers. The Swedish auction has only confirmed the status quo, to preserve what some have analysed to be an oligopoly in the domestic mobile business. Australia has very sound spectrum management rules to overcome that.
The bill confers on ACMA and indeed clarifies some aspects that have been interpreted as statutory impediments to carrying out its planning functions in this digital dividend task. The broadcasting sector and the telcos are on board. The amendments that have been made through the Radiocommunications Act and the Broadcasting Services Act continue a very clear strategy that is being held up as world’s best practice. All of us in this place should embrace the realisation of the digital dividend.",REPS,<title>BROADCASTING LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (DIGITAL DIVIDEND AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2011</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,15,1
"Truss, Warren, MP",NATS,2011-03-23,"—As we have heard, the Broadcasting Legislation Amendment (Digital Dividend and Other Measures) Bill 2011 seeks to take some further steps in the government’s program to convert Australia’s television system to digital. The elements in the bill will make some improvements in that regard, but this debate gives us an opportunity to review the progress of the analog switch-off. There are widespread concerns in the community about the impact on households of the digital conversion. This is the first time in history that a Labor government has delivered something to the country areas before the cities. I suppose that should have set off alarms in the first place. Country areas are clearly being used as the experimental guinea pigs to see whether this conversion can be run smoothly before it is attempted in any of the large cities.
The member for Greenway said that the digital television system will deliver equality of access to people in regional Australia. It is true to say that for most people who live in regional communities it will deliver equality of access to the range of channels that exist in the cities. There will also be a small number of people in remote areas who will be better off than they were, and that is certainly to the credit of this program. Unfortunately, there will also be some thousands who will be much worse off. Those people cause me the greatest concern.
The government’s decision to not convert over 400 of the self-help transmitters around the country means that over 400 communities will have their analog television signals switched off and there will be no digital transmission coming from the transmitters. Instead, the government is offering a satellite option, an option which is obviously inferior for most of these people. The government is going to make billions of dollars out of the sale of the spectrum that will be freed up as a result of the closure of the analog television network. Why can’t it spend some of those dollars—$100 million or so would just about do it—to convert all of the self-help transmitters so that people living in small regional communities and in some cases urban communities are able to get their signal in the same way that they get it now? That is surely a reasonable request.
About 100 or so of the transmitters will be converted, largely at the expense of the television stations themselves, but over 400 will not. That seems to me to be not treating people in regional areas as fairly as they should be treated.

"Prentice, Jane, MP",LP,2011-03-23,"—I stand today to support and endorse Campbell Newman as the next Premier of Queensland. We also need a Liberal National Party member to represent the people of Ashgrove, a state seat within my electorate of Ryan. We need a strong and effective Premier of Queensland, and I can think of no-one better than Lord Mayor Campbell Newman. You do not get a reputation around Brisbane and Queensland as ‘Can Do’ Campbell without having a strong track record of action, commitment and delivery. There is no doubt that Campbell will deliver for the people of Ashgrove as their local member and for all Queenslanders as their Premier, just as he has for the people of Brisbane for the past seven years.
Having worked closely with Campbell since 2002, I know he will make an outstanding contribution to state politics and the state Liberal National Party team, both as a member and as leader. Campbell’s energy, passion and commitment to Brisbane and Queensland are something I admire, and I know he will work tirelessly and faithfully for the people of Ashgrove and deliver the LNP to government in Queensland.
Campbell’s experience in senior management and in the military and his commitment to getting on with the job of delivering services and outcomes for Brisbane residents and Queenslanders will stand in stark contrast to the tired Bligh Labor spin machine. I have every confidence that Campbell Newman will be able to make this unique situation work and, furthermore, run an effective and powerful campaign to be both the leader of the LNP and the Premier of Queensland.

"Morrison, Scott, MP",LP,2011-03-23,"—Australia’s immigration detention network is collapsing under the strain of Labor’s failed border protection regime. Under Labor, our immigration detention network is in a rolling crisis. Last Sunday week, after a series of breakouts on Christmas Island, the Prime Minister said to reporters here in Canberra that ‘this is a situation that is well in hand’. Within 24 hours of the Prime Minister claiming that the situation was in hand on Christmas Island, tear gas was being dropped, beanbag rounds were being fired at protesters and Christmas Island had descended into a week of chaos.
Yesterday morning the minister at the table, the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, boldly assured the nation, with the same assurance that the Prime Minister sought to assure people around the country last Sunday week, that his advice was that all asylum seekers had been accounted for. Yet last night on Lateline he had to admit that there were still at least two missing—there may well have been more; he was not able to be exactly sure—after a face-to-file check failed to accord with a headcount. This is the status of the management of our immigration detention network.
What concerns me about this is that the government is pretending that there is nothing here to see. I asked the minister whether he knew, when he went out yesterday morning and sought to assure Australians that everything was under control, that further checks had to be undertaken. I asked him whether he knew that there is not just a headcount but that you have to do a face-to-file check, as he mentioned last night. If he did know that, why was he so quick out of the blocks to try to create the impression that everything was under control, just like the Prime Minister was?
As is usual in this portfolio, the government protests as to certain facts but, as the facts become known, it is clear that the minister is in charge of absolute chaos. Yesterday on the ABC the member for Wannon nailed this pretty accurately. He knows, as I do—particularly as I come from New South Wales—that the minister is known in the New South Wales Right as a numbers man. But it is clear that he could not get his numbers right on Christmas Island yesterday. The numbers that he should be concerning himself with are the ones on Christmas Island, rather than the numbers within the New South Wales Right faction here in Canberra—where I understand he has been exceptionally busy of late. Perhaps I could suggest to the minister that to find those asylum seekers an all-points bulletin should be put out to the bowling alleys of the country, where they lost the last people who had broken out of the system. Or perhaps they are down at the Melbourne aquarium, where they found the last one. There is a whole series of places they could be. The minister may be advised that, next time, before he goes out and starts pretending that everything is okay, he might want to check that they have done all the checks, so that he can give proper assurance rather than giving false hope, as he continues to do on a daily basis about the status of our immigration program and about the status of our detention network that is in complete chaos. It is a rolling crisis.
I remind those in the House that on 21 November 2009 a bloody fight—as it was described—broke out on Christmas Island, involving 150 Afghans and Sri Lankans. They attacked each other with broom handles, pool cues and tree branches. Three detainees were medivac’d to Perth, 10 were admitted to hospital on Christmas Island and 27 others were injured. On 20 to 22 September 2010 there were rolling rooftop protests at Villawood. Literally, beds were burnt—
Opposition members interjecting—Beds were burning!
—Beds were burning at Villawood, as they were on Christmas Island last week. There were beds burnt at Villawood and people stayed on the roofs for a number of days in that fairly appalling scene. On 1 September 2010, 90 detainees broke out of the Northern Immigration Detention Centre in Darwin. That cost taxpayers $430,000 to fix the mess. And not just that, but it cost a further $790,000 to upgrade the centre because of the security problems at that place, because it was not developed to deal with this level of policy failure. Mind you, I note that we learned in estimates that no-one was charged over that incident either.
On 15 November 2010, there was a violent brawl at Broadmeadows involving 50 children. One was hospitalised. On 17 November there was another rooftop protest at Villawood. At the Airport Lodge in Darwin there was a protest over several days, from 7 to 10 February, which ended with 11 people hospitalised and a further 11 taken to the watch house. On 27 and 28 February there was a riot at Christmas Island in the family compound, where 13 people were injured, windows were smashed, three asylum seekers were arrested and 15 young males had to be moved off the island. On 16 March 2011 there was a mass breakout at the Asti Motel. They walked down Smith Street in Darwin at will. Hundreds of them walked down Smith Street in Darwin, while—not to be outdone—a rooftop protest was also underway at the Northern Immigration Detention Centre in Darwin.
On 17 March there was, for once, a quieter protest, but a protest nonetheless, at Curtin. We should be watching Curtin carefully, because the minister knows that things are boiling up in Curtin as well. On 12 and 13 March there were mass breakouts at Christmas Island, and that was the same weekend the Prime Minister sought to tell everybody that everything was under control. Then, of course, from 14 to 17 March riots broke out on Christmas Island as hundreds engaged in violent protests. Buildings and beds were burned to the ground, staff were holed up and unable to escape, police were assaulted, tear gas was used and beanbag rounds were deployed.
Such is the crisis that has occurred under this government and under this minister that Federal Police had to take by force a Commonwealth facility. That is a disgrace. That is absolutely a loss of control. Not only have they lost control of our borders; now they have lost control of the detention network—and the chaos continues.
This is not the first time we have seen riots and other protests in our detention network, as those on this side of the House know. But there is a big difference now as opposed to when the coalition was in government. When this side of the House had to deal with the difficulties of people coming to this country, we acted. We took steps; we took action; we stopped the boats. We did that through a series of measures, not just one measure. The minister tries to make out that there was just one measure here and one measure there. There were a series of measures put in place and, as a result of those measures, the boats stopped. The number of boats reduced to an absolute trickle. I noticed that last night the minister said that his goal at Christmas Island is to get a detention population to 2,000. That is his goal!
I see the Father of the House here today. The Father of the House put in place a series of measures that ensured that when the coalition left office in November 2007 there were not 2,000 people on Christmas Island, there were not 2,000 people in the detention network; there were four people who had arrived illegally by boat who were in our detention network. That is a goal the minister might want to take up. Rather than 2,000, he might want to think about trying to get the number to four. But to get it to four he has to do some things which I do not think this minister has the resolve to do. Resolve, as the member for Berowra knows, as the former Prime Minister knows and as those who have served in that capacity know, requires you to take difficult decisions. Resolve requires you to send messages when there is chaos in our detention network and requires that you immediately sanction those who are involved in rioting.
This is a minister who is happy to have a three-month review and not know who was involved in the riots last week. He is not happy to suspend those people immediately. They are going to wait for about six months, and after that period of time, maybe even in 12 months time, when he does his general character test review case by case, he may well decide to deny them a visa. But you have to go on his form. It was revealed in this House yesterday and today that three people on SIEV36 were part of a plan, as the Northern Territory coroner said, to scuttle that boat. An independent assessment and review by the coroner found that they sank the boat. The minister knows that the general character test does not require a criminal conviction. He knows this absolutely. He knows that at any time, regardless of any other criminal proceedings, he could have revoked those visas. He could even change those visas. He could have given them a 449 safe-haven visa. But this is a minister who decided not to act. As long as this minister decides not to act, the boats will keep coming, the detention centre chaos will continue and we will continue to see the harm, the waste and the frustration of the Australian people who are angry about one thing: a government that cannot run an immigration system. They are sick to death of a government that simply refuses to listen to them and understand that what infuriates them is a government that has lost control of our detention network, our borders and our immigration system. Their only answer, as the Prime Minister did shamefully in this place a few weeks ago, is to say, ‘The Australian people feel this way because they have been victims of a race baiting campaign by the opposition.’ That is a disgrace. Before the last election the Prime Minister said, ‘If you are concerned about border protection, you are not a racist.’ Commander Bradbury over there I am sure put this in there because he knew—
 (Hon. Peter Slipper)—Order! The member will refer to the member for Lindsay by his correct title.
—I will refer to the member for Lindsay by his appropriate title rather than what I referred to him as before. It was the member for Lindsay who—before he went on that great expedition to Darwin, the well-known port in Lindsay—went out there and encouraged Australians that he was all keen on border protection and so was the Prime Minister, and the people of Lindsay did not have to worry about the government thinking they were racist because they were concerned about the government’s border protection failures. They did not have to worry about that, because that was all behind us. But in this place several weeks ago the Prime Minister restated her assault on the Australian people for having concerns about her border protection failures.
They have no policy at all. This is their policy to stop the boats: East Timor. We can have a processing centre in East Timor—as a new millennium project, I suspect. It will not be this millennium; we will have to wait for the next one. It will be the millennium processing centre at East Timor in the next millennium, to go with the Millennium Dome, I suppose, from this millennium.
The minister was saying last night: ‘It takes time and we have to wait and wait. We do not have an immediate plan; we have a long-term plan.’ I think a millennium is a particularly long period of time. But this is the plan that the government has and it is a plan that is coming to nothing.
This is a plan that worked: on 1 September 2001 Prime Minister Howard said, ‘There will be third-country processing at Nauru’; 19 days later the centre opened. Eight months after the Prime Minister announced her processing centre in East Timor, it is no closer to coming into being. This is a processing centre that is a ‘never-never’ solution.
The only other proposals they put forward, apart from removing the Howard government’s regime, was the asylum freeze. That worked well. It led to a tripling in the amount of time people spent in detention and a doubling in the detention population and it was such a great deterrent that over 50 boats turned up in the meantime and over 2,000 people. Every time this government touches this area, it completely turns to mush. The cost that is paid in humanitarian and financial terms and in the integrity of our immigration program is simply too high.
I have a challenge for this minister. This minister has to decide this week whether he is going to be part of the solution or part of the problem. This minister has to decide whether he is going to walk out of this chamber today and walk into the Prime Minister’s office and say: ‘We’ve got it wrong. We shouldn’t have changed the policy of the Howard regime. It has absolutely turned to mush. I am sitting in a sea of disaster when it comes to our detention network and you will not let me take the decision.’ That is a decision that I am sure the minister knows he has to take—he would know he has to take these decisions—and he can decide to do that today or he can roll over to the Prime Minister and continue to swim in this sea of absolute failure.
I do not think the minister will do that. I think this minister is part of the problem not the solution. His only answer to date is to go out there and employ another six media officers to spin the boats away. You cannot spin them away; you have to act and you need to act now.",REPS,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Immigration Detention</title>,Matters of Public Importance,24,1
"Bowen, Chris, MP",ALP,2011-03-23,"—At the outset I think it is appropriate, given that these issues have been raised, that I put on the record my appreciation and the government’s appreciation and acknowledgement of the work of the Department of Immigration and Citizenship, Serco and the Australian Federal Police in managing the very serious incidents—riots and protests—at Christmas Island over the last week. I think it is appropriate that that is put on the record. Sometimes staff of departments are criticised, and there is a place for that, but it is also appropriate that we thank them. And I do thank them at the outset of this debate.
There are legitimate issues for discussion in this very complex policy area, and it is right that they be raised. I will not take a lecture from members opposite on the issue of riots in detention centres. I will not take a lecture from members of the Liberal Party. The member for Cook in a short acknowledgment said, ‘We had issues too.’ He quoted issues in detention centres about protests, escapes and fires over the last couple of years. He said in a dismissive note, ‘Of course there have been incidents before.’ He did not talk about the riots and protests at Baxter. He did not talk about the riots and protests at Woomera, Curtin, Christmas Island and Nauru. He talked about some people walking down the street; he did not talk about the 480 people who left detention centres in one go under the previous government.
—We acted.
—He says, ‘We acted,’ and those protests, riots and fires started as early as 2000 or 1999. He says, ‘We acted.’ I am not going to take a lecture from the member for Cook on those issues.
The member of Cook raised a number of issues, and I am happy to deal with them one by one. Let me deal with the last: the matter he referred to as spin doctors. He says the government’s answer is to hire more spin doctors, more media advisers, through the newspaper. He says we have just created six new positions.
—You’ve advertised them.
—He says, ‘You’ve advertised them.’ It is very important not to mislead the House. Let me explain to the member for Cook how the Public Service works. When somebody leaves a position, they tend to be replaced. When they are replaced, there tend to be advertisements, so not every advertisement in the newspaper is a new position. In fact, of the six positions advertised this week, four are existing positions. The member for Cook could have given me a call. He could have put in an FOI. He could have asked. The member for Cook says there are six new positions, and it is wrong.
I feel obliged to share with the House the budget of the national communications branch of my department: $2.98 million in the year 2010-11.
—That’s all right.
—The member for Dawson says, ‘That’s all right.’ It is a lot of money and it is exactly half the amount we inherited from the previous government—not exactly half but around half: in 2007-08 it was $4.23 million and in 2006-07 it was $3.8 million; more than the current budget of the national communications branch.
If the honourable member for Cook wants to start this debate, I do not think this is essential to the debate. I do not think this is a key point, but if the honourable member for Cook wants to raise matters, he needs to be sure of his facts. He needs to make sure when he says things to the House that he is correct.
The member for Cook also raises the matter of character and, again, he has been unsure of his facts. He has been wrong. The member for Cook said in the House the other day, as I mentioned during question time, that the minister’s power to deal with character issues is not appellable; it cannot be appealed to the courts. All he had to do was lean across to the man sitting next to him, the former minister for immigration, who had his decisions on character matters appealed to the courts and had a particularly disastrous result because proper and due process is very important in these instances. I am very clear. I have said previously that I will take character into account in these processes. I am more than happy for the member for Cook when that has happened to then question me about how that occurred. I am more than happy for the member for Cook, if he is still in his current portfolio, to ask me how they were dealt with and what the result was. He can try and pre-empt the decisions all he likes.
He makes the point that character issues should be taken into account, and I agree with him. He might ask the member for Berowra, the member for Menzies or Senator Vanstone how they took character into account when considering matters at Baxter, Woomera and previous riots, protests and fires, and the millions of dollars worth of damage caused in those incidents. He could ask them how they took character into account, but I would say each case is taken on a case-by-case basis, as is appropriate.
The member for Cook raises the matter of the counts at Christmas Island and the face-to-file checks. As I made clear last night, the initial check indicated that everybody had been returned and the numbers were appropriate. Then there were some anomalies identified through the face-to-file check. They have been further checked, and I can advise the member for Cook and the House that I have been advised by the department of immigration, the Australian Federal Police and Serco that those matters have been resolved and everybody is in the detention centre—

Mr Morrison interjecting—
 (Hon. Peter Slipper)—The honourable member for Cook has had his opportunity.
—who should be in the detention centre now those final checks have been done. I am more than happy to advise the House of that.
The member for Cook, quite rightly and appropriately, raises the issue of the opposition’s alternative approach. I think the member for Cook and I would agree on some things in this House. I think we would agree that the appropriate way of dealing with pressures on detention is to break the business model of the people smugglers. I think we would agree on that. I think the member for Cook would say, ‘Yes, that’s right.’ He has different terms for it, as he is entitled to. He says, ‘There’s sugar on the table. You’ve got to remove the sugar.’ That is a different way of saying the same thing. The member for Cook likes to say that. Let us go through the member for Cook’s policy prescriptions. He raised it.

Mr Morrison interjecting—
—I remind the honourable member for Cook that he is still under warning.
—He said, ‘We have a suite of measures.’ He is right about that: there are a number of measures on the table from the opposition. I have never said, as he alleged I had, that there is only one measure. Whenever you ask the member for Cook about the solution to any problem in the world, he says, ‘Nauru.’ You could ask him the solution to global warming and he would probably say, ‘Nauru.’ You could ask him the solution to famine in the world and he would probably say, ‘Nauru.’
Nevertheless, I recognise that he has a number of measures on the table. Firstly, he has the detention centre, the offshore processing centre, at Nauru. He says that that would somehow reduce the incentive to come to Australia. He says that a detention centre at Nauru would create uncertainty as to the result of your claim for asylum in Australia. I thought: Okay, let’s have a look this. How would that work when you take into account that, of those who were settled out of Nauru, 96 per cent were settled in Australia or New Zealand?
The member for Cook says, ‘This would create uncertainty. This would stop people coming.’ It was so uncertain that 47 got settled in other countries—that is true. Out of the thousands of people, 47 people were settled in other countries; 96 per cent were settled in Australia or New Zealand. A detention facility at Nauru, with all due respect, would be another Christmas Island—an offshore excised place, a different country, but with the same result of people being processed and settled in Australia. He says, ‘Take the sugar off the table. You’ll have to spend some time in Nauru, maybe 12 months, and then you end up in Australia.’ What is the difference between being processed in Nauru, Christmas Island or Curtin? I am not sure, but the honourable member for Cook seems to think it would make a difference.
The member for Cook needs to answer some questions. Who would run the Nauru processing centre? Would it be the International Organisation for Migration? Has he been to Geneva and met with them and asked them if they would run it? Has he met with the UNHCR and asked them to run it? Or would it be run by the Department of Immigration and Citizenship? If, for example, the member for Cook tried to get an international organisation to run it and those international organisations said, ‘You’ve got to be kidding! We tried that last time. It was a disaster. We’re not going to associate our name with that sort of project,’ he would have to run it himself through the department of immigration, and we all know the legal implications of that, following the recent High Court case.
With respect, the member for Cook then talked about temporary protection visas in point 2 of his suite of measures, as he likes to call them, and he is right. He says: ‘We would introduce temporary protection visas.’ What is the impact of uncertainty there? How does that take the sugar off the table? Consider this: of the 9,043 people granted temporary protection visas, 8,600 were then granted permanent residency—95.1 per cent. So you have 96 per cent of the people at Nauru making it to Australia and 95 per cent of the people who got temporary protection visas were given permanent residency.

Mr Morrison interjecting—
—You are saying it is not true. You do not think that 95 per cent of the people who got temporary protection visas ended up with permanent residency in Australia? That is a very interesting approach.

Mr Morrison interjecting—
 (Hon. Peter Slipper)—The honourable member for Cook has had a fairly good go. He will now remain silent.
—I am more than happy. He is making some fine interjections which I would like on the record, but I do respect your ruling and the office that you hold, Mr Deputy Speaker. What would be the impact of the temporary protection visas? We should check the history and see the impact. The member for Cook very proudly says, ‘Temporary protection visas, after they were introduced, reduced the number of boats arriving in Australia.’ He says the number of boats fell.
—That is exactly what happened.
—That is exactly what happened. My old friend, the member for Stirling, comes in and says the number of boats fell. Well done. The number of asylum seekers went up. After the introduction of temporary protection visas, 8,000 people came over the next two years, but it is okay because they came on bigger boats! The number of boats went down, but the number of people went up—

Mr Keenan interjecting—
—Order! The honourable member for Stirling will also remain silent.
—and the proportion of women and children taking that dangerous journey on boats went up. Before the introduction of temporary protection visas, 13 per cent of people who arrived in Australia by boat were women and children. After their introduction, it was 48 per cent. So, if we are concerned about women and children on boats, I am not sure temporary protection visas are the answer.
So here we have a suite of measures. Measure No. 3: turn the boats back. That was a triumph in the election campaign. The ‘boat phone’—remember that?—Admiral Abbott, at Kirribilli House, on the phone saying, ‘Turn that one back’; ‘Don’t turn that one back.’ That is what we had. The member for Cook has to explain this: if his policy is to turn the boats back—he said it would be in limited circumstances, where it did not cause danger; I respect that—perhaps he could share with the House what those limited circumstances would be. What would be the circumstances when the lives of our naval personnel and the lives of the asylum seekers would not be put at risk? The other thing the member for Cook might like to explain is this: he says he is going to turn them back, but to where? The member for Cook might say, ‘Indonesia’—the logical place to turn them back to. The Indonesian government has said, ‘Not on your nelly. You’re not turning them back to us.’ When the member for Cook made his announcement and the member for Warringah, the Leader of the Opposition, made his announcement during the election campaign that we would turn the boats back to Indonesia, the Indonesian foreign ministry said, ‘We think not. Not to us.’ Minister Natalegawa, the Indonesian foreign minister said:
… simply pushing back boats to where they have come from would be a backward step.
So I am not sure where he would return them.
Then we have point 4 of the honourable member for Cook’s suite of measures. I have to say, this one is probably my favourite. This is about the number of visas that would be made available to offshore entry and onshore entry. He says, ‘We would limit the number of visas available to people who arrive in Australia by boat’—to, I think, 3,750. What would this create when you think about it? You would think, ‘Okay. Let’s have a look at this idea. Maybe this has got some merit. We’ll consider it.’ The member for Cook would say, ‘If you are one of the first 3,750 people to arrive in Australia by boat, you get a visa. If you are the 3,751st, sorry, you stay in detention’—unless he would abolish mandatory detention. I am not sure that is his policy. That is a rolling detention crisis if I have ever heard one. The first 3,750 get a visa and the rest have to wait. Don’t you think that would create quite an incentive to be one of the first 3,750? Don’t you think we would have quite a rush to be part of that process? Don’t you think we would have people saying, ‘Let’s get on a boat and make sure it is in the first few months of the year to make sure we’re one of the 3,750’?
That is the suite of measures that the honourable member for Cook refers to. I refer to it as a suite of fraudulent policies which would have no impact and may have a negative impact.
—You’ve got 30 seconds to give us your policy.
—The honourable member for Cook remains under warning.
—The member for Cook needs to be held to account and he needs to explain how these so-called policies would work, because we says, ‘We have the policies that work.’ They do not work, because they do not match the people smugglers’ business model. They do not remove the incentive for onward movement, or secondary movement, which the honourable member for Cook correctly refers to as the movement through the Asia-Pacific region. I will tell you the way to stop onward movement; I will tell you the way to reduce the people smugglers business model and eliminate it: you enter into a regional solution for a regional problem.
—We agree.
—The member for Cook says, ‘We agree.’ He thinks the region is Iran and that we should have a transfer agreement with Iran. We do not have that approach. We have the approach that we live in the Asia-Pacific region and we will enter into an Asia-Pacific regional partnership, because an international problem needs a regional solution and an international solution, not harsher punitive measures in the hope that they work and in the hope that they will make a difference, which they will not.

"Keenan, Michael, MP",LP,2011-03-23,"—I must start with a confession, and that is that I have a soft spot for the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship. Sometimes I feel that we need to save him from himself. To do that, I think we need to at least give him some facts in this debate. If that is the case, maybe he will stop coming in here verballing, misleading and telling the Australian people more untruths. I would like to do that for a few minutes today. Firstly, I want to rebut some of the things that he said about our policy regarding third-country processing on Nauru. Nauru, as we know, was used in the past in a suite of policies that did something that this minister could never claim to have done: they stopped the boats. It was not the only policy; it was part of a suite of policies to which the opposition would return to achieve the same result when the government changes.
The minister, for some unknown reason, keeps referring to the fact that 95 per cent of the people who are on Nauru came to Australia with permanent visas. I want to give him some facts issued by none other than his predecessor as the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Senator Chris Evans. On Friday 8 February 2008, in a press release from the government, Senator Evans stated:
A total of 1637 people were detained in the Nauru and Manus facilities, of whom 1153 (or 70 per cent) were ultimately resettled from—
those facilities—
to Australia or other countries. Of those who were resettled, around 61 per cent (705 people) were resettled in Australia.
The minister continually and wilfully misleads by saying that that figure is 95 per cent. If he had any integrity he would come back in here and correct the record, because that is a press release, which I am happy to table, from his predecessor as minister for immigration.
The other thing the minister does, and I think this is most unfortunate, is to continue to claim the fiction that when we introduced our suite of policies, including temporary protection visas, it somehow resulted in more people arriving in Australia illegally. That is completely and utterly untrue, and I just want to go back and remind the minister of the statistics. From 2002 onwards, for five years prior to the government changing when the Labor Party won the election, we had on average three boat arrivals per year. That is the equivalent of one arrival every four months. Three boat arrivals a year is a weekend’s work for this government. The statistics are completely and utterly irrefutable. The policies that we introduced, which were incredibly controversial at the time and criticised up hill and down dale by the Labor Party as being inhumane and not what they would do, worked to drive the people smugglers from their evil trade and stopped the boats from coming down to Australia.
I also want to address the issue, which the government raises, of the so-called ‘boat phone’. It worries me a lot, seeing that this minister clearly has no idea what is going on in his own portfolio, that they talk about the fact that, if a boat were to undertake an action on the high seas, a naval crew would not refer back to political authorities for permission to do anything. Anyone who has any understanding of how Customs and Border Protection works knows full well that a naval commander, before he took any such action, would of course go up the chain of command and that there would ultimately be a political decision about the sort of action to be taken. So this idea that somehow it is unusual for political authorities to control what their military forces do is ludicrous, and it does make me worry about what this minister actually understands about what is happening within his own portfolio.
Yesterday we saw a classic example. The minister fronted up at a press conference and said, rather unfortunately, that all the people who had escaped from Christmas Island had been accounted for. Later on he was contradicted in that, first of all by his own officials and then by officers of the Australian Federal Police. A great many events have occurred over the last week. We have seen extraordinary scenes within all our detention centres and particularly, of course, on the Christmas Island detention centre. As the shadow minister for immigration has said, we have seen the extraordinary and unprecedented sight of the Australian Federal Police being called upon to retake a Commonwealth facility by force because the Commonwealth had lost control of that facility. We saw detainees use violence against other detainees. We saw detainees use violence against Commonwealth officers. We saw widespread break-outs and riots. We saw buildings being set on fire and weapons being used.
How did we get to this situation? How is it that, when the government came into power in 2007, there were four people in our detention network who had arrived here in an unauthorised way by boat, yet now we have over 6½ thousand people in our detention network who have arrived in the same way? You have to laugh about the fact that the minister cannot manage to conduct a headcount within his own facilities. I wonder how hard it would be to conduct a headcount when you only needed to count four people. I suggest that it was a lot easier under the policies of the previous government, because the policies of the previous government had stopped the boats from coming in the first place. Ultimately, that has to be the goal of government policy, yet—sadly—this Labor Party just refuses to listen.
As I said, I do have a soft spot for the minister for immigration, so it was impossible for me not to squirm when watching him on Lateline last night. It was impossible not to feel his embarrassment as he was peppered with questions by the presenter and was unable to answer even basic questions on the facts of what is going on in his own portfolio. You have to wonder why you would even bother being a minister in this Labor government. You have consecutive prime ministers, Rudd and Gillard, treating the cabinet with contempt and making policy on the run. Then you have the spectacle of ministers who do not seem to be in charge of what is happening in their departments. The minister last night could not answer any of the questions in a categorical way. Everything had to have a caveat of ‘I am advised’ or ‘I have been told’. He does not give the impression of a minister who is in charge of events within his own portfolio.
Correct me if I am wrong, but I always understood that the idea is that ministers try to be in charge of and shape events within their portfolio. They should not just be hapless victims at the mercy of events. They should not just be talking heads for the department that go out and do press conferences and shrug their shoulders while explaining to the people the circumstances of the latest disaster that has happened within their portfolio as though everything is beyond their control because ultimately they are only the minister.
If you were squirming when the presenter asked the minister to explain some basic facts about what had been going on within his own portfolio, then you really had to feel sorry for the minister when the presenter finished off the interview by asking him about the ‘never-never’ solution in East Timor. That has become an international embarrassment. Australian diplomats are forced to run around the region pushing an idea that everybody in the room knows is never going to happen. I was lucky enough to visit East Timor in January, when I also visited Indonesia, and the East Timorese were quite forthright—as they have been whenever this issue has been raised—that they have absolutely no intention of hosting an international facility at Australia’s behest. Quite frankly, it was very hard for them to hide their disgust at the way the Australian government had treated them.
I also had the opportunity during that visit to visit Indonesia. I talked to some of the members of the committee that are looking into outlawing people-smuggling within Indonesia, something that is very important. They were very polite. They came and met me, and we had a very polite meeting. At the end of it they finally said to me: ‘You know, we are a little bit bemused about why we are always talking to Australians about people-smuggling. They come up here and ask us to do more when the Australian government is pursuing a policy that encourages the people smugglers to continue to bring people to Australia in an unauthorised way.’ That is a fair point. That is why Indonesian officials have said publicly that they would like Australia to take the sugar from the table. They would like Australia to clean up its own house and to stop encouraging people to come here in an unauthorised way and apparently doing everything we can to encourage people smugglers to be in charge of Australia’s immigration system.
The East Timor never-never solution is the ultimate embarrassment, and I urge the government to stop pretending that this is ever going to happen, stop damaging our relationships with our regional neighbours and admit that this is not going to happen. If they were serious about third-country processing they would pick up the phone, talk to the President or Prime Minister of Nauru and ask to reopen the facilities that the Australian taxpayer has already funded on that island.
Words will not solve this problem. The people smugglers need to know that this government has some resolve to stop them from bringing people down here in an unauthorised way. Unless the government shows that resolve, more people will come and we will continue to have this rolling crisis within our detention network. (Time expired)

"Saffin, Janelle, MP",ALP,2011-03-23,"—In politics people often say that if you say something often enough, long enough and hard enough—if you repeat it over and over—people will get to believing it. That is what I have heard from the coalition over the years. They keep saying: ‘Under the Howard government we had the solution and we stopped the boats. We stopped the people coming.’ It is simply not true, and the evidence does not support it. I will turn to that later on in my contribution, but I wanted to state that at the outset. I am sure some of the honourable members opposite now believe it, because they have said it long enough that they have deluded themselves. It is a fact that it just did not work.
With this debate what causes me concern is to have to be debating such a critical humanitarian issue in an atmosphere of attack and demonisation. Both planks—attack and demonisation—are there for one reason only. The honourable member for Cook raises this MPI today, but he and his coalition colleagues are doing it simply to try to gain political support by pretending to have solutions and demonising the others. It is always easy to demonise people we consider to be the others—people who are different from us, who are boat people, who come here differently. Gone are the days when there was bipartisan support on this issue. I hope that one day we can return to that, because the people around the world who are refugees and who are seeking asylum in countries around the world, particularly the wealthy developed countries, deserve better.
The honourable member for Cook talks about a crisis. There is a crisis, and it is an international crisis. It is a crisis for the tens of millions of refugees worldwide. A large percentage of those are women and children, so there is clearly a crisis, but it is in the international area. In talking about this issue there sometimes is also the charge that if you express some support for common decency you are a bleeding heart. I am happy to be accused and wear that badge. If talking about and acting on common decency means I am a bleeding heart, so be it.
I want to turn to the issue of the honourable member for Cook and others saying that under the Howard government they stopped the boats and they have the solutions or the suite of measures that the honourable member for Cook refers to. There were 240 boats that arrived under the Howard government. They carried over 13,600 asylum seekers. It is all within the timing. We have to look at the timing and at what is happening internationally and in our region. The boats stopped coming because global circumstances changed, and that is a fact. That happens because of what is happening in the international community with the conflicts in our region and the conflicts around the globe. The Taliban regime fell at the end of 2001, and millions of Afghans were able to return home. That is a fact. In 2003—

Mr Christensen interjecting—

Mr McCormack interjecting—
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I cannot hear. The honourable members opposite are disturbing me.
 (Hon. Peter Slipper)—I think the honourable member has raised a valid issue with me, and I would ask the honourable members for Dawson and Riverina to observe the standing orders.
—Thank you. In 2003, the Howard government started to build a detention centre on Christmas Island that cost $400 million. They were planning for more boat arrivals; otherwise, why would you build a detention centre? They were anticipating that the people would come. The opposition, through the honourable member for Cook, say that their suite of measures will fix the problem of turning back boats ‘where circumstances permit’. That is a hollow promise too. Of the 240 boats that arrived under the Howard government, only seven were turned back. And that was given up, too, because they realised under the Howard government that that did not work. No boats were turned back after 2003. The practical reality is that there is nowhere to turn the boats back to. Who are you going to turn them back to? Send them back to where? To avoid being turned back, boats are sabotaged, putting Australian Customs and Border Protection and Defence personnel at risk. We have seen it and do not want to do that.
Then temporary protection visas were introduced. We have heard that the temporary protection visas worked, that they stopped the people coming by boat. They were introduced, to the best of my memory, in 1999 and, after that, still about another 8½ thousand people came on boats, so I have not seen the evidence that temporary protection visas worked. Yet here we are being told that if we reintroduce them that will fix it again. The reality is there is no easy fix for this issue. Whether you are in government or in opposition, the position has to be that it is a work in progress, that we have to work through it and come to reasonable solutions to shared problems, because the issue of refugees is a shared problem.
Of the people who did come here and were granted temporary protection visas—about 11,000 people—only three per cent ever left Australia. We said to about 11,000 people, ‘You’ll have a temporary protection visa and, even though you’ve fled a country with conflict and you fear persecution, you can live here with this uncertainty under a temporary protection visa.’ Yet only three per cent of them ever went back. It is cruel, apart from being a failed solution to that problem.
The opposition also talk about going it alone on offshore processing. Mr Abbott has agreed with the government on the need for a regional processing centre—I have heard him say it. But the federal Labor government is committed to getting it right. What we are talking about is establishing a regional centre with the cooperation of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in a country which is a signatory to the international Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees. That is critical because if we are going to have a shared solution to a shared problem, to have it in the region with the cooperation of the appropriate body, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, and, I would imagine, working with the International Organisation for Migration, then it has to be done within that framework. That is where the conversation is taking place at the moment.
I have a couple of points about East Timor. The President of East Timor, His Excellency Jose Ramos-Horta, has been given carriage of this matter for Timor-Leste. He said that Timor-Leste accepts in principle to accommodate a regional assessment centre, but the opinions of all East Timorese sensibilities will be listened to before a final response is given on the Australian proposal. They are involved in those conversations about that issue. A meeting is coming up soon in Bali where I am sure that issue will be on the table.
There is one person I think of who sets quite a moral barometer for this issue, the late Peter Andren. I remember that he was a very popular member in his own area. He spoke on this always from the point of a moral position. Yes, when you are in government you have to have practical solutions, sensible solutions, but we are looking at people—(Time expired)

"Griggs, Natasha, MP",CLP,2011-03-23,"—The government’s immigration network is indeed in crisis. The system is out of control. As a consequence of Labor’s failure, our detention network is stretched beyond its capacity. When the coalition left government only four people who had arrived illegally by boat where in detention. Today that figure is more than 6,300, including more than 1,000 children.
I call on the Gillard Labor government to assure Darwin residents and Northern Territorians that they will be safe, given recent events that have occurred on Christmas Island. If you want a more visible example of the depths of the crisis Labor have created with their failed border protection policies you need look no further than the Asti Motel in suburban Darwin. On 16 March this year, 100 detainees walked out of the hotel heading downtown to Darwin. This was not people rioting and escaping from a remote or secure facility. We have experienced riots and protests and breakouts from the Berrimah secure facility as recently as last week.
Territorians are enduring riots beside residential houses. The Asti Motel is surrounded by houses and units right in the suburbs of Darwin. My office is inundated with calls from residents who no longer feel safe and secure in their own homes. This is outrageous. I cannot understand why my constituents should have to feel frightened and insecure in their own homes, experiencing riots on their front lawns as a direct result of the Gillard Labor government’s failed border protection policy. Territorians are not watching riots on TV, they are watching riots outside their bedroom windows.
The Northern Territory Police and the Royal Darwin Hospital, like many of the other services that are provided in the Northern Territory, are already stretched to capacity. How can this Labor government say that there is going to be no pressure on Territory services as a result of their failed border protection policy? In September 2010, when 90 detainees escaped from the Berrimah detention facility and staged an all-day protest on the road, there had to be a significant impact on NT Police resources. This is just one example. There have been a number of breakouts. As I said, there were people walking down the mall. It is just disgusting. There were also riots which resulted in hospitalisations at Royal Darwin Hospital. Territorians all know that Royal Darwin Hospital is stretched to capacity—but we are told this failed border protection policy will not impact on Northern Territory services at all.
It gets worse. Asylum seekers are being housed in residential apartments in the suburbs. How can this be, when Darwin is experiencing its worst housing crisis? The government are trying to hide these people by renting the apartments under a veil of secrecy. This is typical of this government—they hide the facts from Australians. They have form. When the plans for another onshore detention facility were announced recently in Darwin, they said it would cost $9.2 million. But, as we know, it will cost $83 million, and that is just for starters. I am holding up the front page of the Northern Territory News, which outlines it all. The Labor government’s failed border protection policies are costing Australians hundreds of millions of dollars each year—money that could be spent on vital services and infrastructure. The $83 million that has been identified as the cost to build the new detention facility in Darwin could be spent on building other things, such as three new schools or four new cancer centres, or for nearly a thousand nurses in our hospitals. What about 900 police officers on our streets? Maybe it could build five new suburbs. This money could even establish the eight new GP superclinics that the government have failed to deliver.
—That’s a lot of money.
—It is a lot of money. It goes without saying that this $83 million could even have gone a long way towards replacing infrastructure damaged in the floods and the cyclones of the past summer.
Further, I have received an email which is typical of concerns that I am hearing from constituents in my electorate, and I would like to share it:
Dear Mrs Griggs,
I just want to express my disgust about the government building yet another detention centre, especially in Darwin. I am so annoyed that we can find the money to support overseas illegal immigrants yet we cannot find the money to build a second hospital for Darwin. These people are costing the country a hell of a lot of money and it gets up my nose.
Building this facility in Darwin will put a drain on our resources. Yes, it may create some jobs. However, try and organise a plumber or an electrician in Darwin. Some of these guys won’t even go near normal households because they’re too busy working on large-scale government projects.
Every time an illegal immigrant gets sick they will be putting a drain on our health system. We as Territorians wait a long time at A&E. Now we’ll be pushed even further down the queue because of these people.
My daughter attends Durack School, and she quite often comes home with raffle tickets so that the school can fundraise to purchase the most basic of items for the school. Government schools should get this funding automatically. If we can afford to spend the money on decent accommodation for the illegal immigrants, along with all the other privileges that they receive, why can’t we afford to look after our schools?
Natasha, please turn back the boats. Spend the money on Australians. There are a lot of them out there that need our money. Please have a look at this article I watched on A Current Affair, ‘Saving Vicky’. This lady needs our money and, as a taxpayer, I am more than happy to support this lady. I am not happy paying for illegal immigrants.
There are also a number of reader messages from the Northern Territory News that I would like share. The first says:
Why riot + protest? If they aren’t happy, i would happily pay a one-off tax to send them home.
Another one says:
So … More beds for detainees & prisoners?? Why not more beds at the hospital?
Yet another says:
Tell these rioting asylum seekers they just failed the test and deport them. In Aust, non compliance has consequences.
Territorians are not racist. We just want border protection policies that work. The Territory does not want to be the Commonwealth’s social experiment, and we do not want our constitutional weakness used so that Labor can dump their problems and the outcomes of their bad policies on us. We want genuine economic opportunities, not those that come from bad Labor policy.
The Territory has a strong multicultural background, and Territorians welcome people from all cultural backgrounds—but Labor are taking advantage of Territorians’ goodwill. Accepting refugees does not mean we accept Labor policy. We have a housing crisis and, increasingly, our own economic refugees because of the cost of living rises under this terrible, terrible Labor government. We know that, if there is a carbon tax introduced, Territorians will pay more because the carbon tax is going to be a tax on remote and rural Australia, and it is going to impact on the cost of living in the Territory when we are already experiencing very high pressures. Territorians want a guarantee from this secretive and deceptive government that Labor’s failed border protection policies will not impact on the safety, the security and the economic welfare of Territorians. It is an interesting fact that this Labor government have built more detention beds in the Northern Territory than they have hospital beds. Palmerston people are waiting for a new hospital. What will they get? A new detention centre. Maybe the minister will turn the detention centre into a hospital when he fixes his border protection policy. My beef is not with the businessmen who are building the detention centre at Wickham Point. My beef is with this deceitful Labor government whose failed border protection policies have made it necessary and who clearly cannot be trusted.",REPS,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Immigration Detention</title>,Matters of Public Importance,24,1
"Zappia, Tony, MP",ALP,2011-03-23,"—I suggest that the real rolling crisis is with respect to the position of the Leader of the Opposition and how much longer he will be in that position. This matter of public importance before the House today is all about diverting attention from the divisions within the coalition and onto other matters. When it comes to the opposition we can be certain that they will never allow the facts to get in the way of political opportunism and that they will distort the facts in order to create concern and fear and raise emotions amongst people. We just heard that in the contribution by the member for Solomon. Quite frankly, her contribution is not worth responding to, but I will respond to one critical factual matter. As a member of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration I visited Darwin and visited the detention facilities there. The practice of using a motel in Darwin to house refugees and asylum seekers was a practice that was begun by the Howard government. To suggest this practice was started by this government is quite clearly distorting the facts.
As I said, the coalition never let the facts stand in the way of their political strategy. This matter of public importance debate today is just like the issue of climate change because time and time again we are seeing the coalition distort the facts. In fact, they are doing it quite deliberately to create fear and concern amongst members of the broader Australian community. I wonder what the member for Pearce, the member for McMillan and other coalition members in this place whom I know do not share the kinds of emotions and concerns that I have heard from other members of the coalition today feel when their colleagues bring into this place this kind of debate and use the kind of language that has been used as part of this debate. It is clear to me that when it comes to immigration, refugee policy and climate change the coalition is very clearly divided. To some extent it gives me some comfort to know that, even amongst their ranks, there are people who are level-headed and consider this matter in a measured way.
We are dealing here with the lives of real people, people who in most cases have undergone trauma, persecution, danger, loss and serious suffering. This is a critical international humanitarian issue and we should not play politics with it. As a country that prides itself on freedom, equality, democracy and civil rights, this whole issue with all the complexities associated with it must, for the sake of the people we are dealing with, be handled in a considered and rational policy setting—not with the simplistic, distorted rhetoric that the opposition come into the House with.
The opposition come into this House and criticise the government. I believe the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship quite adequately addressed this point, but I want to reiterate some home truths here. They come into the House and are very critical of the government but they do so without putting forward any rational, credible policy alternatives. You would think that, as the alternative government, they would at least do that. They have no position for which there is any credible level of support by any of the mainstream agencies, government departments or overseas governments with which we have to work in managing this issue. If they are going to come into the House and criticise the government, they should at least offer a better proposal that has been endorsed by the very agencies, governments and countries we have to work with. Do not come in here and simply criticise.
Let me go to some of the facts relating to asylum seekers. I heard members opposite being critical of the government. They claimed the government facts were incorrect. I will get back to some of those claims if time permits. I will go to the facts that were prepared by the Parliamentary Library—not by the Labor Party or by the minister, but by the Parliamentary Library. These are the facts. Fact 1: Australia has had a long history of accepting refugees for resettlement. Since 1945 some 700,000 refugees and displaced persons have found their new home in Australia.
Fact 2: when the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees was established in 1951, there were approximately 1.5 million refugees internationally. So not long after World War II there were 1.5 million refugees internationally. As at the end of 2009 there were an estimated 43 million forcibly displaced people worldwide, including 15.2 million refugees, 983,000 asylum seekers and 27 million internally displaced persons. So we went from 1.5 million not long after World War II to 43 million and that does not include the additional 25 million people who have been displaced due to natural disasters of the types we have seen in recent times.
Fact 3: the majority of asylum seekers still arrive in Australia by air. Even with the recent surge, boat arrivals are still less than half of Australia’s onshore asylum seekers. Fact 4: Australia is not being swamped by refugees. That is what the opposition would have people believe. They are doing their best to portray that myth. For over 10 years, and even during the time of the Howard government, about 13,000 refugees per annum resettled in this country and that includes all the boat arrivals. So the number of people who have resettled in this country in the last decade or so has been around 13,000 per annum in total. That has not changed and is not about to change. Around the globe right now there are 377,000 people seeking refuge in other countries a year. That is the number of applications that are processed to the knowledge of the UNHCR. In fact, Europe gets over a quarter of a million claims every year and has done so for the last three years, the USA gets about 50,000 claims a year and Canada gets about 33,000 claims. So that puts Australia’s 6,500 claims into context.
I want to make two quick points. One is to rebut what the member for Stirling said when he was critical of the minister’s use of facts. He was referring to the rates of Manus Island and Nauru asylum seekers who were ultimately given asylum. He said the figure was about 70 per cent. My hearing of the minister’s comment was that it was Australia and New Zealand he was referring to when he was referring to the 90 per cent plus. I want to make that point absolutely clear. I think most members of this House would agree that there is little difference between Australia and New Zealand.
The second point I want to make is this: the same kind of fear campaign that I am hearing here today was run before Christmas in respect of the Inverbrackie detention centre that has been set up near Adelaide. Inverbrackie has been established and, contrary to all the fear that was being promoted by members of this House, people have settled into that community and settled in very well. I will quote from the Southern Cross, the online Catholic paper issued only recently. It said:
… Mount Barker and Adelaide Hills parishes say they have been inundated with the generosity of parishioners and locals wanting to donate goods to Inverbrackie residents.
The article goes on to say:
Pam Ronan said that the Catholic R-12 College in Mount Barker was keen to welcome the refugee children into the school community.
Patricia Brady said:
People have responded so generously and it is not just from the Catholic community but from all of the community.
That is the kind of reaction that people are getting in the Mount Barker area to the people coming into Inverbrackie, not the fear and concern that was being suggested before Christmas by people in this very House. The Sunday Mail report just before Christmas in Adelaide confirmed again the same kinds of feelings.
This motion is all about diverting attention from the Leader of the Opposition. (Time expired)

 (Hon. BC Scott)—Order! The discussion has now concluded.",REPS,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Immigration Detention</title>,Matters of Public Importance,24,1
"Swan, Wayne, MP",ALP,2011-03-23,"—Over the past few months we have witnessed a series of truly tragic natural disasters—both here and abroad. At home, our country has been ravaged by floods, with Cyclone Yasi in the north and bushfires in the west. Overseas, we have seen earthquakes hit Christchurch and in the past 12 days we have watched the horrific images as one of the largest earthquakes on record hit Japan, followed by the devastating impact of the subsequent tsunami.
These events have tested us, and they have tested our friends. It has been inspiring to see the way in which communities have come together—here at home and globally—to help those in need. Our focus has of course been on providing immediate relief and assistance and getting on with the difficult task of rebuilding our affected communities. But it is appropriate that just before parliament breaks prior to the budget that I update members on the likely impacts of these events on our economy and on our budget preparations.
Japan
Our thoughts in the past few weeks have rightly been with the Japanese people and we have been focused on providing assistance, particularly to those Australians in Japan. These events will leave behind a tragic loss of human life and a damage bill running into many billions of dollars. The economic consequences of these events will become clearer in the coming weeks and months.
But we know that as the third largest global economy, this disaster will inevitably impact on the global economy and on our own. Japan accounts for around six per cent of global GDP and is also an important economy for Australia. Japan is our second biggest trading partner and our third largest source of foreign investment. Around one-sixth of all our exports are to Japan—almost $40 billion. We are Japan’s largest supplier of coal, and Japan is also an important destination for our iron ore exports.
Treasury’s initial assessment is that there is likely to be a short-term impact on some Australian exports to Japan in coming quarters. Japanese demand for steel-making inputs is likely to fall in the near term following the closure of several large steel-making plants and the disruption to Japanese manufacturing. Commodity markets have also generally weakened. Thermal coal prices are down around seven per cent since the earthquake and iron ore prices are down around four per cent. But there may be some rise in demand for other fuels such as LNG as other forms of energy production are more heavily utilised.
In the medium term, reconstruction will support growth in Japan and add to demand for Australia’s bulk commodity exports. But the risks surrounding this assessment are considerable and to the downside. Any escalation in the problems at the nuclear reactors would exacerbate the economic impact on Japan and the global economy, as would further disruption to closely integrated production networks in Japan. There are also considerable risks of dislocation in global energy markets, including rising coal, gas and oil prices.
These events could adversely impact global confidence at a time when the world economy is already facing significant challenges, and there is new instability in parts of the Middle East and North Africa. We will of course continue to monitor the situation closely, including the impact of these events on the global economy and also on our own.
Natural disasters at home
Australia has also taken a direct hit from natural disasters here at home. In economic terms, the January floods and Cyclone Yasi will likely be the largest natural disaster in our history. Together, they will likely reduce economic growth by around half a percentage point this financial year. The supply chains for our coal exports were severely hampered, and production at some of our big mines continues to be disrupted by the floodwaters. On top of this, fruit and vegetable crops have been damaged—the disasters wiped out a significant part of the country’s food bowl. Between our coal and agricultural industries alone, we expect that production will be reduced by around $8 billion—which is slightly larger than our earlier estimates. Our tourism sector has suffered, and other industries—such as manufacturing, retail and transport—have been put under enormous pressure. This is a cruel blow for those sectors already struggling to cope with the high dollar.
The loss of production has also translated into higher prices for families—especially for fruit and vegetables. The region affected by Yasi produces 90 per cent of Australia’s bananas and around one-third of our sugar cane. We expect that the January floods and Cyclone Yasi will increase CPI inflation by half of a percentage point in the March quarter, perhaps more. While this will hurt families doing it tough, these price rises will be temporary, unwinding as crops regrow and production comes back on line.
But just as we are now seeing in Japan and have witnessed in Christchurch as well, the way the community in Queensland and Australia has pulled together has been inspiring. We have seen community groups, business and governments at all levels chip in to help the rebuild. The Queensland Premier’s Disaster Relief Appeal has raised more than $240 million. This is in addition to tens of millions of dollars of in-kind assistance.
And the federal government is providing more than $6 billion for flood and cyclone affected regions across Australia, with the vast majority being invested in rebuilding damaged public infrastructure, such as roads, bridges and schools. More than two-thirds of this will be funded through budget savings, with the remainder funded through a modest, temporary levy. And I am pleased to see that this levy passed the Senate yesterday, with the support of every single Labor MP and senator from Queensland. I do not want to get political here, but I do wonder how the Queensland MPs on that side of the House will look their constituents in the eye when they head home this Friday.
Budget
It is against the backdrop of these natural disasters that we will spend the coming weeks putting the final touches on our fourth budget. Recent events—both here and abroad—will make a difficult task even more difficult. The early years of the budget estimates will bear the brunt of the rebuilding and recovery costs, and government revenue will also take a hit from weaker growth in the short term.
But keeping our budget on track to return to surplus by 2012-13 is the right economic strategy for an economy which is expected to be pushing up against its capacity over the coming years. Just as it was the right thing to step in and support demand during the global recession, it is the right thing to do to step back when private demand is strengthening.
We have already put in place around $5½ billion in savings to meet the cost of rebuilding from the floods and cyclone. And we are sticking to our strict fiscal rules, including our cap on real spending of two per cent or less in above trend growth years. We understand that this will mean that we need to do a lot of things in this budget that will not be popular, but they will be the right thing to do.
A position of strength
While these events pose big challenges for our budget preparations, they will not knock our economy off its medium-term path. We were not beaten by the global financial crisis and we will not be beaten now.
Because of the decisions we took during the global financial crisis and our strong fundamentals, we face these new challenges from a position of strength. The Australian economy is halfway through its 20th year of continuous economic growth, with low unemployment, a solid investment pipeline, strong public finances and a sturdy financial system.
In resources alone, investment has gone from $35 billion last year to an estimated $56 billion for this financial year. Next year, it is expected to increase even further, to a record $76 billion. On top of this we have strong job creation—over 300,000 jobs have been added in the past year, and over 700,000 since we came to government. And we are on track to return the budget to surplus faster than any major advanced economy.
Our position of strength gives us the confidence to make the right policy choices, and our fourth budget will also keep the wheels of reform turning. We will not lose sight of the important task of transforming our economy. We have an ambitious agenda to keep our economy strong and prepare it for the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead. We have a plan to build capacity through making critical investments in infrastructure, skills and education. We are doing the hard yards in tax reform and superannuation, to broaden the economy and boost national savings. This will be another responsible budget that helps manage an economy in transition. We are committed to preparing our economy for the future and making sure we are best placed to take advantage of the opportunities.
On climate change we are putting in place the policies to transition our economy to the low-carbon future. It is important that we decouple our economic growth from growth in carbon pollution—we know the earlier we start the lower the cost and the better placed our economy will be.
With the associated investment pipeline, we know that the mining boom will also continue to push our economy towards its capacity. That is why we are investing in the infrastructure and skills, while also putting in place the policies to support increased workforce participation and labour supply. It is also why it remains critical that we deliver on our fiscal commitments and stick to our strict fiscal rules in the upcoming budget. But we will approach this task knowing that by making the tough calls now, we are putting our economy in a position of strength. This was the approach we took to dealing with the worst global recession in 75 years. It is the approach that we have taken when putting together our previous budgets. And it is the approach we will take in finalising the budget I will deliver in this chamber in less than seven weeks.
I ask leave of the House to move a motion to enable the member for North Sydney to speak for 10 minutes.
Leave granted.",REPS,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Recent Natural Disasters: Economic Impact</title>,Ministerial Statements,25,1
"Hockey, Joe, MP",LP,2011-03-23,"—Australians have watched on in despair at the devastation caused by the earthquakes that have recently struck Christchurch and northern Japan. The devastation which has impacted our friends in these countries has been difficult to watch, particularly when you see footage of people wandering the streets and cities, which have been reduced to rubble, knowing that they have lost nearly everything—and, in some cases, they have lost their loved ones. These events have truly tested the people of Japan and New Zealand, and our deepest sympathies go out to them in their hour of need.
While we focus our attention on the tragedies that have fallen on our neighbours, we must not forget the natural disasters that our own nation has had to face in recent months. Disasters such as floods, cyclones and fires are a natural and, sadly, a regular part of living in Australia. First there were the floods across much of the eastern states, along with bushfires in the south-west of Western Australia, followed by the monster Cyclone Yasi in Far North Queensland. Cyclone Yasi left an unbelievable path of destruction that has left many North Queensland communities completely disadvantaged. Many are still struggling to pick up the pieces—over a month after the storm has passed.
The Treasurer notes that the government is providing more than $6 billion for flood and cyclone affected regions across Australia, and the coalition welcomes that support. It believes the government should spend whatever it takes to get these shattered communities back on their feet as quickly as possible. What the coalition does oppose is how the government has chosen to fund that commitment with a $1.8 billion new tax. What the government should have done was fund all of the reconstruction through savings measures within the budget—and the coalition showed the way, identifying $2 billion of savings which could have been reallocated to the reconstruction effort.
Imposing new taxes is, sadly, part of the Labor Party’s DNA. Labor has announced 13 new or increased taxes in just two terms. These include the alcopops tax, the increase in the tobacco tax, the significant increase in luxury car taxes and, more recently, the mining tax, the flood levy and now the carbon tax. Enough is enough. Another tax will put already strained household budgets under more stress. Quite simply, Australian households cannot afford another Labor tax. This new flood tax will erode consumer sentiment and stifle consumer spending at a time when the retail industry is already doing it tough. There have been levies before, but the flood levy raises in a single year three times the amount of any levy introduced under the previous government. Besides the Medicare levy, this is the single largest annual levy ever introduced in Australia. The Prime Minister said it was the right thing to do. We in the coalition believe the additional tax is the wrong thing to do.
The coalition also has grave concerns about the capacity of the government to administer such large funds. They have a poor history when it comes to management of programs, including a $1.2 billion blow-out in the computers in schools program; a $1.5 billion blow-out in the Building the Education Revolution school halls program; the Green Loans program, with $300 million wasted and the program finally cancelled; and the GP superclinics, with 36 promised and only eight currently in operation after four years. Preventing these and other program spending blow-outs would have paid the $1.8 billion to be raised through the new levy and much more.
It is also worth noting that, for 2010-11, the interest paid on Labor created government net debt will be $4.38 billion this year alone. That is nearly 2½ times the amount to be raised by the new flood tax. That is a core reason that the coalition are so committed to paying back Labor’s debt when we are next in government. The interest on the debt is a huge burden for the budget. The money can be much better spent on essential services such as health, education and income support. The government also has a much greater capacity to respond to natural disasters when the budget is in surplus and there is money in the bank.
But it is not just the coalition that does not trust the Treasurer with money. The Prime Minister could not trust her own Treasurer to oversee the reconstruction of Queensland. She found it necessary to appoint a Liberal to oversee the job. On 7 February this year, when the Prime Minister appointed former federal Liberal finance minister John Fahey as chair of the Reconstruction Inspectorate, I am sure Lindsay Tanner and a number of other people in the Labor Party who had served so well for so long would have been turning in their political graves. Part of the Reconstruction Inspectorate’s remit is to:
Scrutinise requests for reimbursement by local government for projects completed for the purposes of reconstruction—
and—
Examine high value or complex projects prior to execution
Both these jobs should properly be done by the Treasurer and the Minister for Finance and Deregulation, Senator Wong. But our Prime Minister has decided to appoint a Liberal to do all this because, as she knows from school halls, pink batts and the NBN, the Treasurer is not quite up to the job of dealing with taxpayers’ money—yet the Treasurer is going to deliver a budget in May.
The Treasurer wants us to believe that the budget strategy is back on track and he said: ‘Keeping our budget on track to return to surplus by 2012-13 is the right economic strategy.’ And he went on to say:
And we are sticking to our strict fiscal rules, including our cap on real spending of two per cent or less in above trend growth years.
This is a key point. It is curious that the Treasurer has omitted to mention perhaps the most important of his fiscal rules. Let me remind the House of the three rules which underpin Labor’s medium-term fiscal strategy. They are (1) maintain tax to GDP ratio well below the 2007-08 level on average—which is 23.5 per cent (2) achieve budget surpluses, on average, over the medium term and (3) real growth in spending to be kept below two per cent until the budget returns to surplus. This restraint is to be maintained, on average ‘while the economy is growing at or above trend until surpluses are at least one per cent of GDP’. They are the three rules. The Treasurer has not mentioned the first of these rules relating to tax restraint—the 23.5 per cent rule. I suspect he is now walking away from that commitment—to use the Prime Minister’s words—because he knows that this big-taxing government will not be able to meet that promise. This is a further example of the disingenuousness of the government and it is a clear signal that the forthcoming budget will be built on a lie.
This budget is going to have a gaping black hole. Budgets are supposed to include the financial effects of all policy announcements of government. The government has announced that it will be introducing a carbon tax as early as 1 July 2012. It stands to reason that the funds to be raised through the carbon tax should be included in budget revenue and the spending associated with the so-called compensation measures should be included in expenditure. However, the government has decided, deliberately, not to announce any of the detail of the carbon tax, such as the rate, to whom it applies, which industries will be exempt and so on. It has also failed to announce the households and industries that will receive compensation. It is not even putting an in globo figure into the budget papers. This means that it is virtually impossible for Treasury to determine revenue and spending with any certainty. However, the ongoing speculation about the level of the mining tax suggests that, if the mining tax has a starting price of between $20 and $30 a tonne, the sums will be significant.
On page 27 of Ross Garnaut’s climate change review, update paper No. 6 states that a carbon price of $26 per tonne carbon dioxide equivalent would generate around $11.5 billion in 2012-13 alone—$11.5 billion on the revenue side; $11.5 billion on the expenditure side. A recent report by the Centre for International Economics suggests that the price on carbon will need to escalate rapidly following the end of a fixed-price period in order to achieve the required emissions reduction. Therefore, for a starting price of $20 per tonne, the price increases to $49 in 2016-17. That equates to an annual tax take in excess of $20 billion. For comparison, the GST collects $50 billion a year. So the carbon tax is equivalent to increasing the GST from 10 to about 14 per cent. This is a significant black hole in this budget, and it clearly illustrates that the government is unable to meet the 23.5 per cent target, and that is why the Treasurer has stopped talking about it. It is one of the three major components for fiscal integrity and the Treasurer has dumped it. In order to ensure that he does not break another promise, he has decided to leave the carbon tax and the carbon expenditure out of the budget. That is why the budget in May will be a big lie. It is not telling the truth about the fiscal state of the nation. (Time expired)

"Smith, Stephen, MP",ALP,2011-03-23,"—As I said during last year’s parliamentary debate on Afghanistan, ‘There can be no more serious endeavour for any country or government than to send its military forces into conflict.’ That is why it is appropriate that Australia’s commitment to Afghanistan is the subject of ongoing parliamentary and public scrutiny. As part of this, the government and I are committed to providing regular reports and updates on Afghanistan, including to the parliament.
My report on this occasion includes the recent NATO and International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) defence ministers meeting in Brussels, which I attended earlier this month.
Why we are there
It is worth reminding ourselves why we are in Afghanistan and what our goal is. The government’s strong view is that it is in our national interest to be in Afghanistan, not just with our alliance partner the United States but also with 46 other members of the international community acting under a United Nations mandate.
Australia has a responsibility to help stare down international terrorism and ensure stability in Afghanistan. Our fundamental goal is to prevent Afghanistan from again being used by terrorists to plan and train for attacks on innocent civilians, including Australians in our own region and beyond. To achieve that goal we must help prepare the Afghan government to take lead responsibility for providing security for the Afghan people. We must stabilise the security situation and mentor and train the Afghan security forces.
Progress
There are signs that the international community’s recent troop surge, combined now with a strong military and political strategy, has reversed the Taliban’s momentum. This progress is incremental and hard-won, but it is apparent. As International Security Assistance Force Commander General Petraeus told the US Congress on 15 March, districts west of Kandahar city—the birthplace of the Taliban—have recently been cleared by ISAF and Afghan troops.
In recent months, there has been a fourfold increase in the number of weapons and explosive caches turned in and found. Around 700 former Taliban have now officially reintegrated with Afghan authorities, with some 2,000 more in various stages of the reintegration process. But I do urge caution. United States Defense Intelligence Agency head, General Ron Burgess, has cautioned that ‘the security situation remains fragile and heavily dependent on ISAF support’ and that the Taliban ‘remains resilient and will be able to threaten US and international goals in Afghanistan through 2011.’
We must expect pushback from the Taliban, particularly in areas recently claimed by ISAF and Afghan troops, when this year’s fighting season commences in April or May. We do need to steel ourselves for a tough fighting season. United States Secretary of Defense Gates was correct when he said in Afghanistan on 8 March that the coming spring and summer fighting seasons would present an ‘acid test’ of whether our gains could hold. As well, the international community must continue to press President Karzai and his government to deliver on his undertakings at the London conference in January 2010 to improve governance, pursue electoral reform, take effective anti-corruption and anti-narcotics measures and create social and economic opportunities for all the Afghan people, including Afghan women and girls.
As United States National Intelligence Director Jim Clapper advised the United States Congress recently, which he repeated to me when I met him in Australia last week, there remains concern about the ability of the Afghan government to deliver on governance. Without progress on governance, security gains will remain fragile.
International commitment
Leaders of the 48 ISAF countries met at the Lisbon summit last November and resolved that a conditions based transition to Afghan led security begin this year, 2011, with the aspiration of completing transition by the end of 2014. NATO and ISAF members also made an important long-term commitment to support Afghanistan beyond the transition of security responsibility. Good progress has been made since the Lisbon summit, with the first Joint Afghan-NATO Inteqal Board report on transition and the development of ISAF Transition Implementation Principles.
Australia endorses the first Inteqal report and its recommendation to begin transition, as the Brussels NATO-ISAF defence ministers meeting also did, and as announced by President Karzai on 22 March, which I will refer to shortly. The Inteqal report’s commitment to coordinate transition planning with both Afghan and ISAF stakeholders will ensure all partners are consulted throughout the transition process, including on future tranches for transition. It is essential to get this right, to ensure the sustainability of the transition process. As the Prime Minister said at the Lisbon summit, there is no point transitioning out only to have to transition back in later.
The ISAF Transition Implementation Principles emphasise a shared, long-term commitment, a properly resourced mission, and investment and reinvestment in training. I attended the recent NATO-ISAF defence ministers’ meeting in Brussels. Building upon the Lisbon summit, this meeting delivered the message that ISAF partners are committed to achieving a conditions based, irreversible and sustainable transition of security responsibility to Afghan National Security Forces. Working hand in hand with the Afghan government, ISAF intends to complete the handing over of security responsibility to Afghan authorities by the end of 2014. This is an achievable task, and it has already started.
Transition
We must remember that transition will be a process rather than a single event. It will take place at different times in districts and in provinces only as security circumstances permit. The pace of this transition will depend on conditions on the ground, in particular the operational readiness of the Afghan National Security Forces.
On 22 March President Karzai announced the first provinces and districts to transition to Afghan authority. These include the provinces of Bamyan (all districts), Panjshir (all districts), and Kabul (all districts except Surobi) and the districts of Mazar-e-Sharif (Balkh province), Herat (Herat province), Lashkar Gah (Helmand province) and Mehtar Lam (Laghman province).
This first tranche of provinces and districts identified for transition has been selected on the basis of an assessment that their security, governance and development conditions are sufficient to commence transition. The decision to commence transition was made by the Afghan government based on the assessment and recommendation of the Joint Afghan-NATO Inteqal Board. In these areas the Afghan security forces have been assessed as capable of taking on additional security tasks with less assistance from ISAF.
Progress in Oruzgan
Transition is what Australia is working towards in Oruzgan province with the Afghan National Security Forces and our partners in Combined Team-Oruzgan, the United States, New Zealand, Singapore and Slovakia. There was never an expectation that Oruzgan would be in the first tranche of districts and provinces to begin transition. We believe the Oruzgan transition process can occur over the next three years, between 2012 and 2014.
Over the past six months, the Afghan National Security Forces and Combined Team-Oruzgan have expanded security over areas previously controlled by the Taliban. This has been made possible in part through the transfer of several patrol bases from ISAF or Afghan National Army control to the Afghan National Police, which has in turn allowed the Afghan National Army to move into contested areas.
The increasingly competent Afghan National Security Forces, with the support of Combined Team-Oruzgan, are covering more and more ground, extending the reach of the Afghan government throughout the province. Australian mentored Afghan forces are expanding the security footprint from the Tarin Kowt bowl to the Mirabad Valley in the east, Deh Rawud in the west, and north through the Baluchi Valley into Chora. Our task now is to ensure that this progress in security, development and governance and the gains we have made are consolidated and not reversed.
Progress in training the Afghan National Security Forces
As part of the overarching transition strategy in Afghanistan, Australia is committed to mentoring and training the 4th Brigade of the Afghan National Army (ANA) in Oruzgan province to enable them to take on responsibility for security arrangements in the province between 2012 and 2014. Australia’s assessment of the 4th Brigade’s capacity is that it is effective with assistance and increasingly capable.
A further infantry Kandak has now arrived in Oruzgan to bring the 4th Brigade to full strength. While this 6th infantry Kandak lacks experience, it is trained and equipped for initial tasks, has strong leadership and is a strong graduate of the Consolidated Fielding Centre in Kabul. The 6th Kandak is currently mentored by US forces.
The next rotation of Australian forces—Australian Task Force 9—will be deployed into Oruzgan province in June, and will take on the additional task of mentoring the newly formed 6th Infantry Kandak of the 4th Brigade. As we hand over patrol bases and establish new ones, and see ANA Kandaks conduct more unaccompanied activities, Australian forces can be released for additional training and mentoring tasks, including responsibility for additional ANA forces in Oruzgan. As the Kandaks become more capable and self-reliant, Australian forces can move into an enabling and overwatch role.
Support for our troops
Our troops and personnel in Afghanistan are performing extremely well in dangerous circumstances on a daily basis. Australians are proud of the fact that our troops have a well-deserved reputation for their effectiveness and their conduct. Afghan government ministers—including Defence Minister Wardak, whom I met again in Brussels—and ISAF Commander General Petraeus praise the work and reputation of Australians deployed in Afghanistan, including in their engagement with local Afghan communities.
The support and protection of Australian personnel in Afghanistan is, rightly, our highest priority. The provision of new capability is part of the package of initiatives worth $1.6 billion that the government committed to, following the Force Protection Review effected by my predecessor Minister Faulkner, and underlines the commitment to provide our troops with the best available equipment.
Of the 48 recommendations made by the review, 42 are now complete or on track. They include enhanced counter IED measures, better armour and heavier calibre weapons for our Bushmasters, the placement of medics with each platoon operating in Afghanistan and the introduction of 1,000 sets of lighter combat armour.
US related allegations
Recent media reports of allegations of pre-meditated murder of Afghan civilians by a small number of US soldiers are deeply disturbing. The allegations were first reported last year, at which time the United States launched a criminal investigation into the allegations. Criminal charges were laid following the investigation and are now the subject of United States court martial proceedings.
The United States Army has apologised for the distress the terrible incident and the publicity has caused, saying they stand ‘in stark contrast to the discipline, professionalism and respect that have characterised our soldiers’ performance during nearly 10 years of sustained operations in Afghanistan’.
In this context, the United States Army has restated its commitment to the ‘adherence to the law of war and the humane and respectful treatment of combatants, noncombatants, and the dead’ and acknowledged that ‘when allegations of wrongdoing by soldiers surface, to include the inappropriate treatment of the dead, they are fully investigated; soldiers who commit offences will be held accountable as appropriate’. Australia very firmly believes that strict adherence to rules of engagement is essential on the battlefield.
Rule of law and the protection of civilians
The rule of law is an essential basis for international relations and for national security policy. The force of international law, and the protection it offers the Afghan people, clearly distinguishes the international effort in Afghanistan from the actions of the Taliban and its associates. On the ground, international humanitarian law—including the principles of military necessity, proportionality, distinction and discrimination—provides the framework for Australia and ISAF’s rules of engagement.
The Australian Defence Force (ADF) has built a reputation over the years for professionalism and compliance with such rules of engagement. Australian forces take all possible steps to ensure their operations do not endanger the lives of civilians. We have prided ourselves on our high standards and we have a well-regarded international reputation for doing so. When, for example, there are incidents involving civilians, they are always investigated.
In that context, the Registrar of Military Justice has convened a general court martial to try charges against two of the three Australian Defence Force members relating to an incident in Afghanistan on 12 February 2009. Pretrial directions hearings for the court martial are scheduled to commence soon in Sydney and the trial has been set down for 11 July 2011.
Casualties
It has already been a difficult year for the Australian Defence Force. This year, Australia has lost two more brave soldiers. Corporal Richard Atkinson was killed in an improvised explosive device strike on 2 February. Sapper Jamie Larcombe died as a result of gunshot wounds sustained during an engagement with insurgents on 19 February. Our thoughts continue to be with the families, friends and colleagues of Corporal Atkinson and Sapper Larcombe, as they too come to terms with their great loss. These soldiers served their country well and will always be remembered.
We have lost 23 fine Australian soldiers in Afghanistan. As well, four Australian soldiers have been wounded in Afghanistan this year, with 168 ADF personnel wounded in action since 2002. Our thoughts are also with our wounded and their families. The sacrifice our men and women make is great, as is the appreciation of our nation and our people. Our forces face a resilient insurgency, who, in coming months, will seek to retake ground. In this environment, we must steel ourselves for the possibility of further casualties, of further fatalities. Despite these tragic losses and the challenges ahead, Australia remains resolute.
Conclusion
We are seeing progress in Afghanistan. This progress is fragile. The Taliban know they need to regain momentum, so we can expect them to fight back. The coming fighting season will be tough. As we prepare for it, we are also mindful of the civilian toll of the war. We can expect high-profile attacks by Afghan insurgents to continue and to increase, like the 21 February suicide attack in Kunduz province that killed around 30 Afghans and wounded 36 others. An increasing number of civilian casualties are caused by insurgent attacks and the deliberate targeting of civilians or tactics which result in civilian casualties. These attacks are aimed at undermining Afghan and international confidence in the progress that is being made on security, governance and development and on transition.
Transition has commenced with President Karzai’s announcement earlier this week of the first provinces and districts to transition to Afghan authority. Transition must be conditions based and irreversible. Transition can not be and must not be a signal to premature withdrawal.
The international community must continue to provide a long-term commitment to Afghanistan. That is why Australia has made clear it expects to maintain a presence in Afghanistan after our current training mission in Oruzgan has concluded, either in further specialised training, overwatch or through civilian capacity building and development assistance. Australia is confident that the international community has the right strategy for putting Afghanistan in a position to take responsibility for security matters and prevent it from again becoming a haven for international terrorists. This military and political strategy and the required resources are now, at long last, in place and delivering hard-won progress. We see this in Oruzgan as we see it elsewhere in Afghanistan. Australia stands firm in its continuing commitment to Afghanistan.

"Robert, Stuart, MP",LP,2011-03-23,"—Thank you for the opportunity to respond to the Minister for Defence. The minister should know that he enjoys bipartisan support from the coalition as the government seeks to prosecute their agenda with our fighting men and women within Afghanistan.
I thank the minister for his commitment to provide regular updates to the parliament as to what is happening in Afghanistan and I note the minister has indeed been true to his word in keeping his commitment to provide these updates.
It is important, as we seek to understand where we are going in Afghanistan and what the future holds, that we also look back to truly understand how the fight started and why it is important that the government is indeed supported at a bipartisan level to continue the fight in Afghanistan. I think we all agree that the world changed on September 11. Australia invoked the ANZUS alliance, standing shoulder to shoulder with our friend and ally the United States of America as they launched Operation Enduring Freedom.
On 20 December 2001, the UN approved resolution 1386, a resolution which has been approved annually since that date. There are 48 ISAF nations working within Afghanistan. It is a difficult but just and justified fight in response to an unmitigated act of barbarity. I do not need to remind the House or indeed the entire nation that over 100 Australians have perished at the hands of terrorists, whose support, whose training, whose financing and whose indoctrination can in one way or another be linked back to the insurgents, the Taliban and the other extremist groups operating within Afghanistan.
The minister noted that recent progress in Afghanistan has for the most part been positive, especially following the US troop surge that commenced in mid-2009. There is no doubt that recent ISAF operations have made ground, particularly in southern Afghanistan. In Kandahar we currently have 14 or so artillerymen fighting with British artillery commanded by the CO of the 7th Parachute Battalion, the Royal Horse Artillery. There is a group fighting in Kandahar down in the south, where in previous battles they had trained their guns over open sights so close were the enemy, where now there is greater control over the area and greater engagement through shuras with local leaders, and our men are reporting that there is greater trade and commerce between disparate groups within the area. Indeed, the degree of fighting, in their experience, has lessened. A new patrol base has been put outside the main operating area in Kandahar, a testimony to the degree of stability that is being achieved in the southern province.
But let us not lose focus. As the new fighting season approaches, the Taliban will look to reclaim ground it has lost. They are a resilient and hard-fighting foe. In the coming months, as the winter snow melts, the Taliban will push back. It is fair to assume that we are fighting a resilient enemy. The question the nation needs to ask is a simple one: can we or can we not hold our gains? I agree with the minister on the capacity, the capability and the courage of our fighting men and women to hold our gains and, more importantly, to gain even more.
I note the recent report from Major General Mike Kraus, Deputy Chief of Staff Plans at ISAF’s Joint Command Headquarters, where he said:
We believe that we have momentum. We believe we now have the initiative.
However Major General Kraus also noted the fragility of these gains. I know General Kraus. He is not a man loose with his words—a serious war-fighting general who understands the serious nature of our commitments in Afghanistan.
The message here, I believe, is that progress is rarely easy and it is rarely quick. It is incremental. It comes at a cost. Enduring progress is dependent upon coalition forces holding their nerve and, as the minister quite rightly stated, standing firm on their commitment to Afghanistan. In short, if I can quote the previous commander of our deployed forces, Major General Cantwell, not only to the Prime Minister but also to the Leader of the Opposition, and indeed to the parliament, this is ‘not the time to get the wobbles’.
Progress made by Australian forces should not be underestimated. Australian forces are doing an amazing job in incredibly difficult, dangerous and arduous circumstances. General Petraeus, the commander in Afghanistan, has consistently commended the work of Australia’s fighting men and women. In terms of military progress, it is undeniable that the southern provinces, including Uruzgan where the bulk of Australia’s fighting forces are based, is a comparatively safer place than it once was. In Uruzgan, Australia, along with other members of Combined Team-Uruzgan, have made significant progress both in training Afghan 4th Brigade soldiers and in the reconstruction work through the Provincial Reconstruction Teams. I recognise that the Afghan 4th Brigade’s capacity to operate independently of assistance is increasing—slowly, but it is certainly increasing. Having been to Afghanistan twice last year and having seen for myself the progress they are making, I can provide testimony to that fact.
I note that with the next rotation of Australian forces they will also be taking responsibility for the 6th Khandaq of the 4th Afghan Brigade. Australia will therefore be responsible for training the entirety of the brigade. It was also pleasing to see the brigade’s heavy weapon support Khandaq actually fire their D-30 artillery pieces, bringing on line another capability they have got to engage with to seek to destroy the insurgency within Afghanistan.
I also note that we continue to supply a surface vessel operating in the Gulf and the Red Sea region, which does an excellent job in enforcing the restriction zones there, doing counterpiracy and other support activities. I note our substantial aviation assets are flying out of both Afghanistan and, indeed, the wider Middle East, continuing to provide a range of significant resources and platforms desperately needed for the fight to continue. We can as a nation be proud of our some 2,350 men and women currently deployed in the wider Gulf region. As I have said consistently in this place, and I say again to the minister: the only thing I would ask is that currently there is a cap of 1,550 men and women in Afghanistan and it is our contention that that cap would be better placed  on the 2,350 in the wider Middle East area of operations to allow the force commander to surge men and women troops as he sees fit. I certainly reiterate that to the minister.
In terms of transition, the minister has said consistently that a transition of Australian forces out of Afghanistan will take place over what is now three years, sometime between 2012 and 2014. This has the support of the coalition. The PM has also stated, during her address on this issue leading the debate in the parliament, that Australia will maintain a capability after the training role of the 4th Afghan Brigade has ceased with an overwatch capability, a training capability, and perhaps a civilian capacity-building and development assistance capability. The coalition again supports this. We do, however, ask the minister to provide an update as soon as that would be available as to what the overwatch capability or that training role or civilian capability would look like in terms of personnel, equipment and the length of time it would be envisaged that they would be in Afghanistan beyond 2014. We appreciate that it may take some time for the minister to work through the details of what that overwatch or training capability may look like.
In terms of the transition arrangements, we understand that progress has taken place since the London Conference on Afghanistan in January 2010, especially with respect to improving the governance within the Karzai regime. Whilst many steps have been made with respect to improvement within the regime, the world understands that there still needs to be improvement with respect to the legitimacy and the standards of governance and the fight on corruption that the Karzai government brings to its administration in Afghanistan. Certainly taking those issues of governance beyond the major cities and into the regional areas where the Taliban still have considerable influence remains a priority as the Karzai government moves through the London conference initiatives to seek to improve the governance within the area. In terms of endorsing the NATO report and the transition for wider Afghanistan and especially the ISAF Transition Implementation Principles, they are indeed welcome news and are supported as they emphasised a shared, long-term commitment.
I note the minister said that the transition will be conditions based, irreversible and sustainable, with ISAF intending to complete the handover by the end of 2014. I also note the announcement by President Karzai on 22 March of the first provinces to transition. They are Bamian, all districts; Panjshir, all districts; Kabul, all districts except Surobi; and the districts of Mazar-i-Sharif, Herat, Laskargah in the Helmand province, and Mehterlam. In the transition section, though, it has constantly been said—and the minister has made these statements—that the transition would be one based on metrics, where data and commanders’ judgments drive the transition. The coalition support that. We support the view that transition may well take place in Oruzgan district by district, valley by valley, village by village, re-entrant by re-entrant. As I said, the government has the support of the coalition for a metrics and commander judgment based transition that adequately ensures that the Afghan National Army’s 4th Brigade has the training, resources and equipment to do the job, and that ensuring the transition occurs so that Australian soldiers’ lives are not put at any greater risk than they normally are.
As we move towards that transition, it is instructive to look at the toll in Afghanistan. In this year alone, two of our great soldiers have been killed in action: Corporal Richard Atkinson on 2 February, from an IED blast; and Sapper Jamie Larcombe on 19 February, from gunshot wounds he sustained. Our thoughts are with their families, and I join with the minister in thanking those who have made the ultimate sacrifice. I cannot begin to understand the pain that their families are going through. We have now lost 23 brave Australians in combat in Afghanistan. Four more have been wounded in action this year, bringing the total number of wounded, since 2002, to 168. The coalition join the government in their commitment to care for these soldiers and their families. We must, and we will, do everything possible to support them.
I note with interest that the Army has recently embarked on a campaign to better educate and care for those suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder upon their return from the battlefield. I note the great DVD they have made, called Dents in the Soul, and I commend the Army, particularly the Chief of Army, General Gillespie, for their work in tackling this difficult issue and their efforts in embarking on what amounts to a significant cultural change program within the Army and, more widely, within the ADF.
We on this side of the House continue to expect the government to continue to look after our troops’ welfare, and their families’ welfare, not only in the short term but also in the longer term. We expect them to deliver on their promise to support our returned troops, particularly those who have sustained physical injuries or mental conditions.
I call on the wider nation to remember that our fighting men and women fight for us; they fight for you. They fight for the safety and freedom that we enjoy. I call on the nation to remember them and perhaps, if the opportunity arises, to show your appreciation in a tangible way by writing to them. Australia Post will send a two-kilogram parcel free of charge—send them some decent coffee, send them some Tim Tams, send them a letter. The joy your family will get from receiving a letter back from one of our fighting men and women is truly something to behold. Our soldiers have a great sense of humour. A digger from Cairns writes back and says he is used to the tropics but he is now in minus 15 degrees in the mountains at Chora and he is freezing. I encourage Australians to remember our fighting men and women—send them a care package—not just in Afghanistan but right across the theatres of influence where our men and women serve.
The Minister for Defence also provided an update on the new C-RAM, the counter-rocket artillery and mortar early warning system installed to help protect Australian soldiers from attacks in Afghanistan. It is a critical system. It was called for by the coalition, and I thank the previous Minister for Defence for heeding that call and bringing the system forward. Certainly, it is better late than never. It performs a vital role, providing precious seconds warning for our troops.
I also thank the minister for providing an update on the court martial proceedings relating to three ADF personnel. It is no secret that the coalition remain concerned about the length of time it has taken to bring these charges, noting from the minister’s comments that only two court martials have been arranged, with the third pending. We will continue to monitor closely the amount and quality of representation these soldiers are afforded. I note the minister and CDF have promised the finest advice and representation that can possibly be provided, and that is indeed welcome.
I note the minister’s comments with regard to detainee management. I am in lockstep with the minister insofar as we agree that the first priority of the detainee management framework must be to ensure insurgents are removed from the battlefield. Naturally, we will continue to monitor very closely the whole range of issues currently before the ADF regarding detainee management. I also note, though, that ADF troops, most notably our special forces, are becoming frustrated with Australia’s limited current framework. My understanding is that ADF troops can still only hold suspected insurgents for a maximum of four days, whereas our ISAF partners can hold them for 14 days. I would argue that that length of time does not allow for the extraction of valuable information by Australian troops. It is difficult to assess the intelligence value of information extracted within just four days. I believe it is having an impact on troop morale, especially when insurgents are caught, released and then caught again. It is my understanding that the minister is reviewing these arrangements, to his credit. I therefore ask the minister in good faith: can he provide a firm time line for that decision and update; and will any recommendations be made public?
In conclusion, I thank the Minister for Defence for providing the House with this update. He has been true to his word and provided an update, as he said he would. I sincerely hope that he will consider the points that I have raised today on behalf of the coalition. We join the government in thanking our professional military commanders, who have assured the government and the opposition that our fighting men and women are doing everything they need to do to ensure success in the campaign in Afghanistan. We must steel ourselves against the future as we enter the fighting season. We remain in lockstep with the government, as there is bipartisan support for the mission and for our troops.",REPS,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Afghanistan</title>,Ministerial Statements,26,1

"Truss, Warren, MP",NATS,2011-03-23,"—When the debate was interrupted, I was expressing concern that the government has decided, in the context of the introduction of digital television, to close something over 400 local transmitters. These are often self-help transmitters in small locations and provide television services direct to nearby households. Instead, the government has decided that people who receive their television from these transmitters will in future have to switch from terrestrial TV reception to satellite reception. The government has put in place a satellite subsidy scheme that reimburses eligible households to assist them in the cost of making that change. However, I think that there are still issues associated with the change from receiving television reception from a local transmitter to the new television arrangement that need to be addressed.
It is clear that receiving your television from a satellite is a second-best option. There is inconvenience involved and the technology is more complicated. Particularly elderly people or those who are not able to readily deal with some of the technology issues will face difficulties. I am aware that the government is proposing to offer people in-house assistance to help them understand the new technology, but I think we all know from dealing with parents and grandparents that they find these sorts of changes very difficult to manage. In addition, if you have multiple televisions in a house or you have televisions in different buildings, you are required to have much more expensive connections. The government is only offering to subsidise the initial set-top box. If that is lost or a tenant takes it to another place, the owner will be obliged to pay the future cost of those sorts of changeovers.
In reality it would be far better to keep operating as many of these transmitters as possible. In fact, for a relatively small investment out of the billions of dollars the government expects to make from the sale of the spectrum, it would be fair to help those who would actually pay the price. Those people have to give up analog television reception, which most of them are quite happy with, so that the government can sell off the spectrum, so surely they are entitled to be treated fairly and the government should go the extra mile to make sure that they receive a reasonable signal.
There are a number of other issues with getting your television reception from a satellite. Instead of getting local programs, you get programs that have been generically prepared in a faraway place to cover, in some cases, several states. So you no longer get local television advertisements, local information or programs that are particularly relevant to your needs, and there will be time change differences because of the inability of the satellite system to deal with various time zones. From those perspectives satellite reception is clearly inferior. The government has made an effort with its plans to develop a news channel so that regional news services can be transmitted in a local format. That is welcome, although there still seems to be quite some confusion about how that is actually going to happen. Even then, people will not get the news precisely at the right time; it will be replayed sometime later in the evening, either sequentially or simultaneously, so people will have to go through a somewhat more complicated system of programming to see their local news.
Every effort should be made to have the maximum possible number of people receiving their television in the traditional way rather than having to transfer to satellite. There are already quite a number of Australians in rural and remote areas who do get their television by satellite. For those people the new satellite will be an improvement, and it will be welcome from that perspective. However, there are scores of country communities and councils, particularly in states such as Queensland, that operate these local retransmission facilities via the satellite service and would like to continue operating them. At this stage, the government has not been willing to accept that option. The local communities would like to pool the subsidies that are available so that they can retransmit.
I appreciate, and I again acknowledge, that over recent times there has been some willingness on the part of the government to consider this option. I accept that there are technical issues, but, if the trial—which I understand is to be held quite soon—of the use of some technology that will enable this retransmission is successful, then I hope the government will see the good sense in allowing this retransmission to occur at the local levels so that we can retain the local transmitters which were to be closed down by the government under these new arrangements. There does need to be an acceptance that the conversion of the self-help transmitters should happen wherever possible. That is particularly important for business and motels and places like that where there are going to be multiple connections, and it is particularly important for the elderly or others in the community who battle with having to deal with the more complex technology.
It is obvious that the digital signal offers some advantages. Where the signal is available clearly and soundly it offers more choice, better picture quality and better sound quality. But we all know that the digital signal also has some disadvantages. Its range is potentially smaller. There are going to be some people who now get perfectly good analog television reception who will not be able to receive digital. There may be some other people who, fortuitously, will receive a better signal—I acknowledge that—but I think that all of the technical experts say that more people will miss out than are likely to see new benefits. In reality, in examining these sorts of issues, we need to make sure that we do what we can to limit the obstacles to people’s enjoyment of television. In addition, the digital signal is more likely to be affected by adverse weather conditions and, of course, it pixelates and breaks up whenever there are problems with the signal. Those are issues that I think are very important and that people want answers about.
In my own electorate, the analog signal is scheduled to be turned off in half of the electorate in a few months time and in the rest of the electorate in 2013. I appreciate that that is a problem of the electoral boundaries more than it is for those choosing to turn off the signal, but in the city of Gympie, for example, a part of the city will be turned off in 2011 and the balance turned off in 2013. That is going to create some difficulties on the ground. It has been enormously difficult for me as a local member to get accurate and reliable information about what is actually happening in my own electorate. There have been advertisements in the newspapers, which I have read carefully. There are help numbers that you can call. I have called them, and the people have been helpful, but they have not been able to provide answers to most of the questions I have asked. So there was real concern that we are near to a close-down date—in fact, until a few weeks ago I thought that the closedown date might be as soon as 1 July; in other words, only two or three months away—and yet there was no information available to people to help them with the transfer.
I am pleased to say that over the last few weeks the minister’s office has been much more constructive in trying to provide us with the information we need. Previously, I wrote letters to him over many months and got back replies that provided no useful information. I studied his answers to questions in the Senate estimates and found that his answers from various times seemed to conflict with each other. So I welcome the new and more cooperative approach that we are receiving from the minister’s office and hope that thereby we can work through some of those local problems. I now know, for instance, that it seems that the close-down in the majority my electorate will not happen until December this year, so that give us a little bit more time to work through the issues.
I have been struggling to find out what was going to be the source of the programming for the satellite service, which is actually up there and has been operating since December last year, but nobody could tell us which programs were coming from it. We are still battling to get some information about where these programs are going to be sourced from in the future. But if there can be a spirit of cooperation—and I particularly acknowledge the assistance that we are receiving from Emma Dawson, who seems to understand these issues and has been prepared to deal with them in a constructive way—we may well be able to work through them.
From discussing these matters with my colleague the member for Forrest, I am aware that the changeover in western Victoria has gone better than expected. An enormous amount of effort went into it and not all the problems are resolved, but essentially, particularly towards the end, the changeover went reasonably smoothly. I hope that that same level of commitment can be provided in other areas, bearing in mind that western Victoria is comparatively flat countryside. When you move into parts of Queensland, like my own electorate, which are very hilly there are going to be many more complications.
It is important that the government offer a fair deal to all those involved. This legislation will improve the access to the VAST satellite system for some people, and that is a step forward, but there will need to be a better information program available. There will need to be real help for those who are going to be disadvantaged. The public did not ask for this and did not want it. I think they are starting to enjoy the fact that there are extra channels, and they will appreciate the quality, but there is a lot to go through and there will need to be a strong spirit of cooperation if in fact this transition to digital is to happen smoothly and without further difficulties.",REPS,<title>BROADCASTING LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (DIGITAL DIVIDEND AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2011</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,38,1
"Fletcher, Paul, MP",LP,2011-03-23,"—I am pleased to speak on the Broadcasting Legislation Amendment (Digital Dividend and Other Measures) Bill 2011, a bill which is critical to the future of broadcasting in Australia but also critical to the future of wireless broadband. The reason for that is that the bill essentially does two things. First of all, it amends the regulatory framework for free-to-air digital television services and the switchover to digital-only television. Secondly, it introduces measures which implement the restack of digital television channels so as to free up a block of continuous spectrum which can be auctioned for future use, most likely for the delivery of LTE—long-term evolution—or fourth-generation wireless broadband services.
So it is a bill which is of considerable importance. Unfortunately, this government has form in rushing through legislation in this area without allowing the proper opportunity for parliamentary scrutiny. That was what was done with the predecessor to this bill in 2010: the Broadcasting Legislation Amendment (Digital Television) Bill 2010. Key elements of the policy scheme in that bill were simply dropped and replaced with a direction from the minister to the Australian Communications and Media Authority, and that was an unfortunate thing.
I want to make three key points about this bill in the time available to me tonight. The first is to ask: what does this bill say about the attitudes of this government to wireless as a medium for the delivery of broadband services? Secondly, what assurances are there, I believe it is appropriate to ask, about the way in which the spectrum allocation process will be conducted in respect of this spectrum once the restack has occurred? Thirdly, what are the implications of policy in this area for the transition to digital broadcasting in rural and remote Australia?
Let me turn to the first area that I wish to address. What does this government believe about the importance of wireless as a medium for delivering broadband services? The premise underlying this bill—and it is a premise that on this side of the House we acknowledge and support—is that to realise a material block of spectrum here for reallocation for the purposes of delivering wireless broadband in the future is of very high importance. At the moment the problem is that the blocks of spectrum that will be freed up once analog television ceases operating are not contiguous. They are spread in quite a disparate way. So what will need to happen is that those blocks will be restacked—that is, all of the frequencies used for digital television broadcasting will be brought together, and that will free up a large block of spectrum in the 700-megahertz band. That is a necessary step to take if the utility and value of the spectrum for other purposes, particularly wireless broadband, are to be maximised.
Most commentators in this area say—again, it is a proposition that those of us on this side of the House accept—that wireless and fibre or wireless and fixed have important complementary roles when it comes to the provision of broadband services. But what is puzzling is the conflicted attitude of the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, Senator Conroy, to the use of wireless for the delivery of broadband services. Consider, for example, what Senator Conroy had to say about OPEL, the network which was going to deliver wireless broadband services under the Howard government’s Broadband Connect program in a contract announced in mid-2007. Senator Conroy described OPEL as a ‘dog of a product’. This is using, I might say, the same technology at the same speed—12 megabits per second—as is now part of the National Broadband Network between the 93rd and the 97th percentiles. Senator Conroy in an interview on the 7.30 Report in 2007 had this to say about the OPEL network:
If you pick up your cordless phone while you’re using your Internet, your line can drop out. If you use your microwave, your line will drop out.
It was a fear campaign about the use of wireless to deliver broadband. I reiterate that it is the same wireless, the same technology and the same speed as is now embodied within the National Broadband Network proposal to deliver broadband using wireless between the 93rd and 97th percentiles.
But if we go to what the then Leader of the Opposition, Kevin Rudd, had to say in 2007, it is even more interesting. On 19 June 2007 Mr Rudd said: ‘People in regional and rural areas deserve every bit as good a service as those in the big cities. Our fibre-optic-to-the-node plan will offer high-speed broadband to 98 per cent of Australians regardless of where they live. When you look at some of the technical deficiencies in wireless and problems in terms of being able to access speeds of 12 megabits per second using wireless then we believe we have hit upon the right technology.’ It is a technology which they have subsequently abandoned.
There is a real contradiction here. On the one hand we have these criticisms of wireless made for political purposes by the current minister, Senator Conroy, and the former Leader of the Opposition, Mr Rudd, and yet at the same time we have a bill which is proposing complex arrangements to restack the spectrum in the 700 megahertz band so as to free it up for an auction of spectrum which is very likely to be used for the delivery of wireless broadband technologies.
Senator Conroy has continued to run this line, even quite recently, about the deficiencies of wireless. What did he say on 10 August 2010 in relation to the coalition’s policy on the use of wireless as a component for the delivery of broadband? He said that this ignored the advice of industry experts and that:
It will consign Australia to the digital dark ages.
Apparently in the eyes of Senator Conroy wireless is a deficient technology for the delivery of broadband. Indeed, in an interview on 18 August 2010 he described the coalition’s policy as one that would ‘condemn Australians to a wireless network’. We have a deeply conflicted minister and a deeply conflicted government who on the one hand, with this bill, are going through a complex process to restack the spectrum so that it can be auctioned in the expectation of earning several billion dollars because the spectrum will be acquired by mobile telephony operators and others who will use it to deliver fourth-generation, or long-term evolution, wireless broadband while on the other hand they, especially Senator Conroy, are relentlessly criticising wireless as a technology. Senator Conroy just keeps doing it; he just cannot stop himself. It is like some kind of Pavlovian response—mention wireless and there is Conroy jumping up with a criticism. What did he say in Senate estimates on 19 October 2010?
Let me be really clear about this; you cannot monitor somebody 24/7, every second, on an existing fixed wireless network …
In other words, on one hand there is nothing but criticism of wireless as a technology from Senator Conroy but on the other hand there is a bill which is premised on the importance of wireless. Let us be clear and reiterate that the truth is: wireless is a very important component of the delivery of broadband in the future, as is fixed technology including, in an appropriate way, fibre. There is no contention about the importance of fibre. I need hardly remind the House the contention is about the appropriate ownership structure, the appropriate reach of fibre and whether you need to spend $5,000 per premises to deliver fibre to the home, as is the policy of this government.
Let me turn to my second point I want to highlight, which again relates to the National Broadband Network and its implications for the legislative scheme we are considering. We have seen that the tail has wagged the dog when it comes to broadband policy in this country. The tail of trying to make National Broadband Network Company’s business plan as credible as possible has wagged the dog of good telecommunications policy. Already this government has fallen prey to temptation. It has fallen prey to temptation to impose legislative restrictions on the capacities of companies other than NBN Co. to compete in the delivery of broadband.
We have seen this in the so-called cherry-picking provisions. Let us be clear: cherry picking is a notorious code phrase regularly used by monopolists as really meaning ‘we want a free kick’. It is the phrase that Telstra, as this country’s dominant incumbent monopoly in telecommunications, used for many years, and now we have NBN Co. using exactly the same language. There is a real danger that this government will fall prey to temptation when it comes to auctioning off the spectrum which is being rationalised and restacked under this legislation. There is a real danger that this government’s desire to protect the National Broadband Network Co. to maximise that company’s business prospects will affect the way this government thinks about the auction of this spectrum. I simply highlight here the risk that this government may fall prey to the temptation of trying, in whatever ways it can, to nobble the capacity of competitors using the auctioned spectrum to be effective competitors with the National Broadband Network Company. A way in which this government could do that is by rigging the rules of the auction. I simply highlight that risk.
My third point in the brief time that remains available to me is that there are serious concerns about the way in which this government has dealt with the transition to digital as a means of providing continued service in television to people in rural and regional Australia. Of course the transition to digital is inevitable and indeed it is desirable, but it is important that it be managed in an appropriate way to provide continuity of service. For example, it is important that the VAST satellite service should be seen as a safety net rather than as a standard means of delivery of service to hundreds of thousands of households. That is an import concern that those of us on this side of the House have about this bill.
This is a bill which reveals a sharp contradiction in the attitudes of this government about wireless broadband spectrum. I highlight the concern that there is a risk that this government will fall prey to the temptation to rig this auction in a way that will undermine competition to the National Broadband Network Company. I also highlight the importance of maximising the delivery of continued service to rural and regional Australia.",REPS,<title>BROADCASTING LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (DIGITAL DIVIDEND AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2011</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,38,1
"Matheson, Russell, MP",LP,2011-03-23,"—The Broadcasting Legislation Amendment (Digital Dividend and Other Measures) Bill 2011 covers many details and measures. However, I would like to focus my attention on the proposed auction of the 694-through to 820-megahertz frequencies of the radio spectrum, known as the digital dividend, when our nation switches from analog to digital television. The auctioning of this 126 megahertz will deliver a revenue windfall to the Treasury. This spectrum will no doubt be highly sought after by mobile telecommunications and internet corporations, as this particular spectrum is ideal for carrying large amounts of data at very high speed over long distances and has the ability to penetrate buildings and other structures. Because of these unique features, this part of the radio spectrum would also be invaluable to the police and emergency services to safeguard public safety, particularly during emergencies and critical incidents when other communications systems are congested or break down.
I strongly believe it is necessary for measures to be included in this bill to ensure that part of the spectrum will be made available to police and emergency services in times of emergency. The peak bodies of Australia’s police, firefighting, ambulance and other emergency services have requested 20 megahertz of the spectrum to be reserved for these disaster situations. The use of this spectrum represents some amazing opportunities for frontline emergency services and could revolutionise the way these services operate. Mr Deputy Speaker, I bring to your attention a fact sheet that was sent to all MPs and senators by the Police Federation of Australia. In this fact sheet they have raised a number of concerns and made comments in relation to reserving part of this spectrum for emergency services personnel. This updates our February alert that the police and emergency services need the spectrum in the 700-megahertz band for digital dividend for public safety. I will read some quotes from the fact sheet:
All of Australia’s Police Commissioners met on 11 March to reaffirm the need for 20 MHz of the available 126 MHz—
which equates to about 16 per cent. The fact sheet continues:
They are supporting the Attorney-General’s proposal to reserve spectrum for these ‘mission critical’ purposes. Australia’s fire authorities and ambulance services are also united behind this proposal.
COAG has agreed that all these emergency services must have seamless, secure and robust communication systems. It’s called inter-operability.
The major telcos, like Telstra, Optus and Vodafone, will be bidding for the spectrum at auction. On behalf of these big three telcos, a misinformation campaign is being run by the Australian Mobile Telecommunications Association (AMTA).
To set the record straight, Motorola—a company with the technical expertise to know what’s what—agrees that our public safety organisations need part of the 700 MHz band ‘for dealing with crisis situations’. Motorola said ‘Australia risked mortgaging its future if emergency services were unable to obtain some of this spectrum’; it ‘is critical to the future of emergency services users’.
Motorola also refutes the claim that other bands like 400 MHz or 800 MHz would do the job for police and emergency services. And they debunk the argument that Australia would be out of step with the Asia Pacific regional plan.
Congestion on telco networks is a serious problem during emergencies. Their communications systems are not designed and built to ‘importance level 1’ which public safety agencies build to. And if any telco forced to provide a service to police, was foreign owned, national security could be compromised.
Finally, police and emergency services have never said they should get spectrum for $0. State and Territory police spend millions of dollars now on their stand alone communications networks. Any charge applying to public safety agencies should take into account their non-commercial use of spectrum for public safety purposes as per the Radiocommunications Act 1992.
We also understand an Access Economics report for A-G’s says that if 20 MHz is reserved, the revenue raised at auction may not fall. The spectrum is rare and valuable and may become more so.
The Police Federation of Australia are surely an agency that we should all be listening to. This is an issue of national significance, and I hope the minister is listening. We can only assume that the sale of the digital dividend is being used for promotional purposes, probably to try to return the budget to surplus in 2012-13.",REPS,<title>BROADCASTING LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (DIGITAL DIVIDEND AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2011</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,38,1
"Tehan, Dan, MP",LP,2011-03-23,"—In rising to speak on the Broadcasting Legislation Amendment (Digital Dividend and Other Measures) Bill 2011, I raise serious concerns about the digital switch-over in south-west Victoria which is due to take place in early May. Like many other government programs that we are bearing witness to in south-west Victoria, this one looks as if it is going to be another rolled-gold disaster. It seems quite clear that the people are not ready and the groundwork has not been done. The shadow minister for communications has written to the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy on this, and his reply makes no sense. So tonight I am calling for the digital switch-over in south-west Victoria to be postponed so more work can be done with local communities and residents to get them ready for the so-called digital switch-over, which—let us be honest and call a spade a spade—is the analog switch-off. That is what it is. It is people having their analog TVs turned off.
Those people need to be prepared so that they can move to digital—and they are not. Let me read an email that I have received:
Dear Mr Tehan,
I am writing to you for some assistance in the matter of such poor reception in the Cobden area. We feel disadvantaged in this, as most towns seem to have better reception than us. We are seeing texts to the editor in the local papers about problems with pixilation. Many TV viewers between Terang and the southern coast have been experiencing pixilation on TV signals. We also have issues regarding upgrading of antenna systems. It seems that when you switch to digital, if you need to upgrade your antenna system and you are a pensioner or a gold card holder, you will not get assistance.
These problems and many more need to be addressed before the so-called digital switch-over or—let us call a spade a spade—the analog switch-off takes place. This is going to impact people in my electorate. They already have poor mobile telecommunications reception and now they are going to have poor TV reception. They are going to be left with a double-whammy. This government is failing to listen and is failing to take account of this extremely serious problem. The digital switch-over in south-west Victoria needs to be postponed. More effort needs to be made to make sure that people, especially those who are less well off, are in a position to be able to deal with the digital transfer, with the analog TV being turned off.",REPS,<title>BROADCASTING LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (DIGITAL DIVIDEND AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2011</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,38,1
"Albanese, Anthony, MP",ALP,2011-03-23,"—in reply—I thank honourable members for their contributions to the debate on the Broadcasting Legislation Amendment (Digital Dividend and Other Measures) Bill 2011. After its introduction on 24 February the bill was referred to the Senate Environment, Communications and the Arts Legislation Committee for inquiry. The committee tabled their report in the Senate on 22 March and recommended that the bill be passed.
The bill introduces amendments to the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 and the Radiocommunications Act 1992 that are crucial to effectively implement the restack of digital television channels needed to realise the digital dividend. On 24 June the government announced that 126 megahertz of broadcasting spectrum would be released as a digital dividend, resulting from the switch-off of analog television services.
The switch to digital-only television will be completed in Australia by 31 December 2013, releasing the channels used for analog television. The digital dividend will be released as a contiguous block of spectrum in the ultra high frequency, or UHF, band. The UHF spectrum currently used for broadcasting services is highly valued for delivering wireless communication services, including superfast mobile broadband.
The government aims to auction the digital dividend spectrum in the second half of 2012. In order to release this highly valued spectrum, digital broadcasting services will need to be relocated or restacked out of the digital dividend spectrum and organised more efficiently within the remaining spectrum. The government intends that the digital dividend spectrum be cleared by 31 December 2014.
While ACMA has some scope under its existing powers to commence digital channel restack planning, the bill will give it more flexible planning powers and allow the restack of digital television channels to occur in a timely and efficient manner. The proposed amendments will also improve the regulatory framework for digital switch-over and the delivery of both terrestrial and satellite free-to-air digital television services.
During the Senate committee’s inquiry into the bill some submitters raised concerns that the bill favoured satellite conversion over terrestrial conversion. The government recognises that both terrestrial infrastructure and a satellite service are required to provide all Australians with access to the full range of digital television services. Government policy does not advocate a preferred method of digital television reception.
The bill will amend the conditional access scheme to provide commercial broadcasters in remote Western Australia with the opportunity to roll out their terrestrial digital television services before viewers they intend to serve can access the VAST service. This will protect the integrity of the larger terrestrial television markets in remote Western Australia and avoid the need for viewers to purchase satellite reception equipment unnecessarily.
The bill will also allow viewers access to the VAST service after a specified time following switch-over in their licence area where VAST provides a superior number of commercial digital television services, including digital multichannels, than are otherwise available terrestrially in their area. These provisions will provide the commercial broadcasters with the incentive to roll out all of their terrestrial digital television services before viewers in the area receive automatic access to VAST.
Although commercial and national broadcasters can apply to the minister for exemption from converting terrestrial digital transmission sites under very limited circumstances, it is important to note that this exemption is not automatic. It is within the minister’s discretion, having regard to the statutory criteria outlined in the bill, to grant a broadcaster an exemption. An exemption cannot be granted where a service has already commenced transmitting in digital. These provisions are intended to, amongst other things, minimise situations where consumers need to purchase both satellite and terrestrial reception equipment to receive the full suite of digital television channels.
This bill will progress the government’s digital television switch-over program and will help realise the digital dividend, bringing significant social and economic benefits to all Australians. I commend the bill to the House.

"Jones, Ewen, MP",LP,2011-03-23,"—I rise this evening, on 23 March 2011, to mark the 100th anniversary of the sinking of the passenger ship SS Yongala. Its name means ‘good water’ in the Nadjuri language of South Australia. It is named after the town in South Australia. It was on the ship’s 99th voyage from Melbourne to Cairns and all ports in between on 23 March 1911 when the Yongala steamed out of Mackay. By 26 March it still had not arrived in Townsville. It was reported missing on 26 March.
The SS Yongala sank off Cape Bowling Green, about 85 kilometres south-east of Townsville, on 23 March 1911. She sailed into a cyclone and was sunk. All 122 people on board perished in what is still considered to be one of the most tragic incidences in Australian maritime history. The only body ever found was that of the racehorse Moonshine, which was washed up not far from Townsville.
In 1958, two skindivers from Townsville located the wreck and brought to the surface a steel safe which was found in the cabin. It was upon researching the safe’s serial number that it was confirmed that the wreck was indeed the Yongala. In 1980 the wreck was declared an historic shipwreck and is now afforded some legal protection against looting and illicit salvage of any items still on board the wreck.
Australia’s leading underwater filmmakers, Ron and Valerie Taylor, say that they have dived on wrecks all over the world but the Yongala is ‘by far the best’. The SS Yongala is today a major tourist attraction for the scuba diving industry in Townsville and is widely recognised as one of the top 10 dives in the world. More than 10,000 divers every year travel to Townsville to dive this wreck. It is on the bucket list of every serious diver in the world. At over 100 metres long, she is one of the largest, most intact historic shipwrecks. That shipwreck now has established an artificial reef that provides a structural complex habitat for a diverse range of marine life.
At 10 am today in Townsville there was a memorial service at the Maritime Museum of Townsville. On Saturday night in Townsville there will be a tribute dinner at the historic Yongala Lodge in Fryer Street in North Ward, which will be attended by 14 members of the Rooney family. The Yongala Lodge was built in 1884 as a private residence whose original owner was Mr Matthew Rooney. There will be lots of things going on that dinner including a charity auction at which I will be the auctioneer. Tragically, Matthew Rooney, his wife and daughter perished when then SS Yongala sank in 1911, thereby forever linking the lodge with this historic maritime disaster.
As with all disasters, there is always that funny or quirky little story. The Earl family from Cairns, who sent their family south to Brisbane to escape as the wet season, could not find accommodation in Brisbane and were booked to come home on the Yongala. They would have died on the wreck if it had not been for that last-minute finding of a home to rent in Brisbane. They stayed in Brisbane and survived. Today in Cairns there is a suburb called Earlville, named after the family. If they had been able to get on that boat, future generations of the Earl, Harris, Fallon, Howey, Nelson, White and Curtis families would never have known life. In another lovely little story, in the Harris family someone was sick and unable to get on the boat. We do not know how true that one is but, as with all stories, the further you get away from the original incident the truer they become—look at my rugby career!
It is a very special day in Townsville. The Yongala is a very special place. We need to back the North Queensland tourism industry, and I would urge anyone out there who is a serious diver and has a current ticket to get to Townsville, dive the Yongala and spend a tonne of money in my city.",REPS,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>SS Yongala</title>,Adjournment,39,1
"Smith, Anthony, MP",LP,2011-03-23,"—I rise this morning in this House to pay tribute again to the wonderful community in Wandin in the Yarra Valley in the federal electorate of Casey, and in particular the Wandin CFA. On Saturday, 5 March, along with 180 other members of the local community, I attended the opening of the Wandin Fire Station extension. The Wandin CFA was founded in the 1940s. It has a proud history. Due to the dedication and support of so many members of the local community, they have been able to extend their station. Mr Deputy Speaker, as you would appreciate, it has taken a lot of work and a lot of commitment. I pay tribute to the captain, Mr Peter Polovinka. I also pay tribute to Les Sharp. He is a member of the CFA and the Wandin Rotary and is irrepressible, unstoppable and ever persistent. The extension of this CFA district station would not have come about without his constant effort over the past four or five years.
As I said, it was a wonderful community effort. There were contributors at so many levels. The Bendigo Bank of Wandin and Seville contributed $50,000. I pay tribute to so many of the local businesses that gave in-kind donations and gave their time and equipment at so many levels—Gavin McIntyre the builder; Meyland Constructions, who did the excavations; Beenak Constructions; Warratina Lavender Farm; Wandin Video; Zen Gawronski the painter; Waterhouse Timber; Boral Quarries; Activity Playgrounds; Mount Evelyn Garden and Produce; Hewitt Constructions; Wandin Retravision; Robin Mauder the sign writer; and the Golden Opportunity Shop in Seville.
On top of that, as you would imagine, Mr Deputy Speaker, there was constant fundraising to ensure that this great day came about. The extended fire station is a much-needed practical upgrade for the Wandin CFA. It will also serve as a wonderful community facility for everyone in Wandin and the wider community. I commend the leadership of the Wandin CFA and the Wandin community for their community spirit and dedication.",REPS,<title>CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Casey Electorate: Wandin Country Fire Authority</title>,Constituency Statements,41,1
"Elliot, Justine, MP",ALP,2011-03-23,"—Today I rise to speak about the very positive impact of Building the Education Revolution in my electorate of Richmond. The provision of education is one of the most important services that a government delivers, and the reforms delivered by this federal Labor government have been immense. The Gillard government understands the importance of education. We know that accessing a quality education is one of the key factors in transforming a child’s life. It has taken the federal Labor government to reassert the importance of education through our many and varied programs, particularly Building the Education Revolution, or the BER.
Of course, during the very dark days of the global financial crisis it was the federal Labor government that took decisive action and put in place the economic stimulus package. The purpose of the stimulus package was to protect jobs and invest in vital infrastructure like that needed in our nation’s schools. In the electorate of Richmond more than $115 million has been invested in more than 90 schools. I have had the privilege of visiting many of the infrastructure projects in schools right across my electorate. I have had the opportunity to see firsthand some of the many benefits to these local schools. An example is the new multipurpose hall at Brunswick Heads Primary School. Another is the wonderful Korean language centre at Wallumbin High School, where I was witness to a very inspirational performance of traditional Korean songs. Just last Thursday, on St Patrick’s Day, I was very pleased to attend Mount St Patrick’s Primary School and College, two linked schools in Murwillumbah that pooled their resources under the BER—more than $4 million altogether. They have built some fantastic new classrooms, a science and language centre and improved access for disabled students. It was great to see the students so excited about their new classrooms and talking to the teachers about the new opportunities that all these resources will bring—and all credit to Mount St Patrick’s School.
I was also very pleased the next day to visit the Holy Family Catholic Primary School at Skennars Head for a very similar opening. Through more than $2 million in BER funding, this school now has a hall with wonderful resources not only for the whole school—for assemblies, concerts, lessons and events—but also for the whole community. The BER has given our schools resources they desperately need. Of course, the provision of quality education occurs when governments, schools, teachers, students and parents work together with their local community to improve their schools, and that is exactly what the Gillard government has done with Building the Education Revolution.
I will finish with the words of the principal of one of the schools, who said, ‘Boys and girls, always remember that with a federal Labor government anything is possible when it comes to investment in our schools.’",REPS,<title>CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Richmond Electorate: Building the Education Revolution Program</title>,Constituency Statements,43,1
"Keenan, Michael, MP",LP,2011-03-23,"—I rise to speak on the Customs Amendment (Serious Drugs Detection) Bill 2011. The Australian Customs and Border Protection Service is responsible for managing the security and integrity of Australia’s borders. Customs officers work hard day and night to detect and deter unlawful movements of goods and people across the border. Customs have responsibility for protecting Australians through the inspection of cargo to try to find illicit drugs, weapons, unauthorised boat arrivals, postal items and also target high risk travellers. Australian Customs officers do a great job under tough circumstances day in and day out. Unfortunately, they are given very little help by this current government, which is stretching their capacity to do their job, particularly to manage our borders.
Since Labor changed our immigration laws in 2008 relating to asylum seekers, there has been an influx of unauthorised boat arrivals putting an enormous strain on Customs and leaving Australia a soft target for organised criminal syndicates seeking to profit from human misery. Last week we witnessed the largest boat arrival since February 2010—this boat carrying 145 people. We also witnessed a government that had completely lost control over our immigration detention system. We witnessed a large outbreak of asylum seekers from the Christmas Island detention centre, which resulted in a violent confrontation with Australian Federal Police officers, with detainees setting fire to the main buildings, throwing rocks and Molotov cocktails, whilst rioting and setting fire to furniture and bins. The problems certainly were not limited to Christmas Island, with protests, breakouts and disturbances occurring throughout the mainland detention network.
Under this Labor government, breakouts, riots and complete chaos reign. They have allowed people smugglers to dictate to the Australia government who comes to Australia and people smugglers are now in charge of our immigration policy. Since August 2008 we have seen the arrival of 215 boats carrying over 10,500 unauthorised people. Since Julia Gillard knifed former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, the now foreign minister, and took control of the Labor Party saying that it had lost its way, 74 boats carrying over 4,000 unauthorised arrivals have come under her watch.
Without a strong border protection policy, these numbers will continue to increase and more people will risk their lives and the lives of their families trying to enter Australia illegally. Labor’s weak stance on border protection has fuelled the abhorrent industry of people smuggling. As we have stated many times in this House, the coalition believe in an uncompromising approach to protecting Australia’s borders and keeping Australia safe. The integrity of our borders cannot be maintained without a properly resourced Australian Customs and Border Protection Service.
Since coming to office over three years ago, Labor has cut funding for the Customs service for cargo screening, making Australia’s borders less secure and our nation more vulnerable. In the 2009-10 budget, Labor cut the budget of Customs for cargo screening by $58.1 million. This cut to screening by the Rudd-Gillard government reduced the number of potential sea cargo inspections by 25 per cent. Labor’s cuts also resulted in a reduction of 75 per cent of air cargo inspections. In the recent Customs annual report, it was revealed that only 4.3 per cent of sea cargo is X-rayed and only 0.6 per cent of sea cargo is physically examined. It was concerning to find out that a whopping 95.7 per cent of all sea cargo consignments are not X-rayed. It is no wonder that illicit drugs are slipping into Australia and onto our streets under this Labor government when only 13.3 per cent of air cargo consignments are X-rayed and only 0.6 per cent of air cargo is physically examined. This means that 86.7 per cent of all air cargo consignments are not X-rayed. What has become quite clear is that Labor’s cuts to the Customs cargo and vessel inspection system has put Australians at risk by giving a boost to organised criminal gangs that smuggle illicit drugs and weapons into the country.
During last year’s election campaign the opposition committed to restoring Labor’s cuts to cargo screening at ports and airports and committed an additional $35 million to increase Customs resources for cargo screening. This over $93 million funding increase would have enabled the Customs service to inspect an additional 52,500 sea cargo consignments and at least 7½ million additional air cargo consignments. Unfortunately, under a Labor government, these cuts to Customs cargo screening means that more drugs will flow onto our streets and will allow the organised criminal syndicates that smuggle these drugs to thrive.
As noted in the bill’s explanatory memorandum, currently under the Customs Act an internal search, including an internal scan, can be carried out only by a medical practitioner at a place specified under regulations. The Customs regulations of 1926 specify a hospital, surgery or other practising rooms of a medical practitioner for this purpose. The explanatory memorandum explains that, once detained, an application can be made to a judge for an order for an internal search of the detainee by a medical practitioner. Internal searches can be carried out by various means, including by conducting a scan of a person’s internal cavities. A detainee can also consent, in writing, to be subject to an internal search. The amendments in this bill allow, in addition to the existing internal searches by medical practitioners, internal non-medical scans to be done in limited circumstances by an officer of Customs using prescribed equipment. The former search will be renamed medical internal search and the latter will be called non-medical internal scan.
According to Customs, last financial year 205 people were taken to hospital for examination under suspicion of having concealed drugs internally. Upon medical examination, less than a quarter were found to be carrying drugs. In light of these statistics it makes sense to the coalition to support the changes proposed in this bill in order to streamline the process for Customs and enable funds to be saved where possible. We believe that these changes are quite reasonable as, when a suspected person does not consent to having the non-medical internal scan, they can opt to have the medical internal search at the hospital as per current practice. The coalition supports the enhancement of security at Australia’s airports, including the introduction of these non-medical scans. However, the parameters under which these scanners are operated must be monitored and given careful consideration.
The coalition has a long history of keeping Australia safe. Border protection and national security always remain at the forefront of our priorities and we support the progressive enhancements and security being made at Australia’s airports every day. We therefore support this bill.",REPS,<title>CUSTOMS AMENDMENT (SERIOUS DRUGS DETECTION) BILL 2011</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,44,1
"Hayes, Chris, MP",ALP,2011-03-23,"—I too stand to support the Customs Amendment (Serious Drugs Detection) Bill 2011. On the face of it, it is quite evident that this is an essential piece of legislation if we are indeed to be serious about combating serious and organised crime, particularly in relation to detecting serious drugs.
The bill will amend the Customs Act 1901 to enable Customs officers to conduct an internal scan on persons suspected of carrying illegal substances, which are primarily drugs. At the moment should there be reasonable grounds to suspect a person is carrying illegal substances, the only option under the act is to undertake an internal examination that must be conducted by a medical practitioner at a place designated under the act. Obviously, this is a long and lengthy process; people are detained. They are taken to a hospital or to the premises of a medical practitioner and subjected to a search as specified in the act.
The fact remains that, in the last financial year alone, one-quarter of the 205 people suspected of carrying illegal substances were found to be carrying illicit drugs on their bodies—27 kilograms of illicit drugs were detected. When you think of it, 25 per cent would ordinarily be regarded as a pretty high strike rate. Using this new technology, the other three-quarters, who were quite innocent, would not have been detained and subjected to this prolonged and complex medical search process. The proposed non-medical form of examining whether illegal substances are being concealed will provide a significant relief for our hospitals, our emergency units and, indeed, our medical practitioners and certainly will reduce the cost and the time for our customs officers as they go about doing their work in protecting our borders and keeping our community safe.
Clearly there have been some issues raised, particularly in the populist media, regarding concerns about privacy. I have seen articles indicating that you would see images of people that would amount to a breach of privacy. I have been lucky enough to have been given a reasonable brief on this. As you are aware, I am on the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Law Enforcement. One of the inquiries that are currently afoot is looking at our security provisions around both airports and ports at the moment, and one of the areas that we were looking at only recently was the issue of these machines. There are a couple of varieties, and certainly from what we have seen and the brief that we were given, Mr Deputy Speaker, let me tell you that you will not be seen in all your regalia if you walk through one of these things; you will only be seen as an animated depiction. Not in my wildest dreams would I suspect that you would do anything like this, Mr Deputy Speaker, but should someone have planted something on you internally—I do not know how—the machine would simply be able to indicate the areas of suspicion. You would also be given your normal liberties under the act as you were being processed. However, should you not accept being subject to one of these screenings, you would then be subject to the current provisions of the act—that is, an internal search by a medical practitioner.
This bill is not an overreaction. This is something that our government is doing, supported by the opposition, to protect our communities. I have learned in recent times about the value of the drug trade in this country. I have spoken many times about this. I know we talk about the drug trade and all the criminals associated with it, and I often speak about them as just being businesspeople—nefarious businesspeople. They are certainly motivated by profit, but that is what it is; they are in a business. I have an unclassified document from the Australian Crime Commission, and I will give an indication of why I see these people as businesspeople. For instance, cocaine can be accessed in Peru at the moment for as cheap as US$950 per kilo. If brought to the Australian market, it could fetch up to $250,000 per kilo. In Canada methamphetamine can be purchased for $16,687, a typical price per kilogram. That would sell on Australian streets at $210,000.
We were given a brief on ecstasy tablets when we were in the Netherlands as part of the Australian Crime Commission committee at one stage. Presently the typical price for 1,000 ecstasy tablets in the Netherlands is $4,111 and on Australian streets I am advised it is $20,000 for 1,000. The reality is that in the Netherlands an ecstasy pill can be bought for about US$3.50; in an Australian nightclub they are about $45 each—and the nightclub will also charge heavily for the water that it takes to help process that pill!
That is the profit motive that underpins this. That is what encourages people to take the risk. That is what encourages the organisers of these criminal endeavours to use people as drug mules to go and do that. It should not be a shock to any of us who are parents, and in my case a grandparent, that the reality is that the world has changed. People are out there to exploit our kids and our families. We should be doing everything that we can, applying the resources that we have and the technology that is available, to shut down this illicit crime because what is at stake is our kids, our families and our community as a whole.
These things should not be subject to partisan politics, and this matter certainly is not. We should be putting our best endeavours forward to ensure that our people that we put on the front line are appropriately resourced with the necessary financial commitment and also provided with the necessary tools of trade to do what we expect of them, which is to go out and protect our communities.
What we are being asked to consider in this bill makes a lot of sense, given the fact that as a country we are a point of destination. People do not fly through Australia because it is a cheap way to get to somewhere else. They come here for a reason. Last year alone we had 2.5 million people visit Sydney. They did not all turn up for the grand final but, with the traffic jam that I was caught up in, I suspect that half of them did! The point I am making is that we are a prominent destination. We are a destination for people who want to come down under to experience everything that we have, which is great, but we have a population and an economy which is also driving illicit drugs. There is a market here. There are Australians working in collaboration with international drug syndicates and they are working to ply their trade here. They are going to move to satisfy the market. That is why I said these are businesspeople.
Having said that they are businesspeople, there is one other thing which is not exactly a pet subject but is one I often speak about. It is the relationship between organised crime and terrorist groups. As members would be aware, last year I had the opportunity to visit the Middle East and to see a lot of our people in the field. It certainly struck me as somewhat odd that we have our people in Afghanistan, a country which at the moment provides in excess of 97 per cent of the world’s drug trade in heroin—that is where the poppies are being grown and exported—yet, from the last I saw, internationally we are probably catching somewhere around six or seven per cent of that.
To go back to the document that I referred to earlier, the unclassified document from the Australian Crime Commission: if we are talking about heroin per kilogram coming out of Afghanistan, we are talking about being able to access it from the providers there at $2,405 as a typical figure. In Australia that would be sold at $210,000—not for a kilogram but for 700 grams—after it has been refined and processed. That shows what the market is, but it also shows where it has been grown and all the rest of it. The important thing to know about Afghanistan is that opium is not the cash crop of choice; however, it is the crop that has been provided to a lot of the poorer farmers by the insurgent and Taliban sources. People are not given an option of growing wheat, barley or opium. They are told what to grow and provided not only with the crop to grow but also with the labour to plant and harvest it.
Basically, when we talk about the fighting season and the non-fighting season in Afghanistan, what coincides with the non-fighting season is the introduction of terrorist-funded labour to harvest a crop. People that participate in this particular drug trade are not necessarily home-grown Afghan warlords; we are talking about people out of Colombia. The drug syndicates of the world are using this as their cash crop to actually market their drugs and value add to their illicit trade.
The synergy here is that a significant proportion of that money then goes back to fund insurgencies, because the resources are being provided by insurgent groups. We see pictures of British or Australian troops wandering through various areas which look suspiciously like opium fields. The product of those sales is what is being put back to target and to commit acts of violence against Australian, American, Canadian and other forces in Afghanistan under the UN remit who are out there trying to protect the rights and future of the Afghan people.
I will conclude on the basis that I have also used this as an opportunity to talk widely about the subject. It is appropriate that we do everything we can to resource our people on the front line, our Customs officials—officials from the police and other services providing law enforcement services that go about their task of protecting our communities. I commend the bill to the House.",REPS,<title>CUSTOMS AMENDMENT (SERIOUS DRUGS DETECTION) BILL 2011</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,44,1
"Jones, Ewen, MP",LP,2011-03-23,"—I rise to support the Customs Amendment (Serious Drugs Detection) Bill 2011. I will start by stating the bleeding obvious: serious drugs are a blight on our society and on the city of Townsville, which I represent. Anything we can do to assist our Customs officials in getting these drugs off our streets is to be applauded. We see the captured drugs on television and we hear the street value of these imports, but what we do not hear about is the human cost of drugs which get through, and the people who carry them into our country. What we also see today is an increasingly violent nightclub and pub scene. We are seeing the results of people taking illicit drugs and the fallout from them, with displays of thuggery and just plain animalistic behaviour.
Customs primarily search people at the entry point to our country, scanning people who would have ingested or secreted parcels of drugs to get them into the country. Quite apart from being the sole risk-taker for someone else’s get-rich scheme, the dangers of bags rupturing and killing the mule can never be underestimated. All three levels of government need to work together to tackle head-on the issue of drug induced antisocial and violent behaviour. If we can change our attitude towards the taking of drugs, we can then rid ourselves of the dangerous attendee at just about every party in Australia every weekend. Drug-fuelled violence in any city or town is an issue that has no respect for the level of income people enjoy or the school they attended. It affects every part of our communities, from the victims to the small business owners, our health professionals and police.
More and more we see the federal government picking up the tab for health services needed to treat victims of drug-fuelled crime. Night after night, day after day, we see crimes committed by those who are drugged and drunken. Here is an example: a 21-year-old man and his girlfriend were out and about in Townsville. They collected some takeaway food and were in the car eating it when a man came along and randomly started kicking their door. When the young man got out of the car to complain he was set upon with such rage that he was beaten unconscious and his mum could barely recognise him at the hospital. The assailant got a few hours community service, wholly suspended.
In response to the violence on our streets the Queensland state government did what all Labor governments do: it conducted a talkfest, gave the project a snappy name, penalised some small business owners and duck shoved the responsibility to the police. The people of Townsville are calling for strong and decisive action. As a parent of two teenage girls I am keenly aware of the dangers facing innocent people having a good time. The people of Townsville have told me that they no longer want soft responses to what is violent, life-destroying, out-of-control and costly crime. It is time that drunken and drugged louts were dealt a punishment which fits the crime. I have therefore called for mandatory sentencing for drunken and drug-related violence. While the ‘one punch can kill’ slogan was effective, parts of my city are being held to ransom by what amounts to cage fighting each night of the weekend. The people of Townsville are saying it is time that louts on drugs should also know that ‘one punch and you are in a jail cell every weekend for a month’.
Too often our police are arresting these violent criminals only to see them on the streets again causing the same problems. By jailing these thugs on weekends you are taking away the very liberty that they are abusing.
—Are you going to get to the legislation?
—I will have a really good listen to the member’s speech in a minute.
It is the weekends that they value more than people’s safety, and by denying these people their weekends it sends the message that we are a society which will not accept drug or rage violence. This is in stark contrast to the light, non-deterrent penalties currently handed out by the courts.
Simon Overland, the Victorian Police Commissioner, has stated in a speech that the simple banning of thugs from entertainment precincts had not lowered alcohol and drug related thuggery. It is time we treated this crime with the disdain it deserves. Mandatory minimum sentencing of four weekends in prison for offenders would send a clear message to the victims that we, as a society, value their safety. It would also send a clear message to those who take drugs and go out looking for trouble that we, as a society, abhor their actions. Western Australia recently instituted minimum sentences for assaults against police, and within 12 months crimes against police dropped by 28 per cent. Make no mistake, mandatory sentencing is a deterrent.
Townsville is now a major city: we are the largest city in northern Australia, we are home to the largest military installation in the country, we are home to the most significant tropical university in the world and we are on show most of the time. When our convention centre opens we will have people from all over the world come to Townsville. When that happens, what do we want them to see? Do we want them to see and experience a wonderful city where people are having fun and feeling safe or do we want them to receive welcome packs which warn them of places they should avoid? This is not just Townsville: I ask everyone here to ask their community on which side of this equation they would rather place themselves? I want to let these people who want to ruin evenings and lives know that if they try it on they will do so in the knowledge that if they are convicted they will be spending the next four weekends behind bars as a minimum. Weekend detention will have the least impact on the majority of employers, but the employee will have to tell their boss that they will not be available for that weekend overtime or the staff barbecue because they will be busy.
It is time that people felt safe about going out. Across Australia we see people carrying knives for protection when they go out with friends. That is a ridiculous way to live their lives. Drugs play a major part in this, and I will do anything that I can do which reduces their impact on my city. My city is a great one and my country is a great one; we are great people, we are resilient and friendly and I do not want this sort of behaviour to end up being the norm. We must take a stand, as a community, and tell everyone that we will not cop this at all. I commend this amendment to the House.",REPS,<title>CUSTOMS AMENDMENT (SERIOUS DRUGS DETECTION) BILL 2011</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,44,1
"Perrett, Graham, MP",ALP,2011-03-23,"—I commend the member for Herbert for managing to go for that length of time without ever once mentioning the legislation under debate. It is a commendable effort; I am yet to see one person totally avoid the legislation. I would say, in response to the member for Herbert’s speech that I have a bit of faith in our judicial system Australia-wide, whether it is a Labor state or a coalition state. And I have a bit of faith and trust in our judiciary and lawyers; they do a good job.
I rise to speak in support of the Customs Amendment (Serious Drugs Detection) Bill 2011. This bill delivers on the Gillard government’s commitment to ensure strong protection of our borders. It will help boost the protection of our borders and support our Customs officers in their efforts to eliminate illegal drug trafficking, which could end up on our streets. Drug couriers increasingly take greater risks to avoid detection, some unfortunately concealing drugs and other suspicious substances internally. This obviously poses significant health risks to those couriers as sometimes packages split and drug couriers face serious illness or death as a result.
As a government, we want to do all we can to stop drug importation and protect Australian families from the awful harms caused by drug use. Of course we do as a responsible government, and I am sure all state and local governments are doing their bit to combat this scourge of modern society. That is why it is so important that our Customs officers can easily detect drugs that are being imported inside the bodies of drug couriers.
Drug traffickers face reasonably tough penalties in Australia; they are not as tough as those of some of our neighbours, but obviously we have a much more humane approach. The maximum penalty for importing a marketable quantity of drugs is 25 years in prison and/or a $550,000 fine. These are significant penalties, but some nevertheless still attempt to traffic drugs into Australia. They are desperate people, perhaps, or greedy people, or a combination—I am not sure—but this bill enables Customs officers to perform an internal body scan of people suspected to be internally concealing drugs or other suspicious substances. This is not a random scan that occurs at the airport like the explosives tests that many of us have experienced; this is a scan that is carried out when Customs officers have a reasonable suspicion that someone is carrying drugs internally, and the person must also agree to the scan. Those who refuse the scan would instead undergo the hospital examination, which is the current practice.
I understand that we have already made funding available to purchase these scanners, but we also need to give Customs officers the power to perform the scans. At the moment, if a Customs officer believes a person may be concealing drugs internally, that person is taken to a hospital or a surgery where a medical practitioner is then needed to perform an internal search. Obviously this is costly, time consuming and an unnecessary burden on our hospital emergency departments and on the resources of our Customs officers who have to escort the person there. Also, if the person is concealing and refusing to admit that they are concealing, there is more possibility that the drugs packaging could split and cause serious harm to that person, which has occurred occasionally.
Last year AFP officers spent almost 8,300 hours guarding suspects, including more than 4,600 hours in hospital waiting rooms, rather than policing our airports and other public areas. This common-sense piece of legislation allows a Customs officer, with the consent of the detainee, to perform a non-medical internal X-ray scan which can be done quickly. Customs will be able to use computer images of a person’s insides to determine whether they are in fact concealing substances. If the image shows an officer’s suspicions were misplaced, the person would be released immediately. Obviously we do not want legitimate travellers to face unnecessary delays. However, if the image shows evidence of internal concealment, the person will then be referred to a medical practitioner for an internal examination.
Last financial year Customs referred 205 people to hospital for an internal search; 48 of these were confirmed to be concealing suspicious substances, so basically one in four was found to be doing the wrong thing. The new X-ray scans will reduce the number referred to hospital unnecessarily and ensure that our Customs officials can focus on their job of protecting our borders. With early and accurate identification, we will also reduce the health risk to drug couriers with the drugs packages concealed inside their body that can then, because of stomach acids and the like, break and possibly even kill the person.
The bill strikes the right balance between law enforcement technology and privacy. It must be operated with strict controls that ensure that individual rights are respected. For example, a suspect must give written consent to being subject to body scanning. The body scan will only be conducted by a specially trained Customs officer. The images taken are subject to storage, access and destruction controls. Children, pregnant women and the mentally impaired will not be offered a body scan. This is not the same as the full-body scans that are being used overseas for aviation safety; rather this is a Customs measure which scans only the inside of the body to identify internal concealment of drugs in body cavities. The technology will be trialled for one year and, if it is a success, will then be rolled out to more airports.
I know that people in the room, particularly the member for Fowler, are familiar with the decisions that people make to go and smuggle drugs, because I know that he has a particular connection with the Rush family. Scott Rush’s parents are my constituents, so we know that when people are young or in desperate times they can make crazy decisions. While I can understand why people would make such a decision and think that it is okay to smuggle drugs, obviously we need the full force of the law to come down on those people. In Australia we are a humane nation and this is a part of that humane approach which makes our borders strong but is also a sensible approach. It is an important part of protecting our borders.
As this technology improves, the Gillard Labor government will continue to respond to ensure that our Customs officials have the tools they need to keep Australia safe. I commend the bill to the House.",REPS,<title>CUSTOMS AMENDMENT (SERIOUS DRUGS DETECTION) BILL 2011</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,44,1
"Marino, Nola, MP",LP,2011-03-23,"—I certainly support the measures that are included in the Customs Amendment (Serious Drugs Detection) Bill 2011 because the impact of the illicit drug trade on Australian society cannot be underestimated, and I do not think that it is by any member of this House. It causes immeasurable harm and suffering to individuals, families and communities. According to the National Drug Strategy, illegal drugs cost our nation $8.2 billion annually. One of the three pillars of the drug strategy is to reduce the supply, which is, in part, what this bill is intending to do. Whilst we put a number in dollar terms on the impact of illicit drugs on the Australian community, it is not only in monetary terms that we need to consider and manage the impact of drugs, as many of us here know. Numbers, like statistics, require assumption and are open to interpretation, but the impact of drugs on individuals, their families and their communities is not.
The drug strategy says that illegal drugs not only have dangerous health impacts but also are a significant contributor to broader crime. They are a major activity and income source for organised crime groups. Like alcohol, illegal drugs can contribute to road accidents and violent incidents, and something that concerns us all is the family breakdown and social dysfunction. These are the real outcomes of the trade in drugs, and I seriously ask that the House consider not only the dollars but also the impact of crime where people hide in their homes often too frightened to step out onto the street.
The destruction of families and individuals dealing with the addiction is something that you often have to see to believe how serious this is: the impact of illness or death of an addict for the spouse and the children; the parents who spend endless hours waiting, worrying and literally praying that their children will be safe and praying that their children will get through to another day and sometimes listening on the phone to what is happening to their children. There are parents whose children are mature adults in my community. They are 30 or sometimes 35 years of age, well educated and in professional careers as well, but they are in the grip of drug dependence. This has a major impact on the whole family, as well as on the individual’s life and professional career. These are minor examples of the human face and toll of our drug trade casualties. For this reason and for several others I support this bill, which will improve the Customs’ ability to use new scanning technology at our borders. The bill aims to allow Customs officers greater access to scanning technology at our borders and it will mean faster and more accurate assessment of passengers entering Australia and, potentially, a higher and more immediate detection rate.
It is important, however—I think none of us would underestimate this—that an individual’s privacy should not be abandoned or compromised in the process of protecting our community. This is a freedom and right of our democracy that we in Australia can sometimes take for granted. However, I understand that in this case there is no threat to a citizen’s individual privacy. Modern scanning equipment will not be recording details that could or should cause concern. I personally cannot imagine anyone being very embarrassed by a CAT scan of the stomach or duodenum unless they have a reason to be so. Unless there are illicit substances in these parts of the body, I think it is that old adage: if you have nothing to hide, this really should not be a problem. As the technology improves, and I suspect that it will, it may one day be possible to rapidly scan all passengers arriving through our borders. I think we are at the cutting edge of some of the technology to facilitate this type of scanning.
A scan of our internal organs that will not be stored in perpetuity is no risk to the privacy of the individual. The measures included in this bill should, in particular, be able to help target the importation of heroin and cocaine into Australia, but I hope that it will have a broader impact on all drug categories. Data from the Australian Crime Commission indicates that passenger transfer is certainly not the only major method of smuggling drugs into Australia, which we are all aware of. Only 4.3 per cent of the seizures of amphetamines and cannabis in Australia in 2008-09 came from passengers or crew at border checkpoints. Over 90 per cent of seizures were made either in our mail system, through parcel post discoveries or in air cargo.
Because of the high level of domestic cultivation of cannabis, the level of importation into Australia is not necessarily high. That is evident by the reduction in the detection of cannabis at the Australian border, which decreased from 53.4 kilograms in 2007-08 to 8.6 kilograms in 2008-09. The majority of detections continues to involve seeds.
Cocaine is detected a little more frequently in passengers at Customs checkpoints, with 8.1 per cent of seizures detected this way. Cocaine, again, is the most frequently detected in smaller weights in parcel post. However, a lower number of large shipments in sea cargo account for 80 per cent of the total amount of cocaine imported by volume. In comparison, heroin is detected regularly in our air passengers arriving in Australia. Twenty-four per cent of heroin seizures are made by checking passengers, which makes up one-third by volume of heroine seized in Australia.
According to the National Drug Strategy Household Survey of 2007, when asked, one in four Western Australians aged 14 to 24 acknowledged recently using cannabis. The drug issue is as serious as it gets for our communities. For 25- to 39-year olds this dropped to 16 per cent, or one in six people, and one in 20 Western Australians reported recently using another illicit drug. Cannabis is not, as some people think, a soft drug. The impacts of cannabis can be very hard to live with, and that is why I am really glad that a Liberal state government in WA has reversed the Labor government’s soft-on-drugs approach that allowed citizens to grow two cannabis plants. It is not a soft drug. The 2004 National Drug Strategy Household Survey found that cannabis users are twice as likely to report diagnosis and/or treatment for a mental health condition than non-users. According to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare Mental Health Services 2003-04 report, people who regularly use cannabis are likely to experience higher levels of psychological distress, including anxiety and depressive symptoms. There is now worldwide acceptance, which I am relieved about, that cannabis impacts on the mental health of users and there is little evidence to contradict that.
According to the British Royal College of Psychiatrists, research has indicated that there is a clear link between early cannabis use and later mental health problems in those with a genetic vulnerability and there is a particular issue with the use of cannabis by adolescents. They cite three major studies that followed large numbers of people over several years and showed that those people who use cannabis have a higher than average risk of developing schizophrenia. When you see this in your community, it is very apparent. In particular, they found that if you start smoking cannabis before the age of 15, you are four times more likely to develop a psychotic disorder by the time you are 26. You are still young. It also suggests that the more cannabis someone uses the more likely they are to develop psychotic symptoms.
One of the studies followed 1,600 Australian school-aged children between the age of 14 to 15 for seven years—it is a great study—and found that adolescents who used cannabis daily were five times more likely to develop depression and anxiety later in life. As well, children who used cannabis have a significantly higher risk of depression. The opposite is not the case. Children who already suffer from depression are not more likely than anyone else to use cannabis. So why are teenagers particularly vulnerable? We do not know for certain. I suspect it is something to do with the brain development. As you know, the brain is still developing until you are at least 20. Any experience or substance that affects this development has the potential to produce long-term psychological effects. There also appears to be a genetic link to the negative impacts of cannabis. Research in Europe and the UK suggests people who have a family background of mental illness are more likely to develop schizophrenia if they use cannabis as well.
In talking to people in my electorate I am often confronted with the impacts of cannabis use on lives and families. I have spoken to a mother whose daughter had been convinced by her peers—the peer pressure issue—to try cannabis. It was her first and only exposure to the drug. Unfortunately for her she reacted badly. I am not sure whether she had a genetic susceptibility, but this teenager to this day suffers ongoing psychotic episodes from that one use. She will probably never hold down a job or have a family of her own. Her own family will have to care for her throughout her life. Trying cannabis just this once is a life sentence for her. It is not a soft drug and it must never be normalised in Australian society.
Amphetamines are another drug scourge that continues to spread evil influence, having a significant impact on communities in my south-west. By 2000 there were more calls to the south-west community drug service team based in Bunbury relating to amphetamines than any other illicit drugs. Whilst the more rapid excretion rate of this class of narcotics makes them attractive to people who are regularly tested, the physical and psychological effects are devastating.
I have an interesting story of a fly-in, fly-out mine worker—I have a lot of those—who tested positive to cannabis at his goldfields work site. He then informed his employer that he would have to switch to amphetamines to avoid the random drug test program. That worker was rightly not re-employed. That that is what he would do indicates the level of desperation that the drug addicted reach. A young lady by the name of Jade Lewis spoke to a group of young people that I had and she gave a graphic account of what drug use had done in her life, to the extent that one night she was out on the streets and she was being beaten up because she owed the drug peddlers money. She pressed the automatic dial number for her parents because she was being beaten up. The phone call went through to her parents, but because she could not speak due to being belted so seriously, her parents were in their bedroom listening to their daughter being beaten. They did not know where to find her. It was not just then, but at any time. They did not know where she was or what was happening to her. The same parents, at one point, had concrete thrown through their windows. It does not just affect the individual users.
I have been trying to attract a headspace unit to the south-west. There are 15 different mental health workers and agencies in the south-west. Headspace is important for young people. It provides a one-stop shop for young people aged 12 to 25 and their families. They have a wide range of youth friendly health professionals. They only have to tell their story once and everybody who is providing a health support knows their story and they will get the help they need, whether it is mental health, education, employment or any drug issue which would affect a young person. This is a great part of the education and awareness program and is just part of the war that we wage against drugs.
I noted that there was an article in the Age on 18 October, which concerned me and I suspect everybody else in the House, that opium production in Burma is eclipsing that in all other South-East Asian countries and trending relentlessly upwards. The threat of serious transnational crime in drugs and in drug trafficking is one of our biggest challenges. It is a challenge at our checkpoints, at our borders, and in every way, shape or form in our society.
I acknowledge that what is contained in the bill will not be the answer to all of our problems, and it is not meant to be, but it is certainly meant to be a step in the right direction and that is why I have no hesitation in supporting the measures that are contained in the bill today.",REPS,<title>CUSTOMS AMENDMENT (SERIOUS DRUGS DETECTION) BILL 2011</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,44,1
"O’Neill, Deborah, MP",ALP,2011-03-23,"—I am delighted to be able to speak to this important legislation today. The Customs Amendment (Serious Drugs Detection) Bill 2011, when enacted, will strengthen the arm of the Australian Customs Service to detect the importation of serious drugs into our country. As a person who has fought long and hard against the sinister and corrosive effect that illegal drugs have in our society, particularly on our youth, this legislation has my unwavering support. To put the effects of drugs into a proper context, I refer to the UN’s World Drug Report 2010.
There are two quite significant statistics. In Australia and New Zealand the annual heroin consumption was estimated at 1.8 metric tonnes, sourced from both Afghanistan and Burma, as we have just heard. Unless we put in place the kinds of provisions of deterrents that this bill provides for, the surplus of supply from those countries is likely to be landing in our country. The report also details significant growth since 2000 in the number of clandestine laboratories producing amphetamine type stimulants in Australia. In response to the comments of the member who has just spoken, we obviously have significant issues with the arrival of drugs from offshore to our country and the bill seeks to provide one more element that assists the Australian Federal Police and our border protection agencies in preventing that on-flow of drugs, to interrupt the supply. We know that good drug policy has, as one of its critical arms, supply reduction.
One of the reasons I am standing in the chamber here to speak to this matter is absolutely related to the impact of drugs on young people and the impact of drugs on the learning capacity of young people that were in my classrooms in schools on the Central Coast. We know that drug issues, drug addiction, drug experimentation and the family impacts they have happen in all areas, and the Central Coast is certainly no different from any other areas. In fact, quite often it has been said locally that with our significant surf culture the drug culture and surf culture has gone hand in hand for some time. I am pleased to see that we have hit a point in our development as a nation and our understanding of this drug culture that people within the surf culture are also beginning to interrupt that narrative that drugs and surf go together. That is because people have been around long enough now to see the demise of great people who have become hooked on what can be glamorised in the press as soft drugs and the devastating impact that has on families.
As with the story that you heard before, one of my good friends on the Central Coast has a son in year 9 who had the experience of meeting up with a couple of mates. He just wanted to belong. He had a very short period of engagement with cannabis and to this day that young man is now in care with 24-hour supervision. He cannot even boil water. The only people who keep in touch with him are not the friends who seduced him into trying what we know is an illegal substance, and it is illegal because it is dangerous. Of course there will be exceptions to the rule. There will be people who will survive the experience—and good luck to them; they must have the most incredible amount of protective health factors at their disposal. They have education generally. They have a family that has attitudes that are antithetical to drugs. They have the physical capacity to resist them and they have a sense of their own future that plugs them into that future. All of those things enable people to enter and move quickly out of a drug addiction or a drug culture that might prevent them from doing the best that they can and on to becoming the best members of our community that they can.
I will return to this young boy. It is his whole life. He was a boy with such incredible potential that has been lost because of an attitude of accepting and normalising drug use.
The legislation that we have before us is entitled the Customs Amendment (Serious Drugs Detection) Bill and it is a serious matter. I would also like to put on the record this differentiation of recreational, soft drugs and hard, serious drugs. I can only imagine that the opposite to that might be non-serious drugs, which is really an aberration. These drugs that we are talking about—all of them, from GHB and ecstasy to whatever is the current flavour of the month in the fashion of drug taking, from cannabis to heroin to amphetamines—are declared illicit because they are dangerous. They are not dangerous in any other way than impacting on families and individuals. We know that the costs to our community, in terms of health and wellbeing and also in terms of our capacity for work, are really quite significant.
A failure to interrupt the drug supply—and the bill is really moving towards supporting that interruption and employing new technologies to make sure we do the best job that we can—created a situation for me where one Monday morning, in-between classes, I had a student approach me because he knew of my interest in this area and say to me, ‘Miss, I need to have a talk to you.’ I told him that I was in-between classes and was there any chance that it could wait until lunchtime. He said: ‘No, I can’t. I really need to talk to you. I don’t think I can keep going today until I get this off my chest.’ I said, ‘What’s the problem?’ He said, ‘One of my friends asked me to hold a tourniquet on his arm while he was shooting up on the weekend. I don’t know what to do.’ I think in that situation it was amphetamines and obviously I moved in to supporting him, connecting him with services and also tried the outreach to get support and services to the young person. I am talking about a 16-year-old young man who is faced with that kind of a dilemma on a Saturday night in a back street in my electorate in Terrigal who came to me seeking support because we were not able to interrupt the supply of that drug getting to him.
There are a lot of claims made in public about how we cannot prevent this and that all we can do is help people stay alive. I absolutely agree with the whole of the tertiary prevention framework of harm minimisation for people who are in need. That is an appropriate way to respond. But we should never, ever have such low expectations for our young people that we think that growing up in a drug-laden environment is going to be safe or normal. We need to use every opportunity that we can to interrupt that supply. That is why I want to speak to this legislation, because it is particularly important.
Currently, the Customs Act allows for an internal body search of someone who is suspected of carrying drugs internally, including an internal scan which can be carried out only by a medical practitioner at a hospital or surgery. But this amendment, with the consent of the detainee, will allow an initial non-medical internal X-ray of a person to be carried out by a Customs officer using body scan technology. This is important because it is timely and allows a response when it has been clearly identified that somebody might be carrying or is displaying behaviours that indicate they might be carrying these drugs in their body.
The body scan technology will be prescribed at a later date in the regulations in the act, but what this technology does is produce a computer image of a person’s body cavity within a skeletal structure. It does not capture imagines of external body parts. I am aware that there has been extensive local and international media interest in the new images used overseas for aviation security screening. It is very important that the people in Australia understand that what we are proposing here is not an image of that type. That is not proposed for use in Australia. The images that will be produced will assist Customs officers simply in confirming or ruling out suspicions that a passenger might be internally concealing a suspicious substance. Where a body scan image supports a suspicion of internal concealment, the existing regime governing internal searches by a medical practitioner will be triggered and that will still apply.
All the safeguards that apply to the sorts of equipment used in the conduct of external searches will also be extended to body scan equipment. For example, before a body scanner could be deployed, the chief executive officer of Customs would have to provide a statement to the minister that the equipment can be safely used to detect prohibited goods and that it poses no risk or minimal risk to the health of the person being scanned. Before Customs officers use the body scanner, they would also have to complete approved training in its use. There are a number of operational pluses to this kind of non-medical internal scan being carried out by a Customs officer, but this legislation and the detection that it allows will do some critical things to address the issues that I raised earlier in my speech to the chamber today. We are talking about a preventative capacity. We are talking about interruption to supply. In doing so, we enhance not only the health of those who never receive the drugs that are caught at this point but also the health of those people who are coerced into carrying drugs in their body. Let us not forget for a moment the terrible life situation a person must be in when you are ready to actually attempt to carry illicit drugs within your body into another country. It is such a high-risk venture and often the people who are going to be caught in this sort of structure are people who most need our help and our care to get their lives back on track and away from such activities.
What we hope to do with this and what will be achieved by this is a reduction in the number of people who are referred to hospital for internal examination by a medical practitioner, and that has got to be a good thing. This legislation will reduce the significant resource and medical costs included in the process, and that also has to be a good thing. It will reduce whatever impact there currently is on our hospital emergency departments, and I know that will be a very positively received impact in our local communities. Further, it will allow earlier and accurate identification and referral for medical examination of people who are suspected of internally carrying drugs and, of course, that is beneficial to those people who are caught in that situation. It massively positively impacts on their health. The reality is that people in this desperate situation, trafficking illicit drugs within their bodies, have been caught in Customs, have had delays and have had a whole number of behaviours which I am sure that many of the viewers of Border Protection will have seen over the years—that television show that explores some of the issues that we are talking about today. They have required ambulance transport to hospital for medical internal treatment because they present with deteriorating health as a result of the action that they are undertaking. Early identification of internal concealment is obviously going to minimise potential threats to life and it will reduce the numbers of people requiring transport to hospital or the numbers of people who require surgery.
In the 2009-10 financial year 205 detainees were referred to the Australian Federal Police to be taken to the hospital for an internal search. Thankfully, only 48 of these were confirmed to be internally concealing a suspicious substance. For all of the others this technology is something that they would have been very pleased to have been able to access at that time to avoid the further inconvenience and complications, and the resources of our border protection and our AFP could be better used to move towards our end goal of reducing supply in a strategic and deliberate way.
This initiative is an important supply reduction initiative. It helps prevent the inflow of drugs to our society. It helps create, in the public space, a more certain articulation to add to the voices that are already out there that ‘do not bring drugs into Australia’ is a very strong message. If you do, we will interrupt that flow; we will detect it in the most advanced and best possible way. Based on those facts, I commend the bill to the House.",REPS,<title>CUSTOMS AMENDMENT (SERIOUS DRUGS DETECTION) BILL 2011</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,44,1
"Mirabella, Sophie, MP",LP,2011-03-23,"—I rise to support the Customs Amendment (Serious Drugs Detection) Bill 2011 and I do so with a great degree of frustration—frustration which I am sure is being felt right across this nation from the eastern to the western seaboards. It seems oddly ironic that I am standing here today in support of a bill that seeks to strengthen border protection during a week in which Australia’s borders have gone into complete meltdown. As my colleague the member for Stirling has alluded to, last week saw the arrival of the largest illegal vessel since February last year, carrying 145 people, but that is just the beginning. We know chaos broke out at the Christmas Island detention centre, violent riots have erupted, Molotov cocktails were launched, government taxpayer funded buildings were burnt and many detainees were injured. I know it is a very sensitive topic for the government because they are incapable of dealing with this crisis—a crisis of their own making. Border protection is an area, whether it is to do with drugs or whether it is to do with people, that is of particular concern to the Australian public, and those seeking to speak out on behalf of the concerns of the Australian people should not be gagged or shouted down.
Similar scenes have been witnessed at detention centres on the mainland. We have seen, and I think we will see more, similar scenes to this being repeated and now we have a number of escaped detainees on the loose. Make no mistake, Australia’s border protection regime is in meltdown and it is this Labor government’s fault. We are told that asylum applications have increased across the board and we are just taking our fair share. That is wrong and it is a fraud, because from the last figures available, worldwide asylum applications to industrialised countries fell by 13 per cent and ours rose by 78 per cent. Since the relaxing of Australia’s border protection rules in August 2008 we have seen the arrival of more than 10,600 unauthorised people. The flow of arrivals has not slowed under the stewardship of Ms Gillard; in fact, it has accelerated and under her watch there have been some 74 boats and over 4,000 unauthorised arrivals.
What perplexes most people is that there was no imperative to change the strong border protection rules of the previous government. In fact, I seem to recall the then-aspiring Prime Minister, Mr Rudd, talking about how conservative he was about border protection, pretending that he was a pale imitation, a younger imitation, of a John Howard just in order to get elected. There was no imperative to change. Without a strong border protection policy what will happen is that these numbers of unauthorised entrants, this violence and the destruction of taxpayer funded property will continue to increase. The Labor Party has no plan and no agenda to fix their weak stand on border protection, fuelled by the abhorrent people smuggling industry.
In seems ironic that today the Labor government is introducing legislation to strengthen our borders when all they have done to date is to tear down the strong regulations and laws that were previously in place. This bill will amend the Customs Act to enable Customs officers to undertake an internal non-medical scan of a person who is suspected to be concealing internally a suspicious substance. It will allow, with the consent of the detainee, an initial non-medical scan of a person to be carried out by a Customs officer using this new technology that produces a computer image of a person’s internal cavities with a skeletal structure which may serve to allay an officer’s suspicion that a passenger is internally concealing a suspicious substance. Currently under the Customs Act an internal search, including an internal scan, can be carried out only by a medical practitioner at a place specified in the regulations, which specify a hospital, surgery or other practising rooms of a medical practitioner for this purpose.
It makes very practical sense for the coalition to support the changes proposed in this bill in order to streamline the process for Customs and enable funds to be saved where possible because, goodness knows, this government does need to save funds. If we look at some of the statistics, we see that in the last financial year 205 people were taken to hospital for examination under suspicion of having drugs concealed internally and, upon medical examination, less than a quarter were found to be carrying drugs. As well as streamlining services, these amendments are aimed at working to take some pressure off medical examiners.
Yes, the coalition does support these practical amendments. We will always support practical amendments that strengthen our borders. We are the parties that the Australian people know will always stand firm to strengthen our borders; it is the Labor Party that weakens our border protection. As I said earlier, it is strangely ironic that Labor is proposing these measures to strengthen border protection, when to date they have displayed a pattern of utter failure and an inability to face up to their responsibility as a national government and protect our borders against the practice of people smuggling and illegal immigration.
We saw in the 2009-10 budget that Labor cut the budget of Customs for cargo screening by over $58 million. This cut reduced the number of potential sea cargo inspections by 25 per cent and reduced the potential of air cargo inspections by 75 per cent. When you look at the disgraceful waste of hundreds of millions, of billions of dollars, in their Mickey Mouse programs like the free fluff in roofs program and when you see the sacrifices that need to be made by decent government programs—
—Yes, the BER.
—She is always at the openings.
—They are shouting down.
 (Ms S Bird)—I indicate to the members that there is a form to interrupt, and that is not it. The member has the call.
—I can understand the sensitivity. How can you defend the indefensible?
—The member for Indi will not encourage the interjections.
—Madam Deputy Speaker, with all due respect, these issues of budgetary cuts to Customs and Border Protection are an integral part of this debate and, if it hurts to remind members of the government that their ministers have been utterly and shamefully incompetent—some of them the most incompetent in the history of the Australian parliament—they need to listen and do their job to hold their ministers and their Prime Minister accountable.
In the recent Customs annual report it was revealed that only 4.3 per cent of sea cargo is X-rayed and only 0.6 per cent of sea cargo is physically examined. No doubt most Australians would be horrified to know that more than 95 per cent of all sea cargo consignments are not X-rayed. It is no surprise that so many illicit drugs find their way into the main streets or the back streets of every metropolitan centre, every country town and every valley in this nation. Under Labor, when only 13.3 per cent of air cargo consignments are X-rayed and only 0.6 per cent of air cargo is physically examined, I am sure the flow of drugs will become easier.
Labor’s cuts to the Customs cargo and vessel inspection systems are an absolute gift, a free pass, to criminal gangs and drug smugglers. The coalition reaffirm our commitment to strong border protection. We did so during the 2010 election, not because we were trying to imitate another political party to get elected, not because it was some cynical ploy to deflect from other policy issues, but because we actually believe in it. We have believed in it. I recall when I was first elected, in the 2001 election, John Howard famously made comments to reaffirm our commitment to protecting Australia’s borders and taking our responsibility as a national government very seriously to determine the nature of the inflow of people to this country. We committed to that. We also committed to restoring Labor’s cuts to cargo screening at ports and airports, and we committed an additional $35 million to increase Customs resources for cargo screening.
This $93.1 million funding increase would have enabled Customs to inspect an estimated additional 52,500 sea cargo consignments and at least 7.5 million additional air cargo consignments. If the Labor Party were fair dinkum about Customs and Border Protection, they would at the very least commit to the reinstatement of this funding. In light of the past week’s tragic and unfortunate circumstances, you would think that any sensible government would step back, have the courage to admit their failures and return to the coalition’s policies, which actually worked and helped protect our borders.
They are not afraid to do it when they are in election mode. They are not afraid to pretend to be economic conservatives and, now they are in government, social conservatives, and try to mimic the coalition, so why not do it when it counts? Why not do it when policy needs to be made and implemented in the interests of Australia and Australians? It is quite clear that unfortunately the current the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship is rather hampered. He is not calling the shots. We see him deeply frustrated and, I hope, deeply concerned that his directions and his area of responsibility are seriously being dictated to by that alliance partner that the Labor Party have—and I am sure they will live to regret having it—the Greens. I ask members on the other side to think very carefully about this. The damage done to this nation cannot be reversed. They cannot reverse the damage that they have done through all their other policies—the billions of dollars wasted in putting expensive tin sheds on school grounds, the billions of dollars of damage through the free fluff in roofs program, to the sovereign risk that has been created by their carbon tax.
We saw yesterday Graeme Kraehe from BlueScope Steel giving the government facts that they do not want to hear; they tried to shout the poor man down, the man who said that the carbon tax emperor has no clothes. They have created all these problems that will add to the debt and interest payments that we have. They are creating all these problems leading to sovereign risk. If they go ahead with their carbon tax, they will send jobs offshore to countries that are not as efficient as us, that do not have the same environmental laws as us and that will actually increase emissions while making the same things that we made.
Let us put all of that to one side. Can they get one thing right? The one fundamental responsibility that Australians expect is: protect our borders. Is it that hard? Can you not be big enough to admit publicly what you talk about behind closed doors in the caucus room—that you have failed, that you have been absolutely irresponsible in junking policies that worked, only to see over 10,000 illegal immigrants arrive and damage and chaos ensue. Australians know that you have failed and they want you to do something about it. They want you to stop listening to the Greens; they want you to start protecting our borders. That is the very least this government can do. I know there is a preoccupation in a minority government to protect one job, the Prime Minister’s job, at the expense of everything else, but surely your conscience must be telling you that you have a responsibility to govern for all Australians.
—Order! I remind the member to address the remarks through the chair, not to the chair.
—In light of the broader issues raised by this customs amendment bill, which the coalition is supporting, I ask government members to think deeply and to realise that eventually their failures are clear for all to see. (Time expired)

"Brodtmann, Gai, MP",ALP,2011-03-23,"—That is 15 minutes of my life that I am not going to get back again, and that is 15 minutes of my life that my colleague is not going to get back again. I am reflecting on how much time the member for Indi actually focused on the Customs Amendment (Serious Drugs Detection) Bill 2011, which is the reason we are here today. It was quite an extraordinary little performance that one, but it is pretty indicative of the bile, venom and nay-saying that is typical of the opposition today. Every opportunity that they get they use to kick down everything that we are doing, to nay-say what we are doing, to flip-flop all over the place on climate change. You are just wreckers. Admit it, you are just wreckers.
Madam Deputy Speaker, with all due respect to you, I shall speak through you. It is indicative of an opposition that just generates a culture of fear in this country and that wants to keep this country on its knees. It generates a culture of division and a culture of hatred. I am actually seeing it now, Madam Deputy Speaker. I do not know about you, but I am getting quite a few emails that are just revolting; they are poisonous. The only reason I can think of that I am receiving these emails is that there is this hatred that is being whipped up by the opposition on a whole range of issues and people are feeding off it. Is this the sort of nation that we want? Is this the sort of nation that you want? I hardly think so. What we do is make people proud of the fact that they are Australian—proud of the fact that as a result of our swift action when the GFC hit we saved this country from recession. We saved thousands of jobs from being lost. We saved this country. As a result of what we did we are the envy of the world. We invested millions of dollars in education, millions of dollars in health, millions of dollars in child care, millions in paid parental leave and millions—and we are continuing to do investment in these areas—in infrastructure. This is what makes people proud. This is what makes a happy and content nation, not one that is fuelled by what goes on in the opposition—on hatred and bile and venom—much of which we heard today. Probably we heard 12 minutes of that today and about three minutes on the bill, which I am about to discuss.
It is with great pleasure that I speak today in support of the Customs Amendment (Serious Drugs Detection) Bill 2011. This bill amends the Customs Act 1901 to enable Customs officers to conduct an internal, non-medical scan of a person who is suspected of internally concealing a suspicious substance. It is indeed a pleasure to speak in favour of a bill that illustrates so well the focused concern of this government to pursue worthwhile reforms and improvements in the way the government carries out its role. In this case, the role is the critical one of protecting the Australian community from the tragic effects of drugs.
I doubt that anyone who gets to about my age has not been touched by the tragic effects of drugs. When I was here at ANU I used to share a house on the north side with someone who was studying to be a lawyer. He became quite a prominent lawyer, as is so often the case. People tend to think that people who have serious addictions are either homeless, unemployed or in a disadvantaged position, but my friend was a prominent lawyer. He was living in Darwin at the time and he overdosed on heroin. My husband also had a good friend who overdosed on heroin when she was in her late teens. So, as I said, once you get to this ripe old age you have always been touched by the tragic effects of drugs.
On that subject I was very heartened the other day to attend Karralika, which is in my electorate. They conduct a range of programs for those with drug and alcohol dependencies. They have had a fantastic success rate and I commend the work that they are doing at Karralika and encourage them to continue with their good work. They have a few issues at the moment in terms of wanting to extend their funding base. They are largely dependent on the ACT government and they want to extend their funding base to be a bit broader, so we have been discussing ways that they can do that. I take my hat off to everyone at Karralika for all the work that they are doing and thank them again for hosting me the other day.
This bill provides clear advantages over the current way in which those suspected of internally carrying drugs or other suspicious substances are examined and suspicions are tested. It does this by taking advantage of technological advances while at the same time reducing the cost to the Customs services of testing suspicions and reducing the negative effects on those tested. By providing greater efficiencies, the proposed procedures would materially improve the ability of the authorities to combat the importation of drugs, with all of their tragic consequences, some of which I have just outlined. Although the advantages are clear, as with any new technology the government is prudently beginning with a trial in order to ensure that the anticipated gains—advantages—do in fact materialise.
Currently under the act the procedure involves the internal manual search of someone who is suspected of internally concealing drugs. As you can imagine, Madam Deputy Speaker, this is far from being simply an inconvenience to the subject of the search. It is in fact an invasive and embarrassing operation. Furthermore, this operation can be carried out only by a medical practitioner at a place specified in the regulations. The Customs regulations of 1926 specify that it be a hospital or the rooms of a medical practitioner. Therefore the way we do things at the moment is characterised by considerable inefficiency, potentially wasting a considerable amount of time and human resources, and by a surfeit of bureaucratic procedure.
The current medical scan technology that is the subject of the bill, in contrast, has the potential to clearly show whether or not a person is carrying drugs or not and does so in a manner that is far less invasive and time consuming. It does so by scanning the internal organs and cavities of a subject and this technology produces a computer image of a person’s internal cavities within a skeletal structure as opposed to images of external body parts. So, in particular, it is a completely different system from that introduced recently in the United States: full body scanners that have received a great deal of critical comment. Where a Customs officer’s suspicions are allayed through a negative result from the scan, the subject will be released immediately. If, however, the suspicions are given evidential support by the scan, it is only then that a full internal examination will be conducted.
An example of the greater efficiency to be achieved is shown by some statistics. During the 2009-10 financial year, 2005 subjects were passed to the Australian Federal Police for internal examination at a hospital, but of those only 48 were confirmed to be concealing suspicious substances. This is clearly a very high rate of false positives with the associated efficiency losses. Of course, given the nature of the evil that we are trying to combat, we have to weigh the cost to the taxpayer and the effect on those suspected against the cost of failing to detect drugs. The proposals of this bill would allow us to achieve the same aims at a lower cost in resources and harm and embarrassment to those examined, particularly those whom examination reveals to be not concealing suspicious substances.
The advantages include reducing the number of people who are referred to hospital for internal examination by a medical practitioner; reducing the significant resource costs and medical costs incurred in the current process; reducing the impact on hospital emergency units, which I think is a very positive thing, because given the pressures that are currently on emergency units any mechanism to alleviate those pressures is welcome; enhancing early and accurate identification and referral for medical examination of people suspected of internally carrying drugs; and, through early identification of internal concealment, minimising the potential threats to life and reducing the number of people requiring transport to hospital by ambulance on the basis of deteriorating health during detention.
It is important to stress again that these expected advantages will be tested in a trial. This trial will help to pick up any unexpected problems or ways of improving the process. Importantly, despite the strong imperative to combat the importation of banned drugs, the bill also provides protections for the privacy and human rights of those subject to examination. I know this is an issue of concern to people, so that is why I was keen to cover it today. First, under this amendment these kinds of scans will be conducted only with the permission of the subject. Second, this bill provides for the use of only such devices as are capable of scanning internal cavities and not any external scanning or imaging. Any scanner that is bought that has a capability beyond this would have that superfluous capability locked out so that no Customs officers will be able to alter that capability. It will be completely locked out and people will be incapable of mobilising it. Thirdly, the chief executive of the Customs service must provide a statement to the minister stating that the device procured is safe to be used, possesses no or minimal risk to the subject and can reliably detect illicit substances. Finally, these scanners will not be used on all travellers or, indeed, randomly. They can only be used in a situation where a Customs officer has reason to suspect the subject is carrying illegal substances. I think that is an important point to make and underscore.
Madam Deputy Speaker, the bill before us is one that should command the support of all who wish to see Australians protected against harmful drugs, and you understand the importance of securing efficiencies and cost reductions in the way government carries out its functions. I commend the bill to the House.",REPS,<title>CUSTOMS AMENDMENT (SERIOUS DRUGS DETECTION) BILL 2011</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,44,1
"O’Connor, Brendan, MP",ALP,2011-03-23,"—in reply—First, I thank the members who have contributed to this important debate on the Customs Amendment (Serious Drugs Detection) Bill 2011. I thank the member for Canberra for her very compelling arguments as to why the bill should be enacted to enable Customs and the AFP to do their very important role. I also thank the member for Moreton—apparently he did a very fine job; he told me so himself—and the members for Robertson and Fowler, who of course have been involved in dealing with matters like this. The member for Fowler continues to advocate strongly to ensure we have very good protection at our airports and in other places and I thank him for that. I understand the member for Herbert also spoke on the bill; I thank him for that. I understand that the member for Indi made passing references to the bill when she spoke, which was very nice of her.
The Customs Amendment (Serious Drugs Detection) Bill 2011 will enable officers of Customs using prescribed equipment to undertake an internal, non-medical scan of a person who is suspected to be internally concealing a suspicious substance. Currently under the Customs Act an internal search, including an internal scan, can be carried out only by a medical practitioner at a place specified in regulations. The Customs Regulations 1926 specify a hospital, a surgery or other practising rooms of a medical practitioner for this purpose. The amendments will allow, with the consent of the detainee, an initial, non-medical, internal scan of a person to be carried out by an officer of Customs using body scan technology that is to be prescribed in the regulations.
This technology produces a computer image of a person’s internal cavities within a skeletal structure as opposed to images of external body parts. Such images may serve to allay an officer’s suspicion that a passenger is internally concealing a suspicious substance, in which case the detainee would be released immediately. Where, however, a body scan image supports a suspicion of an internal concealment, the existing regime governing internal searches by a medical practitioner will apply. The existing safeguards applicable to equipment used in the conduct of an external search of a detainee will be extended to the body scan equipment to be used to carry out a non-medical, internal scan. For example, before a body scanner could be deployed, the chief executive officer of Customs would have to provide a statement to the minister that the equipment can be safely used to detect prohibited goods and that it poses no risk, or minimal risk, to the health of the person being scanned.
In addition, before officers of Customs can use a body scanner, they would have to complete approved training in its use. The extension of the internal search regime to include a non-medical internal scan by an officer of Customs will reduce the number of people who are referred to the hospital for internal examination by a medical practitioner—I think that is a very wise thing. It will reduce the significant resources costs and medical costs incurred in the current process. In short, it will mean not having emergency awards or other facilities of a hospital being clogged up by these examinations. It will enhance early and accurate identification and referral for medical examination of people suspected of internally carrying drugs; and, through early identification of internal concealment, it will minimise potential threats to life and reduce the number of persons requiring transportation to hospital by ambulance on the basis of deteriorating health during detection.
These are very important consequences of this bill, if it is enacted. Mr Deputy Speaker, as you know, having the airport of Adelaide in your own electorate, this is an important bill. It is important to ensure we prevent people bringing drugs into this country. We have to have an effective regime to do that. This increases our capability to detect unlawful drugs being imported, making the streets safer in Adelaide and, indeed, safer in all of the cities, towns and regions of this country, because we are improving the capacity for law enforcement to detect drugs. I thank those who contributed to the debate, particularly those who actually spoke to the bill, and I commend the bill to the House.

"Southcott, Dr Andrew, MP",LP,2011-03-23,"—I rise to speak today on the Therapeutic Goods Legislation Amendment (Copyright) Bill 2011 Therapeutic Goods Legislation Amendment (Copyright) Bill 2011. The coalition will not be opposing the bill. We understand the importance of the generics medicine industry in Australia and the competition it provides for medicines when they move off patent. The amendments to the Copyright Act have arisen due to some cases of pharmaceutical companies who have launched claims of infringement of copyright in their product information documents. The use of copyright infringement has the potential to provide pharmaceutical companies with an extended period of market exclusivity after the patent over the medicine has ended.
Copyright has a duration of at least 70 years from publication. The delay of generic medicines entering the market after the patent expiry of the original medicine would have significant financial implications for consumers and also for the government. Without these amendments, the moves by pharmaceutical companies to protect their interest under copyright compromises the accuracy, consistency and safety of the product information documents as the generic products seek to alter the already approved product information from the originator company to avoid potential liability under copyright. It also has the potential to damage the pharmaceutical brand substitution policy which was introduced in Australia in 1994.
The opposition recognises the important role that generic medicines and their timely introduction play in the health care system. We understand the purpose of these amendments, which is to ensure that we still have timely introduction of generics to the market and, in turn, increased affordability and access to pharmaceuticals in Australia.
The bill seeks to introduce two very specific exemptions to copyright infringement under Australian law. The first exemption is that the use or lodgement of existing product information documents is not a copyright infringement when used to apply to register a medicine under the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989. This exemption ensures that, for example, when a pharmaceutical company applies to the Therapeutic Goods Administration for registration of a generic version of a medicine, they will not infringe copyright if they submit a draft product information document that contains text that is similar to the product information already approved for the originator medicine.
It is important that the product information documents of the originator and the generic medicines are similar in form. The product information document contains technical information about the medicines, such as active ingredients, precautions, adverse reactions, dosages and storage, as well as details of the medicine’s safe and effective use. Doctors and pharmacists receive and use this information when prescribing and dispensing medications to ensure the safety of the patient. Having product information documents that are similar in form for both the originator and generic brands avoids any perception that differences in the content of the product information sheet reflect differences in the pharmacological or clinical properties of the medicine itself.
The second exemption removes copyright infringement to the supply, reproduction, publication, communication or adaptation of the TGA approved product information sheets, provided that the uses for a purpose related to the safe and effective use of the medicine. The amendments to the Copyright Act proposed in this bill will also bring the Australian law substantially into line with the same labelling requirements for medicines in the United States.
In consultation with stakeholders, while there was no opposition to the bill, there was concern about some potential unintended consequences. One, for example, is what will be the effect on product information publishers. For example, publication of reference work such as the MIMS Annual or the Australian Medicines Handbook. These reference handbooks are widely used by practitioners. The issue is what impact the exception of copyright will have on these reference books. There is also the potential for unintentional infringements such as those mentioned above. There is also the potential to reduce the intellectual property protections by abolishing copyright on a class of documents.
The opposition is satisfied that the amendments do not go any further than necessary to ensure that the TGA continues to have the ability to approve product information sheets that are in similar forms for both the originator and generic brands of the same registered medicine. However, we will continue to monitor the situation and, if the concerns of some stakeholder groups are justified, we will look at remedying the situation.
Despite the concerns by some stakeholders that I have mentioned, this bill does provide important exceptions to copyright to protect the timely introduction of generic medicines into the Australian pharmaceutical market. That is why the opposition will not be opposing this bill in the parliament.",REPS,<title>THERAPEUTIC GOODS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (COPYRIGHT) BILL 2011</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,45,1
"Owens, Julie, MP",ALP,2011-03-23,"—I am pleased to speak on the Therapeutic Goods Legislation Amendment (Copyright) Bill 2011. We have some very complex bills in parliament from time to time. This, in many ways, is not one of those. Its purpose is quite simple. The issue that it deals with, which is intellectual property, is never simple, of course, and we have already heard from the member for Boothby about some surrounding issues. The purpose of this bill is quite simple. It is to ensure that generic drugs can make it to the market efficiently at the end of the patent period and to ensure that pharmaceutical companies cannot hold up the release of generic drugs when a patent expires by using the Copyright Act. The issue here is not the patent in the drug or the intellectual property in the drug itself. This bill really comes into effect when that patent period has expired, but the bill deals with the possible copyright in what is known as the PI, or product information.
In this context, product information is almost a technical term. It refers to a product information sheet that is approved by the Therapeutic Goods Administration before certain kinds of drugs are released. It contains technical information about the medicine, such as the characteristics of the active ingredient, its indications and contraindications, a description of clinical trials that support the indications, precautions, possible adverse reactions, dosages and storage and all kinds of information relating to the medicine’s safe and effective use. That product information is an extremely important device for prescribers of the drugs. The purpose is to assist medical practitioners, pharmacists and other health professionals to prescribe and dispense the medicine appropriately and safely and to assist them in working with their patients to provide the education so as to support the high quality and safe use of the drug that they are prescribing.
It has been the practice of the Therapeutic Goods Administration to approve a generic version of a registered medicine that is in a similar form to that approved for the originator registered medicine. In other words, when a drug comes off its exclusive patent period and it is released generically, the practice has been that the product information is essentially the same as the original drug. The reason for that is that it is important for the safe use that doctors and pharmacists who are prescribing and dispensing all brands of the same medicine receive the same information about the effects and contraindications and safety warnings associated with the use of the medicine. To do differently—to have different product information about each different generic brand of the same drug—might lead prescribers to assume that they are talking about different drugs rather than the same one.
This practice, which has become quite common, is at some risk now. In 2008, a Federal Court action was initiated by one of the originator pharmaceutical companies against a generic company. In that case, the originator company claimed that the generic company infringed the originator’s copyright in its product information. An injunction was granted by the Federal Court and that effectively prevented the first marketing of an independent, generic brand of the medicine. The assertion of copyright in product information by pharmaceutical companies has the potential to significantly delay the entry of the first generic medicine on the market, thereby delaying the listing of medicines under the PBS and effectively delaying or preventing a 16 per cent statutory price reduction for the medicine. This could result in significant financial cost for the Australian consumer and the PBS. Also, given that the duration of copyright is up to 70 years or more, it could significantly delay the entry of generic drugs to the market.
There is also a further concern that companies seeking to avoid copyright litigation may begin to supply their medicines without critical product information. This has already occurred on one occasion and such a practice would be detrimental to the safe and effective prescribing of higher risk medicines. So the purpose of this bill is really quite simple. It is to insert a new section 44BA into the Copyright Act, and the effect of that insertion will be that actions under the Therapeutic Goods Act for the purposes of approving product information for prescription and other higher risk medicines, or of approving variations to approved product information will not be an infringement of copyright subsisting in any product information which has previously been approved by the Therapeutic Goods Administration.
Its purpose is quite simple and this appears to be an extremely balanced way to achieve it. It is important because any delay in bringing generic drugs to the market has a cost to both the consumer and government, and that delay can be substantial. It is also important because such delays could only lead to practice which is less efficient and good than the practice we already have. It would undoubtedly lead to different product information being provided for essentially the same drug as generic companies found ways to avoid possible court cases over infringements in copyright and it would in some cases no doubt lead to drugs being released to the market without product information. Neither of those two possibilities would be as good for the consumer or the taxpayer, for that matter, as being able to maintain the current practice of the Therapeutic Goods Administration preferring to use the same or similar product information for generic drugs as has been used for the original drug under its patent period.
Exempting particular acts from infringement action under the Copyright Act is not something that is done lightly. I know the member for Moreton is a keen advocate for intellectual property, because of his writing and I am because of my background in the music industry. It is not something that is done lightly; it is an incredibly important regulation. However, the proposed amendments reflect the importance the government places on ensuring that we have the highest levels of health consumer safety through the provision of accurate information to prescribers and health professionals. The only other exemption of this kind in the Copyright Act actually relates to the use of approved labels on containers for agricultural and veterinary chemical products. It is a rare thing to do. There are precedents overseas, for example in the US, where the same label is actually used on generic drugs to the original drugs. They had similar issues and made amendments to the appropriate acts to allow for the use of those same labels without breach of copyright. It is a fairly common practice around the world and something I believe provides a balance between protecting the original interests of the drug company through their original patent period and protecting the interests of consumers by being able to bring generic products to market effectively at the conclusion of a patent period. Once again, I am pleased to support this bill.",REPS,<title>THERAPEUTIC GOODS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (COPYRIGHT) BILL 2011</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,45,1
"Alexander, John, MP",LP,2011-03-23,"—I rise to speak on the Therapeutic Goods Legislation Amendment (Copyright) Bill 2011. Whilst the coalition will not be opposing this bill, I feel it necessary to put on record some reservations about the direction in which we are heading with this industry which this bill represents. This bill is intended to prevent the pharmaceutical companies that research, develop, test, invest in and, finally, produce original medicines from being able to claim copyright over the heavily regulated product information document that they create to be inserted in the medicine packaging. As a result of this, as soon as the patent for a particular medicine expires, a generics company, that has made no investment in research and development and taken no risk, can start producing the same medicine with virtually a photocopy of the product information document inserted.
In short, this bill will add a caveat to the Copyright Act to basically say that if you are a company you can claim intellectual property through copyright of documents you produce, unless you are a pharmaceutical company. When I first read of this bill I was more than surprised to find that the industry’s representative, Medicines Australia, was supporting the passage of this legislation despite the fact that this further erodes its ownership over its property. I now understand that this decision is based on the best interests of Australia’s broader health industry. Medicines Australia has given proof that it is not an obstructive industry pursuing legal rights to frustrate generics companies. We all understand and support the role that generics companies play in reducing costs to the consumer by offering alternatives, and as representatives for those consumers it is our responsibility to ensure that we are protecting their interests. However, sometimes we as legislators can go too far in the dispensation of this protection. This is something we must remain mindful of when providing governance to this important industry.
The journey of a typical medicine can take on average almost 15 years from discovery to market. This includes more than six years refining 10,000 potential compounds down to 250, a further six years of clinical trials with up to 500 volunteers, followed by two to four years attaining TGA approval and commencing large-scale production. This journey is one of great expense and significant risk, as not all trialled medicines end up in the marketplace to recoup those costs. Of course, for a generics company all the hard work has been done and the risk has been borne years earlier. The product has proven to be a success and all they need to do is simply wait for the product’s patent to expire.
Through the research on this bill, I have learned that some generics companies are stocking pharmacy shelves on the day the patent expires, meaning they have previously gone through the process of attaining TGA approval and commencing large-scale production. This raises a legitimate concern with the way in which this industry is regulated, as there is minimal, if any, communication between the TGA and IP Australia when placing generic medicines on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods. It seems that the TGA takes the view that it is up to the generic companies to self-regulate in ensuring they are compliant with the patent restrictions and, if not, then the original medicine producer can instigate legal action. We all know that, by the time the original medicine producers discover the breach and serve an injunction to prevent the marketing of these products, great damage can already have been done through a large quantity of sales and dilution of the brand. Surely we would prefer a society where our regulatory bodies take the initiative to check that a company has the patent permission to market a medicine prior to giving them the regulatory approval to do so. Surely it would be reasonable for the companies that have made all of the investment and taken all of the risk to be informed that a generics company has been given approval to copy their products. In the current system this is not the case.
It is my belief that, with all the regulatory support given to the generics companies in the name of competition, the original medicine producer should be afforded a reasonable notice period of one or two weeks so they can ensure the generics company copying their product is not in breach of the patent. This will avoid the need for a threat of involvement by lawyers with injunctions and claims for damages, and will simply ensure that all parties are doing the right thing in the first place.
The actions of both Medicines Australia and the coalition in not opposing this bill highlight our shared desire to avoid becoming a more litigious society and to support the important role played by the generics companies in our society. The pharmaceutical industry contributes over $4 billion per year in manufacturing exports, more than any other high-tech industry. They invest more than $1 billion per year in research and development and employ approximately 14,000 people, many of whom are based in the electorate of Bennelong. As we work to promote competition in this industry in order to lower prices for the end consumer, we must also ensure that we do not implement too many barriers to profitability and thereby reduce the incentive for the original medicine manufacturers to make the investment in the first place. After all, if there is no research and development, if there is no intellectual property developed, if there is no invention of an original medicine, there will be no product for the generics to copy.
Recently we witnessed the Gillard cabinet reject seven medicines from being listed on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme despite these medicines being recommended for approval by the experts, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee. This decision is unprecedented and has created a dangerous environment, as many players in this industry are forced to reassess the longstanding processes for the production and marketing of their products. The fact that Medicines Australia, who will lose some control through this bill, has chosen not to oppose it and yet has expressed vociferous opposition to the government’s actions on the PBS, highlights what a bad decision this really is. Despite the government’s overt support for the generics industry, this decision—to not offer some essential medicines on the PBS—means it is the consumers who can least afford these medicines who will be forced to pay the maximum price, instead of receiving the standard government subsidies for these health products.
This industry will only survive and thrive on the certainty with which we are able to provide it. Unprecedented and ill-thought decisions, based on politics rather than on what is right, will only serve to undermine this certainty and the foundations that this important industry is built upon. We are a country that has rapidly transitioned from a farming based economy to a more urban society exporting mineral resources. The future must embrace, encourage and stimulate high-tech industries that will produce an Australia at the forefront of the Asia-Pacific region. As legislators, we should do everything possible to support these cutting-edge industries and make welcome the investment that comes with a profitable and productive high-tech sector.
This legislation is fairly simple in its scope and it is both fair and right that we should ensure that technical information supplied for health products is consistent in its high quality. As a party we support the role of both competing interests, the original medicine providers and the generics companies. We support the competition in this market ensuring efficiencies, the original medicine providers and the generics companies. We support the competition in this market, ensuring efficiencies in service and keeping downward pressure on the price paid by the end consumer, yet this support must also be tempered by some clarity and forethought in the direction we take to support the vital role played by the original medicine producers, the essential contribution they make to our nation through investment, employment and, most importantly, the health of our constituents.",REPS,<title>THERAPEUTIC GOODS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (COPYRIGHT) BILL 2011</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,45,1
"Neumann, Shayne, MP",ALP,2011-03-23,"—I speak in support of the Therapeutic Goods Legislation Amendment (Copyright) Bill 2011. Competition is good for consumers and information is power. Information is important for doctors and pharmacists. It is important for consumers. It is important for good, sound health concerns and for public safety. Generics make medicine cheaper. Doctors and pharmacists are at the front line of primary health care not just across the country but in the various communities that I represent—Ipswich and the Somerset region.
This bill is a pretty simple one. It amends the Copyright Act to allow the Therapeutic Goods Administration to continue what has been a longstanding custom of approving product information in similar terms for all brands of a medicine. In fact, it really ends ambiguity and deals with a potential problem caused by litigation.
We have in this country a great health system that we intend to make even better. Medicare and the PBS are world firsts. These are great Labor initiatives. These are great initiatives that make the care of people in my electorate and the various communities across the country safer. They are supported fervently by Labor. Labor strongly believes in health care. We hear speeches by those opposite, even the last speech by the new member for Bennelong, that show they really are not fair dinkum when it comes to issues of health care. While they support this legislation, there is not fulsome support. We even had as recently as 20 or 30 years ago coalition members in this place actually deriding Medicare as a rort. The previous Prime Minister, John Howard, actually once described it infamously as a rort. They really are not as committed to our system of pharmaceutical care, health care and hospital care as we are. We know that, because whenever they are in power they rip money out of the health system. That is exactly what they do, and that is the reality. Do not just trust me. The Institute of Health and Welfare has found that on repeated occasions while the coalition has been in power.
When prescription and other high-risk medicines are approved for marketing in Australia by the Therapeutic Goods Administration a product information document is produced. It is approved for use by health professionals. This is important for doctors and pharmacists. As I said, this bill ensures that the practice of the TGA approving product information in a similar form for all brands of a registered medicine can continue.
What does that product information contain? It is fairly technical, but it contains information in relation to the ingredients in a product. It contains information about what has happened in terms of clinical trials and a description of those types of trials. Further, it contains information about what has happened in terms of potential reactions to medicine and various precautions. It contains information about what should happen in relation to storage of that medicine and dosages patients can have. It is critical for doctors and pharmacists to have that sort of information, because that is good for public health care. It is good for consumers and it is good for the pharmacies across the country. There is a problem if that arrangement does not continue. As I said, the product information statement actually approved for a medicine assists in health care, particularly for health professionals, to prescribe and dispense accurate, appropriate and safe dosages of that medicine. Any pharmacy across the country knows that to be the case. It is important for high-quality and good clinical care that we do this.
This bill does provide a limited exemption and it puts in place what we always thought to be the case, and what litigation potentially could upset. It provides a limited exemption from copyright for product information, as I said. There is an emerging trend. In fact, a court case is currently being heard in relation to pharmaceutical issues. A company is claiming infringement of copyright for product information, a move that often when done or even threatened is simply designed to perpetrate, if not perpetuate, a problem for our health system. They want in fact effectively to delay the entry of any competitor or any competitor’s products into the market. So, competition is limited, and their listing on the PBS could be delayed.
Such legal action could in fact compromise the accuracy, consistency and safety of product information documents as generic products seek to alter the approved product information to avoid potential liability. As I said before, product information contains information about safety and effective use of medicine, and so it is vital. Product information is required for prescription, and it is important, as I said, for doctors and pharmacists.
In 2008, an interlocutory injunction—a temporary injunction—was granted by the Federal Court partly on the basis of an argument that the approved product information for a generic version of a medicine breached the copyright in the approved product information in the original version of the medicine. This injunction has effectively prevented the marketing of the generic medicine for more than two years, and the hearing of that case commenced in March 2011, after the introduction of the bill into the House of Representatives. The litigation referred to is Sanofi-Aventis v Apotex, which is being finalised this week with closing submissions being made today or tomorrow in relation to the litigation.
In 2008, Sanofi argued that Apotex would infringe their own copyright with respect to the product information for its originating medicine if Apotex were allowed to market its generic version. It also argued that Apotex would infringe the Sanofi patent in relation to inclusion of the treatment for psoriatic arthritis in the registered indications.
In the current hearing, Apotex has argued that there could be no copyright in Sanofi’s product information, because no authors could be identified; that it was not an original document, resulting from cutting and pasting from many different sources; that it did not result from an independent intellectual effort; and, finally, in any event, there was an implied licence for its use because of the custom and practice over many years in relation to the use of the product information which had not been challenged.
It was recognised during that hearing that, under the proposed amendments in the bill, it would not be possible in future to prevent an approved product information being used on the basis that it infringes copyright in another product information. However, the copyright matter was fully argued in the hearing because one of the issues in the case is whether the interlocutory injunction in 2008 was justified. Indeed, when courts look at matters in terms of interlocutory injunctions they often grant those on the basis of urgency or on a different basis to a final injunction. The decision of the Federal Court is not likely to be handed down for three to six months. I think three to six months is optimistic, in my experience in terms of the Federal Court. Even if the Federal Court finds that there was no copyright or that there was no breach of any copyright, there is still no certainty in relation to this matter and litigation could be initiated by other pharmaceutical companies or other interested parties in relation to that. The proposed amendment to the Copyright Act 1968 will ensure that the legal situation is clarified for the future and will ensure that the highest level of consumer safety can be provided through the provision of accurate information to health professionals such as doctors and pharmacists.
We have rigorous, scientifically based evaluation procedures for generic medicines. The Pharmaceutical Society of Australia strongly supports any moves to clear up any confusion surrounding generic drugs. Healthcare professionals have a key role, as I have said before, in helping consumers understand the real or perceived differences, or indeed the lack thereof, between different brands of medicine. Prescribing generic brand medicines is important to contain health costs. As I said previously, generics actually reduce health costs.
The impact for residents in my electorate of Blair is most keenly felt by our pensioners and seniors, by carers and by working families generally. About 14,000 people who are 65 years of age or older reside in my electorate of Blair, and about 23,000 people are reliant on some form of pension. That is a lot of people in an electorate of about 125,000 people. By enabling generic pharmaceutical companies, and their employees and agents, to use the existing product information documents, prescribers of these drugs, pharmacists and patients can be confident that the same standards for safe and effective use of medicine apply across the country.
It can be incredibly confusing for a senior person in my electorate who might be ageing. They might be concerned about taking a form of medication. The potential for what I would describe as medication ‘misadventure’ is heightened by confusion. Indeed, the third intergenerational report said that by 2050 there will be about 2.7 working Australians for every person over the age of 65. This is not a hypothetical; this is a real challenge now and it is likely to be more of a challenge in the future.
Senior residents of Blair tell me they are often confused when they go to take their typically red and blue capsule in the morning because it might be green and yellow. That is not a criticism, it is a fact for many people. Often as we get older we take more medication, and unfortunately this can be a challenge for people of all ages. There are cases when pensioners have told their local pharmacist that they just stopped taking a drug because they were unfamiliar with it. They do not know what it means and they do not know its side-effects. It is important that information is the same for equivalent drugs.
A recent Galaxy poll of more than 500 people commissioned by a drug company in Australia found that when visiting a pharmacy 42 per cent accepted the offer of a generic every time, while 32 per cent did most times. One in five, or about 21 per cent, said that they worried that a generic drug could lead to getting the wrong medicine, while only about eight per cent in that poll said they never accepted a generic. So generics are widely accepted.
As medication experts have said, pharmacists are there to help consumers and to answer questions about their medication. Any person who represents a community in this parliament knows that when people go to a pharmacy they ask questions of the pharmacist. They ask questions about the drugs they take, often more freely and willingly than they ask questions of the doctors who actually prescribe the drugs.
This legislation clears up confusion. It simply puts in place what we have always thought to be the case and it will address the challenges of future litigation to make sure that public health and safety is better provided across the communities of Australia.",REPS,<title>THERAPEUTIC GOODS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (COPYRIGHT) BILL 2011</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,45,1
"Hall, Jill, MP",ALP,2011-03-23,"—Like the previous speaker, I rise to support the Therapeutic Goods Legislation Amendment (Copyright) Bill 2011, which is before the House today. The bill amends the Copyright Act 1968, and the amendments are intended to enable the Therapeutic Goods Administration, the TGA, to continue the longstanding practice that supports the quality use of medicines. The practice is to approve under the Therapeutic Goods Act the information for the generic version of a registered medicine that is similar in form to that approved for the originator registered medicine.
This legislation seeks to continue the longstanding practice of allowing generic medicines to be available to Australians. The member for Bennelong may have touched on this, but to really understand this issue we need to look at the importance of the pharmaceutical industry, which is one of the larger industries in Australia. The Australian medicine industry contributes $18 billion a year to the Australian economy and makes a significant contribution to the health of Australians. Some 14,000 Australians are employed in the industry, which exports $4.12 billion a year. The industry continues to export more goods around the world than any other high-tech industry, including the car, wine, scientific and medical equipment industries. In 2009, 18,000 Australians participated in clinical trials. It is a really big industry; it is an important industry for Australia. Part of that industry is the generic medicines industry. Generic medicines are substitute medicines that doctors can prescribe, or that can be bought by Australians, which are similar to the original medicine that was developed. These generic medicines can only be prepared and sold once the original medicine comes off copyright.
Since 1994, substitute, or generic, medicines have been prescribed within Australia. As the member for Blair pointed out, an overwhelming majority of Australians will accept a generic medicine as opposed to a branded medication. I know that, from a personal perspective, if I go to a pharmacy and I am asked whether I will have generic or a branded medication, I will choose the generic medication except in cases where there may be an ingredient that does not quite agree with me, which can be the case. That is why it is important that proper product information is available to doctors when they are prescribing the medication. Doctors need to be absolutely certain that there will not be any unwanted side effects and that the medication will actually target what they seek to treat in their patient.
For a very long time, since 1994, that has worked extremely well in Australia. But in recent times concern has arisen, particularly with the case that is currently before the courts and which I believe is due to be heard this month—although, as the member for Blair said, it could be up to six months before the findings are handed down. An injunction was granted by the Federal Court in 2008. If this case were to be successful, it would have enormous implications for the availability and the prescribing of generic medicines. In turn, that would have an enormous impact on the costs and, I would argue, on the availability of pharmaceuticals in Australia, because it would increase the cost to government. With an increased cost to government, in the long run it would lead to fewer medications being listed on the PBS.
This is an exceptionally important piece of legislation because it ensures the ongoing viability and availability of generic medicines within Australia. Mr Deputy Speaker, I know that you are particularly interested in health matters, and we have discussed this issue of generic medicines on a number of occasions. I know your feelings are that the availability of generic medicines is exceptionally important to Australian people. Bearing that in mind, I know that you would want to be associated with the contributions that everyone has made to this debate, but you are unable to make a contribution because you are in the chair.
 (Mr S Georganas)—I thank the member for Shortland for thinking of me.
—As well as making a contribution in savings to government and therefore making medications more readily available, this also provides a saving of approximately $3 for each general prescription to Australians over a period of some 10 years. That is a very significant saving on an individual basis. There is a saving of $1.9 billion to the government and to the individual. I do not think there can be any argument that there is a strong need for generic medicine, and if any barriers were being put in place to stop people accessing generic medicines those barriers should be removed. Delay to generic medicines entering the market also delays their listing with the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, which in turn leads to those costs that I alluded to a moment ago.
This legislation also ensures that all Australians receive the best advice with regard to their essential prescription medication, and the TGA requires pharmaceutical companies to submit a product information document that advises health professions about the medicine.
This legislation will ensure that the correct information is out there, that the consumers of the medication will have the best information, as will doctors. The outcome of the case before the High Court will not be impacted on by this legislation. This legislation takes effect once royal assent is given. This case has received widespread interest throughout the medical community and industry. The generic medicine companies have been watching the case before the court, and they know that any successful infringement of copyright case would mean that suppliers of generic medicines would be unable to provide information substantially similar to that from the originating company’s information. It could prevent generic companies from supplying essential information that must accompany medicines, and therefore prevent them from supplying generic medicines to the Australian market which, in turn, as I have already pointed out, will increase the cost of the medication.
The bill introduces an amendment that specifically relates to certain medicines, and states that there is no infringement of copyright where the supply, reproduction, publishing, communication or adapting of the information is for the purpose related to safety and effectiveness of medicines. So it is covering all bases. It is making sure that information is out there. It is ensuring that Australians can access generic medicines. It ensures that there is a cost saving to consumers, and it also ensures that there is a cost saving to government. I note that the Parliamentary Secretary for Health and Ageing has come into the House. I want to put on record, as I did about you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that she is a person who has made a long-term commitment in this area of therapeutic goods. I think she would be one of the people in this parliament who has the greatest amount of knowledge on this issue, and a person whom I know is committed to ensuring that all Australians can access generic medicines and to ensuring the safety of those medicines. I congratulate the parliamentary secretary on the legislation we have before us today. It is good legislation. It is legislation that will ensure the financial viability of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme.",REPS,<title>THERAPEUTIC GOODS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (COPYRIGHT) BILL 2011</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,45,1
"Thomson, Craig, MP",ALP,2011-03-23,"—I would like to start where the member for Shortland ended off, and also lend my congratulations to the Parliamentary Secretary for Health and Ageing, because this is a great piece of legislation. She has done a great job in bringing it here. This is a good piece of legislation, because not only does it mean that consumers will be much better off and be able to get access to cheaper prescription drugs and so forth; it also means the taxpayer is substantially better off through the savings that come to the government. So the legislation is good all round in terms of what it does. It preserves the integrity of the information that will be provided to consumers, at the same time giving them a considerable saving of around $3, which as we know is not insignificant, particularly to people who are doing it tough in electorates like the electorate of Kingston and my electorate of Dobell as well. These things are very welcome by our constituents in those electorates, as are the not inconsiderable savings that come to the government in making sure we have this legislation in place.
When prescription and higher risk medicines are approved for marketing in Australia by the Therapeutic Goods Administration a document known as ‘product information’ is approved for the use of health professionals. This bill amends the Copyright Act 1968 to ensure the longstanding practice of the TGA of approving product information that is in a similar form for all brands of a registered medicine can continue. These amendments reflect the government’s concern that the important public health objectives of accurate, consistent information for prescribers and consumers might be jeopardised if some pharmaceutical companies claim infringements of copyright in the approved product information of their registered medicines in an attempt to delay market entry of their competitor’s generic versions of those medicines.
While this is only a recently emerging phenomenon, the use of copyright for that purpose has been identified as an issue that needs to be addressed. Product information contains technical information about the medicine, such as the characteristics of the active ingredients, its indications and contraindications, a description of clinical trials that support the indications, precautions, possible adverse reactions, dosages and storage, and other information relating to the medicine’s safe and effective use. Its purpose is to assist medical practitioners, pharmacists and other health professionals to prescribe or dispense the medicine appropriately and safely, and to assist them to provide patient education about the medicine in support of high-quality and safe clinical care. It is critical that doctors and pharmacists receive the same information when prescribing and dispensing all brands of the same medicine. It is therefore the Therapeutic Goods Administration’s practice to approve a text of the product information of a generic medicine that is in a similar form to that approved for the product information of the original medicine. This avoids any perception that differences in the text of the approved product information or the different brands of medicine reflect clinical or pharmacological variations in the medicine itself.
Brand substitution policy was introduced in Australia in 1994 to encourage the use of generic medicines. The policy makes it possible to substitute, where appropriate, the prescribed drug brand at the time of dispensing in the pharmacy. This practice is a vital component of pharmaceutical policy in Australia, as it contributes directly to improved access and affordability of pharmaceuticals to both the government and health consumers. The timely availability of generic medicines is an essential feature of this policy. Any barriers that have the effect of preventing or delaying market entry of new brands of medicine will have significant financial implications both for government and consumers by reducing the effectiveness of further reforms to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme implemented under the National Health Agreement Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme Act 2010.
Under these reforms, the first listing of a generic version of a medicine now triggers a 16 per cent reduction in the price the Commonwealth pays for the medicine. These reforms will provide an estimated $1.9 billion in savings to the government and average savings over 10 years to consumers of $3 per general PBS prescription. These savings will contribute to the sustainability of the scheme and maintain access to quality medicines at a lower cost to the taxpayer. Action by pharmaceutical companies based on a claim of copyright and product information can substantially delay savings to the government and the Australian consumers, because the price reduction trigger of the first listing of a generic version of a listed medicine on the PBS is absent. It can also artificially prolong any market exclusivity that the company might have under the patent law.
Recently, a number of pharmaceutical companies have taken or threatened to take legal action alleging the use by another company of product information approved by the Therapeutic Goods Administration for a generic version of a medicine as an infringement of copyright. In 2008, an interlocutory injunction was granted by the Federal Court to a pharmaceutical company sponsor of a registered medicine partly on the basis of an argument that copyright in the approved product information for the medicine would be infringed by a competitor’s use of the approved product information for a generic version.
In December 2010, in an apparent attempt to avoid the risk of similar litigation, the first generic version of a medicine was marketed without its approved product information being made available. Whilst this is not in breach of any existing requirements under Therapeutic Goods Act, it is not conducive to the quality use of medicines and is not a desirable outcome for public health. If the marketing of this medicine had been prevented by an injunction, the PBS statutory price reduction would not have been triggered. Pharmaceutical companies currently receive appropriate patent protection of their medicines.
A division having been called in the House of Representatives—
Sitting suspended from 12.32 pm to 12.44 pm
—As I was saying before, what a great bill this is in terms of the savings that it will provide to the consumer: $3 per prescription and $1.9 billion to the Australian taxpayer. It is a bill that delivers savings, while still maintaining the safety aspects that are so important when we are dealing with prescription medicine.
Pharmaceutical companies currently receive appropriate patent protection for their medicines under Australian law. Apart from the market exclusivity conferred under the Patents Act, the Therapeutic Goods Act includes measures that require a person applying to register a generic medicine to certify that either they believe, on reasonable grounds, that a patent will not be infringed by the marketing of the medicine or that the relevant patent holder has been notified of the application. Data protection provisions also prevent information provided to the Therapeutic Goods Administration in relation to a medicine containing a new chemical entity from being used to evaluate a generic product for a period of five years from the day on which the medicine was registered.
The government believes these measures safeguard a fair return for the efforts of companies bringing medicines to the market. The use of copyright injunctions to prevent generic medicines being marketed has the potential to provide the patent owners with a substantial additional period of market exclusivity after the patent has expired as a copyright and has a duration of at least 70 years from publication.
The issue, of course, is not unique to Australia. Similar issues have arisen in the United States in relation to the Federal Drug Administration’s same labelling requirements for medicines under amendments to the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act. These amendments were designed to facilitate the introduction of generic competitors once the originator’s drug patent term and exclusivity period ended by allowing the generic producers to piggy-back upon the originator’s successful FDA application. The same labelling requirement was upheld by the second circuit in the United States Court of Appeal in 2000 in the SmithKline Beecham consumer health care case in which the court commented that the purpose of the amendments would be severely undermined if copyright concerns were to shape the FDA’s application of the requirements. The court found, as a consequence, that the same labelling requirements prevail over copyright laws.
I will now turn to some of the amendments more specifically. The bill will insert a new section 44BA into the Copyright Act 1968. The effect will be that actions under the Therapeutic Goods Act for the purpose of approving product information for prescription and other higher risk medicines or of approving variations to approved product information will not be an infringement of copyright substituting in any product information previously approved by the Therapeutic Goods Administration. This will ensure, first, that an applicant for the registration of a generic version of a registered medicine will not infringe copyright if it provides a draft product information document that contains text similar to the product information already approved for that medicine. This exemption would apply irrespective of when the product information was approved—that is, whether it was approved before or after the amendments came into effect.
Second, the supply, reproduction, publication, communication or adaptation of any approved product information of a registered medicine will not be an infringement of copyright in any other approved product information where such an act is done for a purpose related to the safe and effective use of the medicine concerned. This exemption would apply to such acts, irrespective of when the product information was approved. It would cover, for instance, acts of the Commonwealth, including by the Therapeutic Goods Administration, pharmaceutical companies, health care professionals and all of those involved in making product information available to health professionals. The infringement exemption will only apply to acts done after the commencement of the amendments. The bill includes a so-called historic shipwreck’s clause which ensures that if the amendments would result in the acquisition of property from a person otherwise than on just terms, the Commonwealth must pay reasonable compensation to that person. This provision has been included as a precautionary measure to ensure constitutional validity and does not indicate that such a result is likely.
Exempting particular acts from infringements under the Copyright Act is not done lightly. The proposed amendments reflect the importance the government places on ensuring the highest level of health consumer safety through the provisions of accurate information to prescribers and other health professionals about high risk medicines. The only other exemption of this kind in the Copyright Act relates to the use of approved labels on containers for agricultural and veterinary chemical products.
The amendments go no further than is necessary to ensure that the TGA can continue to approve product information that is in a similar form for all versions of the same registered medicine. The government believes that these amendments will restore the appropriate balance between ensuring safe and timely access to medicines for all Australians and encouraging research and development in the pharmaceutical industry through appropriate protection of intellectual property.
These amendments will restore the appropriate balance between ensuring the safe and timely access of medicines to all Australians and encourage research and development. They have a real effect on the costs of medicines for ordinary Australians, reducing the cost on average by $3 per prescription, and saving the Australian Commonwealth government $1.9 billion dollars.
This is an important bill. It is an important reform in relation to these areas to make sure that generic medicines get out onto the shelves and are able to be used in a safe manner as quickly as possible, and providing those savings to consumers and to the Australian government. For those reasons I commend the bill to the House.",REPS,<title>THERAPEUTIC GOODS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (COPYRIGHT) BILL 2011</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,45,1
"King, Catherine, MP",ALP,2011-03-23,"—in reply—I thank members for their contributions. I think we had contributions from the members for Boothby, Bennelong, Parramatta, Blair, Shortland and latterly the member for Dobell. I thank them for their interest in this important piece of legislation.
I particularly want to thank the member for Boothby for his support of the bill and very much appreciate the opposition’s bipartisan support for these measures. I am glad to see that there is such bipartisan support for the need for Australians to have access to the same product information for whichever brand of prescription medication they are taking. I recognise that the member for Boothby, in his contribution, also highlighted some concerns, including the impacts of the proposed amendments on organisations such as MIMS, which makes product information available to doctors and to health care professionals. I assure the member for Boothby that the amendments will ensure that MIMS and other such organisations can continue to provide that product information without fear of copyright action being taken by the pharmaceutical company, as the exemptions in the amendments extend to any publication for the purposes of safe and effective use of medicines, which of course extends to the publication of MIMS.
I thank the member for Bennelong for supporting the bill. He also raised a query in his contribution around when generic medicines are entering the market in Australia. In response to that I reiterate that the TGA cannot include a generic medicine on the register of therapeutic goods unless the generic company has certified that it will not be marketing the medicine in breach of patent and has notified the patent holder. The originator company can take injunction action if they think their patent has been breached by early introduction of a generic medicine which the patent still exists on.
The member for Bennelong also raised the significance of the pharmaceutical industry in Australia and I would also like to add my words to that, in that the government fully understands the significance of the industry in our country. As Minister Carr outlined quite eloquently in his recent address to Medicines Australia, the government recognises the enormous contribution made by the industry.
Broadly, as the member for Shortland outlined, the pharmaceutical industry is of extreme importance in Australia. It contributes significantly to our economy and provides the innovation necessary for Australians to continue to have access to new and important treatments for their health concerns. The Australian government is committed to ensuring access to new treatments as well as timely access to generic versions of prescription medications once the patent has expired.
The bill, as many members have outlined, is a response to an emerging phenomenon in the Australian pharmaceutical industry. Some companies are taking, or have threatened to take, legal action based on a claim of copyright in the product information of their registered medicines in what appears to be an attempt to delay market access by competitors’ generic versions of those medicines. Members will appreciate the potential for this, if it were to become a practice, to result in substantial detriment to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and to Australian health consumers.
Copyright is relevant in this situation because of the important practice of TGA to approve for generic versions of high-risk medicines when they are supplied on the Australian market a product information document in a similar form to the approved product information supplied with the original prescription medicine. This practice has developed for public health reasons. Product information contains critical information about the safe and effective use of medicines and is made available to health professionals to guide their prescribing, dispensing and administrating decisions. The practice of requiring similar product information for all brands of a medicine ensures that health professionals receive this same information about the same medicine, irrespective of the brand. Variation in text between different brands of the same medicine might give the impression that there are clinical and/or pharmacological differences between the brands. This may result in confusion amongst prescribers and consumers, with potential for resultant medical errors and patient harm.
No issue of copyright has arisen from this longstanding practice until just recently. In 2008 the Federal Court granted an interlocutory injunction, in effect preventing the market of a generic version of a registered medicine partly on the basis of an alleged infringement of copyright in approved product information. That matter is due to be heard by the Federal Court this month and will be the first time that an Australian court has considered the issue. Legal action of this kind has the potential to delay or prevent the first listing of a generic version of a medicine on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, thus deferring what is now a 16 per cent statutory price reduction for that medicine under the scheme. This could result in a significant financial cost to the government and Australian health consumers under the scheme and subsequently to the Australian taxpayer.
The amendments in the bill are necessary to ensure that the long-supported and sound public health policy of having consistent, accurate information available for prescribers and consumers is not jeopardised. They provide limited exemptions to copyright infringement, but only for the purpose of approving product information or its later variation or where it is related to the use of approved product information for a purpose related to the safe and effective use of the medicine concerned. Action by companies raised on a claim of copyright in product information can delay, potentially indefinitely, savings to the government and Australian consumers because the price trigger of the first listing of a generic version of a listed medicine on the PBS will not occur. It can also artificially prolong any market exclusivity that the originator may have had through patent law.
Pharmaceutical companies currently receive appropriate patent protection for their medicines under Australian law. A generic medicine cannot be included on the Australian register of therapeutic goods unless the applicant has certified that a patent will not be infringed by the marketing of the medicine or that the relevant patent holder has been notified of the application. The Therapeutic Goods Administration is prevented from using information provided for the purpose of registering a medicine in order to evaluate the generic version of that medicine for five years from that registration. The government believes that these measures safeguard a fair return for the efforts of companies bringing medicines to market.
The proposed amendments reflect the importance the government places on ensuring the highest level of health consumer safety through the provision of accurate information to prescribers and other health professionals about these medicines. The Copyright Act already contains an exemption of this kind relating to the use of approved labels on containers for agricultural and veterinary chemical products. The amendments go no further than is necessary to ensure that the TGA can continue to approve product information that is in a similar form for all versions of the same registered medicine. The government believes that these amendments will restore the appropriate balance between ensuring safe and timely access to medicines for all Australians and encouraging research and development in the pharmaceutical industry for appropriate protection of intellectual property.
At the end of my contribution I want thank both the TGA and the Attorney-General’s Departments, whose staff are with us at the moment, for their work on this bill. It is a very important piece of legislation and I want to thank both of those agencies for their cooperation.
Question agreed to.

"Andrews, Kevin, MP",LP,2011-03-23,"—I rise to speak on the Human Services Legislation Amendment Bill 2010. The government’s bill further merges the back-end support services and some customer areas for Medicare and Centrelink, locating both within the Department of Human Services. Essentially the bill will achieve its objectives by amending the Medicare Australia Act 1973 and the Commonwealth Services Delivery Agency Act 1997, commonly referred to as the Centrelink act, and, through these amendments, firstly, abolishing the statutory offices of Chief Executive Officer of Medicare Australia and Chief Executive Officer of Centrelink; secondly, creating the statutory offices of Chief Executive Medicare and Chief Executive Centrelink within the department; thirdly, abolishing Medicare Australia and Centrelink as statutory agencies; fourthly, providing for service related functions currently delivered by Medicare Australia and Centrelink in support of their chief executives to be delivered by employees of the Department of Human Services; and, finally, providing for new functions taken on by the Chief Executive Medicare and the Chief Executive Centrelink in the future to be delivered by employees of the Department of Human Services.
Under existing arrangements, Centrelink and Medicare services are delivered from different access points, although there has been a gradual integration of back-end services between Medicare and Centrelink in order to improve service efficiency. The amendments that would result from the successful passage of this bill would, firstly, bring in new defined terms of ‘Medicare programs’ and ‘Centrelink programs’ to replace the current secrecy provisions’ focus on agencies as the basis for regulating information sharing; and, secondly, clarify that, if more than one secrecy provision applies to the same information and any applicable secrecy provision permits the use, disclosure or recording of the information, the use, disclosure or recording is taken to be consistent with all of the applicable secrecy provisions. The bill does not amend the Privacy Act.
The bill also amends the Child Support (Registration and Collection) Act 1988 to align the provisions for the appointment of the Child Support Registrar with the provisions of the appointment of the Chief Executive Centrelink and the Chief Executive Medicare and makes consequential amendments to a number of other acts that currently refer to the agencies or statutory authorities which will be abolished.
The amendments to formalise this new structure will be implemented from 1 July 2011. Transitional arrangements will be put in place to ensure that no disruption in customer service delivery occurs as a result of these changes.
The bill also amends investigative search and seizure provisions of part IID of the Medicare Australia Act. Many of the provisions in this part were modelled on earlier versions of the corresponding provisions in the Crimes Act 1914. Because there have been amendments to the Crimes Act over time, some of these provisions in the Medicare Australia Act are no longer aligned with the Crimes Act provisions. The main purpose of the proposed amendments is to bring these provisions into closer alignment with the Crimes Act provisions.
The issue of privacy was also raised in the course of the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee inquiry into this legislation. The bill also brings in amendments to clarify the operation of program secrecy provisions after the restructure to ensure these provisions operate in substantially the same way as they did prior to the restructure to protect against the sharing of customer data without customer consent. By integrating the portfolio into a single department of state, these reforms should increase efficiency and reduce the cost of service delivery, as well as increasing convenience for customers, who will be able to access both Centrelink and Medicare services in co-located offices as these are progressively rolled out.
Equitable, efficient and effective service delivery has always been a priority for the coalition. As a supporter of small government, streamlining operations and agencies into a single department is desirable. The merger of Centrelink and Medicare Australia will ultimately, hopefully, make it easier for clients of these agencies—that is, make it easier for ordinary Australians—to access the services they need and interface with the government in a more efficient and straightforward way.
I acknowledge the government’s proposed amendments to the bill, which at first glance appear to address some of the concerns raised by the Senate inquiry. Having received a briefing from departmental officials earlier today, I appreciate that briefing and the purport of the amendments. Whilst the coalition reserve their view pending any further advice we may receive about the amendments, it is not our intention to oppose the bill.",REPS,<title>HUMAN SERVICES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,46,1
"Jones, Stephen, MP",ALP,2011-03-23,"—I wish to speak today about the Gillard government’s reform agenda and, in particular, the important reforms to government service delivery that are set out in this bill, the Human Services Legislation Amendment Bill 2010. As a result of the passage of this bill, Medicare Australia and Centrelink will be integrated into the Department of Human Services as a single agency under the leadership of the Human Services secretary. A further consequence of these machinery of government changes is that the staff of Medicare Australia and Centrelink will be moved to the Department of Human Services. While currently Medicare Australia, Centrelink and the Department of Human Services work together very closely and in some respects share functions, further efficiencies can be achieved if they are combined as a single FMA agency under the leadership of the Human Services secretary. All staff from Medicare Australia and Centrelink will be moved to the Department of Human Services.
The Medicare Australia brand will not change. Medicare has provided Australia with affordable, accessible and high-quality health care since 1984. The integration of agencies will further extend the reach of the widely recognised—and, I might say, widely trusted—Medicare brand in the community. For example, through the co-location of services the number of shopfronts where Medicare services are available will more than double, from 240 today to around 500 when the plan is fully implemented. The creation of new statutory offices of Chief Executive Medicare and Chief Executive Centrelink will ensure that statutory decisions under program legislation, which are made on behalf of ministers and secretaries of other departments, will continue to be made under similar arrangements as currently apply, providing much needed continuity of service.
Can I address briefly the issue of data and data privacy. All of these agencies collect enormous amounts of data in the performance of their functions. The government is conscious of the need to protect customer data and therefore only existing customer data sharing arrangements supported by legislation will continue. Importantly, any new sharing of customer data within the integrated Department of Human Services will only occur with customer consent. The government is particularly aware of the trust that Australians place in Medicare Australia’s management of their clinical health information and the need for this information to be held separately and securely. For this reason, clinical health information will be excluded from any data sharing under the service delivery reforms.
The bill is an essential component of the government’s service delivery reform agenda. Service delivery reform will transform the delivery of services in the Human Services portfolio and will provide better outcomes for generations of Australians. If the objective of this package of reforms can be summarised, in a nutshell it is all about putting the customer at the centre of service delivery objectives. It will put customers first in the design and delivery of services and it will ensure services are delivered more efficiently and more effectively, especially to people who need more intensive support and those with complex needs.
The integration of Centrelink, Medicare Australia and the Department of Human Services is a significant step in achieving this vision. It will not only drive efficiencies and reduce the cost of service delivery for government but also transform the delivery of services provided through the Human Services portfolio and provide better outcomes for generations of Australians, as I said.
As the former national secretary of a union that represents the vast majority of the workers who will be affected by these changes I know from firsthand experience that a significant change like this does not happen without the application of considerable time and energy from the public servants affected and their elected union representatives. I have a deal of sympathy for the public servants in Commonwealth agencies who are not change-averse but who have to juggle significant changes such as this along with the constant program changes that quite properly come from us in this place, together with the day-to-day obligations of delivering services to their clients.
The median length of service for our public servants today is now eight years. About 20 per cent of public servants have been in Commonwealth employment for 20 years or more, a significant change over the last two decades. This means that, if you have a career in the Public Service, by around the eight-year mark you have usually seen off a variety of ministers, governments and secretaries, and experienced everything that we can dream up in the period of our tenure, including bringing agencies and sections together and then splitting them up and putting them back together again. I hope that the changes that will be brought about by this bill and this package of reforms will drive a new direction in the delivery of human services, because it is much needed.
Machinery-of-government changes can almost become a way of life for Australian Public Service employees. That is why, when considering reforms to government service delivery, it is important to keep in mind those people who are at the forefront of the provision of these services—that is, the public servants who interact with the public on behalf of the government every day of their working lives. It is not an easy job. These government employees are often the target of people’s anger and frustration at government policy, or their expectations of what government policy should deliver, when it does not provide the outcomes that they are seeking. I understand that dealing with government can be a difficult process. That is why all moves towards making this interaction easier, simpler and more controlled by the persons affected will be a good thing.
When talking about the co-location of Centrelink and Medicare offices, it is important to note that Centrelink workers frequently have to deal with customer aggression. I know that the employees who work there feel very strongly about the importance of delivering services to their customers but, equally, feel very strongly about their rights as employees to work in workplaces that are free from actual threats to their health and safety as employees. With the amalgamation of Centrelink and Medicare offices, there will be an even greater need to closely monitor the interaction of these difficult customers with other customers and for the organisation to be ready to take protective steps if required. This is in the interests of not only the employees of these agencies but also the customers who come there, quite rightly seeking the assistance that the government provides. They have a reasonable expectation of being able to do that in an environment free from any threat or perceived threat.
The service delivery reforms that are contained in this bill are a part of the overall public sector reforms that the Australian government has been embarking on for a number of years now. They are well overdue. These reforms have been a part of bipartisan efforts in Australia and are part of a broader international evolution of government service delivery, which is also known in some places as e-government. E-government is about using developments in information technology to enable governments and their citizens to interact more easily. The aims of e-government are to drive efficiency in service delivery provision and to use information technology to improve the quality and range of service delivery. I think everyone who deals with government departments and agencies would welcome these changes. They recognise the changing nature of the people who are relying upon or interacting with government departments on a daily basis.
The important measures contained in the Human Services Legislation Amendment Bill that we are debating today are but a small part of the important service delivery reforms that the Gillard Labor government is committed to in order to transform the delivery of public services. The aim of the measures of this bill is to put the Australian people first in the design and delivery of services and to ensure that services are delivered effectively and efficiently. Indeed, these should be the aims of all Australian governments. I commend the bill to the House.",REPS,<title>HUMAN SERVICES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,46,1
"Neumann, Shayne, MP",ALP,2011-03-23,"—I speak in support of the Human Services Legislation Amendment Bill 2010. I will address the bill briefly and then express my praise for Centrelink for its wonderful support in South-East Queensland and particularly in my electorate of Blair during the recent flood crisis. This is an appropriate opportunity to do so. This bill integrates Centrelink and Medicare Australia into the Department of Human Services from 1 July 2011; it establishes new statutory provisions and positions, particularly the Chief Executive Medicare and the Chief Executive Centrelink, within the department; and it correlates with what we are saying about efficient and effective service delivery. Centrelink and Medicare are organisations that deal with the lives of working Australian families, pensioners and other people across the length and breadth of our country, day in and day out, week in and week out and year in and year out.
With this legislation and our aspirations, all staff from Medicare Australia and Centrelink will be moved to the department. We know how important Medicare is. We in the Australian Labor Party were the architects and authors of Medicare; we believe in it. Those opposite have a transient and temporary commitment to it. From time to time they say they support it and yet, when in office, we know that they do not. Secretly, in their heart of hearts, those opposite do not believe in the concept of Medicare, and their brothers and sisters in Tea Party mode across the Pacific clearly show that they do not believe that the kind of health services we have in Australia should be present in the United States.
The brand ‘Medicare Australia’ is really held in high esteem by the Australian public. It has been part of delivering quality healthcare services in this country for more than 2½ decades. Co-locating the services in one position is the aspiration by 2014 and I think that makes tremendous sense. Australians across the country will value a single location for both Medicare and Centrelink. We are aware of the trust that Australians have in Medicare and we think that is important for primary health care and clinical health information. The giving of advice by social workers, assistance, financial counselling and the delivery of services, advice and assistance in getting back into the workplace—and, when one leaves the workplace, transitioning to a pension and retirement lifestyle—are really important. So, from those who receive the baby bonus to those who go on the age pension, and those somewhere in between who suffer from disabilities, pension requirements and the need to transition back into the workplace, Centrelink is their place. The integration is a significant commitment from the government to look at how we can drive efficiencies and make the system and the delivery of government services even better.
I note the minister is here in the chamber today and I want to thank her for the commitment she showed during the recent flood crisis. I point out that the Centrelink office in Ipswich did a tremendous job during the flood crisis. I also want to make mention of the government’s social inclusion agenda and our national compact with what is often called these days the third sector—the not-for-profit sector. We are seeing this in Ipswich. I was with the then Parliamentary Secretary for Social Inclusion and the Voluntary Sector, Senator Ursula Stephens, along with government representatives, employment service providers and not-for-profit organisations, when we announced on 4 May 2010 the community links initiative, a wraparound service. It is a new approach and it has been trialling well in Ipswich, ensuring that people do not have to go from one service provider to another. They go to Centrelink, where other service providers are present and co-located. So I am a big believer in co-location. That is why I am so happy to see our vision and aspiration that Medicare will also be co-located with Centrelink.
My electorate covers most of Ipswich and the Somerset region, including the Brisbane Valley. Located there are the Lockyer Creek, the Bremer River, the Brisbane River, the Somerset Dam and the Wivenhoe Dam. At the height of the floods, it really was an area of terrible devastation. Businesses were destroyed, homes inundated and lives tragically lost in my seat. The superintendent of St John’s Ambulance in Ipswich, Robyn Rossi, said she treated 700 people at the evacuation centre at the Ipswich showgrounds during the flood crisis there. Doctors from the GP superclinics came across. People went to the GP superclinic next door and they went to other evacuation centres in places like Riverview. At the height of the flood crisis the minister responded to my entreaties and Centrelink did a fantastic job in my electorate.
We had over 60 staff in Ipswich recovery centres—places like the Ipswich showgrounds, Bundamba, Riverview, Karalee, Esk, Fernvale, Lowood, Wivenhoe Pocket, One Mile and Rosewood—as some of the more than 300 Centrelink staff who assisted in the recovery across South-East Queensland. That is the important role that Centrelink plays at the front line, helping people—just like Medicare does. Centrelink does as well, and I believe it is a fantastic organisation. Centrelink’s ability to nationally mobilise during these disasters is crucial to the people of Australia when they are in distress. In times of crisis, in times of property loss, in times of injury and indeed in times of death, Centrelink is there for the Australian people. The floods occurred in January on that Tuesday night, and by Sunday 300 staff, many from interstate, were already located in the area. Some of them stayed in Ipswich. Centrelink staff were there. Some people were on the Gold Coast and some were in Brisbane, but they came to help.
To date Centrelink has processed over 664,000 claims for the Australian government disaster recovery payment relating to the Queensland floods, paying about $715.1 million, according to the minister’s office. They processed 72,000 claims for the DIRS relating to the Queensland floods, totalling over $54.9 million. I want to make mention of a couple of people in Centrelink in Ipswich who did a fantastic job during the flood crisis. It has to be remembered that Centrelink staff who lived locally were cut off as well. People in my electorate will understand when I say my whole world for days revolved between Yamanto in the west and Riverview in the east. We could not get across the Bremer River because it was flooded, and Centrelink staff were cut off as well. But when they were there they galvanised and worked hard together. They came as quickly as they could and people were flown in from interstate as well.
Tony Perera is the Centrelink manager for the Ipswich region. I have the utmost respect and admiration for the work he did. That is how important Centrelink was in helping the people of Ipswich. He, along with Jenny Wright, the team leader of Local Connections to Work at Ipswich Centrelink did a fantastic job in the flood crisis. Tony was always there. If I needed some advice and some help, he responded with the flexibility of a ruck rover. I say that even though I am from Queensland and it is rugby league state. But he was everywhere. He was all over the place. Tony was everywhere. He could move and manipulate people everywhere. That is how great Centrelink were.
Trevor Romer was the leader of what I call the ‘green shirt brigade’. Everywhere I went I saw these community recovery T-shirts, and people respected them. People really respect Centrelink in my electorate because those green shirts, evacuation centres and recovery centres offered not just money but hope. They were there with their iPads, phones and laptops and automatically—just like that!—much-needed money was given out to people in need. So many people lost everything, and Centrelink were there to help. Trevor, as I said, is not from interstate, but he made the comment that he was very impressed with what was in place locally and the community effort that was taking place. Trevor told me he could walk into any group and it was clear that Tony was doing an exceptional job locally building networks and forging good relationships with stakeholders.
Tony Perera is on the Ipswich human and social subgroup committee, which consists of representatives from state, local and federal government levels in addition to local NGOs. I want to make a comment about what Centrelink did and what Tony has done, in particular. That committee was formed for the next phase of community recovery, and Tony had people working all over the place. When I rang up to Tony and told him that people in Wivenhoe Pocket were cut off at both ends, he got staff straight in there to help. He got staff doorknocking in places like Esk to see what people needed. Places like the Esk caravan park were just devastated as the Redbank Creek came in.
We provided things like a Blair floods information kit. We ran it by Tony, and we were handing these out all over the place. He and Centrelink also worked well with the federally funded Ipswich business enterprise centre for the flood disaster relief and recovery manual that was produced. Centrelink worked hand in glove with the Ipswich business community, including the Ipswich Chamber of Commerce, the Ipswich business enterprise centre, the Ipswich City Council and what we know as DEEDI in Queensland, which is the Queensland government’s Department of Employment, Economic Development and Innovation.
Centrelink were very flexible. They worked hard. They networked with people. They gave them whatever they needed. We know how important this was for the people in our area because Ipswich Mayor Paul Pisasale said this in a letter on 1 February 2011:
We understand that between 500 and 750 businesses were directly affected by flood inundation in the Ipswich region alone. Up to 1,000 businesses have been indirectly affected.
Only 60 per cent of those businesses are back on track, but Centrelink was there to help those workers who had lost their jobs with money, business advice and also advice for those people who did not know how to start picking things up. I remember speaking to a Centrelink worker in the Lowood neighbourhood hub. I remember her talking to me about the challenges and travails of the farmers in that community. She told me, with tears in her eyes, about how stoic and resilient the farmers were there and how you had to talk to them for 15 or 20 minutes before they started opening up. But that Centrelink social worker was there to listen, to give advice and to be a shoulder to cry on. That is the importance of Centrelink in times of crisis. She was there to give them advice, because we have the money on the table through low-interest loans and other funding that will help those farmers and those small business operators that Mayor Paul Pisasale talks about to recover, clean up and get back on their feet.
In the Somerset region, which is a rural area to the north in my electorate, the Ipswich business enterprise centre estimates that about 450 businesses were affected, and another 100 indirectly. The Ipswich business enterprise centre was there to work with the Somerset Region Business Alliance and Centrelink to help out. It was a partnership, with communities working together and all levels of government working together. I want to thank them very much for the work they did in that regard.
I think it is important for me to put on record that those staff members in the Ipswich Centrelink office went way beyond their normal duties helping those people who were flood affected. Tony has stated that this shows the level of commitment employed in human services. He said:
People who choose a career in human services are people who are not just looking for a pay cheque—they have a level commitment that is quite exceptional.
He also said that it was not just Centrelink staff that pulled together during the floods. He mentioned a number of Medicare employees working alongside them as well. I want to finish by saying that I cannot stress how important Centrelink is at the coalface of assistance to people—social work, financial advice, a shoulder to cry on, money in the bank and help when it is needed. Co-locating Medicare and Centrelink together will facilitate better service delivery and make sure people in communities like mine in Ipswich and the Somerset region when they need it get the hand they need—not a handout—to lift them up and help them get through this very difficult time.",REPS,<title>HUMAN SERVICES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,46,1
"Plibersek, Tanya, MP",ALP,2011-03-23,"—I want to thank the member for Blair for his acknowledgement of the fine work that the staff of the Department of Human Services did in response to the floods. He has, I know, got a very good relationship with his local Centrelink office and workers but he makes a very important point. It relates to this Human Services Legislation Amendment Bill 2010. There were Centrelink staff coming from around the country, there were Medicare staff there, there were staff from other parts of the Department of Human Services, there were even staff from the ATO and others that came to help on the phones to answer calls from people who were affected by the natural disasters in Queensland and in other parts of Australia.
One of the very important reasons for this legislation that we have been debating is to make that ability for staff to be moved to where the need is greatest much easier and more streamlined. I want to thank the member particularly, though, for taking the time to acknowledge the enormous effort of those people who came from across Australia, and the people who were already in Queensland—many of whom, as the member for Blair said, were flood affected themselves in their own homes and in their families. To acknowledge their work is very worth while.
I have heard a lot of terrific stories from those people who were wearing the green T-shirts about the way they were received by Queenslanders in particular who were stopping in the street to congratulate them on their work. One story included one of the green shirts going to the supermarket to buy cold drinks for people who were working in the heat and humidity at one of the recovery centres. The green shirt did not have quite enough money to buy the number of drinks that she wanted and the young woman working on the supermarket checkout said, ‘You take that drink, I’ll pay for that out of my pocket.’ She insisted on showing her support and her thanks for the work of Centrelink and other Human Services staff who worked so hard in the recovery.
I also want to take a moment to thank the shadow minister for his support for this legislation. This bill is a very important bill and relates to the reform of government service delivery. The whole purpose of the legislation is to deliver better services for Australians. The bill continues a broader program of reform that commenced in 2004 when the Department of Human Services was first created to place greater emphasis on the way government delivers services to Australians. The continued reform of service delivery will make life easier for Australians and will lead to improved policy outcomes for government, particularly in areas like economic and social participation, education, child care and health.
There are a number of customer benefits that will come from this integration including a most recent example of being able to claim Medicare rebates online, but also things like extending services by co-locating more Medicare Australia, Centrelink and Child Support Agency services under one roof, offering more one-stop-shop services whether in those shopfronts, over the phone or online. The collocation of offices will make it easier for people to access Medicare Australia and Centrelink services by offering them from one location, under one roof. The collocation program extends the reach of the Medicare program by more than doubling the number of offices where face-to-face Medicare services will be available—from 240 today to around 500. Already we are seeing the difference in collocated offices, where staff can help customers and then refer them directly to a colleague from another agency. Through broader service delivery reform improvements, people will have the ability to update some of their personal details across the portfolio—if they choose to have their information shared across the portfolio—through a tell-us-once approach. That means if you change your address or your income details, for example, you can tell the department once and your records will be updated in a number of different places—if you agree. This will save people having to contact multiple agencies for the same purpose.
Maintaining customer privacy is a key focus as we merge the portfolio into a single department. Information will only be shared where that sharing is authorised by law or where the customer consents. Customer databases will not be merged. There will continue to be separate databases, although those databases will be able to talk to each other. Clinical health information is excluded from service delivery reform—that is a specific exclusion. The current program secrecy provisions, which apply strict rules about the handling of customer information, will continue to apply. The Privacy Act will also apply to protect customer information. My department continues to work closely with the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner about the impact of these reforms.
Service delivery reform will free up staff to provide better support and assistance to the people who need it. It will provide them with improved career opportunities and more diverse work. Front-line service delivery networks will be brought together into a single integrated customer-facing network. Staff will receive more training, have the tools to deliver better services and be able to deliver tailored services at a local level. My portfolio is working closely with the Australian Public Service Commission, the Community and Public Sector Union and other relevant unions to prepare for the new enterprise agreement which is being developed for the integrated portfolio. The integration of Medicare Australia and Centrelink into the Department of Human Services will not only improve services to customers and assist staff to provide better outcomes for customers, but also provide efficiencies and better services for lower cost. The government is proud of this significant reform which will deliver significant benefits for all Australians.

Since the Human Services Legislation Amendment Bill 2010 was introduced to parliament last November, the government has decided that amendments are necessary to clarify the impact of certain provisions in the bill. The amendments I now move cover four main aspects.
First, the amendments modify the multiple secrecy provisions introduced by the bill. Currently, where a person is a customer of both Centrelink and Medicare Australia, those agencies hold common information about that person, such as their date of birth, name and address. After the integration of Centrelink and Medicare into the Department of Human Services, the department will therefore hold this common customer data in more than one program. Because different secrecy provisions apply to the information depending on whether it was provided to Medicare Australia or to Centrelink, the new multiple secrecy provisions are needed to clarify how the secrecy provisions should be applied in this circumstance. The bill makes it clear that, post-integration, where the department holds the same piece of information about a person under more than one program act, such as Family Assistance and Medicare, that information will be able to be used and disclosed if it complies with one of the secrecy provisions applicable to that information. The amendments do not substantively change the effect of the new provisions; rather, they seek to make them clearer to ensure that the bill will operate as intended.
Second, the amendments make additional changes to the secrecy provisions of social security law, family assistance law, the Paid Parental Leave Act 2010 and the Student Assistance Act 1973. This will ensure that the existing arrangements for the use of customer information collected under these laws will continue to apply after the integration of Centrelink into the Department of Human Services. Importantly, customer privacy is protected because the amendments make no change to the existing arrangements.
Third, the amendments introduce new items to the bill to ensure that customers can consent to information about them being used for a purpose that would not otherwise be authorised by the act under which the information was obtained. These amendments support the government’s service delivery reform agenda by giving customers the right to choose how information about them is handled. The amendments allow the customer to choose to make their basic details, such as name, address and date of birth, available to multiple agencies rather than providing the same information separately to different agencies.
Fourth, the amendments remove transitional provisions relating to the continuation of certain agreements between Medicare Australia and Centrelink as delivery agencies and the departments responsible for the administration of programs. These transitional provisions are unnecessary, as the agreements will be continued by exchange of correspondence between departmental secretaries. These amendments do not alter the impact of the bill, which integrates Medicare Australia and Centrelink into a single Department of Human Services.

"Frydenberg, Josh, MP",LP,2011-03-23,"—I rise today to speak on the condolence motion and express my sympathy with the Japanese people after the tragedy of the recent earthquake and tsunami. Like many in this place, I will forever have etched in my memory the vivid pictures of those massive black waves devouring everything in their way: ships, houses, factories and fields. For a moment it seemed biblical in its proportions.
Measuring 9.0 on the Richter scale, the earthquake was the biggest ever to hit Japan and the fifth largest on record—the largest being a 9.5 quake in 1960 in Chile that left more than two million people homeless. Today the numbers in Japan tell a devastating human story. In a country of 127 million, 22,000 people have been killed or are missing, tens of thousands of homes have been destroyed and hundreds of thousands have found themselves homeless. Many have no access to fresh water, food, power or, importantly as winter hits, heating. The humanitarian challenge is severe. With aftershocks continuing to cause fear, problems in the recovery stage have been compounded by the failures at the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear power plant and predictions of heightened radiation levels in the area. Fortunately, the latest reports indicate that engineers have been able to reconnect all six reactors to the electricity grid. Let us hope the situation stabilises with minimum damage.
Significantly, the world responded to the Japanese disaster quickly, effectively and with overwhelming support. More than 80 countries have sent emergency aid workers, and the Americans have sent a significant commitment of military personnel. Australia too played its part, sending search and rescue teams and sniffer dogs and just yesterday committing two additional RAAF C17 transport planes, which will transport American supplied water cannon systems. These C17s will give the C17 already in Japan additional support.
Australia’s contribution reflects our deep and significant bilateral relationship. Australia has no better friend in Asia than Japan and our relationship extends through the political, security and economic spheres. For decades Japan has been Australia’s No. 1 export market and our people-to-people links are particularly strong. Only months ago my wife and I spent our honeymoon in Tokyo, Hiroshima, Kyoto and elsewhere, exposed to the beauty, the history and the rich culture of Japan and its people. The Japanese are a resilient people who have survived recent tragedies like the Kobe earthquake in 1995, and each time have rebounded with vigour. Japan has the economic capacity and the strong social fabric that is required in times like these. And at trying times like these, we in Australia stand with our friends in Japan shoulder to shoulder for the task ahead. We grieve for the dead, we pray for the missing, and we stand ready to assist the injured. May peace and prosperity be with the people of Japan.",REPS,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,<title>Japan Disaster</title>,Condolences,48,1
"Ciobo, Steven, MP",LP,2011-03-23,"—I had the privilege some years ago of going to Japan as part of an Australian political exchange program with a number of young political leaders from Australia. What I learned as part of that, my only trip to Japan so far, was just how proud the Japanese people are, how warm they are and also—and this was my particular insight—how at peace the Japanese are. I found, through having the opportunity to travel to Tokyo and other locations such as Kyoto, that the Japanese have not entirely uniquely, but certainly in a large way, the ability to find sanctity and personal sanctum in their surrounds. There is a very strong physical and spiritual connection that I observed between the Japanese and the natural environment around them. And so whether it is the bright neon lights and the absolute hustle of a Western city in many respects, like Tokyo, or the Zen gardens in beautiful cities like Kyoto, there is no doubt that the Japanese understand Mother Nature and its interaction with them as a people.
With that in mind, I rise to speak to the condolence motion, to express empathy, sympathy and heartfelt sincerity towards the Japanese people over what they have endured over the past few days and what they will be enduring for many years yet. The twin earthquake and tsunami is without dispute Japan’s worst crisis since World War II. To see entire communities literally swept away along Japan’s north-east coast as a consequence of the absolutely horrific tsunami that followed the level-9 earthquake, we know now in the aftermath that there are some 24,000 people listed as being dead or missing. The National Police Agency said today that 9,408 people have been confirmed dead.
So, as that gruesome task plays out in Japan, we here in Australia extend our hand of friendship and express, we hope, some sense of peace to the people of Japan, knowing that, although we are not enduring what they are, we do have an understanding of and sympathy for what they face.
This year, 2011, has been an extraordinary one. In our own country we have faced natural disasters. We have seen them in our near neighbour New Zealand. And now we see what is taking place in Japan. All of us understand the vital importance that flows from a strong societal fabric. All of us understand the strength that is garnered by being able to walk alongside friends and loved ones and know that this collective strength helps people to overcome adversity and challenge when everything before them—every sense that they can reach into, every sight they see, every smell they smell and every sound they hear—indicates that there is just so much tumult. In that sense, I rise on behalf of the community I have the privilege of representing to say to the Japanese that we have for many years enjoyed strong support and friendship and we as friends would like to be there now for Japan.
Australia as a nation has done what it can and what has been requested of it insofar as providing support for Japanese authorities with respect to search and rescue teams and the use of sniffer dogs for the gruesome task of recovering those who are deceased, and through the supply of military hardware such as C17 aircraft.
In my city of the Gold Coast, I dare say perhaps one of the better known Australian locations for Japanese tourists and in particular Japanese honeymooners, I know that there is a very strongly felt appreciation of just how significant this adversity is following the quake and tsunami. We know firsthand, although not at this scale, that it will take years for Japan to truly overcome the sheer size of this tsunami and earthquake.
The compounding factor in all of this has been the leaking of radiation from the Fukushima plant. Although we are literally tens of thousands of kilometres away, we look on with pride at those men and women who have literally put themselves in harm’s way to do what they can both to cool the nuclear reactors down and to ensure that they were able to reconnect the nuclear reactor’s cooling system to the power grid to enable the cooling system to once again operate. This is true bravery, with people literally sacrificing themselves in order to save so many others. I take this opportunity to also acknowledge, as a mark of respect, the bravery of those men and women and thank them for their selflessness and recognise that they have indeed saved the lives of tens of thousands, if not millions, of people as a result of their very fine efforts.
I, as the representative of Moncrieff, the citizens of the Gold Coast and the citizens of Australia, say to our Japanese friends: ‘God be with you. Strength to you. We have prayed for you and we will continue to be there for you in any way, shape or form that we can help.’",REPS,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,<title>Japan Disaster</title>,Condolences,48,1
"Slipper, Peter, MP",LP,2011-03-23,"—Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker Murphy. At the outset I thank the honourable member for Fadden for his courtesy in allowing me to precede him as I must relieve you as the occupant of the chair in this place.
I think all of us were absolutely shocked when we saw the unfolding tragedy in Japan. For many years Japan has been a very close friend and trading partner of Australia. Many of us have Japanese friends and many of us have dealt with Japanese people in the area of business, to the mutual advantage of both Australia and Japan.
As a former chairman of the Australia-Japan Parliamentary Friendship Group and as a member many years ago of the Australia-Japan Society younger set, I want to pass on my sympathy and my condolences, as well as those from the electorate of Fisher and the people of the Sunshine Coast more generally, to the government and the people of Japan. I want to pay homage to those Australians who have gone to Japan to assist in alleviating the situation that has unfolded.
Japan is in an area of the world that is subject to earthquakes, but that does not in any way, shape or form make the tragedy that has occurred on this occasion any more understandable. My thoughts and prayers go to all of those affected as well as to the entire Japanese people. In relation to the earthquake and the tsunami and the loss of life, it must be an absolutely terrible situation. Many people are, with great fortitude, continuing to accept hardship and difficulty and I hope that the situation improves as quickly as possible. But on behalf of my constituency, and on my own behalf, I would like to pass on my best wishes to the people of Japan at this sad and tragic time.",REPS,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,<title>Japan Disaster</title>,Condolences,48,1
"Robert, Stuart, MP",LP,2011-03-23,"—I rise to offer my support for the condolence motion regarding the Japanese earthquake. I rise with some degree of knowledge, having been in Japan when the quake actually struck. The best condolence I can give is to briefly share some of my 40-hour journey home, post the quake, because it speaks volumes for the courage, the tenacity and the great kindness of the Japanese people.
On that fateful day, 11 March 2011, I was in Kyoto in the morning and I bought a 400-year-old Japanese samurai sword from the Mihara province, a sword that for 10 generations samurai warriors had held, had lent on and had fought with. It was a sword that symbolised all that Japan was and is to be: a nation of great courage, of great inventiveness, of great entrepreneurialism and of tremendous spirit of community—everything that the samurai stood for and continue to stand for. Four hours after I bought that sword and was holding it in my hand, the shinkansen we were in travelling from Kyoto to Osaka and Tokyo ground to a sudden stop. It became apparent over the subsequent minutes, because we were still a fair way away—although my colleagues attest to the shaking on the train—that there had indeed been an earthquake.
The following minutes would outline the severity of the earthquake. We would later spend eight hours on our shinkansen, five hours of it stationary within 200 kilometres of Tokyo. Reports slowly came through over phones, mobile devices and tablets on board the train that a magnitude-9 quake had struck the main island of Japan. We later found out that the quake was so powerful that the island shifted eight feet—it actually moved eight feet towards the continental United States of America. NASA also tells us that the revolution of the world slowed by some 1.6 nanoseconds, which I am sure does not sound very much, but I can assure you that being on a tin-can shinkansen—to be somewhat flippant—when the earthquake and the aftershocks struck was certainly significant.
It was interesting that as I looked around at the 1½ thousand Japanese people on board the train, there was no sign of fear or confusion. Some commentators have called it a calm chaos. I simply call it a calm and stoic demeanour. There was no sense of distress. The only difference between the Japanese people I saw going to Kyoto on the train and the Japanese people I saw coming back was that on the way back there was  a lot more use of mobile phones. Those who did not have a phone had one readily shared with them. There was one gentleman I stood next to who had one phone, as he was speaking to friends, colleagues and loved ones, and another phone—showing the technological genius of Japan—beaming through, via wi-fi and the 3G network, what was actually happening on the ground, including the devastating earthquake.
Even reaching Tokyo, where the electric train system had ceased working, some estimate up to eight million Japanese people were stuck in Tokyo. Many millions then walked home. Estimates are that many millions stayed in Tokyo itself, finding somewhere they could possibly sleep—in the workplace or indeed in train stations or other covered areas. And at zero degrees and plunging on the streets of Tokyo, with millions of people, there was no sense of pushing, no sense of shoving, but people waiting orderly and calmly in line for food. While there was certainly traffic gridlock, as cars sought to leave Tokyo, the great flood of humanity on the streets was orderly, it was polite and it was calm. It speaks volumes of the Japanese people and how they have stoically got on with the job.
As the disaster unfolded—and, indeed, it was not until about 1 am in the ambassador’s personal residence, where he took us in, as there was nowhere else for our parliamentary team to sleep—we saw the full horror of what was unfolding on Japanese TV. It would subsequently take seven hours, through numerous trains, buses and taxis to make it to the airport as the full enormity of the situation unfolded. But even then, there were images of women and children and elderly people, standing in queues in the snow in the northern part of Japan, encouraging others to go first. There were reports of food arriving for people, which they would hand down the queues to the more vulnerable, the elderly and the young, to have it first. What we have seen is the very best of Japan.
Of course, we look with some trepidation at what is happening with the Tokyo Electric Company, the Fukushima nuclear plant. But, again, as it is slowly coming under control, we see 150 people—the Fukushima 150 they call them—with teams of 50 men at a time going into the damaged reactor areas, under terrible conditions, to seek to bring the reactor cooling under control. It is reported that there are no young men amongst them; only the older men who had children could volunteer. It speaks volumes of the courage and sacrifice. Japanese TV was reporting that these 150 men at Fukushima are the modern day samurai, willing to lay down their lives for the Japanese people to bring the reactors under control.
In a fascinating statement, a statement of great leadership, the Japanese Prime Minister came on national television to exhort the Japanese people that the Fukushima men had to bring the plant under control—and, to quote him on national television, ‘retreat was unthinkable.’ The fate of that nation rests in those 150 men, and I believe they have acquitted themselves magnificently, and only time will tell what they have brought about through their courage and sacrifice.
I commend Ambassador McLean and his full embassy staff for the sacrifice they made for their long hours, for their tireless work. I thank the ambassador personally for giving us his personal home to have a couple of hours sleep in and for keeping us informed. I thank his staff, especially the trade commissioner, who came with us on our seven-hour epic journey to the airport, where we arrived before the evidence advance team, who came by road and found that blocked and joined us on the convoluted and difficult train journey to get to the airport.
I thank Qantas, who delayed their plane by up to two hours to ensure the maximum number of Australians could be on the flight. I caught up with the 747-400 pilot of that QF personally, to thank him after the flight. As he talked about the due time to take off there were still a hundred Australians missing—as in, had not made the flight—and he would wait until the last 24, who happened to be children, boarded the flight. Of course, everyone’s connections were stuffed up with a flight leaving so late. Qantas would take responsibility for that, but it speaks volumes of the national carrier that it would actually delay flights at its cost to ensure that all Australians could leave Japan on that first flight out, followed closely by a second flight through to WA.
I have nothing but praise for the Japanese people, for the leaders, for those men who are fighting in Fukushima to get the reactors under control. I have nothing but praise for embassy staff and our Qantas staff. I certainly commend the defence minister. We have three C17 Globemasters in theatre at present; two more taking water cannons to the Japanese people. I offer my heartfelt condolences to the Japanese nation. They are going through a trial—20,000 killed, a great part of their countryside devastated, the economy hit hard. This is a difficult blow to an economy already struggling. The Japanese people need to know that we as a nation will stand with them. I think that is readily demonstrated by the fact that there are only two foreign militaries right now operating alongside the Japanese Self Defence Force: the US military and the Australian military. That speaks volumes, louder than words ever could, of how special the relationship is with Japan and our commitment to it as a nation as it seeks to rebuild.

"Keenan, Michael, MP",LP,2011-03-23,"—I rise to talk on the Electronic Transactions Amendment Bill 2011. The coalition supports the purpose of this bill, which is to update the Electronic Transactions Act 1999 to align the legislation with the relevant UN convention of 2005. As explained in the Bills Digest, the bill updates Australia’s electronic transactions legislation to reflect the internationally recognised standards on electronic commerce set out in the convention, thereby giving greater certainty to international trade and commerce.
The Electronic Transactions Act 1999 implements the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law Model Law on Electronic Commerce of 1996. The intention of the model is to provide a more secure environment for electronic commerce to remove legal obstacles to its acceptance. The principal effect of this act is to provide that transactions will not be invalid merely because they have been completed electronically. Giving information in writing, providing a handwritten signature, producing a document in material form and recording or retaining information may all be done electronically.
The 2005 convention seeks to build on the model law in light of the practical experience of the past 15 years, in particular with respect to issues relating to the formation and performance of contracts between parties in different countries. However, it makes no substantive changes to contract law.
Exceptions to this regime include negotiable instruments and documents of title where there is a risk of unauthorised duplication. Complex transactions will remain subject to their own regulatory and contract rules. The regulations will provide for documents such as passports and statutory declarations to be only in paper based form.
The bill was drafted by the Parliamentary Counsel’s Committee and was approved by the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General in May 2010. The parliaments of New South Wales and Tasmania have already passed the amendments, with the remaining parliaments expected to do so by the middle of this year.
The bill applies the changes proposed by the convention in respect of international contracts. It provides default rules for determining the time of dispatch and receipt and electronic communication for the purposes of formation and performance of a contract. It also clarifies the traditional contractual rules on formation in the context of electronic commerce to recognise automated message systems, clarification of any invitation to treat, determining the location of parties and updating the electronic signature provisions.
The convention rules exclude personal, domestic or household contracts from its regime. However, the bill does not make such an exclusion. The reason for this is that the act does not override the consumer protection provisions of the Competition and Consumer Act 2010, formerly the Trade Practices Act 1974. The public consultation process called for submissions on this issue but received none. This is probably not surprising, because the bill makes no substantive changes to contractual rules or remedies.
It should be noted that nothing in the convention or the bill affects the principle that contracting parties should be free to agree on matters affecting the formation and performance of a contract between them. Parties contracting in different countries may agree on a law which is to apply to their dealings. The convention rules only apply where the relevant law validly chosen by the parties or otherwise deemed to apply is that of a contracting state.
The coalition supports the Electronic Transactions Amendment Bill 2011 and I therefore commend the bill to the House.",REPS,<title>ELECTRONIC TRANSACTIONS AMENDMENT BILL 2011</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,49,1
"Brodtmann, Gai, MP",ALP,2011-03-23,"—I am pleased tonight to rise to speak in support of the Electronic Transactions Amendment Bill 2011. This bill proposes legislation that in some respects is undramatic and may not generate great controversy, but it is a small part of the gradual reform and reshaping of the business environment that is so crucial to Australia’s future prosperity. Indeed, it is salutary for us sometimes to delve a little more deeply into the more quotidian details of some of the grander big-picture images that we are accustomed to use. I believe that this bill can provide us with such an opportunity to understand better the complexity and interrelationships in the modern business environment and the challenges it brings.
We are all familiar with talk of the digital environment—of cyberspace—but we need to reflect a little to see how dramatic has been the change in the environment in which we do business and reflect on how we carry out financial transactions within that environment. So accustomed have we all become to buying goods online, making financial and banking arrangements on the net and using handy and widely accepted methods such as PayPal that we rarely think about the underlying structures of these systems and the legal frameworks that surround them, bind them and manage them.
This bill is very much about the digital economy, a term we hear often, but I wonder whether there is sometimes an inclination to think of the digital economy as somehow a separate part of the economy, exclusive to geeks or video gamers, as one leading member from those opposite seemed to think at one time. But the digital economy is widespread. Anyone familiar with what might be thought of as ‘old economy’ industries such as agriculture will know that the sophisticated use of information technology is commonplace. So we are all involved in the digital economy, at least in a sensibly broad understanding of that term.
This bill also illustrates the value of international cooperation and rule-making. The amendments we are considering will allow Australia to accede to the United Nations Convention on the Use of Electronic Communications in International Contracts. The convention enhances legal certainty and commercial predictability but does not purport to vary or create contract law. This convention is an important element in international trade law and facilitates international trade. The convention was developed by the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law and is the first United Nations convention addressing legal issues arising from the digital economy. Accession to the convention requires amendments to the domestic electronic transactions regime, and each Australian jurisdiction has implemented legislation based on the UNCITRAL Model Law on Electronic Commerce 1996, which was also developed by the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law. The convention updates the model law on the basis of a better understanding of the use of electronic communications since the model law was finalised.
Australia has long been a strong supporter of a robust international trading system. It has been the basis of our economic prosperity and will continue to be. This bill is a small part of Australia’s ongoing commitment to an open and free international trading system, but those familiar with our federal system will know that sometimes cooperation is required within a smaller sphere and that this has historically proved at least as difficult as cooperation in the international sphere. The enterprise of which this bill is part provides an example of the states and territories working towards the same ends and is one of the Gillard government’s many harmonisation, consolidation and streamlining efforts. The bill was approved by the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General, and New South Wales and Tasmania have already passed the amendments to allow it to be applied. Others are also intending to update their electronic transactions legislation. Stakeholders in the business community and other interested parties have also been consulted and are supportive of the proposed amendments.
We often talk about taking some aspect or other of Australian life into the 21st century—it is common parlance. This is shorthand for two important insights. The first is that, since we can no longer try to deny that globalisation has brought the whole world into a closer relationship, we always need to be aware of what is happening in the world at large and of what changes are occurring and to take action to ensure we benefit to the full from this globalised world and this globalised relationship. The second stems from recognition of the increasing rate of technological change. We all know of Moore’s law, which broadly states that the computing power available to us doubles roughly every two years. But even Moore’s law seems modest when we take into account the explosion in software and hardware that we are witnessing. I know from my time consulting in Defence that in some areas software becomes outdated in months and sometimes in weeks but not in years anymore. With this understanding of what lies behind the expression ‘Moore’s law’, this undramatic and modest bill does take Australia into the 21st century. The amendments we are considering achieve small but important clarifications on the details of using electronic means of communication. These include such matters as the date and time of the formation of a contract; clarifying that a contract can still be legally effective despite having been formed by an automated messaging system; reliability of electronic signatures; and determining the place of business of the parties to a transaction. We may not even be aware of these details when we use the internet to update a subscription to a magazine or buy that must-have vintage frock on eBay, but they are essential.
I note that measures such as this, which improve the environment in which business and households can operate online, are of special interest to the Australian Capital Territory region and the people of my electorate of Canberra. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, as of June 2009, just over five million households nationally had broadband and, of these, the Australian Capital Territory continued to have the highest proportion, with nearly three-quarters—74 per cent—of Australian Capital Territory households connected. This is one of the reasons we are so excited about the NBN and eagerly anticipate its arrival and strongly support it.
This high level of penetration is also reflected in the energetic community of businesses in the ACT, including small and micro businesses—one of which I used to own—which work in the information technology industry, the animation industry, the film industry, the defence industry and a whole range of other industries. Eighteen countries have now signed the UN convention that underscores this bill, including significant trading partners such as the Republic of Korea and Singapore. So, for reasons local, national and international, I am very pleased to commend this bill to the House.",REPS,<title>ELECTRONIC TRANSACTIONS AMENDMENT BILL 2011</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,49,1
"Rowland, Michelle, MP",ALP,2011-03-23,"—I would like to make a few comments on the amendments contained in the Electronic Transactions Amendment Bill 2011 as a former practitioner in this area. I dealt with the Electronics Transactions Act quite regularly in the ICT sphere, particularly in terms of contract formation in communications contexts. It is a very relevant piece of legislation that is used in the commercial space almost as a matter of norm rather than analysis. I do recall that in 1999, when it was introduced—my friend the parliamentary secretary here might have been practising at the time too—it was when we were having the Y2K provisions inserted into contracts, and we were only starting to form a body of jurisprudence and a body of statute law dealing with ICT. It was a very interesting time, because people were not quite aware of what an electronic transactions piece of legislation would do. In fact, at its core, it says that a contract is not invalid merely by reason that it may have been done by electronic means. The legislation was very clear—certainly consistent with the international convention which the member for Canberra described earlier—that ‘electronic means’ was not going to be limited to email or to internet. At the time, the internet was only starting to gain worldwide acceptance and usage. We were not going to limit it to facsimile means or any other means. So it was kept as very much a technology-neutral piece of legislation, and it continues to reflect that today.
The amendments in this bill are noncontroversial, and I think that reflects the fact that this legislation is working well. As I said, it is now legislation that is examined not so much for what it contains but in terms of what it might mean for countries that are continuing to contract and whether it would make any difference to their current practices. Again I will say that, as a practitioner in this field, and having seen some amendments go through over the years—and it is a model act which all states and territories ascribe to—there has not been controversy around this. In fact, I think that only one element of the legislation has ever been litigated. It concerned whether a digital signature would satisfy the requirements of signing, in this case involving a touch screen. It was a matter from last year involving the Electoral Commissioner. Other than that there has been zero litigation in this area to test the bounds of it. I think that is a good thing for laws in the e-commerce space to be functioning well and to be functioning well in the sense that they are widely accepted now. When we do have these amendments before us, they are to ensure that we are consistent with our international conventions rather than trying to remedy any particular faults.
As has been mentioned, there are a couple of key elements of this bill. In line with the convention, it looks at whether there are uncertainties in the formation and performance of contracts. There are provisions dealing with automated message systems and whether electronic signatures are reliable and the default rules regarding the place of business for the parties to a transaction. I will just deal very briefly with some of those elements. In terms of signatures, the Electronic Transactions Act makes it clear that an electronic communication will satisfy the requirement to obtain a person’s signature in certain circumstances, if the method used to identify a person and to indicate the approval of the information is communicated, and if the method was as reliable as was appropriate for the purposes for which the information was communicated.
This reliability test has worked quite well, but I note that the Attorney-General’s Department has consulted on this issue and made a recommendation that the Electronic Transactions Act be amended so that a party cannot argue that a signature fails the objective reliability test when the method used is proven in fact to have identified the signatory and the intention of that signatory. Again, this is not an area which has been litigated, so it is more about removing the potential for avoidance of doubt mechanisms.
Contracts and other electronic transactions often these days use automatic message systems without review or intervention by what we call a natural person. The Electronic Transactions Act previously did not contain a provision which made it clear that the absence of human intervention itself did not make a contract invalid or unreliable. I certainly do not believe that there was ever any question that there would be invalidity on those grounds, but we are now dealing with any such potential question that invalidity existed.
In relation to contracting electronically it is very useful to go back to first principles. My former colleague Kenneth Saurajen, a partner at Gilbert + Tobin, has noted that, with flexibility of contracting electronically, some people might think it is conceptually difficult to maintain that it is appropriate or justifiable to have a special set of rules for electronic transactions and digital communication. As he has observed from the writings of others and his own analysis, the fact that a contract is entered into electronically should in theory have no impact upon its legal validity, without any legal concerns restricted to the manner in which its terms might be evidenced, should disputes as to the contract’s existent or content later arise.
This indeed reflects the fact again that the Electronic Transactions Act, the national scheme that the Commonwealth administers and the state and territory schemes have continued to work very well and have continued to ensure that we have reliability in Australia. That reliability is reflected in the very large number of our trading partners who are also signatories to this convention.
I have had the privilege of being involved in the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, which is examining further amendments that might be required to the electronic transactions legislation based on updates to the convention. In the hearings in February I referred to the department’s extensive report into the digital economy a year or so ago and asked departmental representatives whether there was anything in the report regarding any legislative reform of the Electronic Transactions Act or whether there were any submissions on that. The response was that there were no proposals for legislative reform out of that paper, but rather in any future amendments we would simply ensure we maintain consistency with the UN Convention on the Use of Electronic Communications in International Contracts. I commend the bill to the House.",REPS,<title>ELECTRONIC TRANSACTIONS AMENDMENT BILL 2011</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,49,1
"Bradbury, David, MP",ALP,2011-03-23,"—I thank all of the members who have contributed to this debate—in particular, while she is still in the chamber, the member for Greenway. It is always good to see someone that has particular expertise that they are able to bring to the debate around a matter such as this.
As mentioned throughout the debate, the Electronic Transactions Amendment Bill 2011 makes amendments to the Electronic Transactions Act 1999 to implement the United Nations Convention on the Use of Electronic Communications in International Contracts 2005. This will update the electronic transactions regime to reflect internationally recognised standards on electronic commerce. The bill implements model amendments to the uniform electronic transactions regime that were developed and approved by the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General. The bill addresses the use of existing and emerging technologies in electronic commerce. These amendments are an important step in ensuring Australia’s legal regime can support and promote firms and businesses operating in the digital economy.
The amendments are intended to provide increased legal certainty in trade by electronic means. This should encourage further growth of electronic contracting, both domestically and internationally, by dealing with rules that we all live with in the hard-copy environment. The bill contains provisions that adapt accepted contractual principles to the electronic environment. While such provisions clarify uncertainties in using electronic communications in the formation and performance of contracts, they do not unduly disturb or affect settled contract law or domestic practice.
In conclusion, the government is committed to supporting businesses and individuals operating in the digital economy. The time is apt for enacting provisions that foster greater legal certainty and commercial predictability when using electronic communications in contracts. The bill will bring Australia’s electronic transactions legislation into the 21st century. I commend this bill to the House.
