"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2001-08-22,"—On behalf of the Labor Party, I move opposition amendment (1) on sheet No. 2287:
 (1)	Clause 3, page 2 (after line 11), after paragraph (a), insert:
	(aa)	to support programs to reduce domestic violence caused by alcohol or other licit substance abuse;
I have just received the Democrat request—I think the suggestion of the order is a good one, so I can have a look at the detail of that. In general, I want to say to the Senate, and more particularly to Senator Lees, that Labor is serious about these amendments. I was not in the chamber for all of Senator Lees's speech in the second reading debate, but I had a look at the Hansard and read what she said. I want to make the point that this is a genuine attempt by Labor to make the legislation better. It is perfectly appropriate for parties and individuals to negotiate outside the parliament and to reach arrangements on legislation; it is part of the political process. While it is perfectly appropriate for those discussions to take place, for agreements to be reached and for understandings to be made about how one must proceed inside the chamber—it has always been part of the political process; some people rail against it, but that is just a misunderstanding of how politics works—at the end of the day the decision is for the Senate and any agreement outside of this chamber by parties or persons has to be tested inside the Senate and the Senate gets to make a judgment about those things.
In one of her references, Senator Lees talks about `people we have appointed to the foundation'. You have not actually appointed anyone to the foundation yet; it is a process for the parliament to decide on the legislation. I understand that invitations have been issued in a formal sense and that they have met informally, but there is a role for parliament. Labor think the amendments we are moving are important protections that ought to be represented in parliament. Agreements can be reached between individuals who may come and go; it may well be that the minister for health is no longer the minister for health in three months. It is important that the parliament reflect parliament's view, and that is why we are keen to include our amendments and requests to make sure that the legislation is right. It is the legislation that lasts, not the agreements and not the individuals. That is why this is important. I do not doubt the bona fides of Senator Lees or her motivations in this—I know that she has put a lot of work into the matter and that she has a lot of interest in it, and I concede that she knows more about the fundamental issues involved than I do. But my plea is: let us make sure that we get the legislation right, because in the end that is what will stand the test of time, that is what will be permanent, that is what will become the law of the land. It is important that the legislation is correct.
I will not delay the Senate too long. We have had the Senate inquiry process, and the issues have been discussed inside the parliament and by the interested groups. Amendment (1) concerns the question of domestic violence. Labor are seeking to broaden the focus of the foundation to include a major issue concerning alcohol abuse that we think has not been given enough prominence as a result of the negotiations that occurred before the bill. I think everyone in the chamber would concede that domestic violence is a serious problem and that alcohol is a major contributing factor; most people acknowledged that in their speeches in the second reading debate. A recent study in the Medical Journal of Australia showed that almost 30 per cent of middle-aged women have suffered violence or child abuse in their lifetimes. I will not go through all the statistics; I think the parliament accepts that the question of domestic violence and its links to alcohol abuse are very firmly established. Labor think it is important that the foundation and the legislation formally reflect that broadening of focus. It is important that the parliament give the direction to the foundation that it include that reference, and that is why we have moved that amendment. I urge the Senate to support it.",SENATE,<title>ALCOHOL EDUCATION AND REHABILITATION ACCOUNT BILL 2001</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,4,1
"Lees, Sen Meg",AD,2001-08-22,"— There is absolutely no doubt that domestic violence is an extremely important issue. As I move around in my capacity as Democrats' health spokesperson, it is an issue that I come across constantly. It is one that I believe is frequently overlooked by both state and federal governments. Indeed, often I feel that no more than lip-service is paid to its effects, particularly the flow-on effects to children of their experiences in a violent household. In particular, the level of funding from the Commonwealth for domestic violence support services—be it for accommodation or shelters or indeed for the peak body that coordinates the various services across the country—has fallen well short in all of those areas. 
However, I do not believe that this is the place to make up that shortfall. This is a one-off amount of money contributed by those people who paid too much across the counter for their draught beer since the change in our tax system and through until the change to the level of tax on draught beer was made. It is to go to programs to reduce the abuse of alcohol and other legal substances, as in petrol and glue sniffing. However, if we start putting in specifics such as that in this amendment, there are a number of consequences. 
I think that the group that have been selected as members of the foundation are all well aware of these issues. They are all people who have had experience in the area of alcohol abuse, and there is absolutely no doubt that there will be flow-on effects into the issue of domestic violence and the impact, particularly on women and children, of those people who have overindulged in alcohol, particularly those people who get drunk regularly and abuse their families. But to start requiring, particularly in the wording that is here, support for programs to reduce domestic violence caused by the abuse of alcohol or other licit substances moves us away from the actual programs that are now running into domestic violence. Go and visit women's shelters and look at some of the specific support services: services for those who are offenders, services for children and services for mostly women—those who are the victims. I do not think we can start breaking it down as to why they are the victims and start looking at specific causes. It is an issue that is handled regardless of the actual cause of the violence. While alcohol is a major contributing factor in many instances, the foundation will already pick that up; it will already be dealing with the core problem. One of the spin-off effects will be that domestic violence itself can be dealt with.
It is not just unnecessary but an unnecessary complication to put it in this way and to risk further watering down the amount of money that goes into core programs to reduce the abuse of alcohol. As I said in my speech in the second reading debate, tobacco when used as directed will kill. Tobacco is a product that is legal, but we know that it is deadly even used as the manufacturers direct. Alcohol is a product that when used carefully, used responsibly, does not cause harm; it is the irresponsible use of it that this piece of legislation is tackling through funding and setting up the Alcohol Education and Rehabilitation Foundation. I do not for a moment want to suggest that we in this place are not fully aware of the devastating impact of domestic violence on so many Australian families, but I do not believe it is constructive to try to put money into it in this way.",SENATE,<title>ALCOHOL EDUCATION AND REHABILITATION ACCOUNT BILL 2001</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,4,1
"Tambling, Sen Grant",CLP,2001-08-22,"—The government does not support this amendment, as we consider it to be unnecessarily restrictive. The relationship between alcohol abuse and domestic violence is recognised and would clearly be within the scope of the foundation's activities. I refer to the subclauses under clause 3, which are very explicit with regard to preventing alcohol and substance abuse and supporting evidence based alcohol and other illicit substance abuse treatment, rehabilitation, research and preventative programs—particularly that one. The other objectives of promoting education and public awareness and providing funding grants would all, I think, embrace issues such as domestic violence and other matters related to alcohol abuse. The foundation is required to expend 20 per cent of its funds on projects addressing indigenous issues, and it is expected that the foundation will focus its early attention on activities and projects that are designed to address domestic violence. Such projects could, for example, be in the form of public awareness and education programs, or funding could be provided to projects that have a direct impact on families that experience abuse of this nature. The legislation as drafted allows funding for these purposes.",SENATE,<title>ALCOHOL EDUCATION AND REHABILITATION ACCOUNT BILL 2001</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,4,1
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2001-08-22,"—If nothing else, I can count and so I understand that we are not going to get the amendment carried. I must put on the record that I think the explanation given for not including this objective was very unconvincing. On the one hand, people seemed to be saying, `It is already covered; they can already do it, and to say so would be too restrictive.' That argument is nonsense.
—No, it's not.
—Well, Senator Lees, you made some comments and Senator Tambling made some others, and they were not exactly the same story. All I am saying is that it seems to me to be a reasonable thing to assert that we ought to support, to quote the amendment, `programs to reduce domestic violence caused by alcohol or other illicit substance abuse'. It seems reasonable to make that an objective, to say that, as part of the foundation's work, we are serious about dealing with the effects of alcohol abuse, such as the resultant domestic violence on families. We think that is a really important issue. It seems to us that it is more than reasonable that it be made explicit in the objectives of the foundation. I do not understand why making that an objective is, to use the words used by the government, `unnecessarily restrictive'. At the same time, they want to argue that it is work they will do anyway, although Senator Lees says she does not want that work to occur because it would broaden the focus too much. I am not sure what the explanation is for the opposition to this amendment. I do not want to labour the point, but I do think it is an important amendment. It allows us to focus on one of the major social problems brought about by alcohol abuse. Recognising it in the objectives is an important statement from this parliament about the importance of that issue, but obviously that is not going to be supported.
Amendment not agreed to.",SENATE,<title>ALCOHOL EDUCATION AND REHABILITATION ACCOUNT BILL 2001</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,4,1
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2001-08-22,"— On behalf of the Labor Party, I move opposition amendment (2) on sheet No. 2287:
 (2)	Page [6] (after line 13), after clause 13, insert:
13A  Conditions of agreement
		Any agreement made under section 9 or 12 must include the following conditions:
	(a)	the condition that the Foundation or a replacement body must comply with such policies, not inconsistent with any of the purposes referred to in section 3, as the Minister directs should guide the activities of the Foundation or replacement body;
	(b)	the condition that the Foundation or a replacement body must consult with the following:
	(i)	the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission; and
	(ii)	the National Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisation; and
	(iii)	the National Indigenous Substance Abuse Council;
		about priorities for, and ways of funding, indigenous substance abuse programs;
	(c)	the condition that not less than 20% of funding in any year must be allocated to indigenous substance abuse programs.
The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that the matters which the government signed off on in its memorandum of agreement with the Democrats are actually required to be included in the funding agreement with the foundation. We are very concerned to make sure that those objectives are reflected in the funding agreement. We have had a fairly sad history of agreements made with Democrats and others by the minister for health that have never actually come to pass. The famous letters from the minister that are circulated in the chamber as reasons why we should not legislate matters have become a bit of a standing joke. It is always the case that they never quite get applied in the same way. There is always a reason why the minister cannot quite fulfil the commitments. Quite frankly, the question of who will be the minister for health in three months time is a bit of an open issue. 
What Labor says is, `Let us get the legislation right. If we want to do something, if we want this to represent the intention of the parliament, let us include it in the legislation.' Therefore, it is our intention to reflect those matters in the funding agreement. They go to the question of consultation and indigenous substance abuse programs, and we specifically put this in as clause 13A, conditions of agreement. It is all very well to come into the chamber and say, `We have agreement with parties outside the parliament.' What Labor says is, `That is fine, that is part of the political process; at the end of the day, it is our job to reflect the will of the parliament in the legislation.' We have a fairly chequered history when it comes to the success of assurances from ministers circulated in letters or reflected in memorandums of understanding: those things do not have the same authority as parliamentary amendments reflected in legislation. Therefore, I urge the Senate to support this amendment.",SENATE,<title>ALCOHOL EDUCATION AND REHABILITATION ACCOUNT BILL 2001</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,4,1
"Tambling, Sen Grant",CLP,2001-08-22,"—The Labor amendment is essentially in three parts. With regard to subclause (a), I would argue that this approach would be entirely inconsistent with the memorandum of understanding that establishes the foundation as an independent organisation. With regard to subclause (b), the foundation is likely to consult widely in determining priorities for expenditure on indigenous projects. It is expected that, as an independent body, the foundation will develop its own protocols for consulting with the relevant organisations. With regard to subclause (c), the funding agreement between the Commonwealth and the foundation specifies that 20 per cent of the total funds for the entire four years must be directed to projects targeting indigenous Australians and, therefore, I would argue that the Labor Party amendment is unnecessary.",SENATE,<title>ALCOHOL EDUCATION AND REHABILITATION ACCOUNT BILL 2001</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,4,1
"Lees, Sen Meg",AD,2001-08-22,"—I will also deal with this Labor amendment in three parts. Firstly, I want to stress again, as I said in my speech in the second reading debate, that we want this foundation to be independent of government but still fully accountable. As we went through the committee hearing, I think we saw that that is indeed the case. I again direct the Labor Party back to that committee report. I think it is on pages 2, 3, 4 and 5.
—I was at the hearing; I asked both of the questions.
—Fine—you have your answers there in terms of accountability. I think this amendment is absolutely unnecessary. I am not quite sure what has motivated it. I listened carefully to your speech, Senator Evans, but, as we went through the processes in the committee hearing, I thought it was very clear that it was to be an independent body. The last thing we want to see happen is that this body is seen as a replacement funding body; that instead of the state or, indeed, the Commonwealth putting regular money into various substance abuse programs, a level of government just shrugs its shoulders and says, `Oh, look, we'll let the foundation take care of that. We're not going to be bothered putting money into that this year, and we don't want any pressure from anyone for that to occur.'
To deal with section (b), I think it is quite dangerous to start saying that we have a list of people you have to talk to, because we obviously must add to that list. We then should need to go through the charities. If we go back to the document that sets out whom the board members of the foundation are to represent, you will see that there are indigenous people on the board and there are people representing the churches and the charities—people who for years have dealt with the after-effects of substance abuse and who have tried the best they can to work in the area of education, prevention and rehabilitation. As for listing, for example, the National Indigenous Substance Misuse Council, we actually have the chair of that council as one of the members of the foundation. Scott Wilson, the chairperson of the National Indigenous Substance Misuse Council—I will not go through his complete CV—and the other members are perfectly capable of knowing whom they should consult and where they need to go for further information. In this particular case, I think it is not up to us to pick out just three groups and say that these are the three groups—and the wording is—`must consult with', and then presume that they can get the rest of it right. I think we leave it with some confidence to an expert body to decide where and when they go for information and how they proceed.
As for the last part of this amendment, I find it quite limiting, quite restricting, because it says, `Not less than 20 per cent of funding in any year.' It may be that in the first year they get to 18 per cent; it might be 25 per cent in the second year. I think it very much depends on the programs that are submitted and on what information they have as to whether programs need either one-off funding or ongoing funding. I do not think that we should limit the foundation in this way, to say that every year they have to get to that 20 per cent. It is very clear that by the end of the four years they have to have spent at least 20 per cent of funding on indigenous issues, on indigenous substance abuse programs, but I do not think that we need to restrict them in this way.",SENATE,<title>ALCOHOL EDUCATION AND REHABILITATION ACCOUNT BILL 2001</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,4,1
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2001-08-22,"—It is clear that I am wasting my breath, but I do want to make a couple of points. When Senator Lees uses the royal `we', she reflects again her agreement with the minister. You have not appointed anybody to a foundation. You may have a cosy little deal with the minister and you may have shared a nice bottle of red wine in doing the deal. This is the parliament of Australia. We are dealing with the legislation, and what we have to reflect is the view of the parliament. What you want to do is to say that we all accept that you have done this deal and that is enough. I do not have a problem with you doing a deal with the government, but you cannot come in and say that, instead of us having legislation, we have this deal, we have this piece of paper between the former Leader of the Democrats and, hopefully, the former minister. Quite frankly, I do not find that reassuring at all.
You keep referring to the Senate inquiry. As you know, Senator Lees, you and I, I think, are the only two—along with the chair—who sat through it all. I think it is fair to say that I took a full participatory role in that. At the end of that process, I was concerned that your deal was not adequate, that it was not providing enough protections for the expenditure of Commonwealth taxpayers' funds—$115 million— saying, `It's okay, leave it to them. We've got a deal; we've got an understanding.' I am afraid that that is not good enough for me. I have a difference of opinion with you about that. I think we ought to put some protections in place. You said it was dangerous to put these things in. We have gone from `not necessary' to `dangerous'. I do not know what it will be by the third amendment.
—You used the word `dangerous'—I am happy to refer you to the Hansard—thatit is dangerous for us to put assurances and guarantees in the legislation, that it is better that we rely on the agreement that you reached with the minister in writing outside of the parliament. Quite frankly, I do not share your views. What happened to the old Democrats of public accountability—keep the bastards honest and make sure it is all brought before the parliament? When it does not suit you, it is abandoned. Quite frankly, your record of deals with the minister for health is appalling. Most of them have not been honoured. You come in here and you wave letters around at every debate: `I've done a deal with the minister.' Quite frankly, they are not worth the paper that they are printed on and they are very rarely honoured. What I am saying to you, Senator Lees—and I made the point at the start—is that I do not doubt your motives and I do not doubt your interest in this issue, but what you have suggested in this parliament is not good enough. It is not good enough for the expenditure of Commonwealth money, and we want to make sure that we have the protections.
Your example is to say that the National Indigenous Substance Misuse Council are already covered because `we have the chair on the foundation'. But you do not have a foundation, because it has not been established yet. You have a group of people about whom you and the minister had a chat and drew up a list. They are perfectly good people; there is no question about their qualifications. But what happens if that gentleman resigns? Does the next chair of the National Indigenous Substance Misuse Council come onto the foundation? No, he does not. Why? Because there are no regulations; there is no governance of who the members are, how they are reappointed or what their terms are, et cetera. Again, it is all a matter of some secret deal. It is not in the legislation. It is not good enough. If you want me to be reassured, and if you want the parliament to be reassured, let us cover those issues and let us make sure we have got the accountability measures.
But they are not there and, quite frankly, Senator Lees, I am not reassured. You may say, `Tough; I don't care.' That is your political judgment and that is fine. But I make the point to you: you have spent your political career arguing about public accountability and saying that that is one of the Democrats' key issues. Senator Murray comes in and lectures us day after day; let us see you put it into practice. Don't talk the talk; walk the walk. Support proper accountability measures in this legislation, not secret deals that, quite frankly, you are incapable of enforcing. You do not have the ability to enforce them, and we have seen that time and time again. You get done over when the minister finds that what he signed off on is all too hard. Let us put it in the legislation.
 (Senator Lightfoot)—Are you referring to me when you say `you'?
—If you like, Mr Chairman. I always speak through the chair.
—I took no part in that, Senator Evans.
—I know you were taking a keen interest in the debate, as always.
—I always listen to your speeches, Senator Evans. Perhaps you might care to address your remarks to the chair rather than to senators.
—I accept your admonishment, Mr Chairman. I was, through you, trying to address some remarks to Senator Lees. We have been in the centre of the discussion, but I accept your correction. The point I am trying to make is: this is a chance for the parliament to make sure we get it right and it is important that we do so. We are talking about $115 million of public money. We ought to make sure that the proper protections are in place. We all agree with the objectives of the foundation. As I say, we have been prepared to concede that the sort of people you are looking for to get involved are perfectly reputable. There is no argument about the public good that this foundation can do and that good people are being encouraged to be part of it, but we do think that the parliament has the right to insist on the proper protections, and I am disappointed that the Democrats are not supporting those measures.",SENATE,<title>ALCOHOL EDUCATION AND REHABILITATION ACCOUNT BILL 2001</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,4,1
"Lees, Sen Meg",AD,2001-08-22,"—I find it very interesting that you should argue accountability. I can assure you that if there were anything evenly vaguely wrong with this legislation—and you yourself referred to Senator Murray—Senator Murray would be down here in a flash arguing very strongly about it. If you could put a case—
 (Senator Lightfoot)—Would you like to put the case to me, Senator Lees? Put it through the chair, if you would not mind.
—Yes, Mr Chairman, I will put it through the chair. I point out to Senator Evans, through the chair, that we are not, through this legislation, appointing those people who have been invited to go on to the board. In fact, perhaps this is getting at the heart of what Labor's problem is with this bill. They ensured that we did not pass it last sitting session. Fine, we went through the committee process; I thought that was fairly clear, although Senator Evans now says that he has some doubts after it. But I think the detail set out there made it very clear that all the accountability procedures have indeed been followed. But this bill is not appointing those particular people. It is not done that way. To refer back to Senator Murray, he has tried on 17 separate occasions to get an independent, separate process up for the appointment of people to boards, whether it is the ABC board or whatever board it is—generically, to have a process whereby ministers do not get to decide, they do not get to put mates on boards, and we actually have an open and transparent process based on merit. You have voted that down every time, Senator Evans. The Labor Party have voted down that legislation every time. Here we have a time when the government have not done it on their own. The government have not done it.
—Who have they done it with? You.
—Exactly—and that is your problem, Senator Evans.
—Your mates are on.
—Order! Senator Evans and Senator Lees, would you come to order please. Could you stop shouting at each other and address your remarks to the chair.
—This is getting to the heart of Senator Evans's problem. He was not consulted. If the Labor Party had wanted an independent process, Senator Murray has given them opportunity after opportunity. A number of other Democrat senators have moved the amendments; they voted it down. So we stick with the old process, which means the government gets to appoint boards. Here we have, in this instance, the government consulting with the Democrats because we are the ones who helped and assisted in setting up this Alcohol Education and Rehabilitation Foundation. The Labor Party have their knickers in a knot because they were not consulted. This is at the heart of these amendments. The Labor Party are upset because they have not been consulted.
—The parliament wasn't consulted.
—Obviously, if you get into government you can take over the reins and, no doubt, that is why you have opposed our amendments. When you get into government, you will not want to have to consult with anybody. You yourselves will want to be able to choose who is on boards. We have worked with government constructively on the basis of merit to put up a list of people. We have now got 11 names agreed to, all of whom have expertise in areas related to education, to the prevention area or indeed to rehabilitation for those people who have been unfortunately affected badly by alcohol. We are very pleased to say that this is a process that has now come to a conclusion and that that board has indeed met, as had already been discussed during the early committee hearings. We had Professor Webster there, who is the chair of the board, explaining what the board's processes were and what stage that is now up to. We must look at the motives of the Labor Party here and their interests of involvement in this legislation. They come in here with an amendment that says that we consult with three groups but there is no mention of `must consult' with any others. These amendments speak for themselves. They are not necessary and I say again that the Democrats will not be supporting them.",SENATE,<title>ALCOHOL EDUCATION AND REHABILITATION ACCOUNT BILL 2001</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,4,1
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2001-08-22,"—The important point to draw from that is that the Democrats' principal position now is that the way to fix the problem of governments appointing mates to boards is to make sure they consult with the Democrats to make sure that their mates are appointed. It is a ludicrous proposition about public accountability. They say, `Provided they have a chat with me and I am happy, it is okay.' No wonder the Democrats inside the party have had concerns about the decision making process. You have argued for years about proper accountability. A secret deal between the minister and someone from the Democrats is not accountability. This is our chance to have accountability.
The key point I leave with the committee is the rhetorical question: how are these people to be reappointed? If one dies, retires or resigns, how are they to be reappointed? Again, is that a question for discussion between the health spokesman for the Democrats and the minister? Why is that not contained in the legislation? The point is that none of this is contained, and the constant assertion that the foundation is up and working and the board is meeting is not true and was not the evidence given to the committee. At this stage it is a group of people who has been invited in for a cup of tea and a chat. The legislation gives the power to these processes. That is what we are debating today; that is why we ought to get it right. All I am urging is that the parliament insist on the proper accountability measures that we have always insisted on before and about which the Democrats have made much play. As I say, if we are not going to have that, we are not going to have that, but I think it would be a much better piece of legislation if those accountability measures were included.",SENATE,<title>ALCOHOL EDUCATION AND REHABILITATION ACCOUNT BILL 2001</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,4,1
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,2001-08-22,"—I think much of the heat in the previous exchanges was unnecessary. I think it is really not appropriate for Senator Evans to say that we do not have a chance to deal with this. These things come before us, and very often none of us know what is going to come through the executive government to the parliament. When it gets to the parliament, we are able to deal with them. That is what we are doing here and now.
I happen to agree with the amendment that has been moved by Senator Evans, but I do not think the reflections that were made were justified. Senator Lees has done a very good job in a very important area, attention to which has dwindled over the years. We all know it is an enormous problem that we are faced with. We went through the second reading debate, and we have been through this time and time again, individually and with constituents. Alcoholism is an enormously costly problem, costly to the public purse as well as to the fundamental structures of our society. Alcoholism affects families deeply, and they and their extended families bear the cost largely.
To that extent, I appreciate what has been achieved and the outcome is here before us. Our job now is to see whether we can maintain some sort of accountability in the legislation itself. Senator Lees has agreed that that is obviously necessary and has indicated that. We happen to have a slight disagreement on the question of appointment. On balance, I support the amendment put forward by Senator Evans.
I would like to raise, however, the condition that not less than 20 per cent of funding in any year must be allocated to indigenous substance abuse programs. Is the definition of substance abuse programs contained in the legislation?
—I do not know whether it is, Senator Evans.
 (Senator Lightfoot)—It does not appear to be in the bill, Senator Harradine.
—Senator Evans, pursuant to your principle that things need to be cut and dried and put in the legislation, perhaps we ought to look at including the term `substance abuse programs'.
—A consequential amendment might be useful, but I have not done too well on amendments generally, Senator Harradine.
—Let us see how it goes.",SENATE,<title>ALCOHOL EDUCATION AND REHABILITATION ACCOUNT BILL 2001</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,4,1
"Tambling, Sen Grant",CLP,2001-08-22,"—I think it is very important to point out that this legislation is not about the powers of the Alcohol Education and Rehabilitation Foundation itself or anything like that. This is essentially a budget related measure to appropriate funds. In effect, it establishes an account to provide by 1 July 2005 at least $115 million to the foundation, et cetera, for various things. If you look very carefully at part 1 and part 2 of the Alcohol Education and Rehabilitation Account Bill 2001, you see it is very much focused on establishing the account. Then I would point out clause 6, `Credits to the account'. There must be credited to the account $10 million on the day on which the act receives royal assent, $24 million on 1 July 2002, $40 million on 1 July 2003 and $41 million on 1 July 2004. The essence of this legislation is very much that provision of funding to the foundation for purposes that will arise.
The question that Senator Harradine has raised goes to the core of the funding agreement with the foundation. This funding agreement between the Commonwealth and the foundation specifies that 20 per cent of total funds for the entire four years of funding must be directed to projects targeting indigenous Australians. I think that is the essence of that 20 per cent, and it will be a matter for the foundation itself to determine those particular programs and other activities in that area.",SENATE,<title>ALCOHOL EDUCATION AND REHABILITATION ACCOUNT BILL 2001</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,4,1
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,2001-08-22,"— That is a bit vague. What does it mean that this 20 per cent is to assist Aboriginal and indigenous people, or words to that effect? This is the Alcohol Education and Rehabilitation Account Bill 2001. I presume what is meant there is not only alcoholism but also petrol sniffing, for example, or glue sniffing and the like. The whole drugs area—heroin and other illegal drugs—is in another box, is it not?

—Yes, illegal. Am I clear that we are talking about licit drugs? Are we talking only about licit substances now?",SENATE,<title>ALCOHOL EDUCATION AND REHABILITATION ACCOUNT BILL 2001</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,4,1
"Tambling, Sen Grant",CLP,2001-08-22,"—In addressing Senator Harradine's questions, I draw his attention to clause 3 of the bill, where the objects of this act are set out in a number of subclauses:
(a)	to prevent alcohol and other licit substance abuse, including petrol sniffing, particularly among vulnerable population groups such as indigenous Australians and youth;
(b)	to support evidence-based alcohol and other licit substance abuse treatment, rehabilitation, research and prevention programs;
(c)	to promote community education encouraging responsible consumption of alcohol and highlighting the dangers of licit substance abuse;
(d)	to promote public awareness of the work of the Foundation or body and raise funds from the private sector for the ongoing work of the Foundation or body;
(e)	to provide funding grants to organisations with appropriate community linkages to deliver the services referred to in the above paragraphs.
It is important to draw that distinction between the licit programs and other drug initiatives of government which are handled in other government appropriations.",SENATE,<title>ALCOHOL EDUCATION AND REHABILITATION ACCOUNT BILL 2001</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,4,1
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,2001-08-22,"— I thank the parliamentary secretary. Whilst we are on that subject, I did raise in the estimates committee a number of questions, particularly the question of how this will assist in ensuring that no-one who has made a decision that they have a problem and that they need help and has made a decision to pick up the phone and ring a detox unit will be told that they have got a three-week waiting list, which is devastating to them. How is this legislation going to ensure that those people will be able to immediately go into a program which will be designed to assist them with their alcoholism?",SENATE,<title>ALCOHOL EDUCATION AND REHABILITATION ACCOUNT BILL 2001</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,4,1
"Tambling, Sen Grant",CLP,2001-08-22,"—The government shares Senator Harradine's concerns regarding the need for quick access to rehabilitation services for people with an alcohol addiction. The foundation will be required through its constitution to provide 85 per cent of its funding to professional and community organisations whose charter is to provide rehabilitation and other specific services to alcohol-dependent people and their families. The government has every expectation that the funding available through the foundation will make a significant difference to the availability of places and access to such services, ensuring a more timely response to people in need.
I would point out that this legislation is providing the funding. The foundation will act as the filter and provide the process by which that will meet. It will be up to the various organisations—hopefully many community based—to provide the actual services. So it will not be the government acting as a service delivery agency. I appreciate the concerns Senator Harradine raises about getting quick access, getting quick delivery of services, and that will be a matter that I am sure the foundation will oversight very carefully in any of the bodies making proposals to it and in monitoring their progress.
 (Senator Lightfoot)—The question is that opposition amendment No. 2 moved by Senator Evans be agreed to.
Question resolved in the negative.",SENATE,<title>ALCOHOL EDUCATION AND REHABILITATION ACCOUNT BILL 2001</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,4,1
"Knowles, Sen Susan",LP,2001-08-22,"—I seek leave to table some additional information from the Australian Associated Brewers and also from the Aboriginal Drug and Alcohol Council that has been provided to the Community Affairs Legislation Committee. I apologise to Senator Harradine that I was unable to give him any further details.
Leave granted.",SENATE,<title>ALCOHOL EDUCATION AND REHABILITATION ACCOUNT BILL 2001</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,4,1
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2001-08-22,"—I move opposition amendment No. 3:
(3)	Page [6] (after line 18), at the end of the Bill, add:
15  Accountability etc.
	(1)	The Foundation and any replacement authority are deemed to be Commonwealth authorities for the purposes of Divisions 2 and 3 of Part 3 of the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997.
	(2)	The Minister must cause a copy of each business plan of the Foundation or a replacement body to be tabled in each House of the Parliament as soon as practicable after it has been finalised by the Foundation or a replacement body, as the case may be.
This amendment seeks to insert an accountability clause into this very small bill. That would essentially do two things. Firstly, it seeks to ensure that the foundation will have to report to parliament, be subject to the Auditor-General and be accountable at estimates committees by ensuring that it is deemed to be a Commonwealth authority for the purpose of the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act. The opposition is grateful for the advice from the clerks that these goals will be achieved by this amendment.
The foundation will be clearly seen to be a public body publicly accountable for spending public money, rather than a private creature lacking such accountability. That goes to the argument that I have been trying to put throughout this committee stage that this parliament should ensure that accountability mechanisms are contained in the legislation. The second part of the amendment implements the memorandum of understanding reached between the Democrats and the government to ensure that the business plan to be produced by the foundation is tabled in the parliament and hence becomes a public document. I know we are to be reassured that all of that will happen anyway—trust us, it will all be okay!—but the point I have been trying to make through this debate is that these things ought to be in the legislation.
Senator Harradine, your intervention was useful. I had tried earlier in the debate to say that it was perfectly appropriate for people to negotiate outside of the formal process here, and I have no problem with that, but at the end of the day we had the opportunity to get it right. I think you might have missed some of the earlier debate. I also, I might say, before I got a bit excited, did pay tribute to Senator Lees's contributions to these issues and her interest in them. I do not want to make this a personal attack, but I am most concerned about the process and about making sure we get it right. The opposition think this amendment makes sure we have got the proper accountability measures in place and that this foundation is accountable to parliament for those public moneys. We think it is a very proper measure, one that should not cause any excitement and should not be seen as dangerous. We think this amendment would enhance the bill, and I urge the Senate to support it.",SENATE,<title>ALCOHOL EDUCATION AND REHABILITATION ACCOUNT BILL 2001</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,4,1
"Lees, Sen Meg",AD,2001-08-22,"— This foundation is to be established as an incorporated charitable trust. We have already had a number of discussions about the issue of accountability, and I guess the Labor Party are going to continue to say that there are problems, but in fact there are not. The Auditor-General will be auditing and properly supervising in many ways the audit process and the accounts of the foundation. The bill requires the minister to table a copy of every funding agreement and any variation to any funding agreement in each house of federal parliament within 15 sitting days. We are not moving to a completely independent company that runs off and does its own thing. This organisation will be accountable to parliament, we will have oversight of it and we will keep a very close watch on where every single cent is spent. However, as I have said before, we do not want this money back into government coffers just to be distributed in a regular way as money that they would put into alcohol programs. This is additional money. Setting this body up as an incorporated charitable trust will hopefully also encourage ongoing donations that can be tax deductible so that after the bulk of the money is spent in four years there will still be more money raised, as I said in my second reading contribution, perhaps through the beer industry or the wine industry or, indeed, industry generally by people who are concerned about the abuse of legal substances. Indeed, by the end of this month, the foundation is required to submit a detailed business plan. So I say to the opposition: obviously we all want to see in this place full accountability, but it has already been done.",SENATE,<title>ALCOHOL EDUCATION AND REHABILITATION ACCOUNT BILL 2001</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,4,1
"Tambling, Sen Grant",CLP,2001-08-22,"—The government does not support the proposed Labor amendment. The memorandum of understanding establishes the foundation as an independent organisation, as Senator Lees has just outlined. It is not appropriate for such an organisation to be subject to the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act, any more than it would be appropriate for another independent charity such as the Heart Foundation or the Salvation Army to be subject to the act because they receive Commonwealth funding. 
I am sure that, given the level of funding I outlined in answer to Senator Harradine's question between now and the year 2005, there will be a number of occasions on which senators can ask occasions, particularly in the Senate estimates committee, of the officials of the Department of Health and Aged Care. That and the other normal accounting and auditing processes, I think, would give the level of security that the committee is looking for.",SENATE,<title>ALCOHOL EDUCATION AND REHABILITATION ACCOUNT BILL 2001</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,4,1
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2001-08-22,"—I would like to ask a question of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Aged Care because the contribution of Senator Lees and the parliamentary secretary actually confirmed my confusion on this subject. Senator Lees stated that what we have created here is an `incorporated charitable trust'. Those words were not used by the minister. When I asked the question of Professor Webster, the soon-to-be chair of this organisation, what form this foundation was to take, I am almost certain he replied—I will check the Hansard—that it was to be a company limited by guarantee. This seems to me to highlight the problem: the legislation does not tell us what we are creating; it is not defined in the legislation. As Senator Lees is one of the authors of this legislation and stated in her contribution then that it is going to be an incorporated charitable trust and as I am sure Professor Webster indicated at the hearing that it was to be a company limited by guarantee, before we pour $115 million into this, is someone able to tell me what it is?",SENATE,<title>ALCOHOL EDUCATION AND REHABILITATION ACCOUNT BILL 2001</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,4,1
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,2001-08-22,"— I think that is a good question and I am sure the chamber would be obliged of a response to that. I am somewhat confused. Yes, you could ask questions of health department officials. I have done that over the years.
—With varying success.
—With varying success. I agree with what Senator Evans says. Unless the issue is now down in the legislation, there could well be confusion at a later date which is not going to do the trust corporation any good at all. Certainly, the principle of public accountability will not be assisted unless we have it, as suggested by Senator Evans, in the legislation.",SENATE,<title>ALCOHOL EDUCATION AND REHABILITATION ACCOUNT BILL 2001</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,4,1
"Tambling, Sen Grant",CLP,2001-08-22,"—I am advised that the actual structure of the organisation will be a public company limited by guarantee, and it is certainly intended that the foundation will also be able to accept charitable donations. The model likely to be adopted by the foundation reflects the specifications of the memorandum of understanding between the government and the Australian Democrats for an independent charitable body whose primary role is to distribute funding to non-government organisations to address the issue of alcohol and other licit substance abuse. The MOU requires the foundation to meet a number of stringent accountability mechanisms, and these have been incorporated into the legislation, the funding agreement and/or the constitution as appropriate. I am also advised—and I think this information was made available to the committee at the time it considered the legislation—that the foundation's constitution is currently being developed by a major law firm which specialises in company law. The constitution is a fundamental governance document which will specify in some detail the foundation's objectives, general powers, membership rules, use of public trust funds, meeting conventions and reporting requirements. There has certainly been a fair degree of consultation and discussion in this regard which I believe covers the issues of accountability that are intended to be covered by the Labor Party amendment. So the government does not see the need for the Labor Party amendment.",SENATE,<title>ALCOHOL EDUCATION AND REHABILITATION ACCOUNT BILL 2001</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,4,1
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2001-08-22,"—I may have missed it, so forgive me if did, but I do not think you actually answered the question. The question was: is this to be an incorporated charitable trust or is it to be a company limited by guarantee, and where is that specified? The second part of the question is: are you able to provide the Senate with a copy of this constitution?",SENATE,<title>ALCOHOL EDUCATION AND REHABILITATION ACCOUNT BILL 2001</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,4,1
"Tambling, Sen Grant",CLP,2001-08-22,"—I do not have a copy of the constitution at this time, and I am unable to provide that. I think it is still at the point of being developed. As I said at the outset of my comments, I am advised that the structure is that it is to be a public company limited by guarantee. The important point I was making was that it was certainly also intended to be an organisation structured in such a way as to be an independent charitable body.

—————
Statement pursuant to the order of the Senate of 26 June 2000
This amendment is circulated as a request because it provides for an amount of money representing interest to be credited to the Account and therefore available to be paid out for the purposes of the Account.  Clause 8 of the bill provides for amounts to be paid out of the Account in accordance with funding agreements, and for a reference to an amount paid out of the Account to be a reference to an amount paid out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund (CRF).  The amendment will therefore have the effect of allowing more funds to be paid out of the CRF, thereby increasing the demand on the appropriation and therefore the “proposed charge or burden on the people” within the meaning of the third paragraph of section 53 of the Constitution.  
Section 21 of the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997 (FMA Act) provides that if an Act other than the FMA Act establishes a Special Account for identified purposes, then the CRF is appropriated for expenditure for those purposes.  It is therefore a standing appropriation for the purposes of Special Accounts of this kind.  Clause 8 of the bill also constitutes an appropriation because it provides authority for money to be drawn from the CRF and therefore comes within the definition of “appropriation” in section 5 of the FMA Act.
—————
Statement by the Clerk of the Senate pursuant to the order of the Senate of 26 June 2000
The Senate has long accepted that an amendment should take the form of a request if it would have the effect of increasing expenditure out of an appropriation in the bill or a standing appropriation in a statute amended by the bill.  The Senate has also accepted amendments as requests where the standing appropriation was not in the statute to be amended by the bill but in a closely related statute which, in those cases, was part of the new tax system legislation.  In this case the appropriation is a combination of provisions in the bill itself and in a statute referred to in the bill and which applies to it.   The request is therefore in accordance with the precedents of the Senate.
This request of the House of Representatives seeks to deliver the government's promise that the full equivalent of the increase in excise collected on draught beer since 1 July 2001, less the $5 million allocated to the Historic Hotels initiative, will be appropriated and allocated to the foundation. It is there in black and white with the Prime Minister's signature on the agreement. This is an important request. We are trying to ensure that the government fulfils its commitment. The government is trying to be a little mean and tricky, I might suggest, with the mechanism it has devised by moving the money to the foundation and trying to spread the payments over four years. The effect will be to deny the foundation the full value of the money and prevent it earning a further $13 million in interest over the next four years. The foundation is being denied a significant amount of money by this mechanism. The government has decided to make payments annually to the foundation with money it has already collected but to make the smaller payments in the early years. On a rough calculation, we arrived at a figure of about $13 million worth of interest. The opposition has two issues with this. One is the question about whether the full excise that was collected has been paid over. We argue that it has not been. Given that and given the agreement between the Democrats and the government that the appropriate amount is $115 million, we then find there is a mechanism which effectively denies the foundation the full value of that.
I note that the Democrats have circulated a similar request to the one moved by me on behalf of the Australian Labor Party. I think the difference goes to the question of whether the interest accrues continually or only over three years. I will leave it for Senator Lees to explain the differences. We think this is an important request to ensure that the full benefit of the money wrongly collected from Australian beer drinkers is passed on to the foundation. There is no reason why the government should reap a windfall profit from that money by its failure to pay it immediately. On our calculations, that is another $13 million that could be used appropriately for the foundation. I would urge the chamber to support the request moved by the Australian Labor Party. I will be clearer, when Senator Lees has spoken to her amendment, as to the difference between the two requests.",SENATE,<title>ALCOHOL EDUCATION AND REHABILITATION ACCOUNT BILL 2001</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,4,1
"Lees, Sen Meg",AD,2001-08-22,"—I find it very interesting that the Labor Party is now defending the agreement between the Democrats and the government, having criticised it as being unreliable previously. However, I will let that one go. We estimate that the amount of money we are talking about is somewhere between $10 million and $12 million. We have been having extensive discussions with the government on this issue. It was apparently a Treasury decision to appropriate the money over four years instead of on a one-off basis that would have allowed the Alcohol Education and Rehabilitation Foundation to accrue the interest naturally. What we did not want to see—what we wanted to avoid at all costs—was any further delay in this bill passing. Apparently, the government has some specific technical issue with supporting the Labor amendment.
We felt that the money should be accredited to the account at the end of the period. Remember, the foundation is spending 80 per cent of this money within four years, so it will not be an issue for them; they will know how much interest is being accrued. We presented to government another alternative because we did not want to see this legislation bouncing backwards and forwards between the two houses if the government was not able to accept the Labor Party's amendment. I guess it is eventually over to government but this mechanism means that each year an amount of money is paid at the beginning of 1 July 2001, 2002, 2003 and 2004. The interest will be added up and paid in at the end. The fund will know how much it is getting. It will have maybe $13 million—our figures are suggesting closer to $10 million. We will not really know until the end of the day. But those in charge of the funding process, those on the board, will know roughly how much money is accruing and can leave the way in which it is spent open until that final year. 
So while I am not moving my amendment—I realise I cannot do that until we have dealt with this one—we wanted to cover all bases. If the government still had problems with the Labor amendment we wanted to make sure there was one there so that this bill would not go over to the House of Representatives, be changed again and bounced back here as we get closer and closer towards an election, with more and more legislation building up. We want this bill dealt with today in a form that the government is comfortable with. ",SENATE,<title>ALCOHOL EDUCATION AND REHABILITATION ACCOUNT BILL 2001</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,4,1
"Tambling, Sen Grant",CLP,2001-08-22,"—The government does not support Labor's request for an amendment on this matter but rather, is more attracted to the proposal being put forward by Senator Lees. The Commonwealth funding for the Alcohol Education and Rehabilitation Foundation has been appropriated over four years, as is usual government practice. The commitment of these funds over the next four years is $10 million in 2001, $24 million in 2002, $40 million in 2003 and $41 million in 2004, which represents a significant spending challenge to the foundation. I note Senator Evans's comment about the appropriation being a lower amount in the early years and then building up. As I am sure Senator Evans would appreciate, to get the program delivery essence of this in a proper form and to ensure the success of these types of programs, that is a more prudent and appropriate way to go about it. Initial high levels of up-front funding often then mean underspends, which is counterproductive in getting good program outcomes, given the nature of this area. I would, therefore, argue that this is an appropriate distribution of the funds. 
Because of the need to ensure that these moneys are spent on targeted, effective community based activities the funding allocations have been deliberately organised to increase over the four-year period as experience and capacity expands. As I indicated initially, with regard to the other issues we are not going to support this amendment but we are attracted to the Democrat amendment. ",SENATE,<title>ALCOHOL EDUCATION AND REHABILITATION ACCOUNT BILL 2001</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,4,1
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,2001-08-22,"— I indicated in my speech during the second reading debate that I believed the foundation is entitled to the money derived from interest on the $115 million and that I support any amendments to achieve this. I indicated that if the government considers it is not entitled to the $120 million—that was a rough figure—it must also accept that it is not entitled to keep the interest derived from this money for itself but should pass it onto the foundation. 
I am inclined to support the amendment moved by Senator Evans. If that fails, I will support the amendment proposed by Senator Lees. The government has not given the chamber a reason why, specifically and technically—if that is the problem— there is a problem with Senator Evans's amendment. If there is some such problem it has gone over my head. But I indicate to the committee that I will support the amendment moved by Senator Evans. ",SENATE,<title>ALCOHOL EDUCATION AND REHABILITATION ACCOUNT BILL 2001</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,4,1
"Tambling, Sen Grant",CLP,2001-08-22,"—I appreciate the question by Senator Harradine. Let me be totally frank: the government is more attracted to the proposal put forward by Senator Lees, not necessarily for specific or technical reasons. ",SENATE,<title>ALCOHOL EDUCATION AND REHABILITATION ACCOUNT BILL 2001</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,4,1
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2001-08-22,"—I think I am offended that, automatically, propositions advanced by Senator Lees are more attractive than ones advanced by me. That might have to be referred to the Privileges Committee! Maybe I should shut up—maybe it is obvious to everyone that propositions advanced by Senator Lees are more attractive and I just have not noticed. I think it is an indictment on the government that if what they are really saying is that it is a question of from whence the request comes that determines their attitude rather than the technical merits or the efficacy of the amendment. 
I do not want to labour the point, but I indicate that we think our approach is preferable. I suspect the reason Senator Lees's amendment is more attractive to the government is that it costs them less and they get to keep more of the money. Without any explanation to the contrary, I think that would be the general view. So, unless the minister is to articulate some other reason, I am inclined to persist with our request on the basis that he has not articulated a more worthy reason why we ought to go for the Democrat request instead. ",SENATE,<title>ALCOHOL EDUCATION AND REHABILITATION ACCOUNT BILL 2001</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,4,1
"Tambling, Sen Grant",CLP,2001-08-22,"—Let me give Senator Evans a very good and cogent reason why Senator Lees's amendment is attractive. At the end of the four-year period—looking forward to what will then be the subsequent operation of the foundation—it will provide an additional bank of funds for the ongoing program, which will hopefully be supplemented and complemented by the contributions of other community based activities of the foundation. So the specific amounts that have been agreed to under the memorandum of understanding are very much a forward commitment of the four-year program, and the accumulated interest will then provide additional finances which will enhance and add to the operation of the foundation into the future.
Request not agreed to.

where:
fixed-income percentage, for a financial year, is:
	(a)	the percentage equal to the rate of interest earned by the Commonwealth, as at the end of the financial year, on deposits held with the Reserve Bank of Australia; or
	(b)	if the Minister for Finance, by written instrument made within 28 days after the end of the financial year, determines a higher percentage—that higher percentage.
sum of amounts credited, for a financial year, means the sum of all amounts credited to the Account in that financial year or an earlier financial year.

"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2001-08-22,"—I rise to speak on the Financial Services Reform Bill 2001 and related legislation. The FSR Bill deals with the licensing of financial market operators and of clearing and settlement facilities. It introduces a single licensing framework for all financial service providers. It introduces minimum standards of conduct for financial service providers and enhanced disclosure of financial service products when dealing with retail clients. It introduces other amendments to the Corporations Act 1989, including amendments to the market misconduct provisions and to the continuous disclosure provisions. The FSR Bill will replace chapters 7 and 8 of the Corporations Act, repeal the Insurance (Agents and Brokers) Act 1984, repeal provisions in the Insurance Act 1973 and in the Retirement Savings Accounts Act 1997 and amend the Life Insurance Act 1995, the Insurance Contracts Act 1984 and the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993, among other acts. The Financial Services Reform (Consequential Provisions) Bill 2001 makes provision for the transition to the regulatory regime proposed by the FSR Bill. That bill also makes a range of amendments to other Commonwealth legislation that are necessary as a consequence of the FSR Bill. The Corporations (Fees) Amendment Bill 2001, the Corporations (National Guarantee Fund Levies) Amendment Bill 2001 and the Corporations (Compensation Arrangements Levies) Bill 2001 deal with fees and levies flowing from the FSR Bill, but they are included in separate bills to comply with section 55 of the constitution. 
Labor supports this package of legislation. These bills have been the subject of an inquiry by the parliamentary Joint Statutory Committee on Corporations and Securities, which provided an opportunity to hear from participants in the financial services industry and also to question Treasury and ASIC on aspects of this bill. I have been advised by Treasury that these bills will realise efficiency gains in cost savings for the financial services industry by:
... providing a regulatory neutral regime, moving from an industry focus of regulation—with banks being subject to one set of rules, insurance companies another, and so on— to a functional focus of regulation, regulating like activities in like ways regardless of what institution, profession or body is engaged in this activity.
The government believes that this should encourage increased competition in the industry, lower barriers of entry, reduce costs and provide greater confidence on the part of consumers. I believe that consumer confidence will be enhanced by the establishment of the consistent and comparable financial product disclosure regime that is provided for in the FSR Bill. The FSR bill will also ensure that consumers can access appropriate complaint handling mechanisms for resolving disputes with financial service providers. The Labor members therefore believe that these bills will enable consumers to make better financial decisions and will deliver advantages to consumers.
It is timely that the regulation of financial advice providers be considered by parliament. We have seen a rapid growth in the number of retail participants in the financial markets. For example, nearly one in two adult Australians now directly own shares listed on the ASX. That is not, however, the only area where Australians are investing, and the market now provides a range of products with different characteristics and objectives to cater to a range of needs. 
Beginning with Labor's decision to make superannuation compulsory, Australians have become conscious of the need to provide for their future. The demographic structure of Australian society necessitates that this be the case. Increasingly, Australians are wanting to be financially independent and this is to be encouraged and supported. They need to receive good advice from an early age and on every financial product to ensure that their objectives can be met. Australian consumers need to feel confident that they are in a position to decide their financial future and to make financial decisions. That requires that the people who advise them are competent, that they are trained and able to give the advice. It requires that consumers receive all the information they need to make a decision, that they know the total cost of a product, that they know both the return and the risks inherent in the product and that they know what biases may have influenced the provision of the advice. It also requires that ASIC be able to implement and enforce the objectives of this bill. In that regard, I note a recommendation of the government members of the parliamentary Joint Statutory Committee on Corporations and Securities, which was supported by the Labor members, that the government explore the possibility of additional funding for ASIC to allow it to meet its new responsibilities. 
This legislation has the support of the consumer groups. In a submission to the joint parliamentary committee, the Australian Consumers Association wrote:
Consumer groups have keenly anticipated the FSR Bill. Improving the consumer protection standards in financial services is a critical public policy issue in an environment where Australian consumers are increasingly asked to take responsibility for the direct management of their wealth and income, including retirement incomes ... In this regard, the ACA strongly supports the approach taken by the Bill to establish a consistent, uniform and clear regulatory platform for disclosure, licensing, codes of conduct and practices in financial services. The consumer protection aims of the Bill and the comprehensive approach taken to disclosure and licensing (including the critical issue of commission disclosure on risk products, which must continue to ensure a sound consumer protection framework) are supported by the ACA.
Similarly the Financial Services Consumer Policy Centre advised the committee:
The consumer movement has been widely anticipating this important bill which provides a new foundation for the provision of consumer protection in financial services, with particular focus on disclosure, licensing, selling practices, codes of practice and the general shift towards consistency and uniformity. We are pleased to report that we agree with the majority of the proposals, though there are a number of specific areas that we believe require further attention.
These bills are not perfect and Labor will be moving a number of amendments. Before I proceed to outline some of the omissions in the legislation, I wish to comment on its implementation. The Labor members note that there is a wide power to make regulations under the FSR Bill and that ASIC has been given extensive powers to modify the legislation. For example, under proposed section 911A(2)(k) of the bill, a person can be exempted from the requirement to hold an Australian financial services licence if they provide a service covered by an exemption prescribed in the regulations. I note that the Minister for Financial Services and Regulation said in a speech on 3 July 2001 that:
... before the introduction of choice, the Government recognises that lighter touch regulation is appropriate, and only public-offer funds, which excludes most corporate and industry funds will be subject to licensing under the Bill. This reflects the current situation. Even after choice is introduced, the regime applying to industry and corporate funds will be flexible. 
My discussions with Treasury and ASIC officers and industry participants indicate that the operational structure of industry funds and corporate funds can be accommodated within the structure of the bill. I trust that the minister will, as he has promised, continue to consider the needs of industry funds and corporate funds as this bill will apply to them.
There are many other provisions within the bill that allow the minister or ASIC to finetune the application of the bill. These include provisions governing the content of the various disclosure documents and the situations in which the disclosure documents must be given. I also note that the transitional provisions set out in the Financial Services Reform (Consequential Provisions) Bill 2001 provide a further degree of flexibility by allowing most people to transit into the new regime over a two-year period. The bill also provides for insurance multi-agents to apply for a qualified licence which will allow such agents further time to meet the competency requirement to hold a licence. The government will also introduce further amendments today which provide further concessions to insurance agents in relation to the timing of when the bill will apply to them. 
While I would have preferred, like many others, to have seen the benefits of this bill for consumers be realised at the earliest opportunity, Labor remains supportive of this legislation. By the end of the transition period, we expect every person offering or advising on a financial product to be operating under the FSR regime. The flexibility in the legislation should allow the minister, Treasury and ASIC to deal with many of the issues that have been raised with the committee. This flexibility also stems from the structure of the bill, such that only the principles of the new regulatory regime are encapsulated in the legislation. Any variance in detailed application of those principles to particular sectors or circumstances are to be dealt with in the regulations. This is a new structure and will require that the implementation of the bill by the minister be thoughtfully considered, and the impact of the bill be monitored. This is particularly important given the large number of people who are likely to be required to be licensed under the Corporations Act for the first time.
A number of my concerns raised in looking at the provisions of the legislation were met by the minister in amendments he tabled in the other place on 28 June 2001. For example, I and many others were concerned about the changes to the obligations of the financial services licensee. The original legislation only required that a financial services licensee act competently and honestly, rather than the existing requirement in the Corporations Act that a licensee act efficiently, honestly and fairly. I thought it was important that the requirement for fairness be reinstated. That phrase `efficiently, honestly and fairly' was also well understood. 
I also welcome the amendments introduced by the minister to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act in the Financial Services Reform (Consequential Provisions) Bill 2001. They mirror changes made to the Trade Practices Act since responsibility for financial services was removed from the ACCC's consumer protection jurisdiction and given to ASIC. A number of significant changes had been made to the Trade Practices Act since the jurisdiction in relation to financial services was moved to ASIC, which left financial consumers in an inferior position. The government should, having implemented the changes to the ASIC Act, have been more mindful of the need for the act to continue to mirror the Trade Practices Act. However, the government has now acted and I support the amendments.
The minister also introduced on 28 June amendments to the powers of ASIC to impose, vary or cancel conditions on licences of bodies also regulated by APRA. These provisions are to be further amended by the government today. It is necessary in the interests of consumers and efficient enforcement that ASIC not be unnecessarily curtailed by having to consult with APRA on every occasion that it imposes, varies or revokes a condition on a licence of an APRA regulated body. This would not protect consumers and would hamper ASIC's ability to respond in a timely manner. The amendments—which will require ASIC to consult with APRA before imposing, varying or revoking a condition only if such an action would, in ASIC's opinion, have the result of preventing the licensee from carrying on the activities for which APRA has regulatory or supervisory activities—appear far more workable. The issue of how APRA and ASIC interact is a vexing issue, and I note that many in the industry are concerned about how these two agencies coordinate their activities.
The final amendment introduced by the minister on 28 June which I will comment on was the change to the insider trading provisions. The wording of that offence was changed by the legislation supposedly to comply with the Criminal Code. Those changes, however, would have made the offence harder to prove. It is essential that the market be fair to protect the interests of all shareholders, including retail shareholders, and to maintain the reputation for integrity which Australia's financial markets generally enjoy.
I should also add my support to the changes in the continuous disclosure regime which are proposed in the FSR Bill. It is proposed that a breach of section 1001A will now be both a criminal offence and a civil penalty provision. This will assist ASIC to enforce Australia's continuous disclosure regime. There is sufficient evidence, I believe, to justify this. For example, in a joint study conducted last year by the ASX and ASIC of listed technology companies, ASIC concluded that a number of companies were ignoring the basics of good company disclosure or, worse, were not even aware of those obligations. Further, a survey last year by the University of Sydney Accounting Foundation found that many directors felt that the continuous disclosure provisions `1acked teeth'. Accordingly, Labor will be supporting this amendment.
However, this legislation, like the minister, is silent on the issue of analyst independence. It is time for the minister to acknowledge that analysts have a responsibility and obligation to ensure that shareholders understand the basis on which their reports are provided. A number of retail consumers rely on analysts' reports to provide accurate information. They believe the reports to be a fair and true assessment of a company's future performance. It is not acceptable that there is a code which is understood by some in the market but is unknown to others. Consumers need to know, or be able to determine, whether a report is biased because of work being done in other sections of the financial institution for which the broker works. I have previously quoted an extract from a speech by Laura Unger, the Acting Chairman of the SEC, but it is worth repeating:
One of the most important sources of information has always been analysts. Unlike others, they put their name on their work-product and professional reputations are at stake. But, for a variety of reasons, including recent market events, there is scepticism of the objectivity of analysts' recommendations lately. One survey showed that in 2000, 99.1% of brokerage-house analysts' recommendations were `strong buy', `buy' or `hold' recommendations.
I have just returned from the US, where a congressional committee is inquiring into the issue of analyst independence. Some of the evidence has been quite extraordinary. Analysts have been appearing and saying, `Look, everybody knows that “hold” means “sell”.' The last time I went through the dictionary `hold' certainly did not mean `sell', but that is the code you had to understand. If Laura Unger has not convinced you of the problem, an article on Mary Meeker, a stock analyst at Morgan Stanley known as the Queen of the Internet, is terrifying. Fortune magazine on 14 May 2001 wrote:
Though it's hardly news anymore that the Chinese Wall once separating investment banking from Wall Street research has eroded, what you realize in talking to Meeker is the extent to which these two supposedly conflicting functions—keeping companies happy and giving investors honest stock advice—are now organically intertwined. She talks unashamedly, for instance, about how she used her research to help land banking deals for Morgan Stanley. And she describes how upset she became when Morgan Stanley lost a hotly contested deal to archrival Goldman Sachs. “I had never lost an IPO mandate in my life for a company that I wanted to take public,” she says, sounding like, well an investment banker.
This is an issue which needs to be addressed. I understand that the industry, and the Securities Institute of Australia in particular, is examining this issue and preparing guidelines. I encourage that work to continue and, when completed, I encourage industry to adopt such guidelines. Labor is committed to seeing this practice cleaned up. Investors need to be able to rely on advice that is an intelligent analysis of a company's performance.
I will only mention briefly those areas in which we are seeking amendments. They are aimed at ensuring that Australian consumers receive the information they need to make informed financial decisions, that licensees act appropriately and that restrictions are placed on unsolicited telephone calls so as to protect consumers from the unsavoury type of behaviour. In particular, we will be seeking to restore the hawking prohibitions in relation to managed investment products. We will also be seeking the removal of the declared professional body provisions and the proposal to record telephone conversations in relation to takeovers.
Labor will also be moving an amendment to allow regulations to be made to specify certain activities which, even if performed by a lawyer in the ordinary course of their activities, will be considered financial product advice. In Labor's view, it is no longer appropriate for unlicensed persons to operate mortgage investment schemes, even if it was the practice in the past that lawyers operated such schemes. I know my colleague Senator Sherry will be saying much more on this when he speaks.
Before I conclude, I wish to confirm Labor's commitment to full disclosure of commissions for all financial products. We remain committed to achieving this objective and will be seeking a commitment from the government that this bill requires that. Labor is, however, supportive of these bills and endorses the efforts encapsulated in this legislation to assist Australians to make informed financial decisions. I note that the committee report has been tabled and I would like to acknowledge Senator Chapman, who has done an enormous amount of work on this bill. It was a lengthy process, as I am sure Senator Chapman would agree. I did not get a chance to speak when the report on the bill was tabled, but I would like to thank the committee staff, who did a mountain of work to get everything ready so that we could debate the bill today. I acknowledge the minister's commitment to good consumer legislation and look forward to a speedy debate.",SENATE,<title>FINANCIAL SERVICES REFORM BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,5,1
"Chapman, Sen Grant",LP,2001-08-22,"—There is absolutely no doubt that this Financial Services Reform Bill 2001 is landmark legislation. It covers the financial services sector of our economy which, as I understand it, now makes up some seven per cent of the Australian economy. The bill is certainly the most major, and possibly the last, piece in the jigsaw of the government's program of reform of the Corporations Law and of the financial services sector of our economy. So, as I said, it is very important, landmark legislation and, as Senator Conroy from the opposition said a few moments ago, it did attract very detailed attention from the parliamentary Joint Statutory Committee on Corporations and Securities, which I chair. I welcome the fact that, on behalf of the opposition, Senator Conroy has indicated support for this legislation. There is no doubt that the uniform structure which this legislation will establish in terms of the education and training requirements, the licensing requirements and the product disclosure requirements for anyone involved in the financial services industry and marketing what are now called financial products—that is, investments in one form or another, whether equities, deposit products or insurance products—will be a major step forward for this industry. Therefore, the opposition's support for this legislation is very important.
As I said, the joint committee did examine this legislation in great detail. In a sense we have examined it on two occasions now. There was a draft exposure bill published a year or so ago, which the committee examined. It made certain recommendations with regard to that exposure draft and, as a consequence of that, the government introduced this legislation. Again the committee examined this legislation in great detail and produced a report that was finally tabled out of session last week. 
In that report we indicated very strong support for the legislation, not only in our own determination as a committee, but also based on the evidence that the committee received. The evidence across all sectors of the financial services industry did indicate very strong support for the legislation; however, some evidence we received also indicated that there were certain areas that could be improved with amendments to make the legislation even better. It is to those areas that I want to direct attention this morning, based on the report that the committee handed down last week. I say at the outset that I welcome the cooperation of Minister Hockey in his dealings with the committee and in his response to the report and its recommendations. By and large, Minister Hockey and the government have accepted the recommendations of the committee which, with a few exceptions, were unanimous recommendations: in other words, they were recommendations of all parties. The government members, the Labor members such as Senator Conroy and a couple of his colleagues and the Australian Democrats' Senator Murray all supported the bulk of the proposed amendments put forward in the committee report.
The first proposed amendment dealt with what in the previous Corporations Law had been an exemption provided for the media, including journalists who were reporting on financial affairs and economic matters. In the original legislation, it was proposed that those media representatives be required to be licensed, because of the possibility that their comments might be regarded as financial advice. The committee recommended an amendment to the bill to restore the previous exemption that existed for the media generally, including financial journalists, in the Corporations Law. Again, I welcome the fact that the minister has accepted that proposed amendment, and in the committee stage an amendment will be moved to that effect to restore that exemption for media representatives.
The second issue on which we made a recommendation for change was with regard to the proposal for a requirement that conversations in relation to takeover proposals should be recorded. In other words, conversations between the bidder in a takeover proposal and shareholders of the target should be tape recorded. We regarded this as unnecessary and, in fact, quite impractical. However, the government regard this as still essential with regard to retail shareholders. They have, therefore, accepted our recommendation in part and will move an amendment to limit the requirement to record telephone conversations during takeovers to conversations with retail investors—that is, the small shareholders—but they will accept our amendment to the extent that it applies to major corporate shareholders in regard to takeovers. Again, I welcome the acceptance of that recommendation from our committee.
Another issue in our report relates to the insurance industry. We recommended, for instance, that simply providing a quote for an insurance policy over the telephone should not be defined as financial advice under the legislation. The government have accepted that recommendation and again will be moving an amendment to give effect to that. They are also going to accept our recommendation that certain types of insurance should be exempt from the requirements of the legislation. The best example, I guess, in terms of a cooling-off period would be travel insurance. For instance, you might have a travel insurance policy that only lasts for a 10-day trip someone is taking and yet under the original legislation a 14-day cooling-off period would apply to that policy. Quite clearly it was nonsense that someone could actually take their 10-day trip, have their travel insurance and then come back and say, `I am still within the cooling-off period, I do not want that travel insurance' and get a refund. Again, I welcome the fact that the government has responded positively to our recommendation that, for certain short-term insurance policies, travel insurance being the best example, that cooling-off period will not apply.
Another issue addressed by the committee was in relation to professional bodies. This particularly relates to lawyers and accountants and the fact that, in the course of their general advising of clients on legal and financial matters, that could have been regarded as financial advice and required them to be licensed under the legislation. We, as a committee, recommended that what we said could be defined as incidental advice provided by lawyers and accountants in the normal course of their business should be exempt from the legislation. Again, the government has responded positively to that recommendation. Amendments will be included to provide that advice provided by lawyers in the ordinary course of their activities as a lawyer that is reasonably regarded as a necessary part of those activities is exempt from the definition of financial product advice. That will similarly apply to registered tax agents.
I note that there is some controversy in the media at the moment, apparently aroused by accountants saying that this does not go far enough in relation to them, but it seems to me that most practising accountants who are likely to be giving advice to their clients will be registered tax agents. Obviously there is a continuum, if you like, in the nature of advice given by accountants. At one end, it is clearly advice of a type which would not be covered by this legislation and would not require them to be licensed; at the other end of the continuum, they could clearly be giving direct financial product advice and should come under the licensing arrangements. In the middle of that, there is probably a grey area. I believe that the proposals that the government is putting forward for amendment will provide an appropriate dividing line, if you like, between what is and what is not financial advice that will be subject to those licensing requirements. Therefore, I believe that the concerns of the accountants in relation to that issue have been covered by the government.
Another issue that was raised before the committee was pooled superannuation funds—that is, funds that act as aggregators of superannuation moneys from other funds and, in effect, are operating at a wholesale level rather than at a retail level. Again it is my understanding that the government will include amendments to ensure that they are not caught by the requirements of the legislation. They are all very important amendments that came under consideration by the committee, and we recommended that changes should be made to the legislation. It is gratifying to me that the government has accepted, by and large, those particular recommendations.
One of the major issues that was raised with the committee was the potential impact of this legislation on a sector of small business—in particular, those who have previously operated as insurance agents, selling general insurance or perhaps selling term life insurance, but not involved in marketing financial products that have an investment return component. There were several issues of concern to that sector of the financial services industry. The first of those concerns related to the potential impact of the legislation on what might be described as their right to work. The second issue was the impact of the legislation on their client base—the ownership of their client base and the ownership of the continuing streams of commission, including trailing commissions, that would flow from previous sales of products to those clients. We regarded those as very important issues. The legislation, as drafted, could have resulted in a detrimental impact on those agents, simply by the fact that a new regime was coming into place. The government has again considered that particular issue and I welcome its positive response. The government will now amend the legislation to provide that agents who have contracts with insurance companies will be enabled for those contracts to continue in operation for the term of those contracts. If that is, in effect, a perpetual contract, obviously that contractual arrangement will continue infinitely into the future. I think that provides very important protection for that sector of the industry.
I note that that again has aroused some controversy in the media in the last 24 hours, particularly in the Financial Review, where Mr Cleary—their journalist—and their editorial this morning refer to that matter. I quote from the Financial Review editorial. It says:
... the Government is set to give agents what looks like an excessively high level of protection against losing their tenure as an authorised representative.
It also quotes the chief executive of the Financial Planning Association, Mr Ken Breakspear, as saying:
... the growth of small financial planners in recent years shows they have not been hurt by the arrival of the Corporations Law, and small financial advisers would also prosper under the Financial Services Reform Bill, contrary to fears that small business would suffer a loss of market value.
It goes on to say:
It [federal government] should now think carefully whether it is wise and in the interests of consumers to protect small agents against contract termination unless they have actually been convicted of fraud.
That is not actually in the terms of the amendment that the government is proposing. There is no reference to the limits on the protection of their contracts; it simply means that their existing contracts will continue.
I think it is important to make the point that this is not an excessively high level of protection. It is saying that if an insurance agent has a contract with an insurance company to provide services in this area, that contract will continue. That is not providing excessive protection; it is simply recognising that there is an existing legal relationship between the agent and the insurance company and that legal relationship should not be affected detrimentally by this legislation. In other words, the agent should not be put in any worse position by this legislation than he would be had this legislation not been introduced. That is, I think, what any reasonable person would regard as quite an acceptable position. It does not in any way give the agent any advantage; it simply ensures that he is not disadvantaged as a result of what is a new regime, new legislation, coming into place, which, as I said, is very important and beneficial legislation for the industry overall. I am not a lawyer but I would have thought—and the minister might be able to help me on this—that all we are doing is protecting the common law rights of insurance agents for their contractual obligations to continue to be met.
As for Mr Breakspear's comments, of course he represents the Financial Planning Association, which tends to be the bigger end of town—the bigger businesses that will certainly become very important under the new regime. They are essentially large businesses that have resulted from the aggregation of the former individual independent agents into rather large financial planning companies which by and large are now owned by the product manufacturers, owned by the big financial institutions. So Mr Breakspear does not really speak for those at the small business level when he says that the small financial planners have thrived under the new Corporations Law. What he needs to do is to consider exactly what has happened, because what has happened is that a lot of the small financial planners have been aggregated into major companies, major institutions, rather than continuing to operate as small operators.
So I regard that proposed amendment as being of singular importance in ensuring that those small independent agents have the opportunity to continue in business on the basis of their existing contractual arrangements. Obviously, if there are provisions in those contracts that allow them to be terminated and the termination provisions are spelt out, they will still apply. But, if those contracts continue infinitely, those agents will have the opportunity to continue to operate on their existing basis, at least in terms of their rights to maintain their income stream from pre-existing commissions that have previously been earned from sales and also in terms of the goodwill or asset value of their businesses. If they have buyback arrangements in terms of the goodwill with the insurance companies with whom they have these contractual arrangements, they will continue, and that will ensure that they are not, as I say, financially disadvantaged by this legislation.
The other issue on which the parliamentary Joint Statutory Committee on Corporations and Securities made a recommendation also relates to the insurance agents. That was in relation to the disclosure of commissions. Having examined this matter twice, the committee have come to the conclusion that it should not be a requirement that insurance agents disclose their commission on what are described as risk insurance products, that is, those products that provide insurance against risk—it might be fire insurance, home insurance, term life insurance, crop insurance and so on—which is a source of income for many of these small insurance agents. We do not believe there is any consumer demand for disclosure in this particular area. We believe that it will be detrimental, particularly for those insurance agents operating in small communities, to their capacity to earn an income from selling these forms of insurance without any demonstrable benefit to the consumer. We do not believe, on the evidence presented to us, that the commissions play any significant role in the advice that an insurance agent might give to a customer with regard to the options they have for this form of insurance. As a committee, we recommended that for this form of insurance the commission should not be required to be disclosed.
Another very important aspect of this, brought to our attention in evidence, is the attempts by insurance companies to standardise and force down commissions. We believe that the mandatory disclosure of commissions for this type of insurance will hasten that process. What that in effect means is reduced incomes for the insurance agents, which means they will have fewer resources with which to run their businesses. Quite often it is the insurance agent that acts as the intermediary between their client and the insurance company when there is a claim to be made. It is the insurance agent who goes in to bat for their client against the insurance company if there is a dispute with regard to payment of a claim or whatever. If those small operators have reduced incomes because of a move to standardise and push down, drive down, commissions, they have less income and therefore fewer resources available within their businesses. It does reduce their capacity to have the resources available to them to effectively go in to bat for their clients against the insurance companies in the event of a dispute. That was a very important factor in the committee coming to the conclusion that they did: that these forms of commissions should not require disclosure. The government have not accepted that particular recommendation and they will not amend the legislation to bring that recommendation into effect. They have made an on-balance decision; I accept that but I do regret it. (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>FINANCIAL SERVICES REFORM BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,5,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2001-08-22,"—I rise to speak to the Financial Services Reform Bill 2001 and its related bills. These bills arise out of the sixth stage of the Corporate Law Economic Reform Program, or CLERP as it is colloquially known. I have said before that CLERP sounds like a troll's name, and I still think it does. Anyway, CLERP it is. CLERP was conceived by the coalition in March 1997 as a response to the Wallis report and to comprehensively improve Australia's corporate law as part of its drive to promote business and economic development in Australia. That intention has consistently been fully supported by the Australian Labor Party and the Australian Democrats because, on a cross-party basis, all parties did believe that the Corporations Law needed to be modernised, improved, made more efficient and effective and to contribute more to Australia's competitiveness. We, the Democrats, also believed it needed to take into account social values as well as economic values, and in this whole process we have paid a lot of attention to accountability aspects and aspects of fairness as well as aspects of economics, efficiency and competition.
The CLERP process released discussion papers on six issues. Those were known as `Accounting standards', `Fundraising', `Director's duties and corporate governance', `Takeovers', `Electronic commerce' and `Financial markets and investment products'. The release of those papers was an extremely useful commencement for this long exercise of review and reform. The Senate dealt with some of those issues—accounting standards, fundraising, director's duties and corporate governance—in October 1999. The Democrats played an active role in the passage of the Corporate Law Economic Reform Program Act 1999, and we made some very constructive contributions and amendments.
The fifth issues paper out of CLERP titled `Electroniccommerce'seems to have disappeared into the ether. When the minister responds to the speeches in the second reading debate, perhaps he might be able to refresh my memory on what has happened to CLERP 5—where it has gone and whether it might ever reappear in any other form. I think, if you are going to present a package as your overall approach, we at least ought to be taken out of our misery and know whether it is looming in the background or whether it has disappeared.
Today we are dealing with CLERP 6, which was originally titled `Financial markets and investment products'. A discussion paper on CLERP 6 was released in March 1999. To give credit where credit is due, Treasury has undertaken an extensive consultation process over the two-year period. In addition to that consultation, the Joint Statutory Committee on Corporations and Securities inquired into the draft Financial Services Reform Bill and reported in August last year. That committee then again inquired into the bill before us today and reported last Wednesday.
I want to take this opportunity, because none of us were able to speak to the tabling of the report, to comment extremely favourably on the process that was undertaken. To my mind, the position we arrive at today of addressing this bill is at the end of what is the very best of the processes that the parliament can throw up. I mentioned earlier that Treasury have consulted heavily and not defensively in this matter. They have been prepared to make adjustments as a good case has been made.
Secondly, the Joint Statutory Committee on Corporations and Securities chaired by Senator Grant Chapman has, on a cross-party basis, done an extremely thorough review. As Senator Conroy said earlier—and I agree with him—Senator Chapman and the hardworking secretariat are to be complimented on the thoroughness and effort that they put into the process of review and the consequences. In fact, as the committee moved into its latter stages, at times we were hard-pressed to keep up with the minister's rapid and positive response to the recommendations that were being made to us in submissions. As the submissions were made and the committee was hearing them and as the committee was indicating in its questioning and response a positive response to the case at issue, out would come the minister saying, “I agree.' That is very helpful to a committee, because it indicates that you can move on and make a recommendation knowing where you are. A round of compliments to everyone: the Treasury, the advisers supporting the minister, the chair and deputy chair of the committee, the secretariat, the members of the various parties on it and, most importantly of all, the people who made submissions.
Before I conclude my congratulations, I would like to record some thanks to my own adviser, Lee Jones. When I was not able to be at hearings he tracked this whole process. I think sometimes we need to remind the chamber just how important our advisers are to us in arriving at informed decisions and in assisting us to progress legislation in this manner. I would urge this government and any government to ensure that the pay and the conditions and the terms under which both our electorate staff and the staff generally made available to political parties are kept current and competitive to ensure that we keep good people.
I return to the report. The Wallis report had recommended the introduction of a single licensing regime for all financial sales, advice and dealing, and the creation of a consistent and comparable product disclosure framework—a great principle and highly desirable but very difficult in practice to get right. The general aim of the bill is to provide uniform regulation of all financial products, a single licensing framework for financial service providers, minimum standards of conduct for financial service providers dealing with retail clients, uniform disclosure obligations for all financial products provided to retail clients and flexibility for authorisation of market operator and clearing and settlement facilities. The Democrats support the objects of the bill. However, we have seen consistently through the process scope for improving the bill in a few areas and have welcomed government amendments. There are other amendments on the floor from us and from others, and we will deal with those on their merits.
The recent report of the Joint Statutory Committee on Corporations and Securities into the bill made a number of very constructive recommendations, and the Democrats supplementary report made one very important one that I want to refer to in this discussion in relation to what have become termed collectively as `ethical investments'. Ethical investments are investments that are made taking into account the use to which the money invested will be put and the wider implications of the use of that money. I use the term `ethical investment' to denote an investment that has been made when the investor of the money has been cognisant of the social, environmental and ethical impacts of the product that the entity has sold to him or her and the way in which that money will be used.
It has been estimated that approximately $250 million is currently invested in ethical investment funds in Australia. This is extremely low and is likely to escalate rapidly. Socially responsible investment now accounts for around $US2.16 trillion—I will repeat that: $US2.16 trillion—in the United States and $A7.2 billion in the United Kingdom. This is a massive new market. Industry specialists believe that ethical investment in Australia will follow United States and United Kingdom trends and grow to become a multibillion dollar industry in the next five years. That is not far away. Consumers are investing in ethical investment products not only because of a perceived benefit for the environment and society as a whole but also because they are also viewing an ethical investment as carrying less risk than so-called unscreened investment whilst providing the potential for higher returns.
A KPMG survey conducted in the middle of last year showed that 69 per cent of Australians would consider socially responsible investing if given the opportunity. The Democrats are of the view that the investing public would welcome being given the information necessary to allow them to know when an investment is environmentally, socially and/or ethically responsible. However, the Democrats are alert to recent trends where exaggerated claims are made about financial products, and that is why we think some legislative attention is necessary. There is support in the government for this area of interest. Just over a week ago, on 13 August, the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, Senator Hill, commented in a press release:
In order to assess companies, socially responsible investment fund managers or individual investors need particular information about environmental and social performance but in Australia these details can be difficult to find.
The minister made that comment when he announced the release of a new business guide to socially responsible investment. That sort of initiative is a good start, but the Democrats do believe that we need to do more. We are not attempting to prescribe ethically or socially responsible investments, but we would like to encourage a marketplace which is well informed about which funds include socially responsible considerations in investment decisions.
If when we reach the committee stage the chamber agrees to the amendment that I will be moving, it needs to be made clear that Australia will not be out on a limb relative to the rest of the world. In other words, we will be pursuing best practice. In July of last year an amendment to the UK Pensions Act was enacted in the United Kingdom which requires pension trustees to disclose their policy on socially responsible investment in the statement of investment principles. The law does not require any fund to change its policy, but its clear purpose is to draw attention to their practices and encourage voluntary policy and operational changes.
It would be almost impossible for a person to come up with a neat definition of what is ethical. That issue is something that the opponents of this sort of measure will loudly trumpet in trying to resist what I am proposing. However, it needs to be understood that the person who decides the ethics of the situation and whether they are acceptable is the investor. All that the fund promoters need to do is spell out against set criteria the non-financial considerations that are taken into account when making investment decisions when using the investors' funds.
In the majority report of the corporations and securities committee the argument against mandating this disclosure is that market forces will deliver consumers the most transparent disclosure of socially responsible investments. The suggestion is that making the requirement mandatory is unnecessary. The Democrats would like to actively progress the advent of these types of products. It will be useful to start this process by asking in law that those who do take into account ethical, environmental or social considerations state that unequivocally. In that way, we believe that the interest in the availability of ethical investments will be heightened. Any company making a claim that it considers environmental, social or ethical matters when making an investment should be required to substantiate that claim which conveys a marketing value to the product.
The Democrats have two objectives in relation to ethical investments. The first is to encourage a market for ethical investments and to promote awareness of their availability. As I mentioned before, Australia currently has about $250 million invested in ethical investments. We would like to encourage the growth of that figure. The second objective is to ensure that as the market develops consumers are provided with accurate information about the investments. We do not want a situation to arise where promoters start to misrepresent their investments as ethical investments because of the marketing benefits that that label confers. If anybody thinks it is a fanciful view that there will be boosterism of this sort, please pay attention to the nature of the mass marketing investment schemes which are currently causing over 65,000 Australian investors to experience a swathe of irritation, anxiety and disaster. In many respects, those prospectuses and marketing tools used to promote those investments used boosted information to mislead consumers. In this area we need to avoid that.
Claims about ethical investments should be able to be substantiated. The Australian Securities and Investments Commission should be empowered to develop guidelines that must be complied with where a product disclosure statement makes a claim that environmental, social or ethical considerations are taken into account in selecting, retaining or realising an investment. Some might put to me the question why we are singling out claims about ethical investing for special attention when there are already provisions in the Corporations Act which prohibit misleading and deceptive conduct. This bill focuses on full disclosure and encourages it. If you were to use that argument, you might as well say that you do not need the bill at all, because the Corporations Law already says that you should not mislead and deceive people. That has been found to be insufficient. The primary reason is that the imbalance in the access to information is worrying the government, the opposition and us. In the absence of any other requirements, if a statement states that, yes, the managers of the fund take ethical considerations into account, where can the investor go to try to confirm that? The promoters of the fund should be obliged to show their hand to such an investor and detail against set criteria why they claim that their investment is ethical.
The Democrats are not looking to impose substantial additional costs on fund managers and promoters or to see consumers swamped with pages and pages of useless information, but we are wanting to see consumers provided with sufficient information to judge whether they accept that an investment product is indeed ethical. It should be a judgment by investors, not by promoters. I can recall the passage of the Company Law Review Bill 1997 in June 1998, when the government and others in the business community thought the sky was about to fall in when the Senate passed my amendment which included the requirement to annually report on compliance with environmental regulation. They also thought the sky was going to fall in when we passed the amendment that required disclosure of directors' fees, which I note the government now supports fully.
The sky did not fall in. I understand that, while it took a short time for business to become comfortable with what was required to comply with section 299(1)(f), it now does not present a concern in terms of compliance. It has done what I intended, and that is to focus corporate minds on this issue. The Democrats were years ahead on triple bottom line advocacy but now, too, corporate bodies accept this as mainstream. I am hopeful that I have the same support of the Labor Party on this issue as they courageously gave me on the environmental reporting amendment that I referred to earlier. I appreciate that support, and I note that they also supported us on that amendment we moved in 1998.
The other matter which I should elaborate on is the Democrat second reading amendment that I have circulated and now move. I move:
At the end of the motion, add:
“and that the requirement in the legislation that commissions on risk products be fully disclosed be referred to the Joint Statutory Committee on Corporations and Securities for inquiry and report on or before 1 October 2003”.
The amendment relates to disclosure of commissions on risk products. In its current form the bill requires full disclosure of those commissions, and, prima facie, the Democrats support disclosure. However, this is what I had to say on that matter in the corporations and securities committee report:
I can understand the argument for complete exclusion of risk-based products from the commission disclosure regime. If that is a view that is carried so be it. However partial disclosure—
as recommended by the committee—
seems inappropriate.
If it is accepted that the payment of a commission is significant to a customer then surely full disclosure of the quantum is also important. Presumably the quantum determines the degree to which any agent is likely to be influenced by the existence of the commission.
Given a choice between requiring disclosure and not, the Democrats will almost invariably err on the side of disclosing ...
However, I recognise the point made my Senator Chapman that there is concern. I therefore want the committee to use the period of transition to review this issue and, if necessary, go back to the government of the day and suggest further change before the time has elapsed for the introduction of this. That will allow cooler heads to prevail while this is reconsidered. So I do hope that the Senate will support my second reading amendment to get the committee to look in more depth at this issue and to come back when it is not so pressed by the need to push through the main body of the legislation.",SENATE,<title>FINANCIAL SERVICES REFORM BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,5,1
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2001-08-22,"—The Senate is considering a number of bills in regard to financial services reform. Before I go any further, I would like to acknowledge the work of the parliamentary Joint Statutory Committee on Corporations and Securities. I notice that Senator Chapman, the chair of the committee, sat through this debate. I think it is important to acknowledge the work of these committees because it often goes unacknowledged. The examination of the issues that we consider in this place is very important to our understanding of those issues and also is a very important outlet for individuals and various interest groups to express a particular view on legislation and for that to be taken into account to varying degrees by governments of the day.
The bills that we are considering constitute the third tranche of the government's legislative response to the financial system inquiry report—commonly known as the Wallis inquiry. The inquiry concluded that the complex and fragmented regulatory framework in financial services was creating inefficiencies for financial service providers and confusion for consumers. It recommended the introduction of a single licensing regime for all financial sales advice and dealing, and the creation of a consistent and comparable product disclosure framework. It argued that these changes would generate substantial benefits for both the industry and consumers.
It is claimed that consumers in particular will benefit from improved levels of disclosure of information, improved access to appropriate complaints handling mechanisms for resolving disputes with financial service providers and improvements in the competency and training of persons providing financial services. The legislation deals with the licensing of financial market operators and of clearing and settlement facilities, and introduces a single licensing framework for all financial service providers, replacing the differing licensing and legislative requirements currently imposed on dealers and advisers in securities, futures, banking products, managed funds, superannuation, insurance and other financial products.
The legislation introduces minimum standards of conduct for financial service providers and enhanced disclosure of financial service products when dealing with retail clients. It also introduces other amendments to the Corporations Law, including amendments to the market misconduct provisions and amendments to the discontinuous disclosure provisions and the like. The bill will require a large number of persons who have not previously been regulated under the Corporations Act to be so licensed. Much of the debate surrounding this legislation is focused on who is in and who is out and the degree to which they are in and out. I will speak a bit more about that later.
The theme of this legislation, following on from the Wallis inquiry, is to regulate in this area in respect of the functional product rather than in respect of the institution that is distributing and selling the particular product. While supporting this legislation, as part of the Labor opposition, I must say that I am not as enthusiastic an advocate of this approach for a number of reasons. I am certainly not as enthusiastic as the government in terms of the over-the-top sell job that it attempted when it introduced the prudential regulators APRA and ASIC into this country. I think the jury is still out on just how effective APRA and ASIC are as financial regulators.
Certainly at the time there were what I would argue were extravagant claims made about Australia having the world's best practice financial regulatory system, which would be examined and implemented in a similar way around the world. They were certainly some of the comments made at the time by the Treasurer, Mr Costello. The sad fact is, of course, that in recent times there have been significant and justified criticisms made of the way APRA and ASIC have gone about their regulation. Some of the problems in the area have been beyond APRA and ASIC's particular control. I believe they have been underresourced. The level of expertise of some of their staff needs to be improved. They were issues that were imposed on them by the government of the day, but there is still a culture in APRA and ASIC when it comes to the regulation of financial institutions. They are insufficiently vigilant. When given a reasonable level of evidence that there are problems, they are not acting quickly enough. There is evidence of buck passing from one regulator to another. These issues have been well canvassed in recent times, not just in the media but also in the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation and Financial Services report. There are significant problems with financial regulation in this country and part of that problem is the current regulators themselves. Sadly, we had the major collapse of HIH Insurance. There is a royal commission. We have had recently the collapse of a number of superannuation funds—Commercial Nominees to name but one. We have had significant problems with solicitors mortgage funds. Given the evidence that that has occurred, it is difficult, I think, to argue at the present time that we have world's best practice regulation. 
To turn to this particular legislation, I want to focus on lawyers and some superannuation products. Before I do that, I think it is sometimes mistakenly claimed that the legislation we are considering—and what it leads to—is the total answer to problems that occur from time to time with financial products in this country. It is not the total answer. The theoretical argument is often advanced in this country that all we need is to have open disclosure of fees, charges and commissions, adequate regulation of the people who deliver those particular products and education of consumers, and then all the problems will be solved. That is the sort of theoretical, economic competitive knowledge model that is advanced by some in this country—some in particular in this government. That is not sufficient to protect consumers in Australia. This has been well highlighted in respect of the recent HIH collapse. There is a need at certain times for governments to intervene—hopefully there are sufficient protective mechanisms in place—to ensure there are appropriate mechanisms to compensate consumers in relation to certain classes of products, though not all products. 
In a capitalist system, there will always be a level of risk that an individual has to bear, but when you are faced with the collapse of a major insurance company such as HIH—tens of thousands of Australians were burnt as a result of that collapse and often those consumers did not know they had insurance with HIH, because the company they had insured with had on-placed the insurance with HIH—you need effective mechanisms to compensate consumers should those disasters occur. I note that Australia is, I think, only one of a handful of advanced economies that does not have a compensation fund in respect of insurance collapse. Even the United States, which is often promoted as the sort of nirvana of the free market, has a compensation mechanism when an insurance collapse occurs; Australia does not. 
The theoretical model of superannuation advanced recently in the guise of choice is that, effectively, deregulation means that: you remove the corporate nature—the bundling together—of product and you educate consumers, you disclose all the fees and commissions and she'll be right. That is the theoretical model that has been advanced by this government in respect of superannuation, when the evidence of the effective deregulation of some of the superannuation market has shown, particularly in the United Kingdom and Chile, that consumers—depending on the degree of deregulation—are ripped off, despite disclosure, despite so-called competitive mechanisms, despite so-called adequate regulation. 
You need to do more in the event of theft and fraud in respect of superannuation products. There is a compensation mechanism that requires moneys that are lost in those circumstances to be placed into a fund through a cross-levy system on the rest of the industry. That is an important protective mechanism that recognises that superannuation is a retirement product. We cannot in a society such as ours where theft and fraud occurs accept a situation, albeit that it is a very small number of people who suffer in this way, where their money is stolen, because they are going to depend, at least in part, on these savings for their retirement. 
As I said earlier, much of the debate around this legislation has focused on who is in and who is out. This is a timely debate because there have been a number of substantial problems with what are known as solicitors mortgage funds in this country. The Senate Select Committee on Superannuation and Financial Services has carried out a case study on the problems that occurred in Tasmania. That report will be released next week and it is pretty good reading. It is good reading in the sense that it well illustrates the major problems that even lawyers from time to time get themselves into. However, the problems in respect of the solicitors mortgage funds have not occurred just in Tasmania. They have occurred in Western Australia, Queensland, New South Wales and South Australia. For some reason that I am yet to identify, they do not seem to have occurred in Victoria.
Solicitors mortgage funds are a financial investment product generally run by a small number of legal firms in each state where a consumer, quite often a customer of the legal firm, invests money through the funds in mortgages on property. It is usually the first mortgage and can be up to 65 per cent of the valuation of the property. In those circumstances you would not expect a great deal to go wrong. However, the evidence is to the contrary. There have been a significant number of collapses in most Australian states and a significant amount of money—in the hundreds of millions of dollars around the nation— has been lost as a result of investment in these products. I think this highlights why this piece of legislation is important, bearing in mind my caveats on why we need other protective mechanisms.
Unfortunately, when you look at the particular disclosure documents that were made by some—including, I would acknowledge, a small number of legal firms in my home state of Tasmania—you find that, in some cases, the claims that were made were misleading. In most cases it was very difficult to find the commission and the charges and fees, but some of the claims that were made were misleading. Some of these funds have collapsed. There was a mixture of reasons for that—partly incompetence, partly poor valuations, ranging to false valuations, and partly theft and fraud. There were a range of problems. This piece of legislation helps clean up, to a significant extent, these types of products.
When I read some of the evidence before the committee, I went to the submissions from the various legal firms and law societies. The solicitors mortgage fund products had been administered by law societies in their respective states. I was a bit taken aback by the submission from the Law Institute of Victoria on this legislation. I quote from a letter:
... the provisions of the FSRB—
that is, the legislation we are dealing with—
are considered to be an unwarranted intrusion into the independence of the legal profession. To require solicitors to limit advice according to the conditions imposed by ASIC will severely limit the independence of the profession and impede the provision of independent, impartial advice to clients.
That is a fairly startling and, frankly, arrogant claim to be making in respect of the regulation of lawyers, solicitors and financial products. To be fair, reading later submissions to the committee, the law societies and some legal firms made it clear that their focused objection to this legislation lay with so-called incidental financial advice in the course of what would be considered normal legal work. That is fair enough, but what concerns the Labor opposition is that it is made very clear that solicitors mortgage funds, which are clearly a financial investment product, should be covered by this legislation.
I want to touch briefly on the issue of superannuation. The superannuation industry—without going into enormous detail—has a number of different types of funds. We have do-it-yourself small superannuation funds, we have what are known as corporate funds, we have master trusts, which in the main retail to the public, and we have what are known as industry funds, multi-employer funds. There is a growing tendency among those funds to attempt to sell in the retail sector and I think it is fair that they be covered by this legislation. However, the concerns raised by the corporate superannuation industry, I believe, are valid. Generally—there may be one or two of which I am not aware—they are not for public offer; they are not retailing to the general public. They are effectively custodians of the superannuation money of employees of the corporation and are also not-for-profit superannuation funds. Overwhelmingly, they are a good superannuation product. There was an argument, at least in the early stages of this legislation, that the trustees would be required to be licensed, along with the other groups that are brought within the ambit coverage of this legislation. The corporate superannuation industry made a submission and gave evidence to the committee hearings, and I am pleased that the concerns they expressed, at least in large part—perhaps not totally—have been taken into account when developing the legislation, the amendments and the regulations.
As my colleague, and our spokesperson, Senator Conroy has indicated, the Labor opposition is broadly supportive of the legislation. I am a little sceptical of some of the claims that have been made about the regulatory change in this country in the last few years. I note, however, that Mr Hockey has been somewhat more circumspect in the claimed advantages of this legislation compared with the claimed advantages that the Treasurer, Mr Costello, made about the introduction of APRA and ASIC in Australia a few years ago. Perhaps they have learnt from experience that the number of corporate collapses and the problems that APRA and ASIC have experienced do not indicate world's best practice regulatory regimes, or at least that you cannot draw that conclusion at the present time; the jury is still out.
I am a little more circumspect about the alleged `huge' benefits that will flow to consumers. There will be benefits; it is an advance, but we should not forget that regulators need to be very vigilant about the sale and distribution of financial products in this country. Consumers will, regrettably, still get burnt—hopefully not often. The disclosure of fees and commissions and charges is fine. That is all very well—people are entitled to access that information in a way in which they can draw comparisons, because often some of the disclosures that have occurred up to the present time are not easily readable. We should never forget that the vast majority of consumers in this country are not financially literate, and are unlikely ever to be so. Despite the best will in the world and massive education campaigns—in the case of this government, propaganda campaigns—it is very difficult to educate the mass consumer market to the necessary degree of financial literacy. There will always need to be protective mechanisms and compensation mechanisms in the sorts of areas I have outlined, to maximise protection to consumers.

"Cooney, Sen Barney",ALP,2001-08-22,"—I will continue on from where Senator Sherry left off. There are occasions when I think it is a pity we cannot extend the time that is given to a speaker. This is an occasion where we could have listened to Senator Sherry for some extra length of time. Yesterday I mentioned my son-in-law, Joe Ragg, who is a doctor. Senator Chapman promptly brought me to order for dealing with something that was irrelevant. Let me make it relevant in this way. My son-in-law is learning the trade of surgeon. I was saying to somebody what a terrible length of time my son-in-law had to serve to become a surgeon—something like 15 years. I did not get a sympathetic reply. In fact, the reply was, `If somebody is going to take a knife to me, he or she would want 15 years of experience at least.' We, as a community, regulate the people who are going to take a knife to somebody else—
—How are they going to get the experience? 
—That is a very interesting question, Senator Sherry. We ensure that lawyers and doctors have proper experience and integrity. The same goes for other professions. Electricians and plumbers, at least in the old days, when I was younger, had to serve apprenticeships and be qualified before they went about their practice. They had to be people of integrity. That was expected. In our community we have financial advisers, people who give us advice about how to handle whatever money we may have to invest. In the past there has not been sufficient consciousness of the need to have people with proper training and integrity in this area. It is an area where great damage can be done to people. If an operation goes badly that can lead to dreadful consequences. If a representation before the court goes wrong somebody might end up in gaol—a dreadful thing. If a plumber does not do his or her work properly we get a lack of sanitation and all sorts of problems. If an electrician does not carry out his or her work properly we are without light. We can understand that sort of thing. 
However, the myriad of times when people have been given poor financial advice and as a result are left penniless is overlooked. In Victoria, where I come from, the collapse of Pyramid was a disaster, as you well know, Madam Acting Deputy President Knowles. It left a tragic legacy which even now has ramifications, particularly around Geelong. Going back to the 1970s, Cambridge—people here probably cannot remember Cambridge—was another example of a collapsed financial institution. When we are dealing with money and how it is to be spent, we are dealing not only with the economic ramifications of that, but also with its social ramifications—the fact that people can be left without the proper wherewithal to live. That can lead to tragedy. 
Today we see how people who are getting older and who have to go onto the pension are living in a very frugal way. Throughout this community there are people who are living in very poor circumstances. That is a problem. We take steps to do something about that through the pension system. The Labor government, as Senator Sherry was saying, set up superannuation schemes to try to equip people with enough resources to provide them with the means to live comfortably when they got older. As Senator Sherry has so eloquently shown, superannuation is a matter of great moment—not only superannuation, but any vehicle in which people want to invest. 
We each follow our own profession. We are in the profession—I call it that advisedly—of politics. We practice that profession, hopefully, with some skill. Everyone practises their skill. It is great to see the tram drivers in Melbourne—locating myself for a moment in my city—or plumbers, or builders, or the members of any other profession going about their profession, devoting their time and attention to it. But that means that you cannot devote the time and attention that you might want to devote to it investing your money or doing with your money what seems appropriate.
I remember years ago a great man called Hubert Hoy, an electrician, thought he would spend money on the Stock Exchange. He went down there for a day, he saw people going about their business and he said, `Well it is no good me going into that on my own because, without proper advice, I would lose my money.' I think it has become more and more obvious that people who advise us about our money should be properly qualified and should be people of integrity, as I keep saying, and that is what the legislation we are now dealing with has much to do with. The general proposition is that there ought to be a bill such that the licensing, if you like, or the certification of people should be done from one source and that there should be a scheme set up so that those who give advice are licensed.
Once we get to that point, and everybody agrees that that is the point we should get to, we then come to the question: is this person giving financial advice? Senator Chapman chaired the committee that looked into this, the parliamentary Joint Statutory Committee on Corporations and Securities. It was a very eminent committee, I am sure you would agree, Senator Chapman.
—And it had some very eminent members, Senator Cooney!
—Yes, it had some very eminent members, Senator Chapman. We looked into it and we produced the Report on the Financial Services Reform Bill 2001.I think there has been general agreement, but there have been some disagreements along the lines of who should be licensed, who should not be and, in certain cases, what services ought to attract the licensing of people who give them. In our minority report, in the Report on the Financial Services Reform Bill 2001, the Labor members of the committee have set out certain points. I think we have put forward excellent propositions, and the shadow minister for financial services and regulation, Senator Conroy, has done much work. But the person I admire greatly in this area is Ms Diane Brown, who is in Senator Conroy's office, because she brings the intellectual capacity and rigour that I admire. The first dot point of the summary says:
The Labor members support the bill.
So there is no problem with that. The next point states:
The Labor members agree with the recommendations of the Chair that the 2-year transitional period be retained and that the Government explore the possibility of additional funding for ASIC to allow it to meet its new responsibilities.
Perhaps I should explain what is happening here. A lot of the precise rules and regulations that are going to be made will be made through ASIC, and there will also be a series of regulations and policy statements made. There is always a concern when matters are dealt with through subordinate legislation. I do not mean to say that subordinate legislation does not have its place; of course it does. I do not mean to say that subordinate legislation is not effective; of course it is. But there is always a question of what should be done through primary legislation and what should be done by secondary or subordinate legislation. I think—and this is a comment of mine—that we have to watch carefully to see what regulations and policy statements are brought forward through ASIC, and we have to keep them in check, because, in the end, it is the parliament's responsibility to ensure that legislation serves this country in the way that it should do. The next dot point is illustrative of the problems that arise in this area, and they are necessary problems that must necessarily be resolved. It says:
The Labor members recommend that the Bill be amended so that media organisations regain the certainty currently provided by the Corporations Act exemption.
That dot point is talking about the situation where a financial journalist might be writing an article about an insurance company or a manufacturing business, or whatever, and is giving a general description of how that business is operating. There is then the a question of whether that is financial advice. If a person was writing up his or her story and started to get into difficulties as to whether this came within the law or fell outside of the law then there are some problems. So this dot point suggests that the law be expressed so that the journalist can write without going through that worry and will only be caught by these provisions if in fact he or she gives financial advice with the intent to do so. This becomes an issue for other professions, such as lawyers and accountants. If you are running a commercial case, as a lawyer, then of course there is going to be discussion about commercial matters. But you should not be caught by provisions in this act because you are not giving commercial advice. What you are doing is dealing with a case with commercial ramifications.
I will jump a few dot points because I am running out of time. The next one is:
The Labor members do not agree with the recommendation of the Chair to exclude from the Bill compulsory third party and workers compensation insurance, nor the recommendation of the Chair to exclude from the disclosure requirements the provisions of a quotation alone for a general insurance product.
What the chairman, Senator Chapman, was saying, as I understand it—he can correct me if I am wrong— was that when you are dealing with financial advice in those areas, there is really not much in the way of decision making. If you want to take out insurance for third-party liability or workers compensation liability or risk liability, then the premiums are going to be pretty much within a range that does not require financial advice. Therefore, since this sort of insurance is very common and is well-known to people, it should not be licensed. We Labor members of the committee said that these people should be licensed because they are giving advice.
—I am not saying that they should not be licensed, just that they should not be required to disclose—
—Thanks for that. Senator Chapman is saying that they should be licensed but that they should not have to disclose what the commission—is that right?
 (Senator McKiernan)—Interjections are disorderly. Do not encourage conversation.
—It is not disorderly—
—He is being very helpful.
—Order! There are standing orders in this place and it is my job to enforce them and that is all I am doing, irrespective of the number of supporters.
—Of course, Mr Acting Deputy President, but perhaps you might not be enforcing the standing orders as they are written—not that I would suggest that for one minute, but I think that is the proposition being put. However you interpret matters when you are king of the castle, Mr Acting Deputy President, we will of course accept. But I think it was important that I corrected what I had said about Senator Chapman's position and that it should not be allowed to go off into the ether without being corrected. I hope I have done that.
What has been said is that, with workers compensation, third-party insurance and liability insurance generally, the people giving that advice should be licensed but, as I understand it, there need not be disclosure requirements for the provisions of a quotation. That is what is being said, I think. There is a difference on that between the majority and the Labor minority. The Labor minority says that not only should the person selling this insurance be licensed but that there should be a disclosure requirement for the provision of a quotation for that sort of insurance. The next point I have dealt with already but I will read it out:
The Labor members recommend that the declared professional body provisions be deleted from the Bill. The Labor members are still considering whether an exemption for incidental advice by lawyers and accountants should be restored or the definition of `financial product advice' be appropriately amended.
There was a difference in the committee about this, and that is what I was talking about when discussing the issue of journalists and what they write. This is the same sort of thing with regard to accountants and lawyers. If you are a lawyer or an accountant incidentally to being a financial adviser, of course you should be licensed and all the provisions of this legislation should apply. But the question is: when are you a financial adviser and when are you acting as a lawyer or accountant, and where do these matters become, as it were, coincidental to your general advice?
The next dot point deals with the issue of not-for-profit superannuation funds. It states:
The Labor members agree with the proposal of the Minister to table regulations exempting not-for-profit superannuation funds from the licensing requirements and certain disclosure requirements under the Bill.
This has been dealt with by Senator Sherry, who I think is paramount in this area in this house. The last dot point says:
The Labor members agree with the recommendation of the Chair to review the operation of the Bill.
I want to make the point that the whole area of corporations is an area which will always need reviewing. (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>FINANCIAL SERVICES REFORM BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,5,1
"Ferguson, Sen Alan",LP,2001-08-22,"—I rise to speak to the Financial Services Reform Bill 2001 in the knowledge that it is a bill that has had a pretty long gestation period. It has been around for public consultation now for almost two years. It is a good bill, and it is an even better bill with the amendments that are going to be moved to change the original bill as a result of some excellent work that was done by Senator Chapman's Joint Statutory Committee on Corporations and Securities. That committee has looked into this bill twice and has come up with a number of recommendations, some for the second time. I am very pleased that the government accepted many of the changes that were recommended in the report of the joint committee because they have made this bill a much better bill.
I want to speak on only one issue in this legislation, that is, commissions for agents on non-accumulation or risk products. I suppose it is only fair that I should declare an interest, because for eight years prior to entering this place I worked as a commission agent, tied to the Colonial Mutual company, as it was then, but with a number of general insurance agencies. I would like to place on record that earning a livelihood as a commission agent is a legitimate, respected and honourable profession and an honourable method of earning a living, which some people in this place would suggest that it is not. In all of this dash for clarity and for transparency in everything that takes place, I wonder what the end result of this legislation, as it currently provides, is going to be for the consumer. If commissions have to be disclosed when the end result is affected by any commissions paid, will it also include the amount of money that is paid to someone like Bernie Fraser when he makes ads for industry funds? He has to be paid from somewhere—unless he is doing it on a purely voluntary basis, and if he is I think he should say so. If he is being paid to do those ads, that is going to diminish the returns to the members of those industry funds that he so often recommends on television that everybody should join because no commissions are paid—that terrible thing, a commission!—to anybody who is supplying a service—a year-long service or a lifelong service in many instances—and earning a commission.
I want to comment briefly on some very poor and ill-advised reporting in the Financial Review when it talked about Mr Hockey facing on Monday night strong pressure `to cave in to the long-running resistance by small life insurance agents' to the disclosure of commissions. Paul Cleary's article in today's paper says:
Mr Hockey also refused to accept a recommendation in favour of exempting life agents from disclosing commissions ...
I was at that meeting; as a matter of fact, I chaired it. The only issue that has ever been at stake for both me and a number of the members of our committee is whether or not commissions should have to be disclosed on a risk product where the payment of a commission has no effect on the end result to the client. I am perfectly aware that commissions should be disclosed on any financial accumulation product when it affects the end result to the client. As a matter of fact, when I worked as an agent for Colonial, even as far back as 1985 in presentations to clients we were obliged to put in the full costs to the client and how that would affect the end result of their accumulation or financial product. Originally it was done on a very small device that just gave a print-out, but further on, in 1987, we were issued with laptop computers, and every time we gave a presentation it had to include the cost to the consumer of all the fees and charges, including commissions, that were taken out by the company. That was from 1987 onwards, and in those days some of the commissions were very high and had an enormous impact on the end result. The best thing that has happened in recent times is that, on those types of products, commissions have been changed so that in the early days it does not have such an impact on the client's investment. That has been a move for the better. For a long time now, there has been concern amongst some companies that any commission that is paid to an agent which affects the return should be disclosed. 
That is why it is so wrong when this report talks about the disclosure of the commission of life agents, because in most cases life agents these days are selling products where their commission does affect the end result. The only product they sell where it does not is term life insurance. In fact, regardless of what commission is paid on a term life product, the client in the event of a claim will get exactly the same amount of money regardless of how much commission is involved in that contract. That is why I do not see any necessity for commissions to be disclosed on term life product.
Of course, the other area where commissions will be required to be disclosed is in the area of fire and general insurance. There are many fire and general insurance agents in Australia. I worked principally in country areas and I know of some 15,000 to 25,000 registered agents throughout Australia, many of whom have a general insurance agency as an adjunct to another small business, such as a hardware shop or a general store, that they may be running in a country town. In some small towns in the outlying areas in rural and regional Australia, that is a service that is provided to that community. One of the problems is that in many of these cases these people are only earning a very small amount of money out of their insurance agencies—as I said, it is an adjunct to their normal business—but it does make their business viable and economic to run, sometimes providing a great service to those communities.
Mr Acting Deputy President, you and I would both know that, once the commission on these products has to be disclosed, if past history is any example, the client will say, `You're earning that much money out of my car or house insurance, are you? How about you drop your commission, take half as much as you would normally take, and you can have the business?' The disclosure of commission on risk product means that these people will have their incomes forced down purely by the disclosure of the amount of commission that has to be disclosed when they are insuring for an event for which, regardless of what commission they are paid, they will get the same end result in the event of a claim. As I said right from the start, making a living by earning a commission is one of the ways that many people in Australia earn their incomes. To drive these people to give up some of their livelihood because they have to disclose an amount that does not affect the client in any way whatsoever is going to have a detrimental effect on a lot of people and a lot of small businesses throughout Australia.
—They don't have to disclose their overheads, either. 
—Senator Knowles is right: disclosing a commission does not tell you how much petrol they have to put in their car to service a client and it does not tell you how much their telephone bill is when they are doing business, answering calls and ringing up about claims that might be made. The commission that is paid to a risk insurer is designed to cover all of their costs—and that is not taken into account. Everybody seems to think that that is just salary that goes in the pocket. It does not have the same effect on salaried risk insurers because those on salaries will have their expenses paid in some other way. I am thinking of the enormous number of people out in rural and regional Australia, and in some cases in city areas as well, who have a risk insurance agency purely as an adjunct to their business to help them make their business more viable and one from which they know they can earn a reasonable living. It is for those reasons that I am particularly concerned that the government did not take up the recommendation of the joint committee regarding the insurance commission on risk products.
Debate interrupted. ",SENATE,<title>FINANCIAL SERVICES REFORM BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,5,1
"Knowles, Sen Susan",LP,2001-08-22,"—Today I would like to talk about the Labor Party's total gross hypocrisy and misrepresentation in relation to what they are telling the Australian community about social policy. Over the last five years, this government has had a job and a half to do turning this country around to being a fairer country, ensuring that there are job opportunities and that those people who cannot look after themselves are actually cared for by other taxpayers and that pensioners are getting a better deal—the list goes on and on. All we have been confronted with, at an accelerated pace in recent times, is total and utter misrepresentation.
Senators Newman and Vanstone deserve congratulations for what they have done in this area of policy. It has been a very difficult one which has been subjected to continual misrepresentation. Therefore, I would like to go through some of the facts about where we are today. Employment and unemployment are very important issues for so many people. The Labor Party yesterday were talking about unemployment as though it was something about which they had a proud record. They have forgotten that during their 13 years of office they had well over one million people unemployed, which was over 10 per cent of the population without a job. By June this year, that had fallen to 6.9 per cent. The Labor Party cannot trumpet that they are the party of those wanting a job: they simply put them out of jobs. The coalition has created 833,300 new jobs since April 1996. That has ensured that the unemployment rate is well below that left by Labor. Equally, by June this year the numbers receiving unemployment related income support payments had declined by 32 per cent since the time that Labor had one million people unemployed. In terms of taxation for all the other Australians who have to look after those who are unemployed when Labor are in office, the impact of that is a substantial decline. 
Equally, in relation to the issue of youth unemployment, the Labor Party have long trumpeted their ability to look after the young people of this country. Their ability to look after the young people of this country was demonstrated over 13 years when they simply put them out of work. Youth unemployment under Labor was at a staggering 21 per cent. That is shocking in anyone's terms, but it is something about which the Labor Party seem very proud. Fortunately, that has dropped to 13 per cent under the coalition government. That is still too high, but an eight per cent reduction is better than none.
The same applies to work force participation. Employment participation has increased since the mid-nineties under Labor. Seventy-one per cent of working age people are now employed, compared to only 69 per cent in April 1996 when we came to office. Older workers in particular, whom Labor were very keen to throw onto the scrap heap, saying, `We do not need your expertise anymore, we do not want you in the work force', have benefited to the tune of 150,500 places. Older people between 55 and 59 years old have been getting jobs. So employment growth is now at the stage where 73 per cent of those employed are in full-time employment. As total employment has grown, the proportion of those in part-time employment has increased. Since 1996 when we came to office, 369,600 full-time jobs and 463,700 part-time jobs have been created. 
What does that do for families? That is the other important aspect of this. The Labor Party, quite willing to misrepresent facts, have said, quite wrongly, that the gap between rich and poor has widened. If that is so, and if their assertion is correct, why is it that the ABS figures do not substantiate their claim? The rate of jobless families has now dropped, and that is something about which we should all be proud. It is something about which the Labor Party should be congratulating the government, but they cannot bring themselves to do it. In 1991, 8.4 per cent of all couple families with children were jobless. In 1993, this peaked at 10.8 per cent of all couple families with children. That has fallen to 7.5 per cent under the coalition. In 1991, 53 per cent of sole parents were jobless. This increased to 54.8 per cent in 1993. It has fallen back to 48 per cent under the coalition. These are figures that the Labor Party should be congratulating the government on, and yet they refuse to do so. They just continue to go out there and misrepresent the situation. Equally, the number of jobless families with children, after rising through much of the 1990s, fell at the end of the decade. The number of jobless sole parent families has continued to fall.
Real wage increases for low income workers is another area that we should concentrate on. The Labor Party believe that they are the sole repository of all wisdom when it comes to caring for low paid workers. What did they do, other than push them out of work, pushing more and more people onto the unemployment queues, thereby creating greater poverty? They also reduced their real levels of income. The real value of the minimum wage fell under the Labor Party, but it has increased for low income workers under the Howard government.
Between 1992 and 1996, the real value of the minimum wage fell by almost five per cent. Since 1996, under the coalition, it has grown by over eight per cent. The Labor Party pushed it down; the coalition has pushed it up. That is what the coalition has done for low income families and low income workers in comparison with the Labor Party. This represents the fruits of sustained economic growth and a reformed industrial relations system that allows the benefits of productivity gains to flow on to wages— not keeping a brick on people's heads, not forcing their incomes down. Equally, assistance to low income families is important. Payments to all families have risen in the past five years. No-one would believe that if they just listened to Mr Beazley and his band of merry men and women who just go out willingly misrepresenting the truth.
The new tax system has improved the position of low income working families by increasing payments for families and reducing their taxation levels. A single income family with two children has boosted its real income by 15½ per cent between 1995 and 2001. For families using child care, the increase can be even stronger, rising to 22 per cent or more. Income inequality, as I say, is unchanged. The Labor Party will say that the gap between the rich and the poor has just got wider and wider. Some media commentators have the gall to just slavishly repeat the Labor Party claims as if they were true. The gap has not got wider.
Equally, the Labor Party—Senator Evans, in particular—and their acolytes in sections of the media will continue to talk about child-care assistance becoming less affordable and less available. Over the 10 years from 1991 to 2001, real Commonwealth expenditure on child care rose by 160 per cent. In 2001 dollars, it grew from $573 million to $1,490 million. Child-care cash payments and subsidies— which of course are the major components of Commonwealth child-care expenditure—were substantially simplified and restructured as part of the new tax system. The number of children and families using child care also grew. In 1991, there were 302,000 children from 196,000 families using child care. This year, there are 700,000 children—remember, there used to be 302,000—from 500,000 families. That is not 200,000 families but 500,000 families. Under Labor, growth in child care was unchecked and unsustainable. Most child-care centres were simply put in Labor marginal seats to try and hold their seats. Many of those child-care centres have closed and others have opened, but, once again, the misrepresentation flows on by the Labor Party, in that they only talk about those that have been closed. They never refer to those that have been opened—particularly those that have been opened because there is an area of unmet need. This is not about just slamming child-care centres into a marginal Labor seat to try and hold the seat or win votes but about making sure that child care is available where it is required.
Equally, in education, the number of school students has increased by 105,000 since the coalition government came to office—more than a three per cent growth rate. Between 1996 and 2000, the number of vocational education students increased by a massive 402,000 people—a growth rate of some 30 per cent. There was a continued strong growth in tertiary education, with an increase of over 60,000 additional tertiary students between 1996 and 2000, and that represents a 10 per cent growth. We know, of course, that the Labor Party had absolutely no wish or desire to give people an opportunity to go into trades, into apprenticeships, and the number of apprenticeships just went down and down. The coalition has given young people who do not necessarily want to go on to tertiary education a greater opportunity.
In the few moments that I have left available to me, I want to get on to pension rates, because pension rates is another thing that the Labor Party continually misrepresents. Between 1991 and 1995, under Labor, pension rates simply kept pace with inflation. As I have said in this place so often before, they kept pace with inflation, but retrospectively kept pace with inflation. The pension went along, the CPI figures came out and then the pension was increased to match the CPI figures. Not so under the coalition. Real pension rates are now 4½ per cent higher than they were in 1996. In 1996, the government legislated to ensure that the single pension rate never fell below 25 per cent of the male total average weekly earnings. Good economic management and labour market reform have allowed sustained growth in average earnings since then, and this legislation means pensioners also benefited from this growth. Current rates are $201 per week for singles and $335.50 for married couples, and that, as I said, is a real increase of 4½ per cent on the rates when Labor was in office. So when we get the pensioners' federation—the mouthpiece for the Labor Party—talking about how good the Labor Party is in looking after older Australians, it could not be further from the truth. They were dudded continually by the Labor Party, with pension rates being increased only after the CPI. We now have them well ahead of the CPI. 
The other side of income is interest rates, because many young people have a home mortgage and have to pay out huge home mortgages. When the Labor Party were in office, of course, way back over decades, interest rates got up to 17 per cent and business mortgages were in the 20 per cent range, and today the current home loan interest rate is 6.8 per cent compared with that peak of 17 per cent in 1989-90. This represents a saving to borrowers of $744 per month on a loan of $100,000 or $521 on a loan of $70,000. That is a clear income windfall for people who have mortgages. It is more money that goes into their pockets and it is more money that they can spend on their children and themselves than Labor has ever been able to deliver to them. I just hope that the Labor Party will see reason and stop misrepresenting the facts to the electorate.

"Minchin, Sen Nick",LP,2001-08-22,"— Senator Schacht asked me a question today regarding the proposed United States free trade agreement. I have some further information to add to my answer and I seek leave to incorporate that response into Hansard.
Leave not granted. 
—I am quite happy to read my answer into Hansard. The answer to the senator's question is no. Neither my department nor any of the agencies that report to me have done modelling or research into the effects of an Australia and United States free trade agreement on the Australian automotive industry. As I stated earlier today, our government will, as part of any free trade agreement negotiations with the United States, seek to ensure that no section of Australian industry, most particularly the car industry, is worse off as a result of the agreement. In fact, we will be endeavouring to provide greater benefits for each area of Australian industry.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Motor Vehicle Industry: Free Trade Agreement</title>,Questions Without Notice,8,1

"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,2001-08-22,"— I move:
That, in the opinion of the Senate, the following is a matter of urgency:
The need for the Senate to acknowledge the increasing community opposition to mandatory sentencing and the imminent repeal of such legislation in the Northern Territory, and to urge the Western Australian Government to repeal mandatory sentencing laws.
There can be little doubt that, in the wake of the very recent Northern Territory election result, we have seen a very strong swing towards those parties opposed to the Northern Territory mandatory sentencing regime and that community opposition to that regime is increasing and welcome. Certainly that was not the only factor in that election, but debate around mandatory sentencing was a significant part of the overall election and one that drew sharp distinction between the Territory's government and opposition. The ruling CLP, a strong advocate of mandatory sentencing, is about to lose power after 26 years in government in spite of its relentless support for mandatory sentencing and the use of that issue as a political tool and weapon—a weapon that, thankfully, has backfired— in its armoury of campaign strategies. In that context, I do think it is worth the Senate reviewing its position on mandatory sentencing, given that the issue is once again in the spotlight and given that this chamber has previously passed legislation to repeal mandatory sentencing.
After campaigning on what has been seen as an electorally unpopular platform of repealing mandatory sentencing legislation in the Northern Territory, the Northern Territory Labor Party, to its credit, has won strong support for its position. Perhaps Territorians finally came to understand the inherent injustice of such a scheme or perhaps they came to see the fruitless waste of time and money needed to support such an ineffective scheme. Either way, the tide has turned.
The Territory's regime and its sister regime in WA have rightly been brought into domestic and international condemnation. Despite some modifications to the Territory's scheme by the coalition last year, it remains an ineffective solution to juvenile crime because it continues to deny judges and magistrates the discretion they need in deciding appropriate sentencing given the circumstances of a particular crime. Whilst not targeting indigenous crime directly, both regimes operate in states with a high concentration of indigenous people, and therefore the effect of those laws has been to disadvantage indigenous youth and their families.
When the first imprisonments for relatively trivial property offences were first highlighted in Australia they brought significant protests on the streets— mostly protests from what Territorians would call the southern states but also protests on the streets of Alice Springs and Darwin. The wider community in Australia has rightly demanded the repeal of such legislation, as made evident through protests, popular press, radio talkback, petitions and so on. Indeed, the Senate's own Legal and Constitutional References Committee inquiry found that mandatory sentencing is not appropriate in a modern democracy and does in fact breach international obligations under treaties and conventions. Yet, in spite of that international and domestic condemnation, the federal government has failed to take a reasonable approach to this matter.
The issue was resolved unsatisfactorily, largely with smoke and mirrors, when the Prime Minister formulated a political solution with the then Northern Territory Chief Minister, Mr Shane Stone. As an editorial in the Australian noted at that time:
[The changes] merely ameliorate the extent of the regime. It is important that the age of adulthood in the territory is raised to 18 years (from 17). It is important also that all juveniles arrested for minor offences be placed in diversionary programs before a decision is taken whether they are charged. It is important that the diversionary program will be enhanced through an injection of $5 million in federal funds. It is also important that an Aboriginal interpreter service will be funded, if only to explain the purpose of the law to some transgressors. But the fundamental issue—mandatory sentencing itself—has escaped review.
It seems now, though, that the Northern Territory government has paid the electoral price. One long-time resident of the Territory was quoted recently in the Australian as saying:
There was a time when those of us in the Northern Territory didn't mind as being seen as different and dismissive of southerners criticisms of the way we do things—but times have changed. Many of us no longer want to be regarded as rednecks and cowboys.
Whilst federally Labor has taken heart from this poll and has supported the repeal of mandatory sentencing in this chamber, its broader record on mandatory sentencing is not one to be proud of. It was, after all, first introduced by then Premier Dr Carmen Lawrence in my home state of Western Australia. Yet now, as a federal Labor politician, Dr Lawrence and her colleagues are opposed to mandatory sentencing. Sadly, this is in conflict with the state Labor government of my home state, which maintains mandatory sentencing laws and, as recently as yesterday, reiterated its support for them.
There is no question of the popular electoral support for mandatory sentencing in my home state— and probably for all the wrong reasons—yet the state government in WA, and Attorney-General McGinty in particular, have shown themselves in recent months to have the courage and integrity to take on unpopular issues, particularly with regard to social policy, and to show leadership on them. Sadly, that leadership is nowhere to be found in the hazy and emotive law and order debates that dominate the airwaves and print columns in the popular press.
However, despite having the opportunity, both the federal coalition's and opposition's commitment to overturning this offensive legislation is, at best, half-hearted and the Human Rights (Mandatory Sentencing of Juvenile Offenders) Bill 2000, cosponsored by Senator Brown and Senator Bolkus and by Mr Andren from the House of Representatives, is now a distant memory. Granted, that bill died in the other place, but attempts by me to continue to promote mandatory sentencing repeal amendments to Territory legislation—something I tried to do in an omnibus bill last year—saw both the government and the opposition collude to withdraw that bill in its entirety rather than even allow debate on my amendment.
But where exactly does the Northern Territory Labor leader Ms Clare Martin really stand on mandatory sentencing? It seems that when mandatory sentencing is repealed there, as it appears that it will be, they will be introducing sentencing legislation that will introduce a small element of judicial discretion, but otherwise the plans sketched out during the campaign appear not much different from the existing system.
So the state of play in the Northern Territory is that currently we have a deal between Prime Minister Howard and the now immediate past Chief Minister Denis Burke. We have a situation where Northern Territory police have the option to use diversionary programs involving juveniles, and the federal government have provided some $5 million for diversionary programs, including interpreter services. But it does mean that the first offence by an adult would attract a mandatory sentence of 14 days in jail.
There is a clear difference and distinction between the Territory situation and the Western Australian situation. In Western Australia, the system applies to home burglary. If an offender has offended two or more times previously for the same offence, they are subject to mandatory sentencing. It is argued that somehow, because that is less draconian than the Northern Territory situation, that is acceptable. But as Mr Dennis Eggington, Aboriginal Legal Services Chief Executive Officer, said only yesterday:
WA's laws jailed younger juveniles for longer periods than those in the NT.
If they—
meaning the Northern Territory—
repeal their laws, WA will be the only State in breach of Australia's human rights obligations.
While we are about to see the death of this legislation in the Northern Territory, these laws remain operative in Western Australia.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Mandatory Sentencing</title>,Matters of Urgency,15,1
"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2001-08-22,"—Senator Greig's motion today is a bit like the curate's egg: it is good in parts. The operation of mandatory sentencing legislation is undoubtedly difficult and complex. I do not think anyone denies that. There is no doubt that there is a body of community opposition to mandatory sentencing, and I think that needs to be acknowledged. Indeed, it may be growing, as Senator Greig's motion suggests. I am on the record as saying that I do not support mandatory sentencing for the categories of offences that are covered by the present Northern Territory and Western Australian legislation, and I have consistently advocated other more constructive ways to deal with repeat offenders, especially juveniles. The Attorney-General has previously expressed concern and has indicated that the Commonwealth does not support mandatory sentencing but, of course, firmly believes that sentencing is a state and territory matter.
Be that as it may, in speaking against the motion today I would remind the Senate that opposition to mandatory sentencing is not a universal view. While the opposition of the Labor leader in the Northern Territory, Clare Martin, to mandatory sentencing may well have galvanised opposition to mandatory sentencing in the Territory, as some have claimed, in Western Australia a change of government has resulted in no foreshadowed change. Indeed, the Premier of Western Australia, Labor leader Dr Gallop, is on the record as supporting the mandatory sentencing regime. He did this against the wishes of Mr Beazley all through the mandatory sentencing debate and before he became Premier. Clearly, there is both political and community support for mandatory sentencing in Western Australia. I think we need to acknowledge that.
The question for today's debate then is whether this parliament should lead public opinion in what might be thought of by some as the appropriate direction or whether it is more appropriate for the Commonwealth to recognise that sentencing is a matter for state and territory governments to deal with and that the government is conscious of the problems they face in balancing the need to curb repeat crime and the community's concern to protect young people. That is the balance that has to be struck.
As the Senate would know, the issue of mandatory sentencing has been extensively canvassed by the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee in its inquiry into the Human Rights (Mandatory Sentencing of Juvenile Offenders) Bill 1999, and it is currently undertaking an inquiry into the Human Rights (Mandatory Sentencing for Property Offences) Bill 2000 to report in September of this year. The earlier inquiry examined the mandatory sentencing regimes in both the Northern Territory and Western Australia. It was acknowledged by all of the committee members that the apparent safeguards and practical operation of the Western Australian legislation did put it in a different category of severity to the then Northern Territory regime. Following the report, the Northern Territory regime was substantially altered to meet concerns, with the financial assistance of the Commonwealth. Senator Greig mentioned $5 million committed by the Commonwealth for the juvenile pre-court diversion scheme and a jointly funded Aboriginal interpreter service. I think it is fair to say that a range of diversionary programs has been introduced that has substantially improved the outcome for juvenile offenders, including the definition of 17-year-olds, who were hitherto treated as adults for the purposes of the legislation, as juveniles. I will come back to the considerable achievements of the negotiations with the Northern Territory in the introduction of these programs if time permits.
But, as I mentioned earlier, the Labor leader in the Northern Territory has indicated her intention to repeal mandatory sentencing if she forms a government. As the possibility of mandatory sentencing being repealed is certainly in prospect—I think we have to acknowledge that—that may leave Western Australia as the only jurisdiction where mandatory sentencing for property offences remains on the statute books; so I intend to concentrate on Western Australia. What does the Western Australian law provide and why does it apparently enjoy community and political support in that state? Put succinctly, the Western Australian mandatory sentencing regime is directed to home invasion or home burglary. They are words that strike terror into most home owners' hearts. In that regard, it differs significantly from the Northern Territory legislation, which covers a wide range of property offences and which could have got, prior to the changes that were made in the Territory, a young person for some quite trivial offence.
The Western Australian legislation provides that an adult, 18 years and over, should receive 12 months jail for a third or subsequent offence and that a young person—that is, 16- and 17-year-olds—should receive 12 months prison or detention or, relevantly for the purposes of today's discussion, an intensive youth supervision order. In other words, in Western Australia the court can have regard to the fact that the rehabilitation of a young offender is facilitated by the participation of the offender's family in a program. It stands to reason, really, that someone's prospect of rehabilitation is much enhanced if the whole family—or at least those who are important adults in the young person's life—are involved.
Sections 98 and 99 of the Young Offenders Act provide that the court may make an intensive youth supervision order with or without a sentence of detention. The President of the Children's Court in Western Australia has decided that the court could use those provisions to release a young person who was a repeat home burglar. In other words, the magistrate or judge was not constrained from exercising his or her discretion, which is the relevant point, and taking the individual circumstances of the young person into account.
In 1998, the Young Offenders Act was amended to enable the courts to give credit to juveniles for time spent on remand. There is provision in the Young Offenders Act for referral to a juvenile justice team of a young person alleged to have committed, been charged with or found guilty of various offences including home burglaries. The team may dispose of the matter by, for example, specifying conditions to be complied with by the young person. The Young Offenders Act makes limited provision for the early release of young persons under supervision. In other words, the legislation has been tempered by most of the usual safeguards and options that you would expect in any responsive and flexible criminal justice system dealing with young offenders. In addition, the minister administering the Criminal Code is bound to review the mandatory sentencing legislation after four years from its commencement and submit a report to parliament, and that is expected by 14 November of this year, as I understand the situation.
Having regard to the fact that the mandatory sentencing scheme for juveniles in Western Australia is not mandatory in its operation and that in the Northern Territory there have been significant enhancements to their scheme by means of diversionary programs—and indeed the whole scheme may be repealed—what is left to offend the sensibilities of those who oppose mandatory sentencing? Adults in Western Australia who have broken into a home and committed burglary on three occasions receive a mandatory sentence—the so-called `three strikes' for repeat offenders. The legislation was thought to be necessary and justifiable. The committee was told that Western Australia has the highest rate of home burglary in Australia. In 1993, 11 per cent of homes in Western Australia experienced a burglary or an attempted burglary compared with the overall rate for Australia of 6.8 per cent. I think it is worth going back to the introduction of the Criminal Code Amendment Act, where it was said:
The government shares the community's concern about the prevalence of home invasion offences and acknowledges the devastating effect which such offences can have on the lives of victims.
At a local level, I believe it is important to respect the views of a democratically elected government giving expression to constituent concerns. I certainly have received communications from people in Western Australia asking how I would feel if my home had been broken into. One person had a break-in on 13 occasions and they asked me how I would like to be cleaning up a house 13 times later. I certainly would not like it, and I certainly do respect the right of the Western Australian government to move at their own pace in making their own laws for sentencing of repeat offenders.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Mandatory Sentencing</title>,Matters of Urgency,15,1
"Cooney, Sen Barney",ALP,2001-08-22,"—This is a very important topic up for discussion today. Senator Greig has, as is often the case, come forward with a matter of some moment. He has moved the proposal:
That, in the opinion of the Senate, the following is a matter of urgency:
The need of the Senate to acknowledge the increasing community opposition to mandatory sentencing and the imminent repeal of such legislation in the Northern Territory and to urge the Western Australian government to repeal mandatory sentencing laws.
He has dealt with that, as has Senator Coonan and, as has been mentioned, as did the Legal and Constitutional References Committee report, on which I think we worked very well.
I think there is some concern in this context—and I understand entirely that Senator Greig does not intend it this way—that we are concentrating only on mandatory sentencing, which is bad for all the reasons that Senator Greig has mentioned and that Senator Coonan has spoken of. But mandatory sentencing is only part of the problem in sentencing generally. It is quite clear that in Australia today more and more people are being put in prison because of the sentencing laws right around the country, and there is, for better or for worse, a law and order campaign going on from state to state. I think they are the sorts of issues that must be faced. So it is not just mandatory sentencing; if we concentrated only on mandatory sentencing I think that we would be missing the point in many a case.
Senator Coonan spoke of how somebody would feel whose house had been broken into again and again and again. How would somebody feel whose son or daughter was assaulted? How would someone feel whose money was taken from them by some financial dealer? And we were talking about doing something about financial advice only this morning. How would anybody feel when an insult was done to their body, their pocket or their sense of dignity? They would feel very bad about it. But should that be the only consideration we take into account when we are looking at the issue of sentencing? People say, `Look, why don't we ask the victim what he or she would do in respect of the person who has committed the offence?' But what if on the other hand we asked what the mother and father of the person who perpetrated the crime would do if he or she were asked that question? You are going to get two different results, depending on who you ask. That is why the system has developed over the years to have a person who should bring a good mind to this—a good mind in the sense of one who can do justice by everyone.
A lot of the problems arise in this area because some of us believe that there is such a thing as redemption—that some people, if they have committed a crime, can nevertheless be redeemed in certain circumstances. Some years ago a musical called Les Miserables played in Melbourne and the rest of Australia. It was based on the book of the same name by Victor Hugo. There were of course several figures, but the two interesting ones in this respect were Jean Valjean, the criminal, and Javert, the policeman, who chased him. The policeman was full of sincerity, but it turned out that he was mistaken. He thought that there was no good in Valjean—that he would never recover—and that he should therefore pursue Valjean no matter what. As that play showed, there was a great deal of good in the criminal in that case. 
What we have to do as a civilised community, as a community in which civil principles predominate, is to see what is the appropriate course to take in any particular instance. A judge's decision, when the judge is faced with the question of what should happen to a person who comes before him or her, can be reached by asking these questions. What has this person done? What sort of evil has he or she perpetrated on his or her fellows? Then he or she might go on to ask: what sort of person is the criminal? Is it his or her first offence? Is that relevant? Is the crime an abominable one? Is that an issue to take into account? Has reparation been made? Is that a matter to take into account? These are the sorts of things that should be open to consideration for justice to be done to the person who is before the court. If a person is put in prison, the length of their sentence will depend on the answers to those questions. Each person should be tested on his or her merits against what has been suffered by the victim. You will take into account what has happened to the victim and you will take into account what sort of person the perpetrator of the crime is, and from those circumstances you will try to work out what will happen. That is a decision to be made in respect of each individual, and that is why people do not like mandatory sentencing. 
This issue has arisen today—Senator Greig, correct me if I am wrong—because of the probable win of the Northern Territory election by Ms Clare Martin. She promises to take an appropriate approach to this matter, and I think she ought to be congratulated. Since we are congratulating members of my party—Mr Acting Deputy President, I know you have the generosity of soul to give credit where credit is due—
 (Senator Lightfoot)—I do indeed, Senator Cooney.
—Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. I hope senators remember former Senator Michael Tate—he is from your state, Senator Brown—who is now in Holy Orders in Tasmania. He was the person who brought in the sentencing provisions set out in the Commonwealth Crimes Act. They operate in respect of federal offences and are set out in division 2. I do not have time to go through it all, but section 16A outlines the matters to which the court should have regard when passing sentence. It states: 
In determining the sentence to be passed, or the order to be made, in respect of any person for a federal offence, a court must impose a sentence or make an order that is of a severity appropriate in all the circumstances of the offence. 
It then goes on to talk about those matters. As a party, we have some good things to say about ourselves in this area of sentencing. I am not saying that this is universal throughout the land, but as far as the federal system is concerned the Labor Party have some good things to talk about here.
It is easy to demonise people who commit crimes. The biblical admonition that there ought to be an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth always seemed to me to be too severe. The way things are happening these days, you begin to wonder about people's attitude to that. People often call for penalties far in excess of the severity of the crime that has been committed. That is my observation. Also, it is always easier to give justice to the attractive people in the world. For example, if a young lady aged 25, beautifully dressed and beautifully spoken were to come in here, she would appeal to our hearts and it would be easy to give justice. It becomes a bit more difficult when you have an old lag, somebody in their 60s—I am in my 60s, so I am a bit concerned—
—You appeal to our hearts.
—Yes. If somebody is dirty and looks mean and miserable and does not work well, it is very hard to give that person justice in the same sense. But, if we were using our sentencing law appropriately, if we were doing justice to everyone, we would be trying to divorce our prejudices—I am not saying divorce our feelings because you cannot divorce feelings from the area of criminal law when there is so much emotion, and properly so—to do justice between the victim and the perpetrator of the crime and then we would be getting somewhere. Mandatory sentencing has to be seen in that context. It is a good thing that Senator Greig has raised it. I cannot anticipate what Senator Ludwig will say, but I hope he speaks a lot about the Northern Territory provisions that Clare Martin has brought in. Senator Brown, are you going to speak?
—Yes.
—I am always very interested to hear what he has to say. I think this is a topic that should be debated in this chamber. If you are sentenced to imprisonment, the old idea of the civilly dead is still around.
—The what?
—The civilly dead. In other words, if you are locked up you have no rights; therefore, you are called civilly dead. There was a film made about that in Melbourne—a horrifying film about the results of that sort of thing. People not only lose their freedom but also lose their reputation, their future and all sorts of things. They might deserve to have that happen to them. All I am saying is that, if we believe in a redemptive process, if we believe in some sort of justice, we will look at each individual and try to do the right thing in respect of him or her. There are lots and lots of principles about sentencing that have been developed, and we are still developing them, so let us develop them with the right spirit and on the right basis.

"Mason, Sen Brett",LP,2001-08-22,"—In rising to briefly address Senator Greig's urgency motion this afternoon, I congratulate him on an eloquent address against mandatory sentencing. I will make three points very quickly. Firstly, I oppose mandatory sentencing. I think that generally in this country punishment is justified because it rehabilitates. There is no evidence that mandatory sentencing rehabilitates. Sometimes it is argued that punishment may deter. I do not think there is any argument that mandatory sentencing deters. Some people have argued that mandatory sentencing can be an appropriate act of retribution or revenge, or part of just desserts. I am not even sure of that because, without the exercise of judicial discretion, the capacity for an appropriate reflection of just desserts is extremely difficult. I do not think you can justify mandatory sentencing on common punishment grounds.
Mandatory sentencing is a simple approach to a very complex problem, but what it does illustrate is that there is community concern about crime. Of that there is no doubt. There is great concern in the Northern Territory and Western Australia. I see from news clippings over the last couple of days that Mr Carr, the Premier of New South Wales, has come under some criticism for not being able to control crime in Western Sydney in particular. It is a big problem, hence people often clamour for simple solutions. That takes me to my second point. While I do not support mandatory sentencing, I do think it is an appropriate issue for a state or territory government to deal with. That might sound like a cop-out, but let me explain why.
It has always been the case under our constitutional arrangements—under the Commonwealth Constitution and state constitutions—that state governments have power over law and order and punishment. I think we would all agree with that: it is a matter of fact. But it is also a matter of principle. I am reluctant, sitting here in Canberra, to legislate for crime and justice issues relating to people living in Darwin or, for that matter, Perth or Brisbane. I think it is a matter best left to state legislatures. There has been a change of government in Western Australia this year and, it would seem, in the Northern Territory. If that is because people have changed their opinion on mandatory sentencing, that is fine with me. I will not be complaining about that. If Dr Gallop and Ms Martin wish to change the law, that is fine. I have no problem with that at all. It is something that is best left with state legislatures.
My third point is perhaps more important and more interesting. What worries me about some of the arguments—and these are not arguments put by Senator Greig today, but arguments I hear in the community, offered in the opinion pages of newspapers—is that there is a social and political agenda that seems to want to blame society for criminal activity rather than the individual. It is a philosophy that tends to deny that individuals have free will. That is a very dangerous philosophy. Obviously it is antithetical to liberalism because we believe in individual responsibility. That is central to our philosophy. I have been disturbed by things I have heard and read recently, to the effect that certain racial, perhaps religious or gender groups may be more predisposed to criminal activity and that, therefore, if they commit criminal activity, that is okay. I do not like that.
—No-one said it is okay.
—Senator Bolkus interjects and says, `No-one says it is okay.' I accept that no-one is saying it is okay. What I am trying to do though is shoot home responsibility. People in Australia will not wear the fact that people try to blame society. Individuals are responsible and must be held accountable for their actions. It is for that reason that the Attorney-General, Mr Williams, and this government proposed diversionary programs in the Northern Territory—with the former Chief Minister, Mr Burke, and his government—that forced offenders to come to terms with their offences—not to blame the victim, not to blame society, but to bring offenders face-to-face with the victims of their criminal activity. I think that is a very good thing. One thing we never want to get in this community is the view that somehow people are not responsible for their actions, or that some people are less responsible for their actions than others. That is racist and discriminatory. I will not wear it, and neither will the community. We have to ensure that all Australians are treated as one and, where there is disadvantage—and I accept Senator Bolkus's interjection—that has to be addressed. I hope that these diversionary programs are successful. There has been success in the past with the Dubbo program and with the victim-offender mediation in New Zealand. If we continue to work on that, I think we will move ahead.
In conclusion, I think Senator Greig should be applauded for bringing this matter before the Senate today. It is an important issue. I think he is right that mandatory sentencing is an inappropriate sentencing tool. In a federation such as Australia it is appropriate that state and territory legislatures take responsibility for that, but let us never take away responsibility from the individual.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Mandatory Sentencing</title>,Matters of Urgency,15,1
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2001-08-22,"—I rise to speak on standing order 75, the urgency motion moved by Senator Greig. At the outset I remind the Senate that the urgency motion goes to: 
The need for the Senate to acknowledge the increasing community opposition to mandatory sentencing and the imminent repeal of such legislation in the Northern Territory ... 
I might just pause at that point, and it is not to be unkind to Senator Greig. I understand the passion with which he speaks about mandatory sentencing in his home state. However, I am perplexed as to whether his motion means mandatory sentencing per se— whether it encompasses all types of mandatory sentencing—or whether we are talking about the mandatory sentencing Senator Brown's bill speaks about, which bill is currently before the Senate Legal and Constitutional Committee, or the mandatory sentencing considered by the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee when it inquired into the Human Rights (Mandatory Sentencing of Juvenile Offenders) Bill 1999.
The urgency motion talks specifically about the repeal of such legislation in the Northern Territory and urges the Western Australian government to repeal mandatory sentencing laws. Is that `laws' in plural—in other words, all mandatory sentencing laws? I think it is a minefield to go down that path. There is obviously a distinct difference between what is happening in Western Australia and what is happening in the Northern Territory. But there is also a distinct difference between mandatory sentencing laws as I understand them in this context—laws which go to property offences—and mandatory sentencing laws which might go to more serious or violent offences, that type of regime. I think Senator Cooney had a point when he said that mandatory sentencing is only one part of the issue. 
The other part of the issue is the community at large and how they regard mandatory sentencing. Senator Greig has informed us that there is increasing community opposition to mandatory sentencing. The community, as I understand it from a Queensland perspective, is concerned about crime and about how to deal with crime. With sufficient time I will go to the Queensland position and to how Queensland is dealing with crime in the community. But before going there, it might be worthwhile having a look at where we are now in relation to mandatory sentencing in the style that I understand it. Two types of mandatory sentencing exist in the Northern Territory currently and I suspect if Clare Martin becomes the Chief Minister that mandatory sentencing in the form of a property offence will end. In Western Australia I understand it was proposed that mandatory sentencing, following the introduction of the proposed property offences regime there, be reviewed after four years. 
Senator Cooney talked specifically about how you deal with issues that bubble up in the community such as what to do about crime. Senator Cooney hit the nail on the head when he talked about diversionary programs. The Northern Territory—under Attorney-General and Chief Minister, Denis Burke—did eventually look at how to walk away from mandatory sentencing per se as it relates to property offences. That regime went not so much to what the WA regime envisages—a `three strikes and you are in' regime—but more to a position where you have a graduated number of days in prison for the first offence, and then any subsequent offences. 
It is important to take a step back and look at what happened in the Northern Territory when they agreed with the federal government to introduce diversionary programs. From submissions that have been made in another place, the results appear to show that the programs were starting to have some effect. What directly worked to assist were community based drug and substance abuse diversionary programs, a jointly funded Aboriginal interpreter service, together with the establishment of a juvenile diversionary unit in the Northern Territory Police to administer the diversionary processes and to conduct family conferencing. Those issues, when you put them together, start to give us a better picture. They show us that diversionary programs can work to mitigate the problems in the community. Clare Martin's policy position, as enunciated prior to the Northern Territory election, was that:
Labor will repeal mandatory sentencing for property crime, replacing it with a regime that is tough on crime, and tough on the causes of crime. 
That brief statement fronts a well articulated position paper on crime protection, punishment and prevention. The one idea in that paper that I draw out is that there is clear evidence that community, social and developmental initiatives work to reduce crime. 
The Queensland Premier similarly established a task force on crime prevention back in August 1998 to address the causes of crime and implement effective crime prevention activities across all areas of government. Later, in December 1999, the Premier launched the Queensland crime prevention strategy, Building Safer Communities, as part of the government's overall approach. The Queensland government committed in the order of $80 million over three years for what are real solutions to deal with crime in the community: to establish a community crime prevention fund, to support local communities and to plan and manage crime prevention activities, plus a range of other mechanisms and guiding principles to ensure that diversionary programs and the like actually work within the community.
It is not only in Queensland. Western Australia similarly established a justice coordinating council to coordinate criminal justice and crime prevention initiatives—that is, the implementation of a state crime prevention strategy. Mandatory sentencing for property crime exists, as far as we can tell, in detail in two states. We have dealt with the Northern Territory which, as I have said, deals with a particular form of mandatory sentencing. For a first offence you get 14 days, for a second offence 90 days and for a third offence one year. Hopefully the Northern Territory government which I understand is about to form will abolish that system. 
In WA the Criminal Code was amended on 14 November 1996 to provide that adults or juvenile offenders who are convicted for a third or more time of a home burglary offence must be sentenced to a minimum of 12 months imprisonment. So that is the type of mandatory sentencing that we are looking at. Senator Mason went on briefly to give us his three reasons. Perhaps one of them was more a free-will speech rather than an argument about mandatory sentencing, but he was right in the sense that community concern about crime is important and needs to be addressed. But simply abolishing mandatory sentencing is not always the answer.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Mandatory Sentencing</title>,Matters of Urgency,15,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2001-08-22,"—I congratulate previous speakers on the quality of this debate and, indeed, Senator Greig for bringing the motion before the Senate. In the short time I have, I point to the very important role that the Senate has had in changing the mindset on mandatory sentencing laws in the Northern Territory and Western Australia as they relate to property crimes. We are all aware that these laws have particularly captured young indigenous people at a rate far above the non-indigenous population, and we recognise that these laws are for the mandatory sentencing of people for property crime but not, as Senator Cooney said, for white collar crimes which often involve much greater property loss for people in the community. 
In the run to the federal election in 1998, I foreshadowed I would move to introduce a bill into the Senate to override mandatory sentencing laws which captured children in the Northern Territory. I had been approached by indigenous groups and the Greens in the Northern Territory, but at that time there was no public debate about it. After the election I made good that commitment and consulted widely with other members of the Senate and got assistance from Chris Sidoti of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, Louis Schetzer from the National Children's and Youth Law Centre, and from legal and community representatives in the Northern Territory. On 25 August 1999, with the support of the ALP, the Democrats and the Independent member of the House of Representatives Peter Andren, I introduced a bill to ban mandatory sentencing for juveniles across Australia. That legislation was finally supported by the Senate. It was the first private member's legislation to go through this place in five years. I remind senators that it was supported because the government allowed government time for it to be debated, recognising the by then high level of public concern about the issue. There had been quite considerable turnouts of people protesting about mandatory sentencing in Hobart, Sydney, Melbourne and other cities around the country. Also, huge amounts of mail had been coming in to the offices of members of the Senate and the House of Representatives. 
A Senate committee then had hearings in Darwin, Alice Springs and Perth. Subsequent to that there was the tragic death of a 15-year-old Aboriginal boy from Groote Eylandt who had been detained in Darwin while serving a 28-day sentence for stealing texta colours worth a few dollars. It appears that he was totally unable to comprehend why he was there and for how long he was to stay in detention. There were public hearings and protests, and prominent people from all walks of life, including Jane Campion and Mal Meninga, signed petitions and supported statements in support of the bill. The majority of the Senate supported it.
As you know, Mr Acting Deputy President, the bill was then supported in the House of Representatives by Mr Andren and the Labor Party but it was not able to be debated because of government numbers. However, the government in turn then moved to introduce, with the Northern Territory, diversionary programs. I must say that this introduced the very important provision for Aboriginal language interpreters in the courts in the Northern Territory. There are now over 200 of these interpreters. Also, the age of majority was raised to 18 in the Northern Territory, which means that today, while we are here debating this, a large number of 17-year-olds are not in jail who otherwise might have been. Diversionary sentencing is working, and it will do so too in Western Australia where there is an even greater number of Aboriginals as against non-Aboriginals locked up under mandatory sentencing laws. I support this motion. I will continue to work to end mandatory sentencing and to do the right thing, that is, hand back to the courts their right to make the punishment—and hopefully rehabilitation sentence—fit the crime.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Mandatory Sentencing</title>,Matters of Urgency,15,1
"Eggleston, Sen Alan",LP,2001-08-22,"—Mandatory sentencing legislation raises complex and difficult issues. I think the record shows the Commonwealth government has recognised that states and territories have a difficult job dealing with the impact of crime and the problem of repeat offenders, and acknowledges that these are issues which the states and territories are best placed to address. I think we have to ask ourselves why in Western Australia and the Northern Territory there is mandatory sentencing. Mandatory sentencing in those two jurisdictions was introduced because people were concerned about law and order problems. There was a culture of lawlessness in Perth: there were home break-ins and old people were being beaten quite cruelly. There was a great deal of public concern about what was happening. That is why the Western Australian government introduced very focused mandatory sentencing laws concerning home invasion or home burglary.
In the Northern Territory, there was also great public concern about what appeared to be a culture of lawlessness and an impression—a widespread belief, in fact—that the courts were being too lenient with offenders and that the punishments that were being meted out did not reflect the seriousness of the crimes involved. People were concerned that recidivists seemed to be let off too lightly. We have to understand that background in considering the question of mandatory sentencing.
The agreement between the Commonwealth and the Northern Territory governments for a juvenile pre-court diversion scheme and an Aboriginal interpreter service has reflected the Commonwealth government's commitment to work cooperatively with the states and territories to prevent juveniles entering the criminal justice system. That program has had a fair degree of success. The Commonwealth has worked with the Northern Territory government to ensure that rehabilitation and education programs for young people are effective in preventing repeat offending, by addressing the underlying causes of juvenile crime. Significant progress has been made under the agreement, including the implementation of community based diversionary programs, the establishment of a juvenile diversion unit in the Northern Territory and the training of police in diversion procedures. Victim-offender conferencing has also been established, which has helped—perhaps reduced— the incidence of juvenile detention in the Northern Territory. The establishment of an Aboriginal interpreter service has also been a very important innovation.
The WA laws were introduced to deal with the question of home burglaries, and they are not draconian. Offenders are given ample opportunity to modify their behaviour before they run the risk of being sentenced to detention. Under the three-strike law, the mandatory detention system operating in WA, the question of detention only arises on a third conviction for home burglary. Before that occurs, offenders are always, in all cases, given numerous opportunities to mend their ways. The detention is a way of dealing with problem offenders, and I think that should be understood. The detention occurs in Western Australia in the interests of protecting members of the community and helping the offenders to overcome their problems through counselling and through dealing with issues like drug and alcohol problems. But it is not inevitable that children in Western Australia, even upon conviction for a third offence, will be detained. The alternative is that young people are placed on intensive youth supervision orders, through which they are provided with counselling and help in the community. Detention is only a default alternative.
Although a great deal has been said over the last two years in the parliament of Australia about Australia's mandatory detention regimes, I think it is very instructive to have a look at the rest of the world and compare Australian regimes with those of other countries, particularly with other common law jurisdictions such as the United States and the United Kingdom. On 18 April 2000, Radio National's Law Report dealt with the issue of mandatory sentencing. Susanna Lobez, the presenter, interviewed Professor Freiberg, of the University of Melbourne, about how Australia's regime compared with those in the rest of the world. Professor Freiberg made the point that Australia's regimes are minor and that in the United States, 23 states have mandatory sentencing laws, some of which are quite draconian. He said:
... in California there have been 40,000 convictions under mandatory sentencing laws, and people can get up to 25 years for a third strike for stealing a pizza.
Australia's regime pales in comparison. In the United Kingdom, the mandatory legislation also applies more strictly than it does in Australia. (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Mandatory Sentencing</title>,Matters of Urgency,15,1
"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,2001-08-22,"— In the few minutes remaining in the debate, I will touch on the key themes that have emerged today. I begin by making it very clear that the motion before us is not a directive. It is not a piece of legislation. We cannot today force the Western Australian government to do anything in particular. The motion is merely making a statement. I would argue that it is a moral statement, an important one and one which should be made. Given that this chamber has already passed legislation to that effect, which is a directive—because it would have had a real legal impact on the ground—I find it bizarre that we cannot simply reiterate that with a motion today.
Both Senators Mason and Coonan effectively said in their respective contributions that they believe strongly in states rights. Whatever views they may have on mandatory sentencing itself, they had strong views on the rights of states and territories to determine their own laws. I would argue that that ethos was completely obliterated some years ago when members of this chamber voted to overturn the voluntary euthanasia laws in the Northern Territory— which was legislation that that parliament introduced for its own people. I also make the point that the Northern Territory recently had a referendum—I think it was at the last federal election—in which it asked: `Do you want self-determination? Do you want self-government, or would you rather the Commonwealth continue to have overriding powers?' A majority of people voted for the latter, thereby giving this chamber the mandate to do as it chooses in terms of various laws in relation to the territories.
I take exception to some of Senator Mason's argument in relation to individual responsibility and to the notion of free will. It is a quaint notion, but I would argue that free will does not exist where an offender is severely and adversely affected, perhaps by drugs or poverty or desperation or mental illness or peer pressure. I learnt recently on an investigative tour in Darwin that many of the particularly young Aboriginal men that are being sentenced under mandatory sentencing in the Northern Territory are doing so as a right of passage. It is a way of achieving manhood, particularly for those from Groote Eylandt. It is a way of obtaining some kind of kudos within the white system.
I would say to Senator Mason rhetorically, who is not here, that, if we firmly believe in freedom of the individual, individuals must have freedom of choice and free will, and we must extend that ethos to judges and magistrates. They must be the ones who decide on the appropriate sentencing of offenders. Inflexible laws are not to be promoted by inflexible politicians. That is the core of the issue here. I think this chamber has both the right and the duty to send a message—if not to override legislation—to the Western Australian parliament that it firmly believes that mandatory sentencing is wrong for social reasons, for reasons of reconciliation and our response to indigenous people, and for economics.

"Ferguson, Sen Alan",LP,2001-08-22,"—Prior to the luncheon break I was talking about this legislation and in particular the disclosure of commission on risk products. I will not go over the ground that I covered at that time except to say that, as far as I am concerned, it is a matter of principle, which I stated quite strongly during all the discussions that we had prior to the introduction of this bill, that where the commission that is received by an agent in relation to a product has no effect on the end result for that client should a claim be made—and because it is defined as a risk product or a non-accumulative product there can only be a claim when the event occurs—the agent or the representative should not have to disclose to the client the amount of remuneration that he or she is getting. As a matter of fact, the disclosure could have exactly the opposite result. From my experience as an insurance agent for eight years, I know that there were some products where five per cent commission was paid and some where 10 per cent commission was paid. It is quite possible that the product that paid 10 per cent commission was a better product than the product that paid five per cent commission, yet it is in the consumers' mind that they must be getting a better deal. If the person who is selling the product is receiving less money, the consumer thinks they must be better off. The reverse is the case: sometimes they may choose the wrong product when the disclosure has to be made.
I note Senator Murray's second reading amendment where he, as a sort of halfway house, moved:
... that the requirement in the legislation that commissions on risk products be fully disclosed be referred to the Joint Statutory Committee on Corporations and Securities for inquiry and report on or before October 2003.
In other words, during the transition period we will see what happens to risk products: we will have an inquiry and at the end of the day if it is not working so well then maybe we will do something about it. Can I say with respect to Senator Murray that, while I certainly will be supporting that because it is better than anything that is currently in the bill, really that is putting the cart before the horse. What should have happened is that the disclosure of commission on risk products should have been left as it is during the transition period. Then at the end of two years there could be an inquiry to see whether or not the nondisclosure of commission on risk products had affected in any way the transparency or the decision making of people who were actually purchasing those products from agents and whether people might make submissions to the Joint Corporations and Securities Committee saying, `Look, we feel that the nondisclosure of commission on risk products is having an adverse effect on the clients.'
I can tell you that the disclosure of commission has never come at the request of consumers. The consumer bodies may have given evidence to Senator Chapman's committee that they needed all the transparency that was available. That is their job. The Consumers Association need almost to find a justification for their existence in some cases, and I think this is one of them. There has never been any push from consumers for the disclosure of commission on risk products. I sold those products for eight years and I can tell you that never once was I asked what was the commission rate on the product that was being sold. The client was concerned only as to whether the product that they were buying was going to deliver them the result they wanted in the event of a claim being made. Commission was never the issue. While people might come in here and talk about HIH and the collapse of major insurers, the disclosure of commission would not have made any difference to that. The quantum of commission that is paid to agents certainly does not influence the product that people will buy in risk cases.
I can give you another example in the area of crop insurance, which I was involved with because I lived in a farming area and did a lot of work there. Some companies do not like crop insurance; some companies do like crop insurance because the larger your portfolio the more your risk is spread. If you can get a big enough portfolio it becomes good insurance; if you have only a small portfolio of crop insurance it is a higher risk because you have not spread it as much. I dealt with companies some of whom offered five per cent commission for crop insurance and some of whom offered 10 per cent commission for crop insurance. Their rates were exactly the same, but one company liked the business; the other did not. It was only natural that, as an agent, where there was no difference, I wanted to look after my security and my income so I chose in most cases one that paid 10 per cent commission. I knew the product that the client was getting was exactly the same as that where I was getting only five per cent. I think that is a decision that any person in business would make. I may have put car insurance with another company because they liked car insurance while the company that liked crop insurance did not like car insurance. The quantum of commission and the level of commission that is paid to an agent bears no relation to whether or not the person is adequately covered for the risk that they are insuring against.
—It is strange that in this bill crop insurance is regarded as wholesale and not covered.
—I understand that Senator Chapman. I was only using it as an example.
—It is an inconsistency.
—But it would have been so simple in this bill for the government to have decided to say that it requires a disclosure of all commissions paid except for those commissions paid on risk or non-accumulation products. Where there is a commission paid on an accumulation product and the amount received by the agent or the person representing the company affects that which the client may get, it must be disclosed. The person needs all that information to make a balanced decision, particularly in the case of general insurance. Term life is another example where you insure yourself for a flat rate regardless and the premium is X amount of dollars. In most cases in term life, people look at the premium. They do not look at what commission is paid; they want to know how much it is going to cost them in actual dollars to get the death and disability cover that they require for their own protection, the protection of their business or the protection of their family.
This is a very good bill overall. It has been made much better by the amendments that will be moved by the government as a result of the considerable work that has been done by Senator Chapman and the Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities. They have twice looked into this bill. As I said in my opening remarks, this bill has had a very long gestation period. I congratulate the minister on the amount of consultation that took place, because it is almost two years since we first saw the proposals that are coming forward in this legislation. Every player in the field has had a chance to be consulted and had a chance to have their say.
I was disappointed in the remarks in the editorial in today's Financial Review and in Paul Cleary's article which were simply not accurate. If they choose to report on rumour or what somebody else might tell them, it would not hurt them to actually check the facts before they put it in the paper. There was never on our side of politics any resistance. He talked about `long running resistance by small life insurance agents to disclosure of commission'. That simply was not true. This side of the parliament has always supported disclosure for life agents where they are talking about accumulation and financial products. I do not know whether Senator Sherry was in the chamber this morning when I was talking, but in my life as an agent we were disclosing full fees and charges in every presentation out of a laptop computer from 1987 onwards. This is not something new. Some companies did not, but this is not something new. I am disappointed in the reporting.
I am also disappointed in some of the reaction of the Financial Planning Association, Mr Ken Breakspear and IFSA. They are looking after the big end of town, they are looking after the companies and they are looking after those people who deal in much greater amounts of money and looking at things like trailer commissions and other matters. My concern and my only concern in relation to risk products is to make sure that the livelihoods of the very, very small operator, that person who makes even just part of their income out of selling risk insurance as an adjunct to their business—and there are thousands of them throughout rural and regional Australia that I know of and certainly some in metropolitan areas as well—are not going to be affected by the fact that they have to disclose the quantum of their commission to their clients when they are talking to them. As I stated just before lunch, I know a number of people who would say, `Well, if this is the quantum of commission you are making, sling me a half or take less and I will give you the business,' so in fact you are reducing their income.
The other point I want to make is that I believe this is going to be a device for major insurance companies to push down the rate of commission to the lowest common denominator so it makes it very difficult for some of the smaller operators and smaller agents to make a living as a commission agent. As I said right at the very start from my speech, earning an income from commission is still an honourable profession and way to make a living and one that should be respected in the way that it always has been. I wonder whether we will get to the day, if this legislation gets through and we see the disclosure of commission, where someone who is selling second-hand cars and wants you to buy a Holden instead of Ford will have to say, `I am getting paid $150 extra to sell you the Holden,' or someone who is pushing a certain line of suit to you in a men's clothing store will have to tell you he is making a quid because he is selling more of those suits than something else. Why single out risk products and the disclosure of commission on risk products when in fact the person who is purchasing gets exactly the same result at the end of the day regardless of the commission that is paid? But I commend the bill as a whole because I think it is a very good bill.",SENATE,<title>FINANCIAL SERVICES REFORM BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1
"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2001-08-22,"—I am very pleased to speak in support of the Financial Services Reform Bill 2001 and the related bills in this package that will revolutionise financial services in Australia and the provision of financial services in Australia. The bill contains landmark reforms, as earlier speakers have said. The reforms have been described in detail and I do not want to go over the detail again. 
The bill restructures an industry that contributes about seven per cent to Australia's economy and employs close to 330,000 Australians. It will directly benefit the 17 million consumers of financial services in Australia and it will provide the industry with unprecedented opportunities to export services to an estimated three billion people in Asia and in other jurisdictions.
The purpose of the bill is to harmonise the fragmented regulatory regime for the financial services industry to ensure a consistent level of market integrity and consumer protection across the industry. It establishes a single licensing regime for the provision of financial services. Essentially, it proposes three key reforms: a harmonised licensing, disclosure and conduct framework for all financial service providers, a consistent and comparable framework for financial product disclosure and a streamlined regulatory regime for financial markets and for clearing and settlement facilities. 
Consumers particularly will benefit from the introduction of a consistent framework of consumer protection. They will have an enhanced capacity to understand and compare different financial products and to evaluate financial advice. Consumers will also have access to efficient procedures to deal with complaints and to resolve disputes with financial service providers. I want to say something about that a little later. Industry will benefit by the cutting of compliance costs and the removal of regulatory barriers to the introduction of technological innovations. E-commerce will be boosted by the facilitation of electronic delivery of a range of financial services and products. 
Today, our services sector is one of the most dynamic and innovative sectors of the Australian economy. It represents 72 per cent of GDP and this percentage is growing. Mining and agriculture represent over eight per cent and financial services represent over seven per cent of GDP. But when it comes to exports, it is a very different story. Services represent only one per cent, whereas the mining and manufacturing sector represents 55 per cent. Projections suggest that revenue from Asia's financial services industries will reach $US450 billion by the year 2011. In non-Japan Asia, real financial market revenues are expected to grow by 10 per cent per year. Obviously, there is significant potential for Australia to grow our export of financial and professional services. It is against this background and the need to meet the challenges of changing consumer needs, the forces of globalisation, technological advances and the blurring of traditional boundaries between different types of service providers that this bill has been introduced. This government is responding to consumer expectations for better service at less cost and greater returns on more diverse investments. 
The bill delivers the third instalment of the reforms arising out of the 1997 financial system inquiry known as the Wallis report. The bill is essentially based on the premise that it is no longer possible for different institutions, services and products to be regulated under separate financial frameworks governing licensing, disclosure and other conduct obligations which vary across different industry sectors. The bill, as others have said, is complex and far reaching. For the purpose of my brief contribution today, I want to confine my comments to a couple of issues. The first is the complaint provisions. Under the bill, all licensees will be required to be members of an independent complaints scheme approved by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission within a two-year transition period. So far, ASIC has approved the insurance inquiry complaints scheme for general insurance as well as the financial industry complaints scheme. The latter covers licensed shareholders, financial planners, life insurers and fund managers. Obviously, providers of banking services and superannuation services will also require approval of an appropriate complaints scheme. 
The significant improvement on existing complaints schemes is that, at the point of sale, either when buying a financial product or receiving financial advice, a provider will also be required to furnish a comprehensive disclosure document that will include information on how to make a complaint. This is a boost for the consumer, who otherwise might be unaware of how to make a complaint and might get discouraged by the difficulty of taking on a large institution and indeed overwhelmed by the financial burden of the cost implications of pursuing a complaint in court. Obviously, a cheap, effective and fair means of resolving disputes is in the interests of both the consumer and the financial provider, and there is a real interest in making that known right at the start.
It has to be said that not all complaints will be justified or will warrant a remedy, whatever a complainant might think. But where consumers have been misled or facts material to the risk being assumed have not been disclosed or adequately explained, or where the provider has been negligent and a consumer has suffered loss, an independent and readily accessible complaints mechanism can assist in sorting out responsibility before the matter escalates and entrenched positions are taken by either side. 
Following what might be regarded as an exhaustive consultation process—as Senator Ferguson has said—that has included extensive industry consultation and two reports of the Parliamentary Joint Statutory Committee on Corporations and Securities, the government has brought forward some sensible amendments to the regulatory framework and uniform licensing provisions. Here I would also like to add my commendations on the work of the committee, which across party lines have worked through a very complex regulatory framework and have brought the bill to the chamber in a pretty sound state for debate. The key amendments are: retention of existing contractual arrangements with life companies; exempting lawyers and tax advisers who give incidental financial advice in the ordinary course of their activities; the exemption of pooled superannuation funds in the wholesale market; and some limitations on the taping of financial advice given by telephone to retail investors during takeovers.
I wish to briefly comment on the requirement that those selling financial products disclose all fees, charges and commissions, which has been the subject of earlier contributions. This requirement has been the subject of some criticism as having the potential to affect small agencies, typically in country Australia, which sell general insurance, often as an adjunct to some other business such as a stock and station agency or a pharmacy. One of the arguments advanced in favour of the proposition that those agents selling risk products should be exempt from disclosure is that the commission paid will have no direct impact on the ultimate outcome for the consumer. However, this view overlooks the fact that the underlying objective of the bill is to ensure that the consumer is protected and given sufficient information in a form that will enable them to make an informed choice. 
The amount of commission paid to an agent is a material fact that may influence a consumer's choice of provider. It may also signal how keen a provider is to get the business. When faced with two largely identical products from two different providers, why would an agent not go for the one that pays the highest commission? In that scenario, the decision would be influenced by the financial interests of the agent rather than factors that would impact on the consumer such as the service history or the financial health of the provider. It must be said in defence of agents—and I wholeheartedly accept this—that most would be influenced quite properly by a number of factors, including competitive premiums and how to provide a good service for their client. However, it is not as clear-cut as it should be. Any material factors going to the formation of a contract which could influence a consumer's choice of provider should be transparent and disclosed. I do not think that the arguments advanced for exemption are sufficient to outweigh the consumer's right to know about the financial reward that the agent will gain by recommending a certain provider.
No doubt these reforms will require adjustments, and the two-year transitional period seems not unreasonable in the circumstances. As Chair of the Senate Regulations and Ordinances Committee, I look forward to scrutinising the detailed machinery of the regulatory scheme to ensure fairness and that personal rights are protected. The regulations are also subject to an extensive consultation process with industry and consumer representative bodies.
Finally, the bill represents new approaches to regulation of market misconduct. The explanatory memorandum makes it clear that the existing law in the Corporations Act is intended to be reproduced but extended to all financial products and markets. Lawyers and those advising industry will need to be alive to the implications that the application of the Criminal Code will bring to conduct regulated by the bill. As this is a speech and not a legal advice—sometimes I tend to slip into my former role—I will but refer to the comprehensive and thoughtful exploration of these legal issues in a paper given by Joe Longo, special counsel to Freehill's lawyers, and delivered on 31 May at Sydney University's law school.
—A fine Western Australian.
—He is a good Western Australian. I quote the concluding paragraph:
For lawyers, great care will need to be taken to identify the legislative strand which supports a particular conclusion. For industry, while much of the substance of the regulatory approach presently found in the Corporations Act is intended to be reproduced in proposed Chapter 7, the attempt to take a unified approach to regulating financial products generally will, I think, force industry to reconsider its compliance strategies as regulatory and market attention is, in effect, refocussed on a range of financial products that historically may not have been regarded as being relevant to market manipulation and insider trading, for example.
I commend the paper to those who are interested in the market misconduct provisions. 
It would be remiss of me if I did not also note the role that Senator Ian Campbell played in the development of many aspects of this legislation. There have been a lot of players in this, as well as extensive consultation, but while we have quite rightly praised the efforts of the committee we should also note that Senator Ian Campbell played a pivotal role in earlier incarnations of this bill. Having said all that, I will now sit down. I commend the bill to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>FINANCIAL SERVICES REFORM BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2001-08-22,"—How hard it is to follow the eloquent contribution of the Deputy Government Whip. It would be hard to find anyone in this building whose knowledge could surpass her knowledge of corporate law issues. While we are patting each other on the back so vigorously, I should mention the tremendous contribution of a range of people to what has been, without exaggerating, a very successful program. I do not even think people on the opposition benches would contradict this, although I can get carried away from time to time on this. The Corporate Law Economic Reform Program—CLERP, one of the worst acronyms in modern political history, designed in my office back in 1997—has generally been supported by all groupings within the parliament. We have had a couple of disagreements. The most significant one was over takeovers reform, where I and the government were pressing to have a follow-on rule, a mandatory bid rule, which would mirror the law that is in place in the City of London. That is the most significant policy difference, and I still remain hopeful that at some stage in the future the Democrats and potentially the Labor Party may see the benefit of that takeovers reform.
Having said that, I want to carry on from Senator Coonan and say thank you to the range of people who saw what started its life as CLERP 6 and have been deeply involved in moving it from the initial concept of merging chapters 7 and 8 of the Corporations Law to today, when it has become known as the Financial Sector Reform Bill. The existing Corporations Law had the stock exchange regulated or legislated under chapter 7 and the futures exchange under chapter 8. Back in 1997, we decided that the products and services effectively offered by the futures exchange and by the stock exchange had merged in many respects, that many of the derivatives type contracts and a range of the other futures type contracts offered by the stock exchange at that time had merged and that there was little justification for having two separate bodies of law regulating those financial products.
From there, we also looked closely at a report called the good advice report, as I recall, which recommended, as you would know, Mr Acting Deputy President Sherry, from your experience in superannuation, that there needed to be some harmonisation of regulation of people involved in giving financial advice across a range of financial areas, including superannuation, general insurance, risk and non-risk products and a range of other financial planning offerings—including managed investments, which have been in the news lately—and the traditional securities and futures products. That was a report that made some sound recommendations.
Following that report, we then had the Wallis inquiry, which looked at reform of the entire financial system in Australia, and many of the key Wallis recommendations were implemented during the last parliament. That saw the establishment of the Prudential Regulatory Authority, new powers for ASIC and the most historic reform of the financial system in Australian history. Most people—certainly those in international areas looking at Australia's regulatory structure—are finding a system in Australia that is operating very effectively and has made Australia an exemplar around the world in terms of corporations and financial regulation. It is interesting to see that even in European countries like Germany they are tending more and more to model their financial and corporate law governance structures on the system that has been developed here in Australia under the CLERP program since the Treasurer gave me responsibility for that program at the end of 1996.
That was when we set out. With this significant piece of reforming legislation, we are nearing the end of that enormous Corporate Law Economic Reform Program. This brings to an end a lot of that process. Even though we look forward to CLERP 7 coming before the parliament fairly shortly, CLERP 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 together saw the most significant rewriting of Corporations Law in Australian history. They make our Corporations Law the envy of many other jurisdictions around the world. I think when we finally get the follow-on rule and the mandatory bid rule into takeovers law, it will be without any doubt the greatest corporations regime on the globe. We look forward to Senator Andrew Murray's support for that change when it comes before the Senate next.
But it did involve enormous consultation and a policy view from the Treasurer and myself and the government that we should rewrite the Corporations Law with a couple of key objectives. The core one was to have a body of law in this country which encouraged enterprise, encouraged business, encouraged investment, encouraged the formation of capital and encouraged mergers and acquisitions so that capital could find its best use and which also created an institutional framework with the Wallis reforms that gave consumers a stronger level of protection and better disclosure regimes, so that consumers knew, in better and more assessable detail, what the sorts of risks and rewards and opportunities of the various products they would be accessing were, so that they were then able to make better decisions based on that information.
It has been an enormous process. I think it is fair to say that it has contributed significantly already, with the enactment of the fundraising reforms, the takeovers reforms, the corporate governance reforms and, very importantly, the reforms to accounting standards, to Australia's growth as an international financial centre and, although it is hard to measure these things, I think it has contributed to Australia's increasing economic security in a period when we are pretty much a Rock of Gibraltar economically in a turbulent sea of international economic events. That is a very good thing. It means that the mums and dads, as they have begun to be known in recent years, the investors of Australia, who either invest through big superannuation funds or in managed investment schemes or directly into securities or other products, can feel some security and become part of the free enterprise system in Australia with some security about their investments. No Corporations Law and no financial structure is ever going to take away risk, but it is very important that, when people enter into these products, they understand what the risks are and what the rewards are.
I think it has been an important reform. I am pleased to have been associated with it. I join Senator Coonan in thanking Senator Chapman for his significant work throughout the entire CLERP program, and particularly with this bill. I also pay credit particularly to Senator Ferguson. During my time of trying to get CLERP6 into a piece of legislation and ultimately into this place, he gave me enormous assistance with his significant personal knowledge of and expertise in the insurance industry. I know that Senator Ferguson is respected throughout the industry across Australia. I thank him for the time he gave to me when I was a parliamentary secretary struggling with the demands of the insurance industry. I also thank my friend John Hibbett at the FPA, the banks and all the different players in this. I think the concept of finding a unique, single regulatory regime for all the people who have been in that industry for so long was, I guess, in Sir Humphrey's language a brave decision, but we are here today. I see from my briefings from departmental officials that on most of the areas of this law there is pretty solid agreement. We will have a couple of disagreements in the committee stage.
I conclude by thanking not only all the people here but all the people who did bother to come forward and assist the government to design this large package. I mentioned John Hibbett, but there were many other people right around Australia who contributed and gave up their very valuable time to assist the government with its consultations. Last, but not least, I thank the departmental officials who used to be in the Business Law Division—I do not know what it is called these days. Since Jim Murphy's time as the head there, there has been a whole range of people in the Treasury department in what was called the Business Law Division. It is probably called something else now. They are not all here in the box today but are back at Treasury, but I thank them for the enormous amount of work that has gone on since late 1996 until the present.
I think you would be hard pressed to find a piece of legislation that has had the sort of consultation that this has had. It deserved it. I think Joe Hockey, the minister, would tell you that it is about seven per cent of the GDP of Australia. It affects just about every man, woman and child in Australia, because just about everyone has some form of interaction with the investment community, no matter where they invest. Getting this legislation right and ensuring that consumers are protected, and balancing that with a need to develop capital, is a hard balancing exercise. I sincerely thank the Treasury officers who have put so much time and effort into what is a significant piece of legislation. I thank all honourable senators who have contributed to the debate and look forward to moving this legislation through its subsequent stages. I commend the bill to the Senate.

"Hutchins, Sen Steve",ALP,2001-08-22,"—I rise, following my colleagues Senator Bolkus and Senator McLucas, to outline Labor's position on these environment bills. As has been reported to the Senate by Senators Bolkus and McLucas, the bare bones of what these bills will do cover four areas. Firstly they will gut the Australian Heritage Commission, which currently operates independently to manage and protect Australian heritage, and replace it with the Australian Heritage Council, which will merely have an advisory role. Secondly they will transfer the power to make decisions relating to the listing of heritage sites away from an independent body of experts like the Heritage Commission and pass it on to the federal environment minister.
The third aspect of the bills is that they will abolish the current Register of National Estate and replace it with a National Heritage List or Commonwealth Heritage List. This will be limited only to properties of national value, relegating responsibility for the protection of all other sites to the states. Finally, this puts a cloud over the future of the 13,000 sites currently on the Register of National Estate. It will be at the discretion of the minister as to which sites will fit into this new Commonwealth Heritage List and which will simply be left off it.
So these bills seek to abolish an independent body of experts such as the current Australian Heritage Commission and replace it with an advisory body; they seek to abolish the Register of National Estate and put in jeopardy those 13,000 sites that are currently on it; and they seek to transfer the naming of that sort of stuff—that is, they will move from being on a Register of National Estate to being on a Commonwealth Heritage List. That signifies to me, and I am sure it signifies to a lot of Australians who are concerned about the preservation of not only our indigenous heritage but also our European heritage, that we are about to allow the vandals to get inside the gate.
As a Tasmanian, Mr Acting Deputy President Sherry, you may recall—and I certainly do, as a New South Welshman—the Askin years in New South Wales between 1965 and 1976 under Sir Robert Askin, Premier Tom Lewis and Sir Eric Willis. I recall the number of heritage properties that were bulldozed around Sydney in that era—in those 11 years of conservative New South Wales rule—to make way for high-rise apartments. That is what the coalition did when they were in power over that period in New South Wales. It disturbs me that this is the intent of this legislation, particularly for places in New South Wales.
As I said, there are 13,000 sites listed on the Register of National Estate. In just my local area, in the city of Penrith, there are a number of them, which I will refer to shortly. When we have a number of Liberals and National Party people in this place who purport to have some sense of history and some need, as I said, for the continuity of not only indigenous heritage but also European heritage, I cannot understand why they are not more outspoken in their party rooms and are not saying more here in the parliament itself.
There are a number of sites—and I will be Sydney-centric and New South Wales-centric—that are worthy of preservation. At the moment we have 13,000 listed. But, if we accept what the minister and the government are proposing, we could end up with only a handful of sites. The sites that may be deemed to be on the Commonwealth Heritage List may be limited and a number of indigenous and European icons that we wish to preserve may be abolished by an incoming conservative government—whether it is in New South Wales or anywhere else. This is akin to allowing the vandals in the gates. This is akin to allowing them to walk in, take over and threaten these icons that we hold precious and dear.
I recall clearly the tory years in New South Wales, during which a lot of heritage listed buildings were torn down, carted away and not preserved to make way for high-rises around Sydney Harbour. I recall clearly going with one of my uncles, who was a tip truck driver, to Mosman while they carted away the remnants of a number of buildings with beautiful Georgian architecture that had been bulldozed to make way for some sort of high-rise.
I know that you, Mr Acting Deputy President Lightfoot, are probably very concerned about the preservation of icons of European importance, as your own actions in relation to the Fremantle Artillery Barracks demonstrate. So I wonder why the party room of the coalition has allowed the opportunity in this legislation for the preservation of these heritage listed areas to be transferred to the hands of the state governments. I cannot recall the name of the former New South Wales coalition minister who was quite proud of his slogan `tar, seal and beautify', but that was the way he approached any area, whether it was heritage listed buildings or heritage listed bushland. That is what we will see. The bill will transfer the decision making from an independent body of experts to an advisory panel and, in the end, the decision will be made by a minister on political grounds.
People might say that we are lucky to have a conservative conservationist type minister in the position at the moment, but I do not believe that, and I think that will be proven in time. I do not believe that this should be subject to political pressure, because we are dealing with a number of sites in a number of areas that, if they were `tarred, sealed and beautified', would probably attract a lot of money. I do not believe it is fair on any federal government minister to be put into a political predicament where, for example, there is some bushland around Sydney Harbour and they are approached and told, `If you can sell this bushland off you might get a few hundred million dollars,' even though this bushland might have some indigenous attraction or might have some attraction for descendants of European settlers. I do not believe that the minister should be put into that position. That is why, under Labor's legislation, the independent body of experts made that decision. What was wrong with that? The body is made up of people who have an interest in heritage listing, architecture, the environment and the ecology. Why would we—or anybody listening to this broadcast—give this government a blank cheque to go and destroy our indigenous and European heritage? There are no guarantees in this legislation that that would not occur—none at all. It all goes back to the minister. It all goes back to the possibility that the minister would be subject to pressure from his political cronies.
I saw what Sir Robert Askin did in New South Wales during his government's years in power. I saw what Tom Lewis did. I saw what Sir Eric Willis did when a high-rise building got in the way of some European or indigenous heritage. They were subject to political pressure—or they applied it themselves. They tore down these buildings and they tore away a lot of Sydney's heritage. That was done because of the kind of political pressure the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, Senator Hill, will be putting himself under if this bill is passed. We are going to oppose these bills and I hope that the Democrats oppose these bills. We believe that the current legislation is quite adequate. We feel that the legislation should be altered so as to progress the ability of the Commonwealth to protect and manage Australian heritage sites, not to strip them back, as this legislation allows to occur.
—The current legislation offers no protection at all!
—Understand this, Minister: you are going to be put under political pressure if this bill is passed. It will all come back to you. The white shoe brigade will come and say to you, `Please, let's rip this away, let's put some nice high-rises here, let's put a freeway through here—let's do something like that.' You will be subject to it. It is foolish of anybody to think that that will not occur. It is absolutely foolish of the government to put their minister in a position where that might occur. 
I want to talk about my local area, as I have done before. Currently, of the 22 sites in my local area— the city of Penrith—21 are in the electorate of Lindsay, which is held by Mrs Kelly.
—She is a very good member, too. She is an excellent local representative.
—I would not say that. I want to talk about a number of the sites that will be in jeopardy if this bill is carried. I know what the Liberals think about Western Sydney. They think we do not exist. Like a lot of Liberals, they think that Sydney stops at Strathfield and starts again at Leura. Except for probably Mrs Kelly and, say, Mr Kerry Bartlett, there are no Liberals past Parramatta. Of course, you understand why. Senator Payne has an office at Parramatta, but she drives out there every day from some trendy inner city suburb. I am not sure where Senator Coonan lives, but I am sure that it is nowhere near where I live in St Marys, which is out in the west of Sydney.
Let us look at what the Liberals think about people who live in Western Sydney and why I say we are in jeopardy if this legislation is passed. I refer to a report by David Penberthy in the Daily Telegraph of 6 August. Mr Acting Deputy President, being a Western Australian, you might not be aware that there is to be a by-election in Auburn in Western Sydney in a few weeks time. The Liberals are running a candidate. I do not know why, but I suppose it is to beef up Mrs Chikarovski's leadership chances. Let me tell you what the advice was for the Liberals when they went out and campaigned in Auburn. What frontbencher Brad Hazzard said to his colleagues—I do not know Mr Hazzard but I understand he represents the North Shore seat of Wakehurst in Sydney—was that when male MPs go out to the west and campaign in Auburn they should keep a tracksuit top in their car because in the past residents have responded better when he wore a tracksuit instead of a shirt and tie.
—I rise on a point of order. Mr Acting Deputy President, this might be interesting to some—although I doubt it—but it is certainly not relevant to the bill before the chamber. If the honourable senator wants to have a chat about domestic political issues near his place of residence, perhaps he should do so on the adjournment.
 (Senator Lightfoot)—I remind you, Senator Hutchins, that your remarks should be addressed to the bills before the Senate. However, if you are developing an argument in the next few seconds with respect to what you were saying, please proceed; otherwise, revert back to the bill.
—What I am getting to, as I said, is the fact that in the City of Penrith, where I am a resident, we currently have 22 estates on the national register. I believe they are in jeopardy if this legislation is carried. I believe they are in jeopardy because, as I said earlier, most Liberals think Sydney stops at Strathfield and starts again at Leura.
—Are they on the state list?
—No, they are your Liberals too.
—No. Heritage items—are they on the state list?
—Let me explain to Senator Hill, through you, Mr Acting Deputy President, that Senator Marise Payne, one of his colleagues, has an office in Parramatta, but she drives out to Parramatta from the inner city every day, I assume, when she goes to her office. I understand that the office of Senator Coonan, another Liberal senator, is in Phillip Street. I am not sure that Senator Coonan gets out to the west at all. Senator Heffernan is a Liberal from Wagga Wagga. I do not know that Senator Heffernan has an office in Sydney at all. What I was developing—
—I rise on a point of order, Mr Acting Deputy President. I submit to you that it is a reflection upon Senator Coonan to suggest that she does not travel to the west of Sydney. She represents the whole of New South Wales, and I am confident she represents it well, including the west of Sydney.
—I do not think that was a point of order, but—
—I withdraw that reflection on Senator Coonan because I know, from talking to her the other day, that she was out in Blacktown. She had to get a lift from a tow truck driver, as I understand it.
—Senator, please proceed to address the bills currently before the chair. If there were fewer interjections, I am sure Senator Hutchins would find it much more appropriate to address the bill, rather than answering interjections.
—We believe that our locally registered sites will be in jeopardy.
—How?
—I have already explained it to you. If you have not worked it out by now, you are not going to. What do the Liberals in Sydney think? As I have said, Brad Hazzard has advised his colleagues campaigning in Auburn that they should wear a tracksuit top and tracksuit pants. There is one Liberal state member of parliament in Western Sydney, Liz Kernohan—she is not a bad person—who has apparently advised that when the women MPs run around Auburn trying to—
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I raise the point of order that was made a little earlier. What Liberals may or may not have said about what people should wear seems to have almost no relevance to how these sites could conceivably be endangered.
—On the point of order, Mr Acting Deputy President, I have been listening to Senator Hutchins's excellent speech. Senator Hutchins has been drawing attention to the cultural significance of Western Sydney, and he believes it would be endangered as a result of this legislation. I think it is entirely appropriate, in developing that argument, for Senator Hutchins to reflect upon the cultural heritage, if you like—the cultural attitudes—of the representatives of the Liberal Party with respect to—
—There is no point of order, Senator Forshaw.
—I am not making a point of order: I am speaking on the point of order.
—You are out of order.
—I was responding to the argument that the point by Senator Hutchins about the cultural views of Liberals in Sydney is not relevant to this debate. I would suggest that it is very relevant because it is relevant to the approach that this government and the political party would take to cultural heritage in Western Sydney.
—I am sure the Senate will take on board what you have said, Senator Forshaw. I invite Senator Hutchins to proceed with the bills currently before the Senate.
—Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. I refer to what Ms Kernohan said. She advised—
—Mr Acting Deputy President, Senator Hutchins is reverting—
—He hasn't even quoted her yet. She's a member for Western Sydney.
—He has. He said that when she was speaking to women Liberal members—
—Do you have a point of order, Senator Coonan?
—My point of order is that Senator Hutchins is reverting to form and proceeding to speak about what Liz Kernohan, the member for Camden, said to some other Liberal women members. That cannot be relevant, culturally or in any other way, to the protection of heritage sites.
—Senator Forshaw, I do not mean to disturb your conversation with Senator Coonan—and I apologise for having to do it—but you are out of order. Senator Hutchins, you may proceed with the information that you can give the Senate that is relevant to the bills.
—I would argue that what I am about to say in relation to what Dr Kernohan said—
—That is what I am inviting you to do. If it is relevant, Senator Hutchins, you may do it.
—I believe it is. It says what the attitude of Sydney Liberals to people who live in the western suburbs of Sydney does in terms of jeopardising the sites that are on the Register of the National Estate.
—I do not think you can generalise, Senator Hutchins.
—Let me proceed, Mr Acting Deputy President. 
—I am inviting you to proceed, but please restrict your comments to those that pertain to the bills before the chamber.
—I will. When Sydney was first settled in 1788, the early part of the settlement was on Sydney Harbour but the major part of the settlement for almost 30-odd years was on the fringes of Sydney. In fact, they call places such as Liverpool, Penrith, Windsor and Parramatta `Macquarie towns'. At the time, they were far more relevant to the governing and the economic wellbeing of the colony. In my area, there are a number of sites of historic value that I believe will be jeopardised if this bill proceeds. One of the sites that I believe is in danger is called Mamre House, which is not far from where I live. It was originally the property of Samuel Marsden, the `flogging parson'. I believe its continuity on the Register of the National Estate could be well and truly jeopardised if this bill proceeds. As in the good old days of Robert Askin, this building, being on valuable property, could be bulldozed. 
I also want to refer to Werrington House. In terms of the history of the country, Werrington House, which is in the city of Penrith, was where Sir Henry and Lady Parkes once resided. They resided there from 1860 to 1872. I believe that this place may be jeopardised if it is put into a political environment where a minister has to make a decision, even though independent experts have determined this place is of historical relevance. There is also Victoria Bridge, across from Emu Plains to Penrith, which is one of two bridges constructed between 1864 and 1867. The only other bridge that is still standing that was constructed in that period is at Menangle. Also in Penrith is a place called Thornton Hall. This was the home of the Smith family—I do not mean the Smith Family charity group—of Thomas Smith and then his son Sydney. Sydney Smith was the first member for Macquarie in the federal parliament and the first Post Master General. These sites are of immense value, and the minister may agree. I do not believe that such decisions should be taken away from independent experts whose opinion is that these buildings belong on the estate and given to some sort of advisory body that may or may not agree with that opinion.
It is clearly the intention of this legislation to reduce the number of places on the Register of National Estate from 13,000 to a few hundred. This is where I come back to my point about the Liberals and their attitude to Western Sydney. I have already said that they think that we just wear tracksuit tops and pants out there, that that is how sartorially elegant we are. Dr Kernohan said that Liberal MP women were best not to wear make-up or dress too well because women may be embarrassed to answer the door—
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order, which goes to relevance. The bill has nothing to do with women wearing make-up. The honourable senator was doing well for a while. He was referring to listed properties within Western Sydney and was seeking to make—
—You are just wasting his time. You have made the same point of order all the way through. It is you that is irrelevant.
—Thank you very much. We do not talk about whether women should wear make-up during question time. 
—Senator Hill, what is your point of order.
—The point of order is that Senator Hutchins, having got back onto the bills for a short while, has now drifted off again into a discussion of whether women should wear make-up. That is clearly not at all relevant to these bills and I invite you to bring him back to what is before the chamber. 
—Senator Hill, I am sure that Senator Hutchins, in the 30 seconds that are left to him, will come back and speak of something that is relevant to the bills currently before the Senate.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I have made my point about what the Liberals think of people in Western Sydney. Irrespective of the minister's rhetoric, you would be mad to put yourself in this position where you will come under political pressure. (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 2) 2000 [2001]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,20,1
"Lees, Sen Meg",AD,2001-08-22,"Due to Senator Ridgeway being on a pair, I seek leave to incorporate the speech that was begun by him.
Leave granted. 
The speech read as follows—
I rise to speak today about the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2000 and in particular, about the implications of this bill for the protection of Indigenous heritage.
This bill seeks to insert a new heritage protection regime into the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999, thereby providing for the protection of natural, cultural, historic as well as Indigenous heritage.
These amendments would make national heritage places another matter of `national environmental significance' under the Act.
The bills also establish two new lists:
1.	National Heritage List and
2.	Commonwealth Heritage List, which would replace the current Register of the National Estate, that contains a number of Indigenous places.
The protection of cultural heritage is one of the utmost importance to Indigenous peoples.
It is part of our identity that has been passed from generation to generation over many thousands of years. It is interwoven with our languages, stories, our art, customs and traditional practices.
For my generation, our culture is the legacy that we will give to our children and grandchildren. This is a weighty responsibility, and one that exists under Indigenous law and custom - regardless of whether it is acknowledged by the mainstream Australian legal system or not.
As Michael Dodson has put it:
Everything about Aboriginal society is inextricably interwoven and connected to the land. Culture is the land ... our reason for existence is the land. You take that away and you take away our reason for existence. We have grown the land up. We are dancing, singing, painting for the land. We are celebrating the land. Removed from the land we are literally removed from ourselves.
The recognition and protection of Indigenous heritage, including sites, places and landscapes, is therefore central to the reconciliation process.
As ATSIC noted in its recent submission to the Senate Committee,  “protection provides an important safeguard to the maintenance and regeneration of Indigenous culture and demonstrates an acceptance and respect for cultural differences which are the hallmarks of reconciliation.”
But at the current time, Indigenous heritage is poorly protected and Indigenous peoples have no direct control over their heritage.
Nor have they been involved in discussions over the new heritage protection regime to the extent that we believe they should have, especially given the recent discussion about the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Bill 1998, which seeks to reform the 1984 Act.
Of particular concern is the lack of consultation and discussion relating to the relationships between the ATSIHP Bill and this current suite of heritage bills.
The fact that the legislators of this country continue to make decisions about Indigenous heritage in this day and age without seeking the prior and informed consent of the people whose lives will be affected by those decisions is not acceptable - especially when the subject of these decisions is as fundamental as the protection and management of the oldest living cultures in the world.
The Australian Democrats are not alone in being gravely concerned with the disrespect that this type of behaviour shows to Aboriginal peoples and Torres Strait islanders.
The Environment Committee, in its report into the bill, raised the issue of how the proposed legislation would relate to existing laws, and in particular, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act 1984, and its proposed replacement, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Bill 1998.
The Committee stated that “there is no clear discussion in either the legislation itself or the accompanying materials about the intended relationship between the two regimes. This is unacceptable given the complexity and sensitivity of indigenous heritage protection, and the amount of negotiation, consultation, review and inquiry that has been invested into the ATSIHP legislation, including the:
·	Review of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act 1984 by the Hon Elizabeth Evatt AO (the Evatt Report)
·	Joint Parliamentary Committee on Native Title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund 11th and 12th Reports
·	Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee report into the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Bill 1998.
The Committee consequently recommended that the Government provide full details about the relationship between Indigenous heritage protection in the proposed EPBC regimes and the ATSIHP Act prior to the Senate's consideration of the bills and that Indigenous peoples be given the opportunity to comment on the Government's response.
The Committee also recommended that the Government provide a full response to the recommendations contained in the Evatt report.
So far. no response has been forthcoming. which is highly unsatisfactory given that this report was tabled in this place in 1996 are a most thorough and considered evaluation of these complex issues by The Hon Elizabeth Evatt.
I remind the Senate that the Evatt report was warmly received by many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and their representative organisations across the country because for the first time, a government review set out with the goal to:
“respect and support the living culture, traditions and beliefs of Aboriginal people and to recognise their role and interest in the protection and control of their cultural heritage.”
This is the approach that all members of this place should be taking in relation to the heritage amendments we put before this Chamber.
I would also like to remind the Chamber of one of the recommendations of the Evatt Report which is long overdue in this country, and that is a national policy for Indigenous heritage protection that would address all aspects of Indigenous cultural heritage. As the report recommended:
“Such a policy should form the basis of standards for cultural heritage protection, and for programs at all levels of government which affect Aboriginal heritage. An Aboriginal-controlled body such as an Aboriginal Cultural Heritage Advisory Council should have responsibility to oversee the implementation of this proposal, and should also have a role in monitoring Aboriginal heritage protection nationally and in co-ordinating laws and programs that have an impact on Aboriginal heritage.”
Perhaps if we had acted on the advice of the Hon Elizabeth Evatt, we would not find ourselves still grappling with the issues she clarified over 5 years ago.
I also bring to the Senate's attention the fact that ATSIC, as the peak national body for Indigenous peoples, has similar concerns to those of the Australian Democrats in relation to the lack of consultation with Indigenous peoples about the relationship between existing heritage regimes and the proposed amendments to the EPBC Act to include heritage.
The Chairman, Mr Geoff Clark, stated in his submission that “it is ironic and very disappointing that on the day before the Bills were introduced into Parliament, representatives of the Indigenous leadership, including myself as the Chairman of ATSIC were meeting with the Minister Hill on the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Bill 1998 and not one word was uttered by the Minister or his advisers about a new heritage regime being introduced into Parliament on the next day.”
The ATSIC submission states that:
“While the heritage amendments to the EPBC Act are before Parliament, it would be important to detail the impact of the whole indigenous heritage regime and consider those in context with the ATSIHP Bill negotiations, and on the ground protection of Indigenous sites and heritage in the interim.”
In response to the need to significantly strengthen the protection of Indigenous heritage, ATSIC (and the Australian Conservation Foundation) have proposed that Indigenous heritage become another matter of national environmental significance, under the Act. This would then regulate actions which have a significant impact on Indigenous heritage.
The Australian Democrats believe that this proposal is worthy of further consideration, and should be the subject of further consultation and negotiation with Indigenous Peoples in the context of changes to both this and the Indigenous Heritage Protection Act.
The second reading amendment which I am consequently moving today is that the Government engage in discussions with Indigenous Peoples about the relationship between the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act 1984, the 1998 Bill, the Native Title Act 1993 and the proposed insertion of a new heritage protection regime into the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999, and that these discussions include consideration of making Indigenous heritage another matter of national environmental significance under the EPBC Act.
Specifically, the Government needs to discuss with Indigenous peoples the details of any such a trigger and in particular:
a.	the type of trigger which could be used, including whether to use the current significant impact trigger under the EPBC Act;
b.	if this EPBC trigger were used, what would constitute a `significant impact' in relation to Indigenous heritage, and what would consequently be a `controlled action';
c.	the opportunities and constraints of using a trigger under the EPBC Act to protect both tangible and intangible heritage;
d.	the requirements upon a person who discovers a site or object with Indigenous heritage values;
e.	what consultation processes are needed in alerting Indigenous peoples about a proposed action;
f.	issues related to public notification of sites;
g.	the options available in dealing with an action which may have a significant impact on Indigenous heritage;
h.	how `Indigenous heritage' or `Indigenous heritage values' should be defined;
i.	what the criteria should be for assessing Indigenous heritage values; and
j.	the appropriateness and workability of using state and territory heritage regimes and planning laws to protect and manage Indigenous heritage and whether these regimes could be accredited by the Commonwealth under a bilateral agreement.
I commend this amendment to the Senate for its consideration.
—The second matter I want to deal with is Senator Ridgeway's second reading amendment. On behalf of Senator Ridgeway, I move:
At the end of the motion, add:
“but the Senate calls on the Government:
	(a)	to engage in discussions with Indigenous Peoples about the relationship between:
	(i)	the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act 1984; 
	(ii)	the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Bill 1998;
	(iii)	the Native Title Act 1993; and
	(iv)	the proposed insertion of a new heritage protection regime into the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act); and
	(b)	to include in these discussions, consideration of indigenous heritage as another matter of national environmental significance under the EPBC Act”.
I will speak briefly about the issue that Senator Ridgeway was dealing with specifically relating to this bill. I also wish to discuss another piece of legislation that seems to have vanished. Indeed, Senator Ridgeway stressed, as did Senator Woodley, how disappointing it is that, after lengthy negotiations, after all the discussions and, finally, after an agreement between indigenous people and the environment minister, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Bill 1998, which was an improvement and a replacement for the 1984 act, seems to have vanished. On behalf of Senator Ridgeway, I ask Senator Hill if there is any sign of that bill and, in particular—this will also be dealt with by my colleague Senator Allison—how that relates to and integrates with the legislation that we are currently dealing with. This bill establishes, as the chamber knows, two new lists—the National Heritage List and the Commonwealth Heritage List—which replace the current Register of the National Estate. The Register of the National Estate contains a number of indigenous sites. Therefore, questions arise as to what this legislation is seeking to do and what, at the stage of final negotiations, that other piece of legislation would have achieved, how it relates back and, indeed, which is the stronger of the two acts as far as their working for indigenous people. 
To make one final point as I look at Senator Ridgeway's amendment, the Democrats agree with the ATSIC proposal that all indigenous sites should have protection. Indeed, the ATSIC proposal is certainly worthy of further consideration. However, to formally amend during the committee stage of this bill, particularly given the previous negotiations and discussions, is something we are very wary of at this point in time. We believe that, given the work that has already been done, we need to revisit that to look at how the two acts will work together. In particular, if we are to move down the road in this bill, we need to go back to the national indigenous working groups, the land councils, and basically, in the context of both pieces of legislation, look at protection for indigenous Australians. So, in closing, I want to speak on behalf of this motion that Senator Ridgeway has put together. It asks the Senate to call on the government to engage in discussions with indigenous peoples about the relationships between the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act 1984, the protection bill of 1998 so far as the negotiations have gone and the Native Title Act 1993, and to propose the insertion of a new heritage treatment regime into the EPBC Act.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 2) 2000 [2001]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,20,1
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2001-08-22,"—In closing this second reading debate, I thank all senators who have participated. I have not personally heard all contributions but—
—No, I did not. I listened to Senator Cooney yesterday. I thought his was a most constructive historical recollection and very useful as background information to this debate. I heard Senator Ridgeway's brief contribution yesterday. I listened carefully to Senator Hutchins' contribution this afternoon. So I think I have at least been able to get the flavour of the debate. 
There is clearly, on the part of the Labor Party, the opposition—to give them the benefit of any doubt—a misunderstanding as to what is being sought through this process. One might say that there is a deliberate avoidance of the fact, but I will not argue that. I am simply prepared to accept that it is a misunderstanding. 
The problem with the existing Register of the National Estate is that there is no real protection power that comes with it. It has been a very important contribution to the development of heritage conservation in Australia and, at the time of the commencement of that legislation and the establishment of the Register of the National Estate, it really was leadership in this field. It required the development of lists of places that should become part of this Register of the National Estate, and those places could cover the field of natural heritage, built heritage and cultural heritage including indigenous heritage. That has been valuable in developing a list of some 13,000 items that most Australians would accept are of heritage importance. However, the degree of importance has been a subject that has come in for much more critical debate in recent years. There is certainly a point of view that basically applications for listing and pressure for listing have come about because of political issues of the day rather than any overall analysis as to what are the really important heritage items in this country that should therefore be on a national list.
Secondly, apart from that debate as to whether the list reflects items that most Australians would think are of national importance today, the protection of those items is not really significantly enhanced by the existing legislative scheme at all. Basically, the existing scheme only places an obligation on the Commonwealth government, and only when a proposed action of the Commonwealth government will have a detrimental effect upon those assets is the act triggered. Even if it is triggered, all that is required under section 30 of the legislation is a consideration as to whether all feasible alternatives have been taken into account. So most threats to items on the Register of the National Estate are not from the Commonwealth at all. It is a very rare occurrence where the Commonwealth intends to take some action that could detrimentally affect a listed item. As I have said, even on those rare occasions there is no protection per se given to that item: it is simply that the Commonwealth has clearly got to understand the consequences of what it is doing and that it has taken that into account.
What happened, of course, is that this early start in Australia on heritage conservation through the existing Australian Heritage Commission Act was quickly overtaken by better protection in each of the states. It was the states that set up independent heritage authorities that basically had a power and responsibility of protection. You, I think, Mr Acting Deputy President, would argue that this is in fact a primary responsibility of the states rather than the Commonwealth in any event.
 (Senator Lightfoot)—That is probably right, Senator, yes.
—That is clearly a Western Australian perception of our federal structure, but I can quite understand it—that the primary responsibility for conservation of heritage lies with the states. When there were no state legislative regimes it was understandable for the Commonwealth to show leadership and to establish the Register of the National Estate. We now have this huge national register with no real powers attached to it. In addition, we have state heritage protection schemes that provide much greater real protection to items that have been listed. Not surprisingly, we find many items are now listed on the Register of the National Estate and listed on state heritage lists as well. Not surprisingly, because of the size of the national list and because of the processes of registration, a huge backlog has developed. 
All of this caused the commission, some years ago—I acknowledge it commenced this process before we came to government in 1996—to question whether it was time to move on to a more contemporary scheme of conservation and protection. The commission itself commenced this debate, through preparing discussion papers. It led the debate from 1996 onwards around the country. People regard the issue of heritage dearly and so there are passionate views on this subject. The debate that took place within heritage communities around the country certainly was passionate. For some, it is true there is a deep sentimental attraction to the notion of the Register of the National Estate, even though those who are involved in this debate and are well-informed accept that it offers very little, if any, protection at all. The commission recognised that at this stage of Australia's cultural development there needed to be a better national scheme, one that could more effectively provide protection where it is appropriate to provide protection and one that would also give the primary responsibility to that level of government that should accept that responsibility—not only for protection but for the costs that are inevitably associated with it. 
I have mentioned protection at a Commonwealth level and protection at a state level but of course many local governments around Australia have also taken on this responsibility and developed lists within their jurisdictions. They have also, to some extent, developed ways of protecting the assets on their localised lists. The fourth stream is the non-government lists, the National Trust lists and the like. It is therefore not surprising that those who regard this issue as a serious one have been wrestling for some years with the way in which all of these lists and all of these various regimes of differing levels of protection might be rationalised into something that is a more effective national scheme. 
We picked up this challenge when we came to government. We took the advice of the Australian Heritage Commission and took it to governments other than our own. In 1997, the governments of Australia—the Commonwealth and the state governments—agreed that there should be a new scheme. That agreement is the basis of what is before the chamber today. It is interesting that Senator Hutchins sees a great threat from Liberals in this scheme, when the New South Wales Labor government endorsed it back in 1997. They did so because they also recognised that it was time to move on and it was time to develop a new scheme. 
The fundamentals of this scheme are that there would be a national list, probably a relatively limited national list, of items which most Australians would regard as so fundamentally important to our cultural heritage—whether they be built items or otherwise— that they should be recorded in that national sense and that, within its capacity, the Commonwealth should accept an ultimate responsibility for their protection. I will try to explain that to you a little further, Mr Acting Deputy President. I can imagine you would be the sort of honourable senator that might be a little nervous about that concept, so I will not use an example in Western Australia. But let us take, for example, the Victorian parliament, the first parliament of the Federation of Australia. It is clearly an asset of great historical and cultural importance to all Australians. I, as a South Australian, have as much interest in seeing that properly conserved as any Victorian. I would not be surprised therefore if independent experts say that that is the sort of place that should be regarded as being of genuinely national heritage significance, for which the Commonwealth, representing all Australians, would have ultimate responsibility for protecting. 
On that idea, the Commonwealth government and the state governments agreed. They also agreed that there are many items that could be best described as being of state heritage significance and that they should be protected by effective state heritage regimes. You would then have a better scheme in that you would have a national list and Commonwealth protection for items of genuinely national heritage significance, whilst the mass of items that are of state significance would be protected under the existing state regimes. Those regimes could be accredited by the Commonwealth, provided that they meet a set of best contemporary practices. The state and Commonwealth governments also believed that it was legitimate for local governments, and it was the responsibility of local governments, to protect items that could be described as being of local heritage importance.
That is the framework of what is before the chamber today. It is designed to achieve a better protection, a more effective protection, of our heritage in a national sense and certainly a level of protection that is far superior to that which exists today. In addition to that, in this legislation we recognise that the Commonwealth is the owner of many properties. They may not reach a level of national significance, but the Commonwealth nevertheless has to accept responsibility for the heritage values of its properties. 
—Senator Bolkus! Sorry to interrupt you, Minister. Senator Bolkus, you are interrupting proceedings with your conversation; the speaker on his feet has the call and I find it difficult to concentrate on what he has to say. If you want to talk to Senator Forshaw, I invite you to meet outside somewhere.
—For that purpose, the Commonwealth should list such items. In practice, of course, what would happen is that you would avoid this duplication and that items that are not of national importance but are of state importance and are on the state lists would stay there. That is obviously a sensible reform in itself. The Commonwealth and the states having agreed to that framework, we then went through the process of drafting this legislation. The parliamentary committee considered the legislation, and there has been a long and important community—
—Senator Hill, could I interrupt you again. I understand that there may have been an arrangement to stop the debate at 6.40 p.m.
—Why don't I stop in about two minutes?
—Twenty seconds.
—You've stopped now.
—At this stage it would be sensible, it seems to me, to complete the second reading debate. I have set out the framework for it and I have given the rationale. I have said that there has been a long and important public debate that has led to this parliamentary debate. 
The last issue I want to touch upon is that raised by the Australian Democrats—that is, the indigenous heritage issue. I was invited to comment on the sites bill. It is still the government's desire to have that piece of legislation passed this session. I believe that we are close to achieving that goal and we will continue to work to achieve that outcome. In relation to indigenous heritage, yes, it is included within this legislation. So, if the indigenous heritage achieved the national significance standard, it would be treated as such.
In relation to the broader area of indigenous heritage, we accept—as the governments accepted in 1997—that there is still more work that needs to be done to develop an effective way to properly respect and conserve the broader range of indigenous heritage values across Australia. That debate must continue, and the rationalisation that has been argued for by Senator Ridgeway of the various pieces of legislation should ultimately occur as well. In our view, that should be the next phase of heritage protection within Australia and the next major project for this parliament. On that basis, I would accept the amendment to the second reading suggested by Senator Ridgeway, because I think it is pointing to an important direction for the future that this government would accept. I commend the bill to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 2) 2000 [2001]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,20,1
"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,2001-08-22,"— by leave—The opposition also support the amendment in order to give consideration to the issues raised by the Democrats. In respect of the second part of the amendment, though, we anticipate that there may be some pitfalls in doing what the Australian Democrats would like us to do. We give it passage in respect of the second part in order to air some of the pluses and minuses of it, but we also share the concern expressed by Senator Ridgeway about ATSI heritage legislation.
Amendment agreed to.
—I understand that the Labor Party want to divide on the second reading. It was put to me that that will obviously take some time, and I am wondering whether it would assist the chamber if some process were agreed to that would allow the division to take place tomorrow rather than today. If a motion could be moved to postpone the division on the second reading until the next day of sitting, I think that would serve my purpose.
—In relation to the proceedings this evening, there was an understanding that at 6.40 p.m. we would proceed to certain other business—a message and a response to a return to order—which would have enabled at least some time to be spent dealing with the return to order subject. That time is no longer available, so I do not see any reason why we should curtail the second reading division. We might as well have it now as tomorrow.
—I put the question that the motion that these bills be now read a second time, as amended, be agreed to. ",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 2) 2000 [2001]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,20,1
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2001-08-22,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
This is a report from the 1999 national report on schooling in Australia. It would appear that this government is not yet able to bring forward documents any more quickly than we have seen in the past. It is two years out of date. This was the first year where we saw the recommitment of the national goals for schooling. The national goals for schooling are outlined in this report. The Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Dr Kemp, is the first education minister since this report was brought down to completely undermine those national goals for schooling. Last December, we saw a schools bill brought into this parliament which saw $22 billion expended on schools in such a manner that it seriously challenged those national objectives and goals as outlined in this report. It was a schools bill that undermined the basic premise that we have had for many years in this country of a fair and reasonable distribution of funding between government sectors and non-government sectors. In that bill, we saw a disproportionate, inequitable, divisive and totally unfair allocation of funding brought forward by this government which demonstrated an ideological obsession and a prejudiced view against public education in this country. That is quite inconsistent with the national goals for schooling as outlined in this report.
In that bill, we saw a continuation of a policy whereby from 2000 through to 2004—that is the quadrennium under discussion in that bill—the amount of money going to government education from the Commonwealth is reduced as a total of outlays from 37.1 per cent to 34 per cent. That is a marked and substantial shift in the allocation of moneys going to public education in this country. We saw a new model of funding put in place—the so-called SES model—which was totally unfair and was totally prejudiced towards the schools that are already wealthy or powerful and, of course, are able to look after themselves much more effectively than the poorer non-government schools.
A couple of weeks ago, I visited two small Jewish schools in Victoria: Yeshivah and Beth Rivkah College in Caulfield and Addass Israel. Those schools highlight just how grossly improper this bill was last year and how inadequate a funding model it was. These two schools are in a wealthy area, but they are so poor that they have to actually run a roster system for use of the playgrounds. Not enough money is put into those schools to allow all the kids to go into the playground at once. It is a small community of people which is required, for religious and community reasons, to live around a synagogue and the school. They often live in extremely poor circumstances. That community is not characterised by wealth, as this model would suggest living in Caulfield would be. More often than not this community is characterised by poverty. We have a government that sees this as a model that discriminates against those people.
On the other hand, the government schools in the area in which I live in the north of Melbourne are being discriminated against by this government to the point where Commonwealth expenditure has been reduced from 37 per cent of total outlays in 2000 to 34 per cent in 2004. That is a remarkable jump in such a short time. The national school goals outlined in the report have been undermined by this government—a government that is intent on undermining the Karmel settlement, the consensus that held sway in this country for 25 years around the issue of non-government schools. We have a government that is intent upon a policy which is unfair, divisive and totally unjust. We have a government determined to discriminate against public education and the majority of Australians in favour of the wealthy and the privileged few.

"Tierney, Sen John",LP,2001-08-22,"—I rise to speak on the same matter. I am delighted to follow Senator Carr to put the record straight on this nonsense that he has been peddling. The very simple fact that Senator Carr seems to want to totally ignore is that public schools are 88 per cent funded by state governments. What has declined in recent years is the commitment of the states to their public schools. The worst example of that is the Carr Labor government, which came into office in 1995, in my own state of New South Wales. We left office in New South Wales spending 25½ per cent of the state budget on education. What have the Carr government in New South Wales spent on education as a percentage of the budget? They have spent 22 per cent—that is, 25½ per cent down to 22 per cent. That is the problem, Senator Carr. The state governments are cost shifting and moving money out of the public schools to the point—if you have a look at the budget comparisons—where they are putting up the budget, in New South Wales, by between one per cent and two per cent. At the same time, the federal money— and remember that that is only 12 per cent of the money that goes to state schools—is going up at over five per cent a year, which is more than double what is happening in the states. We are actually making up for some of this shortfall created by the states, but because they are 88 per cent of school budgets it is of course a big ask. The reality is—and Senator Carr totally ignored this—that government schools in this country are overwhelmingly the responsibility of state governments and, if there is a problem in the public schools, it is overwhelmingly the result of the policies of state governments such as the Carr government in New South Wales. Fortunately, we have come in with top-up money in a number of areas such as literacy and numeracy, which has dramatically halved the rates of illiteracy in our primary schools in New South Wales. And that is what I wanted to focus on today.
Before I finish, and before Senator Carr walks out of the chamber, I want to make the point that Senator Carr started his comments by saying that this report was late. Senator Carr, the reason the report is late is that your Labor mates in New South Wales and in Victoria have been slow in putting the figures in. How can you actually have a national report without New South Wales and Victorian figures? These two states make up two-thirds of the schools in Australia. Why are they late? Because those state Labor governments are dragging the chain. I was very surprised that Senator Carr did not start bagging the state Labor governments. He does not seem to like doing that, but they are the guilty parties in this regard.
I want to focus on the way in which the federal government, in its specific areas of responsibility in the states schooling system, has dramatically improved the literacy and numeracy rates in this country in the time it has been in government. I want to quote the figures for year 3 and year 5. These are the figures relating to 1996 to 1999. In that time the illiteracy rate for year 3 students has dropped from 27 per cent to 13 per cent, and that is a halving for that year. For year 5 students, it has fallen from 29 per cent to 14 per cent—again, a halving of the illiteracy rate in this country. But we have a series of state Labor governments across this country now, unfortunately, that are really dragging the chain on agreements to improve these standards even further. The state Labor governments do not want to report this; they do not want to report it to parents. The behaviour of the Labor states on this matter has been an absolute disgrace. We made great progress in the last three years. That is now all in danger because the state Labor governments do not want to report their figures. I call on them to really focus on this incredibly important matter and to make sure that we do have proper reporting requirements. We know where we are up to, we know what needs to be done, and in the future we can drop these illiteracy rates even further. The whole key to the future of children in this country is that they are literate and that they are numerate. They cannot survive in our economy and in our society without that. We have made dramatic improvements. I call on the Labor Party, federally and state, to join with us in that very important matter. (Time expired)

"Macdonald, Sen Sandy",NP,2001-08-22,"—In light of this week's debate about health services, I want to outline the coalition's achievements and our determined commitment to deliver further improvements. In the past three budgets there have been more than 120 targeted health initiatives introduced by the Howard-Anderson government. This year's budget continues the government's commitment to better health outcomes for rural, regional and remote Australians by addressing shortfalls in the rural health work force, particularly in the field of nursing, and strengthens existing measures to provide sustainable rural health services.
These initiatives complement the really inspirational $562 million regional health strategy called More Doctors, Better Services that has been in place since the 2000-01 budget, and it followed the Michael Wooldridge-John Anderson medical outreach tour. This year's budget delivers record funding for Medicare and confirms the coalition's commitment to strengthen and improve our public hospital system. It includes $300 million for increased Medicare rebates for GP visits, particularly benefiting patients with complex health conditions who need longer consultations with their doctor; $104 million over four years for GPs to employ more practice nurses so that they can focus on diagnosis and clinical care; $13 million over four years to provide 110 nursing scholarships worth $10,000 per year targeting students from rural and regional backgrounds to access undergraduate nursing degrees; $120 million for GPs to provide better outcomes in mental health care; nearly $50 million to allow GPs to better treat Australians with diabetes, which is an increasing problem for all of us; funding for GPs to better manage patients with asthma; $72 million to increase the number of women who can be screened for cervical cancer, especially women living in regional and remote areas and targeting migrant women and Aboriginal women; and over $43 million to increase the availability of after-hours and emergency care for 32 new after-hours medical care sites that are being established across the country.
The coalition government has particularly focused on enhancing rural health education and training. This will see the development of nine rural clinical schools and three university departments of rural health in regional areas. I am pleased to be able to say that this includes a department of rural health to be established in Tamworth, where my electorate office is. This will be established in cooperation with the University of Newcastle, which is working in partnership with the University of New England in Armidale. Congratulations to both those universities and to the medical schools within those universities. This initiative will provide specific rural health training and encourage medical and other health professionals to take up rural practice.
Another initiative is the Rural Australia Medical Undergraduate Scholarship Scheme, which aims to increase the number of students with a rural background studying medicine by providing financial support during university. In the year 2000, this provided approximately 430 scholarships, and around 80 further scholarships have been awarded this year.
Further, a total of $33.4 million has been allocated to fund the Commonwealth Medical Rural Bonded Scholarship Scheme over the next four years. Under this scheme, 100 new medical school places tied to the scholarships will be offered every year, with students receiving $20,000 annually while studying, in return for a commitment to work in rural areas for at least six years once they complete their fellowship as a general practitioner or as a specialist. One hundred medical students have already signed up for these scholarships.
The multipurpose services initiative is a joint Commonwealth, state and territory government program responding to the needs of rural families through the delivery of improved health and aged care services. This is achieved through the pooling of funds from various sources to sustain diverse medical services in the one location. To date, 54 of these multipurpose service sites have been approved and operate nationally. These multipurpose service sites also support 1,124 flexible aged care places. The more allied health services initiative provides $49.5 million over four years to boost the range of health professionals, including mental health workers, podiatrists, physiotherapists and dieticians in rural areas. Early estimates indicate there will eventually be more than 130 full-time equivalent health positions funded nationally from this program. The medical specialist outreach assistance program will ensure that visiting specialists, local GPs and health services can work together to improve local health practitioners' skills as well as health care for rural Australians. The enhanced pharmacy package provides funding over four years for a range of allowances to sustain or increase the number of pharmacies in more remote areas and provide work force support.
Other rural health initiatives undertaken in the past three years are continuing. I will mention some key programs. The Rural Retention Program has provided payments to more than 2,000 doctors who have practised in rural areas for a specified period since the introduction of this world-first initiative in 1999. This amount includes a second payment to over 1,600 of those doctors. The John Flynn scholarship scheme continues and provides financial support to enable medical students to form long-term relationships with rural communities and gain a better understanding of rural medical practice. Each year some 600 medical students receive assistance under this scheme, with 150 new scholarships available this year. In the 1999-2000 budget, the rural women's general practitioner service was funded to provide regular female GP visits to more than 60 communities—another world first. The government has funded the Royal Flying Doctor Service for more than 40 years, particularly to help rural and remote communities access a broad range of clinical services and the best aero-medical emergency retrieval system in the world.
The coalition is also working to make the health system better and more user friendly. For example, when Labor was in government, Australians could claim a Medicare rebate only from a Medicare office or by post. Over the last four years the coalition has implemented a number of initiatives to improve access to Medicare, including more than 800 national claiming facilities in addition to telephone claiming facilities. Over the next year advances in technology should in fact allow patients to claim their Medicare rebate on the spot from the doctor's surgery.
In contrast to Labor, the coalition believes in a strong private health sector to complement the public system. The private health sector allows Australians the freedom to choose their own doctor and hospital and helps alleviate pressures on the public system. The coalition will continue to improve Australia's health system by reforming Commonwealth-state relations and by emphasising quality care and preventive treatment. If Labor were serious about providing better health services to Australians, even in opposition they have the chance to do something constructive—for instance, by urging the New South Wales state Labor government, which gets around $8.3 billion this year from the GST arrangements, to spend more of that money on the public health services that are desperately needed in New South Wales. The coalition will continue to provide Australians with a choice of private care combined with a quality public hospital system. This means that Australians, particularly those who live in regional Australia, will have affordable, high quality and world-class health care.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,"<title>Health Services: Rural, Regional and Remote Australia</title>",Adjournment,22,1
