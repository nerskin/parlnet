"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2000-10-10,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts (Senator Alston), the Special Minister of State (Senator Ellison) and the Minister for Justice and Customs (Senator Vanstone), to questions without notice asked by Senators Conroy, Faulkner and Ray today, relating to the use of a telecard issued to the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith).
We have heard now very many times Senator Vanstone assert that comment should not be made in this chamber about operational matters of the AFP or matters pending determination by the DPP. There is always a sanctimonious comment to that effect. The same claim was made by Mr Howard at his press conference earlier today on the issue of Mr Reith's credit card. But when the Prime Minister was then asked whether the misuse of Mr Reith's telecard was a fraud on the Commonwealth, the Prime Minister answered directly—and I quote—`I don't believe it is.' Let us be very clear: the Prime Minister is putting on the public record his view about whether a crime has been committed while the police and DPP processes are still under way. The Prime Minister has prejudged the criminality of this matter pure and simple and, in doing so, he has also removed any defence the government had on relying on the standard of no comment on police operational matters. 
In complete contradiction to what the Prime Minister has said, Senator Alston, in question time, said, `Don't you believe in due process? You're not prepared to wait.' The Prime Minister was not prepared to wait today. But of course you have to acknowledge that the Prime Minister is only following Mr Reith's efforts on the AM radio program and on the front page of the Canberra Times newspaper today. Mr Reith has claimed that he personally stopped using his telecard in 1994. He states that he believes his card had been handed back to his department. He admits family use of his telecard. In an interview on the AM radio program this morning, he detailed the handing out of his telecard and PIN number to other people.
He admits to this negligence. So much for not commenting on operational matters! It may be that Mr Reith has not yet fully briefed the Prime Minister on this matter. Certainly Mr Howard got the facts wrong in his press conference today. The Prime Minister does not yet understand that this is not a one-off occurrence in 1994—`before Mr Reith was a minister in my government', as the Prime Minister said—but was an ongoing misuse of Mr Reith's official telecard for five years, beginning in 1994.
There is no doubt that this matter has been covered up. I raised this matter at Senate estimates in May this year. The department was asked directly about individual telecard use by members and senators. We now know that the department was well aware at that time of Mr Reith's delinquency. Of course that meant it gave us very evasive and guarded answers at the estimates hearing. But having promised to provide the information on telecard use by members and senators, it provided the answer nearly 10 weeks after the committee deadline, with the department claiming that the information was being extracted and it would have to be provided to each member and senator for their verification before tabling. That was deliberate prevarication by the department and the minister.
Now the government is attempting to hide behind AFP operational matters to protect Minister Reith. Well, the bottom line is: Mr Reith, through his stupidity, through his naivety, and through his carelessness, has blown $50,000 of taxpayers' money. We call on Mr Reith to pay back the full amount. Pay back the $50,000. We also call on the Prime Minister to stand this negligent minister down for the course of the police and DPP investigation of these very serious allegations of fraud against the Commonwealth. The only winner in this whole affair, of course, is the member for Higgins, Mr Costello. Not even the $35,000 of media training will be able to remove the smirk from Mr Costello's face.

"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2000-10-10,"—You always know when Labor has a weak case. Firstly, Senator Faulkner shouts—five minutes of shouting—so you know that he does not have an argument of merit. Secondly, you know there is a weak case against a minister in the House of Representatives when questions are not asked in the House of Representatives—
—Yes they were.
—they are only asked in the Senate—
—That is not right.
—so that you cannot get—
—You are wrong again.
—Well, how many questions were asked in the House of Representatives? How many questions were asked?
—You are wrong; just apologise.
—Okay, I will rephrase it. When the attack is predominantly in the upper house and not in the chamber fronting the minister or fronting the Prime Minister, then you know Labor has a weak case.
—Because you make a choice. Labor made a choice: its first political issue of the day was apparently education, so in the House of Representatives, in front of the large press corps, it took up the issue of education. For its secondary issue, it decided to have a go at Mr Reith in the Senate chamber, in which he is not present, in which he will not be responding directly and where the Prime Minister is not present and will not be called to account for his actions. That is a demonstration, I would have thought, obvious to any reasonable, objective observer, that Labor does not take this matter seriously. 
By contrast, Mr Reith has taken the matter seriously. When it came to his notice he brought the matter to the attention of the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister sought the advice of the Attorney-General and it was referred to the police for investigation, because it does seem there has been some misuse of this credit card by some third party and it needs to be investigated. Nobody is disputing that. But what did Labor do in here today? Instead of saying, `There seems to have been misuse of this card that needs to be investigated, and we are pleased it has been forwarded to the police for that purpose,' what did it do? It traduced the language of corruption, and then had the nerve to say to the Senate: `Oh, we are not alleging corruption or some misconduct on the part of the minister. We just happened to use that coloured expression to suit our purposes.' Well, we know what that is meant to imply to anyone who happens to be listening to this chamber today. It is not surprising that Senator Cook sits there smiling—because he has seen that tactic used over and over again over the years. Does Labor worry about proving guilt? Never. It is always assumed by Labor. It assumes guilt. Senator Faulkner shouts it to the world, then he reshouts it to the world, and then Labor believes it is going to get the headline that it has been proven. That is the Labor way of doing it. I accept that it quite often works, actually: if you assert it confidently enough, shout it as Senator Faulkner does, then it quite often gets written in that way.
—You are shouting now.
—I never shout, Senator. This matter came to notice after a long period of time because, as Labor will concede, we are not provided with detailed telephone accounts. We are not provided with them, apparently in our own interests, so that there cannot be any prying into matters of privacy—a decision that was taken by Labor in government, which I do not quarrel with. It means that senators and members are not necessarily aware of the detail of their telephone usage. It does mean this. But when this matter was brought to Mr Reith's attention, proper action was taken. When he found that there had been some usage by a child of his, that money was repaid. In relation to misuse by a third party, it is being investigated by the police. Who could have asked for more than that? Only Labor, which, of course, is dissatisfied with that because it is not interested, as it is never interested, in establishing the truth. It is only interested in asserting guilt, and it does that for short-term, base, political motives. I guess that is all part of the game.

"Ray, Sen Robert",ALP,2000-10-10,"—If we were guilty, as Senator Hill charges, of base political motives in this, we could have raised the specifics of it at the estimates last May. But we did not. We asked general questions about the use of the telecard. We did not ask the specific about Mr Reith. So, Senator Hill, to say we are acting in the short term is not true. Secondly, Senator Hill does not address the question of how bad it is to comment on operational matters. When he says Mr Reith acted properly, Mr Reith made this matter public when the Canberra Times questioned him yesterday. Go back through the history of Mr Reith's dealing with this issue. He was told about this issue back in August 1999. When did he tell the Prime Minister? In May 2000. And when was it referred to the Federal Police? Not back in August 1999. After the Prime Minister was informed, on the advice of the Attorney-General, the matter then goes to the Federal Police.
We have this contradiction. This morning, trying to save his own skin, Mr Reith said he referred the matter to the Federal Police. I believed him until I watched the television at lunchtime—a direct broadcast of the Prime Minister's press conference—where the Prime Minister said he, the Prime Minister, referred the matter to the police. Who is to be believed—Mr Reith or the Prime Minister? 
On the question of belief, we are asked to accept by Mr Reith whether in fact he could remember what happened to his card. He sort of vagued it up. He said, `I thought I might have handed it back in.' If he is serious about the issue, why didn't he do a search of his office, of his briefcase, of his wallet, to see if the card still existed? Why didn't he ring the department and say, `Oh, look, chaps, I've been asked a question on this and I've forgotten whether I handed my card back in.' But no, to vague things up, to fuzz the whole issue, he says, `I may have handed it back in.' The fact that it is reissued every three years and everyone gets a new card with an expiry date has been overlooked by Mr Reith. Of course, what Mr Reith has not done directly, and he should at least do it now, is say that he, Mr Reith, admits to directly breaching the Remuneration Tribunal provisions as reinforced in the DOFA guidelines. Those guidelines are explicit: the telecommunications card is issued to the member and senator solely for their personal use on parliamentary and official business.
You have to ask how this issue arose when you have a PIN, a 12-digit number. Who got hold of it? Mr Reith at least answers that. He said he gave it out. He is totally in breach of the Remuneration Tribunal provisions. And what is he doing with his time? Doesn't he actually read the cost of his total phone bill? He has had 65 monthly reports, he has had five annual reports and he is so dopey he cannot analyse this massively high figure that he has been charged over this particular period.
It is a double standard here. Three years ago, Mr Reith, when I was accused of some misconduct to do with ministerial resources—and after an inquiry it was found there was no evidence at all—rushed into print that same day. He put out a press release and said I was not being vigilant enough in supervising my resources. The difference is that I was vigilant; there was no evidence. But Mr Reith was not being vigilant. Some $50,000 shot out the door. We have to ask why he does not pay back the full amount of money. He is too busy undermining workers' entitlements, negotiating 10 per cent discounts with Hudson Conway on his Melbourne penthouse or working some twisted ideological framework for sabotaging the referendum on the republic. That is what he has been busy about, while back home, back in his electorate, now a marginal electorate, now capable of getting marginal seat funding, he has let $50,000 shoot down the drain. In fact, he should pay the whole amount back, and he should pay it back today.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,"<title>Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business: Telecard</title>",Questions Without Notice,1,1
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2000-10-10,"—The Labor Party, devoid of policy and vision, come into this place, crawling the gutter, trying to raise issues so that the Australian people do not realise they have rolled over on GST and they have changed their mind on the sale of Telstra. They want to cover up the fact that we have reduced unemployment, and they want to cover up the fact that we have got rid of the budget deficit. They want to cover up the fact that we have in fact got on with the business of the government of this nation and introduced wonderful schemes like Work for the Dole, which they condemned at first and they now seem to embrace.
I trust that there are some Tasmanians listening to this broadcast, because I am sure that, especially in Tasmania, they will recall when a former Labor Minister for Justice, Senator Tate, in this chamber, during a criminal trial, made comment about the matter, as a result of which the trial had to be aborted. The Labor Party come in here as though they have no record in relation to mucking up criminal inquiries and criminal trials by their tawdry political exercises, attempting to malign people when there is a proper course to go through. 
We have a former minister giving a most demeaning performance here. He used to be held in high regard, but now all we ever hear from Senator Ray is questions dealing with sleazy innuendo, purely personal attacks. And why? Because, if ever he gets up on a policy issue or waste of government money, everybody reminds Senator Ray of the $500 million-plus blow-out on the Collins class submarine which he had to supervise. He has the audacity to come in here and say Mr Reith ought to pay back $50,000, when we have no idea who was responsible. We know who was responsible for the $500 million on the Collins class submarine, and it was Senator Ray. When you pay back your $500 million, Senator Ray, we might ask questions of Mr Reith about paying back $50,000. We know you will not come in here with $500 million, because you deny any responsibility for that. We know that you were drawing a ministerial salary and driving around in the ministerial car at the time, but you come in here as though you have no responsibility. 
Volume in relation to the opposition is often used as a substitute for substance. The fact is that the people of Australia expect from us as parliamentarians a vision for the country, a vision for the future; they do not expect these sorts of tawdry exercises where the evidence is not to hand and people do not know exactly what has occurred. They do not want people like Senator Ray and Senator Faulkner trying to make accusations when there is no basis for them. The Labor Party seem to think that if they continually repeat an assertion it somehow becomes fact. We know how the Labor Party act in this chamber: we saw it with their shameful attack on the Bailleau family, when it was shown to be completely without foundation. Did they ever apologise? No. What did they do? They moved on to the next tawdry little exercise. They just move on because there is no sense of shame, there is no sense of decorum and there is no sense that there might be life in politics above the S-bend. These people on the other side enjoy nothing more than wallowing around in the septic tank of innuendo. But I would invite them to get a life, to come up above the S-bend and to consider what they might be able to contribute to the Australian people and to Australian political debate by actually coming up with some policy ideas and a vision for this nation rather than a vision of attack against their colleagues on the other side. They think that by cutting off members of the Liberal Party at the knees they somehow increase their own stature. That is not the case.

"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2000-10-10,"—It is a well-known concept to make the poacher the gamekeeper. Here we have the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business stomping around the country, belittling unions and demanding that corporate Australia crack down on rorts, otherwise known as award conditions. At the time of the waterfront dispute he said:
... the reality is that the rorts and inefficiencies on the Australian waterfront have been going on for far too long. I think most Australians reckon that enough is enough. Certainly the strong reaction I've had is that it's about time, it's about time that someone finally took up these issues ...
We all know what Mr Reith did. He did not hesitate to call in the balaclavaed thugs and chained dogs. So incensed was he by their perceived rorts, he announced that he was launching a book called `The fat little book of MUA rorts' and that it would be posted on his department's web site. Yet for five years he has been in breach of his own award entitlements and it has been kept hush-hush. Only now has Mr Reith been forced to fess up—and there are still a lot of other questions which need to be answered.
Every senator and member is issued with a telephone services charge card at Commonwealth expense. The card may be used by only the senator or member personally to make telephone calls on parliamentary or electorate business. Yet today it has been revealed by Mr Reith that he has run up a telecard bill of more than $50,000 for which he cannot account. Some of that bill, we know, was due to the use of the card by a member of his family. Who gave away the PIN number? Senator Hill has mounted his defence, but at no stage has Senator Hill addressed the question of who handed the family member the PIN number. Would you, Senator Hill, hand your PIN number over to a member of your family? No, I bet you would not. I bet you have read the guidelines.
—Address the chair, please, Senator Conroy. 
—Can we believe that Mr Reith is so gullible as to not check expenditure of his own entitlements? Can we believe that Mr Reith, who is so quick and eager to check on the rorts of workers, did not ensure his own affairs were in order? Such haphazard management definitely goes against the prime ministerial code of conduct, which clearly states:
Although their public lives encroach upon their private lives, it is important that ministers and parliamentary secretaries avoid giving any appearance of using public office for private purposes.
Why did he give a member of his family the PIN number? The code says elsewhere:
Ministers are provided with facilities at public expense in order that public business may be conducted effectively. Their use of these facilities should be in accordance with this principle. It should not be wasteful or extravagant. 
Who gave a member of the family the PIN number? Can we believe that Mr Reith has never read this code and is not aware of his obligations to the taxpayers? Again, can we believe that Mr Reith is so gullible as to not check expenditure and his own entitlements? 
He took a very strong interest in exposing what he alleged were rorts by the MUA. He was especially intrigued by the surface of a billiard table. He accused Labor of supporting these rorts. He said of Labor:
The rorters' supporters over here support that; they support that. This is the latest in a long list of rorts—the Eddie Charlton rort—and you guys support it.
Who is supporting the rort today? Who is supporting the minister who gave, on his own admission, his PIN number and card to a member of his family? Who is supporting the rorts now? I wonder what Mr Reith is saying now. Labor pursued this issue at Senate estimates and waited 10 weeks for an answer to a question relating to telecard expenses of members and senators. When in doubt, Mr Reith brings in balaclavaed thugs and chained dogs to hound down the alleged rorters. He does not hesitate to go to extravagant lengths—lengths that may extend as far as Dubai—to bring perceived rorters to task.
When there is doubt about him, he pays back $950, crosses his fingers and hopes that no-one will notice the other $49,050 and that no-one will demand that the $49,050 be paid. It has been noticed, Mr Reith, and your actions stand in stark contrast to your strong action when you were chasing workers that you perceived rorted their entitlements. Your action may well end up costing the taxpayer $49,050—money which could easily be put to a better use for the benefit of Australian taxpayers. Mr Reith's explanations so far have been inadequate. Mr Reith is reported as believing that his telecard had been handed back to the department. (Time expired)

"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2000-10-10,"—Before this bill is completed, I would like to speak to what happened here last night: that was, the Labor Party and the Democrats basically guillotining this bill and to a large degree making the bill meaningless.
—Guillotining!
—You killed the bill. As a result, the migration of elderly people related to Australian residents will largely be unregulated. On page 3 of the bill under clause 1 we still have a reference to the bill affecting a resident of Australia and in clause 2, at line 32, at (B), we also have a reference that will change the definition of an Australian resident to include anyone who has an authority to work in Australia.
Given, as I said yesterday, that a large percentage of the people who come in under this migration legislation amendment will come in under agreements, such a high percentage of those agreements being broken is of concern, particularly when you take into consideration the new definition of `resident' and a person's ability to access this bill in relation to their being here on a work authority. It may possibly still leave the Australian people exposed to a greater cost than they would have been if the government's bill had stood as printed. We find ourselves now with the substantive sections of these bills removed. We are back to schedule 1, which refers to health cards. If people do default on the agreements they have entered into—and they have in the past to a large extent—the vast majority of these people will automatically be able to obtain a Medicare card. Again, we will have an escalating cost and an impost not only in relation to Medicare itself but also in relation to our residences, our hospitals and all of the other facilities that will have to be put in place to accommodate these people, even down to providing interpreters for them. 
It is very much on the heads of the Labor Party and the Democrats for having amended this bill in such a way that there are now no regulations whatsoever covering those previous sectors of the bill. I indicate that I will support the government's bill as amended, but it falls far short of what the bill would have achieved if it had been passed either in its printed form or with some minor amendments that I believe would have improved it.

"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,2000-10-10,"—While someone gives Senator Brown a copy of the message, and I would like to have one as well, could I indicate that the opposition will not be supporting that part of the message which asks the Senate to agree with the House when it says it does not agree with some of our amendments. Some of these amendments are manner and form, in a sense. They do not raise major issues of principle, and I think what we have got here is a knee-jerk reaction by a minister who is not prepared to accept that others may have a different view to him, by a minister who was probably suffering jet lag when he made a decision in respect of some of these amendments, and by a minister whose senior minister, in the true sense of the word in this portfolio, is Senator Minchin. 
We actually moved amendments here in a quite reasonable way and had them debated. Quite a number of issues were thrown up during the Senate deliberations on this bill. Very substantive issues and very important matters were raised and the opposition took the view, as did the minor parties, that there were some amendments that were necessary and some which we would ensure an ongoing scrutiny of to ensure that unforeseen consequences did not take place, and we would come back at a later date to address those issues. In other words, we did not accept everything that was put up through the deliberative process of the Senate, but we in the opposition were quite selective about the items that we supported. I am sure Senator Brown and Senator Allison would say the same thing about the Greens and the Democrats.
We are now in a situation where the government has said, `It does not matter that you have had a committee process, that the bill has been looked at, and that there has been a large number of submissions. It does not matter that people have identified problems with the legislation; we will not listen to them. We will not listen to anyone who disagrees with us.' As I said, the government has said they are not prepared to accept the most simple of amendments. 
If you look at amendments Nos 1 and 2, for example, which the House disagrees with, amendment No. 1 is an Australian Greens amendment which gave some meaning to the objects clause of the legislation. What was that meaning? The objects of this act are deemed to be, by the amendment passed by the Senate:
(a) to encourage the additional generation of electricity from renewable sources;
How often has the government said that that is the objective of the act? The minister has put out press statement after press statement, not only in Australia. I am sure that when he goes to The Hague in just a few weeks time he will tell the rest of the world that this is the great objective of this legislation. We will tell the rest of the world that it is an objective that the government has told the Australian parliament not to share, not to agree to. Subclause (b) says `to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases'. What is the purpose of this legislation? This is legislation announced at the greenhouse conference at Kyoto by the minister in order to demonstrate to the world—
—It was announced by the Prime Minister before Kyoto.
—It was announced by the Prime Minister before Kyoto, telling them that the Australian government was serious about greenhouse emissions and that the Australian government was going to do something about it. So much for the Prime Minister's word. As the minister now says, the Prime Minister made that commitment, but it is a commitment that the cabinet is not prepared to agree with. Has the minister lost control of his portfolio or has the Prime Minister lost control of his senses and his commitment? Go back to The Hague, Senator Hill, and we will tell them that the promise made by the Prime Minister at Kyoto on the reduction of greenhouse gases is something that he no longer believes in, because he will not allow it to be placed in the legislation.
Subclause (c) says, `To ensure that renewable energy sources are ecologically sustainable.' Once again, you could go through the government's Internet site and find press statement after press statement. You can come into this place and you can hear statement after statement by the minister saying that these three objects are the objects of the act. Why not accept them as the objects of the act? Because the government says in its official explanation that this clause, these amendments Nos 1 and 2—and I must say that amendment No. 2 is, once again, a Greens amendment that gives definition to `ecological sustainability'; a definition which appears not only in this government's documentation but in that of the previous Labor government—substantially alter the approval processes for renewable energy generation projects seeking to be eligible under the measure. Someone must have put that excuse in the wrong box. Someone must have ticked that off, and that someone must have been suffering jet lag at the time. In the schedule it says:
The additional tests imposed by these amendments are not clearly defined and would make participation in the scheme difficult, increasing uncertainty for project proponents.
The difficulty that the draftspeople have found in respect of amendments (1) and (2) is probably in understanding the purport of them. They say:
This is counter to the intention of the legislation, which is to support the expansion of renewable energy generation capacity in Australia.
The purpose of the legislation for an international constituency is that, by supporting the expansion of renewable energy generation capacity in Australia, they would be having an impact on the level of greenhouse gases emitted in Australia. We can go on through the amendments. The Senate accepted an amendment to define what is an eligible renewable energy source. It listed, (a) to (r), a number of sources. That list is not anything radical; it is nothing novel; it is nothing irregular. It is a list on which you will find, if you go through this minister's statements, at one time or another, if not on one occasion, all these aspects listed as renewable energy sources.
But we do not say this is an exhaustive list. We made it very clear in debate that this is a list of some instances. What is not an eligible renewable energy resource is listed in subclause (2), `Fossil fuels and waste products derived from fossil fuels'. When we discussed that aspect of it, Senator Campbell, representing the minister, said, `There's no need for that because it's already in other parts of the legislation.' But we are now told these sorts of amendments are out of order because they run counter to the objectives of the legislation. Then we go to subclause (3), which says that `the regulations may prescribe any matter necessary or convenient to give effect to this section'. This is a clause that allows the government to add other eligible renewable energy sources. 
The register of applications is something that we debated the other day. Indexation is a critical issue and I turn to opposition amendment No. 22. The Senate decided that, unless the charge was indexed, it would lose value and as a consequence lose impact. As a consequence of that, the sorts of renewable energy sources this legislation is claiming to be able to bring about will not happen. We have had the figures provided to us in relation to the need for indexation. Over 10 years, if this measure is not indexed, it would be worth about half the value it is now. Let us accept that the value of the charge at the moment is not one that gives people enormous confidence that it will achieve much by way of an alternative renewable energy industry. There are concerns as to whether it is sufficient to drive the outcome. But if you do not adjust it to the CPI, over that immediate period you will have the value of that penalty basically being valueless. If you increase it in accordance with CPI, the value will be maintained and you will have a better opportunity of actually achieving the sorts of outcomes the government says it wants to achieve. The $40 declines to $30 by 2010. If, however, it is CPI adjusted, it will have a value of $53.29. So, in essence, it is going to be valued either at $53.29 in 2010 or at $30, if you do not have that CPI adjustment.
We think that amendment is quite critical to the ongoing success of any scheme that comes out under this legislation. We also believe that it is an adjustment that the Australian Greenhouse Office thinks is important and one that the minister himself thinks is important. Essentially I am saying two things: (1) reasonable amendments after considered discussion and debate with a lot of public input have been rejected by the government on the one hand; (2) in their rejection they have not even come up with any reasonable options to reject the clauses adopted by the Senate. So we will be insisting that the amendments that the House of Representatives does not agree with be agreed to.
Motion (by Senator Hill) proposed:
That the committee does not insist on its amendments nos 1, 2, 5 to 7, 17 to 20, and 22 to 24 to which the House of Representatives has disagreed and agrees to the amendment made by the House in place of amendment no. 24.",SENATE,<title>RENEWABLE ENERGY (ELECTRICITY) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,15,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-10-10,"—I oppose the motion by the government because I agree with Senator Bolkus that the Senate should stand firm on these amendments. I would have thought that the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, who was not here for the debate on this important legislation as it unfolded, certainly in the committee stage, would have taken this opportunity to congratulate the Senate on improving the legislation. 
I want to look at some of the amendments that have been rejected by the minister and his government through the House of Representatives. The first is the rejection of the Senate adding to the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Bill 2000—which we must remember is to produce environmentally friendly energy, such as wind power and solar power—these objects:
(a) to encourage the additional generation of electricity from renewable sources;—
that is what the bill is all about—
and (b) to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases;—
something the government says it ascribes to—
and (c) to ensure that renewable energy sources are ecologically sustainable.
That is the problem for the government because at the heart of this legislation is the deceit that you can turn Australia's native forests into woodchips, burn them in a furnace and produce electricity and call that ecologically sustainable—and, of course, that is a lie; it is unsustainable. You cannot destroy wildlife habitat, ancient forests or woodlands, chip them and turn them into electricity and have that seen as either renewable energy—which is the title of this bill—or sustainable. I will be looking forward to the minister's explanation of how burning forest woodchips is either a renewable process or ecologically sustainable. Certainly Senator Ian Campbell, who stood in for the minister last week, sat glued to his seat rather than respond to that question. The Senate is saying, `You are pursuing ecologically sustainable processes, such as solar power and wind power; don't allow in under the fence these destructive processes and accredit through certificates under this legislation such things as burning woodchips as renewable power.' 
I also reiterate that there is a big project proposed for tidal power near Derby in the Kimberley, which effectively involves damming those outlets to the ocean of the wild country there where you get tides of up to 10 metres high and the waterfall effect of the sea rushing in and out of those regions. That is an absolutely spellbinding and world renowned phenomenon, and this government wants to put a concrete block across tidal outlets like that and call that environmentally acceptable—ecofriendly. Well, it is not. It has a major impact on the environment, and the government should see it for what it is. It should simply be honest about this.
In the definition section—and this is the second amendment which the government in the House of Representatives has rejected—the Senate added to the definition of `ecologically sustainable' a couple of provisions which I suspect this government and this minister for the environment simply cannot wear because those provisions are about honesty in definition. Part (b) says that `ecologically sustainable' means providing for `equity within and between generations'. That means giving to the next generation a world that we can enjoy now, not taking away from the environmental heritage. What does the government have to fear about that? The government is rejecting the amendment because it is in the business of destroying forests to produce energy and that is certainly outside the bound of intergenerational equity. Part (c) says that `ecologically sustainable' means that the action is consistent with protecting biological diversity and maintaining essential processes and life support systems. The government cannot accept this amendment because what it wants to do, amongst other things, is allow for new big dams which suffocate everything behind them in terms of life-rich valleys and ecosystems and woodchipping of forests—the most species-concentrated components of the ecosystems of many of our states. The government wants to burn that and still call it ecologically sustainable when patently it is not.
When you get to amendment (5), the Senate has inserted in the list that the regulator should publicise `the eligible renewable power sources from which power is intended to be generated'. The government says, `Let's not do this,' and it says that because it does not want to say to the public in an area, `This renewable generation is coming from this unacceptable source.' The Senate is saying, `Let's have transparency,' but the government says, `Let's have a cover-up.' When you get down to the list of sources which are considered to be okay, the government, rather than accepting that list, says:
This amendment reduces flexibility in the administration of the scheme and reduces the range of renewable energy sources ...
So it means that the government has, beyond this list of more than a dozen alternatives which are to be classed as energy sources, other sources in mind. I would like the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, Senator Hill, to explain to the committee what they are. I certainly believe that legislation should be specific. The minister apparently believes that legislation should be obscure and leave anything to do further down the line.
Senate amendments (18) and (19) are criticised by the government because it says they would:
... segment a market—
that is, renewable energy— 
that is designed to offer a generic product, which is a megawatt hour of renewable energy. Liable parties have made representations to the effect that they consider exposure of the fuel source—
that is, saying whether they are burning woodchips to call it green energy—
used to create renewable energy certificates that they get accreditation for from Senator Hill, the minister for the environment—
quite falsely under this legislation as renewable energy when it is not—
would reduce their competitive position by creating high and low value certificates. 
Let me unscramble the jargon there. The minister is saying, `We do not want on these certificates, which I accredit and which are going to make more expensive power like solar power and wind power actually saleable on the market, the producer of the power to have to say where they are getting their energy from.'
I will tell you why the government does not want this. The public is savvy and it does not mind buying solar power. In fact, tens of thousands of households in this country are paying extra on their bills so that they can buy renewable energy from existing hydro schemes, solar schemes and wind power schemes rather than buying polluting fossil fuel power. The minister, who is an advocate of burning forests in furnaces, says, `If you have to put that on your certificate, the public will not wear it. The public is going to prefer solar and wind power, and those people like Forestry Tasmania, which are in the business of burning native forests in furnaces, would be at a disadvantage because the public would find out about them.' Senator Robert Hill, the minister for the environment, says, `We will get over this problem for our friends the woodchippers by not allowing the public to know where the power is coming from.' 
That is the sort of minister that we have in the environmental seat at the moment. No wonder, by the way, that his candidate for the global council of the World Conservation Union—which is meeting at the moment in Amman in Jordan and discussing, amongst other things, as a priority, renewable energy—has lost the vote overnight and that the Wilderness Society's candidate, Christine Milne, a former parliamentary leader of the Greens in Tasmania and a renowned advocate for the environment, has been elected against the wishes of this government and despite a tour de force of lobbying by this government for an alternative candidate. There has not been, since the 1980s, such an upset in the world's premier environmental body. In fact, Australian governments—serial Labor and Liberal governments—have never had their candidates voted down. I know; I stood in 1993 in Buenos Aires against the government backed candidate and lost. The government has such a network with other governments, with business and with environmental groups around world that a patch-in-the-pants organisation like the Wilderness Society—bless their hearts—gets run over every time. But on this occasion, Christine Milne took the podium for the candidacy and gave an expose on the performance of the Australian government before the premier world audience of representatives of nations and their environmental spokespeople. In particular, that galvanised developing countries who, like the public of Australia, do not like to be cheated. And Senator Hill, despite all his efforts and the huge amount of effort by his Environment Australia department to get up another candidate, in a huge upset, lost on the floor of the World Conservation Union conference.
What he is trying to do here today is to get the Senate to drop amendments which simply say: let us be honest with the Australian people. When the certificates are issued for renewable energy, let them say where that energy is coming from. If it is solar power, let it be said; if it is wind power, let it be said; and if it is burning woodchips from native forests, let it be said. What does the minister say? He says, `I, as minister for the environment, do not back that.' What a situation for a minister for the environment to be in. I hope he will reconsider. More and more Australians are becoming aware of how much he has let down this portfolio and how much, when he goes overseas, he is trying to put a gloss, which is now fragmenting, on the Australian government's failure to address just this issue of global warming and the need for Australia to get back on track with renewable energy. 
If he is in proper form, Robert Hill, the minister for the environment, will go to the next major conference on global warming, which is in The Hague in the Netherlands next month, with the coal lobby, who will be there again to twist his arm, if it needs to be twisted, against the international interest there is in—and the responsibility there is on our shoulders to do something about—global warming; and that interest is much more vigorous than anything this government is doing. We owe it to coming generations. We should not leave them with the social, economic and environmental impact that global warming is so obviously going to bring—not within a matter of centuries, but within a matter of decades. They are going to wear the cost of the inaction and the duplicity of this government at the turn of the century. 
The government has said here that liable parties have made representations to it and that they consider exposure of the fuel source on these energy certificates would reduce their competitive position. So I ask the minister: would he inform the committee as to what those liable sources are, who or which part of the industry has informed the government that writing the source of the energy on these certificates would put them at a disadvantage? I predict that the minister will not answer that question.
The government's excuse for turning down amendment (23) is that it would substantially delay the implementation of the measure and the scheme would not be able to commence as the government requires. In relation to amendment (23), the Senate has, in effect, said that draft regulations must be made available for public comment for a period of not less than 30 days before those regulations are made. Again, what the Senate has said is, `Let the public in on this.' I am fantastically proud of Australians, in particular young Australians, and I say that very sincerely. They are the most knowledgeable community in the world as far as the environment is concerned.
—Well, why don't you stick up for us overseas? Stop running us down overseas.
—I think the senator opposite said that all I do is run the government down on this. (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>RENEWABLE ENERGY (ELECTRICITY) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,15,1
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2000-10-10,"—We are disappointed that the government is not accepting many of the amendments that were agonised over in this chamber. It is fair to say that, at the end of the day, we did not get anything like what we wanted. The amendments which were agreed to were reasonable. The Democrats would certainly have preferred many of our other amendments to have been agreed to by the Senate, but I think that, after all, we did a pretty good job on this bill. There were some smaller amendments that the Senate agreed to which will allow people to know, when a generator applies to be registered, just what their intentions are in terms of the source of energy—a simple requirement that does not seem to me to involve anybody in an onerous obligation or anything that would be too much administratively—and that will give us and the public an opportunity to scrutinise the types of renewable energy being picked up by this measure at an early stage. We had amendments which required the generators themselves to indicate what sort of source they would be tapping into for their energy and what their output would be from each source. We also requested that the Senate accept a related amendment requiring that the register of certificates indicate where the energy had been sourced from. Again, that was an opportunity for us to have an early indication of where we are going with this bill.
The government says that it expects the renewable energy industry to get a real kick on with this bill, and that is the hope of the Senate as well. We do trust that this legislation will both reduce greenhouse gas emissions and give a real burst to Australia's renewable energy sector. If that does not happen to be the case and we end up burning native forest timbers and depending on biomass—if we end up at the end of the scale of renewables, which is the cheap end, the ones that are easy to achieve, such as collecting gas from municipal wastes and that kind of thing—we will do the renewables sector in this country a great disservice, because this is an enormously important opportunity. 
The government has said that it will agree to a review process after three years. This was our amendment and we are glad to see that at least some review has survived although, as senators will recall, I withdrew our amendment in favour of both the Greens' and the ALP's. Three years is a long time down the track. The small provisions which I urge the minister to think about carefully would allow us to have some indication earlier on if things are going awry, if the bill is not doing what we all hope it will do—that is, give us a good balance and a real advantage to the sector that we most want to see prosper under this legislation, and that is wind.
I think the government has been ungenerous, to say the least. We would have liked to have seen the list of eligible renewable energy sources in the bill. Our amendment No. 7, as amended, does attempt to get up a list of renewable sources which would be eligible, and so far the government has not said, `That is so restrictive. You have forgotten about X, Y and Z.' Of course, we could add new eligible sources to the legislation at any time if the government were of a mind to consider that. Included in those eligible sources is wood waste. It is a problem for the Democrats to have that in there because we know that that includes native forest wood waste and we oppose that. Nonetheless, it was a good attempt at saying, `What are the eligible renewable energy sources?' and putting in a list of them so that it is quite clear in the legislation and we do not have to wait until a regulation comes out at some later stage to discover what it is we are all talking about here. So that is a disappointment.
As Senator Bolkus has said, we thought that a number of the other amendments made some sense and we reckon the House of Representatives ought to be persuaded to support them. Again, I think the Senate has a problem with this bill. We do want it to pass—or at least the Democrats want it to pass. We are also acutely aware of the threats that have been made by members of the government over this legislation to withdraw the bill altogether if the Senate interferes with it too much. That would be a great pity. I sincerely hope the government will not consider doing that and that it will take this opportunity to consider in particular the amendments that I have mentioned, because I think they are worth while. They have been put forward in the best possible faith, if you like, and we think that the bill would be enhanced by them. Obviously there are a lot of other amendments which we think would have enhanced it much more too. We think the government could at least give more serious consideration to those amendments.",SENATE,<title>RENEWABLE ENERGY (ELECTRICITY) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,15,1
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2000-10-10,"—We have a bill here that was amended in the Senate. In relation to one amendment of the Australian Democrats, we accepted it in the other place. It was an important amendment to ensure that a penalty was in fact a penalty and not a charge that was tax deductible. That was within the spirit of the original intent and I think that amendment has served a useful purpose. We have also accepted that there be a review after three years by an independent party and that review would be made public. That would enable the government, but more importantly the community and the parliament, to get a good understanding as to how this act is working in practice. Out of that, issues that have been of concern to the Senate, such as whether the level of penalty is sufficient, would have the opportunity to be reconsidered.
Senator Allison raised the issue of the energy sources. As I understand it, when making application the energy sources would have to be indicated. So that data would certainly be available for consideration by the reviewer. If, as a result of the review indicating that an inappropriate mix of sources has been utilised, the parliament thinks that some rejigging of the scheme is necessary, then the parliament in the future would have that opportunity. I think I know where the Australian Democrats are coming from. They would like to be confident that this legislation will encourage particularly the utilisation of such sources as wind and solar, while being less enthusiastic about some other sources such as biomass and, I think I could fairly say, not enthusiastic at all about some sources such as forest waste. I can say to the Australian Democrats that I am advised that the government's best estimate of the percentage of energy that would be sourced through this bill from forest waste would be just about three per cent. It is a very small percentage of the total energy source, not a percentage that would be said to have any significant effect on decisions to harvest a native forest or not. It is really an incidental matter. 
There is no doubt that the take-up under this bill is likely to be the least-cost options first. That is not surprising, and I would respectfully suggest to honourable senators that there is nothing wrong with that, either. There are many lower cost opportunities to develop renewable energy in Australia and the government is keen to encourage that to take place. More expensive options—options where perhaps the technology is not as well established or has not been previously commercialised—may be taken up under this legislation later after the cheaper options are taken up first. I remind honourable senators and in particular the Australian Democrats that this bill should not be looked at alone; it should be looked at as complementary to the $350 million that the government is putting up to encourage other forms of renewable energy, in particular those that need a boost at the commercialisation stage in order to be economically viable such as the options that I announced last weekend in relation to solar panels that intensify light from the sun upon solar cells. The two projects that we announced needed an enhancement by the government of $1 million each. They should be seen as important but being addressed through a different way; that is, through the direct grant path rather than getting an immediate boost through a scheme such as this. As we can build some economies of scale into the utilisation of such technically sophisticated sources of renewable energy, the cost will come down, and in the future they may well be picked up with this bill, either in its first term or after the three-yearly review when it no doubt will be further enhanced.
I urge the Australian Democrats to see it in those terms: that this is a first step; that it will establish a very significant industry in Australia which currently does not exist in the way that we are talking about post this bill—a $2 billion investment in renewable energy. The sources of power will be made available to the registrar so that they will be taken into account in the review after three years. The government and the parliament will have the opportunity to consider such modifications as are demonstrated to be necessary through that review, post the first three-yearly phase.
As I said, the government has picked up the non-tax-deductible amendment, which I think was the very important amendment; it has taken on board and accepted the need for the review after three years, so that we can all be confident that the legislation in practice is working in the way in which it is intended and we can give consideration to any refinements that should be made. We would suggest to the Senate that that should be sufficient for the Senate to recognise that this legislation is in a form that can be implemented, get the investment into the industry, give us that opportunity to make renewable energy more commercially viable in this country, and bring significant benefits in terms of greenhouse gas outcomes.
As I said yesterday, adoption of this legislation at the moment in Australia will actually put us up on the top rung of countries in terms of the percentage of our power contributed by renewable resources. Once you take out the nuclear energy powers, the nuclear energy parties, then we really are on the top rung. As I said, once you start characterising the energy of places like Denmark according to its hydro source, then we are even further up the ladder. 
I commend the decision that has been made in the other place and the package that is now brought back to this chamber through the message as sufficient for the Senate to be able to accept that today it would be enacting a very worthwhile and workable piece of legislation that can contribute to a major step in the right direction for Australia in building a better balance of energy sources and contributing worthwhile goals in terms of greenhouse gas outcomes and other environmental outcomes.",SENATE,<title>RENEWABLE ENERGY (ELECTRICITY) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,15,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-10-10,"—I thank the Minister for the Environment and Heritage for his contribution. What he did not do was respond to the questions about why we should not put the source of energy on the certificate for the public to be able to read it at the outset. Senator Allison was expressing concern that we have to wait until after three years for a review, and the minister confirms that we would indeed have to do that—and I am not sure if the public would even then find out. Somewhere down the line after the next two federal elections we would be able to find out which sources had won out in terms of getting this government advantage in renewable energy. The question to the minister has to be: why not tell the public now that the renewable energy certificate which was giving a new energy plant an advantage in the market is indeed a solar power scheme, a wind power scheme—or is from burning of sugarcane or native forest wood waste, woodchips? Is there a reason why this should be not known to the public? I do not think there is, but the question to the minister is: is there a reason, and, if so, what is that reason?  
I notice that in the return of the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Bill 2000 to the Senate from the House of Representatives the government says that liable parties—that is, some people in the renewable energy business—have made representations to the government to the effect that they consider that exposure of the fuel source used to create renewable energy certificates—that is, saying where they are getting their renewable energy from—would reduce their competitive position by creating high and low value certificates. That is, the public, the buyers of the electricity, are going to prefer solar power over woodchip. The minister says, `We will not release that information for at least three years down the line.' So the public cannot make a choice. Are we really to accept that? 
The minister also said that the wood waste from forests and woodlands—and there have been projects mooted on this in New South Wales, Victoria, Western Australia and Tasmania, at least—would make up only three per cent of the renewable energy, which is two per cent of the increase in electricity output in Australia over the next 10 years. That is three per cent of two per cent, which on my calculation is 0.06 of a percentage point. I agree with the minister that that is very small indeed. 
The question I have to ask the minister—and I hope he is listening while he is talking with Senator Allison at the back—is this: has his department taken into account the Southwood project in Tasmania? You will remember that I spoke about this extensively last week, so people are well acquainted with it. This is the project of Forestry Tasmania and the Bacon Labor government to burn 300,000 tonnes of native forests and wildlife habitat as woodchips in a furnace on a new industrial site at Judbury in the Upper Huon Valley—that is an hour or more's drive south-west of Hobart—to produce 30 megawatts of power, enough to power a sizeable town or small city. That of itself is more than the three per cent that Senator Hill is talking about. I ask Senator Hill whether he is saying to the committee that the Southwood project's intention to burn 300,000 tonnes of woodchips is at the outset not going to be permitted under this scheme. If that is the case, we should know, and certainly Forestry Tasmania should know—and I would commend him on that. If it is not the case, then I do not believe his figures and I do not believe the figures that he has had put before him. 
Really this is a case of public accountability. That is the major thrust of the amendments which are here and which we want the government to adopt. Last week I lost the argument—with the Labor Party, even—that woodchips should not be entertained here. The Labor Party agrees with the government that burning of woodchips can be classified, along with solar power and wind power, as a good thing in terms of ecological sustainability. The Greens are absolutely appalled by that concept, but the big parties agree with it. That has gone through, but what the government is essentially saying here is `We don't want the public to know about it.' 
I am pleased to hear that the Labor Party has drawn the line at that. I am pleased to hear that the Democrats have drawn the line at that. I certainly will draw the line at that; I have drawn the line well before that. It is up to the government to say who the liable parties are that have been lobbying it. Is it the woodchip corporations? It is up to the government to say whether it is excluding Southwood, for example, from getting renewable energy certificates. It is up to the government in particular to say why it cannot be honest with the Australian people, who I was saying in the earlier submission are the most environmentally sophisticated and literate people in the world according to international surveys on the environment, and let them know what the product is. This is simply a matter of good labelling and honesty in business. This is a deceitful piece of legislation. But I think the government, nevertheless, could get its wish through—that the woodchippers and others be serviced by this piece of legislation—if it were to be at least open with people. It would find itself adopting these amendments and then, I suppose, getting the legislation through this place with the support of the Labor Party and Democrats—remembering that I was the only senator who voted against this legislation yesterday, when it was before this place.

"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2000-10-10,"—All I can really say is that the anecdotally based contribution of Senator Brown is not consistent with the advice that we have had. We appointed consultants to give us advice on this matter. They, no doubt, sought the information from the industry upon which they gave us that advice. Senator Brown comes in here and he says that he knows of other possible projects that could change those figures. That may or may not be so. I can only say that, when we appointed independent consultants to give us the advice, those consultants obviously had no political bias and we expect them to be acting objectively and professionally. That is what they are being paid for and that is the source of the figure that I have given to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>RENEWABLE ENERGY (ELECTRICITY) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,15,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-10-10,"—When I ask the minister, `What is the source of the advice?' I expect him to an-swer. I do not expect him to say, `Oh, there is a consultant in the way that excuses me from giving that information to the Senate and therefore to the Australian public.' He knows the answer but he is not prepared to tell us, and that is an indictment in itself of the attempt by this legislation to withhold information on a very important environmental factor, which is: where are our renewable energies coming from? While the minister is off seeking advice, I just want to come back to his contention that Australia is doing extremely well amongst the community of nations. This bill is about how we go between now and the year 2010 in terms of new energy, and it is aiming at two per cent of that in Australia being from renewable sources. But because of the fact that it is measured in current output, not in the output of 2010, it actually turns out to be one per cent of the electricity production in this country by the year 2010.
However, I will take the government's figure of two per cent. When we look at the rest of the world, the average for other nations between now and the year 2010 is 7.4 per cent renewable energy out of the new sources they are looking at. So Australia is less than one-third of the world average. We come in behind many other like countries in the world, many of which are aiming at above 10 per cent through to 15 per cent. Certainly Denmark is there at 20.3 per cent, with an aim a few decades down the line of making that 100 per cent. Here we are, Australia, the world's worst per capita greenhouse polluter, and the figure is going through the roof under this government and under this minister for the environment. They have come up with one of the poorest regimes for rectifying that amongst the community of nations. I know we can all use figures to our advantage or disadvantage. I am taking those figures from a chart from Greenpeace that I produced here and that I have quoted from in here. There has been no countermanding it. The fact is that Australia is an extraordinarily poor performer to date; but this legislation of itself, if that is all the government has in its saddlebag, is going to mean that Australia is going to be an even worse performer as we go down the line.
Senator Hill has to go to the post-Kyoto conference, which is at The Hague in the Netherlands, next month. I am afraid it is going to be an occasion of Australia copping a bollocking from the rest of the world, and not because Australians want it that way. This is the sunny country. I reiterate that Australians want this to be a solar powered nation. We have the best expertise in the world. But this government has turned its back on that, notwithstanding the announcements the minister made on the weekend. I am aware that, since I have been in this place, the government has taken all $12 million in research and development for the solar energy sector and transferred it across to coal and gas because that is where the lobbyists are. 
Our technology is facing the unenviable position of having to go offshore, whereas governments overseas such as those in the US, Japan and Switzerland have massive programs for funding citizens putting solar panels onto their rooves. In some cases the tiles are made entirely out of solar panels—there are whole rooves of them. There is not any legislation of that sort in sight in this country. We do not have eco taxes, we do not have pollution control taxes and we certainly are holding the pack back as far as renewable energy is concerned. And here we have a piece of legislation which says that the first cab off the rank, and probably the biggest classified source of renewable energy in the near future, is a giant woodchip furnace in Tasmania. I would urge the Labor Party and the Democrats to at least insist on public accountability in this legislation. That is what these amendments are about and we should stick to them.",SENATE,<title>RENEWABLE ENERGY (ELECTRICITY) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,15,1
"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,2000-10-10,"—I would like to briefly make a couple of observations. I have already indicated our position on these amendments, and we will insist on them. But I would like to alert Senator Brown to something going on essentially behind his back. While he is raising very important matters in this debate and being very productive in doing so, we are unwittingly allowing Senator Hill enough time to try to con the Democrats into supporting his proposal again. I tried to get involved in the discussion, but I was curtly told that I was not wanted and was not needed. There is a real problem here, Senator Brown, which is that, for as long as we are raising the general points, Senator Hill, fresh from his lack of success overseas—on two occasions in the last 48 hours—is taking this time as an opportunity to try to con the Australian Democrats into supporting his measures.
Can I just say one thing: this minister cannot afford to go to The Hague without this legislation. Once we recognise that strategically, we should not give in to him. The legislation is soft enough as it is. The legislation has enough holes in it as it is. Any more concessions to this minister will, I believe, make the legislation almost ineffectual. So let the message reach the Australian public and anyone who picks up this debate when the minister goes to The Hague: if our amendments are not insisted upon, if we do not maintain the value of this legislation, if we do not give it direction in the objects clause, then this legislation is nothing like what the Prime Minister promised the international community some 3½ years ago at Kyoto. It is an unfair outcome that we are raising important matters when Senator Hill, as I said, is busily trying to con the Democrats, but I hope that this time the Democrats will not give in.
Mr Temporary Chair, I would like to split the motion that is before the Senate. We are prepared to accept the government's adoption of the Australian Democrats amendment in terms of the review. We do not think that it is as good as the one that was accepted by the Senate last week—for the reasons that I, Senator Brown and, at that stage, Senator Allison expressed then—but we are prepared to accept it. If we can break off the motion and treat it in two parts, we will not insist on our amendment (24) and we will accept the government's alternative, which is the Democrats amendment for that particular clause. However, we will insist on all the other amendments that have come back from the House of Representatives. ",SENATE,<title>RENEWABLE ENERGY (ELECTRICITY) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,15,1
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2000-10-10,"—I thank the Senate, particularly Senator Bolkus and Senator Brown, for allowing us some time to further discuss these matters, a result of which is that I think Senator Allison is going to insist on amendment (5)—she can correct me if I am wrong. Firstly, I should say that I think each amendment should be taken separately. I think that Senator Allison is going to insist on amendment (5) except for subclause 2. The difficulty with the subclause is that it refers to the `estimated average annual output', which could be calculated over quite a number of years. 
—Mr Temporary Chairman, I rise on a point of order. Is Senator Hill acting as press secretary for Senator Allison or is he the minister? I am sure that she can tell us what she wants to do, Minister.
 (Senator Hogg)—There is no point of order. Minister, could you resume your explanation?
—Secondly, amendment (6) will appear in a slightly amended form to make it clear that the information that is required to be provided pursuant to amendment (5) has to appear on the public record. 
—Do you have a form of words?
—I think she has—
—You failed as a press secretary. Go back to your old job!
—I think we are doing very well in difficult circumstances, Senator Bolkus. The form of words for amendment (6) may well be: `(3) The Regulator must enter details of the eligible renewable power sources as provided by the intended generator on the register of applications.' Senator Allison might indicate whether she thinks that I have understood her position correctly.",SENATE,<title>RENEWABLE ENERGY (ELECTRICITY) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,15,1
"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,2000-10-10,"—On the procedure: Senator Hill suggested that we take the amendments individually. Why don't we do so? As we come to each one, either he on behalf of Senator Allison or Senator Allison herself may feel inclined to tell us what they want to do.
—Senator Bolkus, I was going to suggest from the chair that I think we need the suggested form of words that has been put forward by the minister to be properly documented and circulated to members in the chamber. In that case, I take the suggestion that we split the original motion and that we deal with it item by item. Or we can do (1) and (2) together—",SENATE,<title>RENEWABLE ENERGY (ELECTRICITY) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,15,1
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2000-10-10,"—We can do all except (5) and (6) then. 
—All right. Let us do (1), (2), (7), (17) to (20), (22) and (23) only. So the motion becomes:
That the committee does not insist on amendments Nos 1, 2, 7, 17 to 20, 22 and 23.
That is the first motion that is before the chair.",SENATE,<title>RENEWABLE ENERGY (ELECTRICITY) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,15,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-10-10,"—I would prefer that each amendment is taken in turn, as Senator Bolkus has suggested.",SENATE,<title>RENEWABLE ENERGY (ELECTRICITY) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,15,1
"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,2000-10-10,"—Just to help the committee, Mr Chair: I do not really need to insist on that now, Senator Brown. If we can deal with that patched together, I would hope that the Australian Democrats would be supporting us in insisting on our amendments with respect to those or they would be opposing us, in which circumstance the sort of cognate vote would probably expedite proceedings. That is unless there are some other reasons why you would want to have them all individually.",SENATE,<title>RENEWABLE ENERGY (ELECTRICITY) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,15,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-10-10,"—I was not opposed to expediting the proceedings, but I did want to ask Senator Allison on each amendment—most of these amendments were put forward by the Democrats and they are now dumping them—what it is that the government said to her that has encouraged her to cave in like this. This is an extraordinary event that we are witnessing here. We saw yesterday the Democrats vote for this bill, which does involve this terrible proposal that forests be burnt and turned into electricity and that that be classed as renewable. We have seen the Democrats turn down an earlier Greens amendment that, before that happened, there should be a Commonwealth environmental impact assessment, remembering there will be an assessment at state level—but in Tasmania at least that means nothing because the minister can simply override it.  
Now we are seeing the government say to the Democrats: `Look, we are going to apply a little bit of pressure to you. We won't let this legislation through if you do not agree to us rejecting these amendments from the Senate, even though you put up some of them.' As Senator Bolkus has said for the Labor Party, the pressure is really on the government because it wants to go to the COP6 talks at The Hague on global warming in the Netherlands next month and say that it has passed this legislation; it has at last passed a piece of very modest legislation to do something about the enormous problem of global warming in Australia. Instead, a quick chat in the back row with Senator Allison during the course of these proceedings, if we are to understand the minister—and I am still waiting to hear from Senator Allison on this—sees a comprehensive cave-in on these amendments, with the exception of half of one and a bit of another. We are talking about a dozen amendments at least. Most of these amendments are core Democrat territory, which is that to set aside the environmental component is to be transparent and is to be publicly accountable. They are saying, `Make the government be publicly accountable.' The first amendment, which is apparently now going to be thrown out by the Democrats, is just stating that the object of this bill is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and also to ensure that renewable energy sources are ecologically sustainable. This is not just Greens territory; this has been in the past a bulwark of Democrat environmental policy. But here, if Senator Hill is to be heard correctly, Senator Allison is saying, after a quick chat from him, `We'll dump that.' This is extraordinary behaviour from the Democrats, if that is the case. The pressure is on the government. The government would accede to these amendments because it wants to take this legislation to The Hague, but with a quick chat the Democrats have caved in to Senator Hill on it, having said they would not—all within the space of about 20 minutes. 
I am not going to go further at this particular juncture on this because I do want to hear from Senator Allison. I have been in parliaments long enough to know that sometimes there are extraordinarily unforeseen circumstances which lead people to act totally out of keeping with past behaviour, past principles and even party policy. So I cede the floor to Senator Allison, who no doubt is going to be shepherded from here on by Senator Hill in this matter. But I think Democrat voters and all Australians deserve an explanation for this behaviour.",SENATE,<title>RENEWABLE ENERGY (ELECTRICITY) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,15,1
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2000-10-10,"—What an extraordinary contribution that was. If this bill passes, those of us who vote for it—it does not matter what party or interest group they represent—will be able to go out and say that they have passed legislation that will result in the largest boost to renewable energy in the history of this country. For anyone that is seriously interested in Australia's contribution to the greenhouse challenge, that must be a great day. Anything that is going to boost the investment in renewable energy—let alone an investment of $2 billion that will significantly introduce economies of scale, bring down the price and therefore encourage further utilisation of renewable energy—would have made a significant contribution to a better result from Australia in terms of global greenhouse gases. So I find it absolutely amazing that Senator Brown, who claims to be an environmentalist, would come in here and argue against that. For Senator Brown to try and suggest to particular senators who have a green constituency that their constituency might in fact be disappointed in an outcome that amounts to such a huge boost to renewable energy is an obscure argument, to put it at its best. Certainly, after the passage of this legislation, I will have no hesitation in saying that it is the single most important contribution that we have made.
As you would know, Mr Temporary Chairman Hogg, most of the projects announced by the Prime Minister in November 1997 making up Australia's then domestic response to the greenhouse issue were no regrets projects. In other words, they were projects calling for a contribution from industry and the community that did not require an extra financial commitment. They were best practice projects that would primarily be driven for other objectives than for greenhouse gas abatement. This was the major one of those November 1997 initiatives that went beyond no regrets and actually required an additional financial contribution from Australian industry. As it turns out, the contribution has been estimated at some $2 billion, which would otherwise not be spent and is therefore a significant economic cost. I am pleased to say that, in the end, industry accepted that it is a reasonable economic cost in terms of the contribution that they could make to help Australia achieve a better greenhouse gas outcome. 
What the Senate is doing today is legislating the first major initiative beyond no regrets that requires an extra economic burden to help Australia achieve a better greenhouse gas outcome. As I said, that is something which I would have thought would be applauded by all Australians who are seriously interested in the issue of global warming. If I might put that in a broader context, the target that Australia accepted at Kyoto was never going to be easy. There are some people, such as Senator Brown, who dismissed it as a free kick—that was naive to anyone who makes an objective study of these issues. In fact, our graph of business as usual indicated that Australia's greenhouse gases were likely to rise between 1990 and the first reporting period of 2008 to 2012 by about 45 per cent. To reduce a projected increase of over 40 per cent down to just eight per cent in that short period of time was always going to be a major effort. It was the equivalent effort in terms of cost of abatement of all the other major industrialised countries who were a party to the Kyoto protocol. 
The reason the Kyoto protocol was successful in the end was that the international community accepted Australia's principle of differentiation—that is, that all countries should accept a fair share of the burden, but it would be differentiated according to the different costs of abatement and, furthermore, that it could be implemented by each state according to its national circumstances. Obviously, certain policies and measures in one economy can be at a very different cost and have very different practical aspects from another economy. What we argued successfully in Kyoto was that each state, each economy, should be able to look at the opportunities that it has to reduce its greenhouse gases in terms of accepting approximately an equal share of the cost burden. Out of that, Australia was given by those making the assessment a figure of an eight per cent rise over that period—a difficult target but, we believed, a fair target. We were benefited by the fact that in the lead-up to the Kyoto conference the Australian government had done considerable work on what domestic initiatives would be necessary to help us achieve that target. Those initiatives have been introduced over the intervening period and up to the stage of this one, which, as I said, is the first major initiative beyond no regrets which has required a legislative base. When fully implemented, those initiatives are going to help Australia significantly to achieve its target.
Since Kyoto, the task for Australia has become more difficult because of the economic success that we have experienced. One thing that we did not judge correctly at Kyoto was the extent of economic growth that would be achieved by the Howard government. That growth—an extraordinary economic result to the background of the Asian economic crisis—has made Australia's task even more difficult, but the government has addressed that, in particular with the suite of initiatives that were announced last year as part of the negotiation over the GST package. Here again the Australian Democrats deserve some credit because some of these extra greenhouse initiatives were their initiatives. They took the political opposition, with the political moment that Senator Brown is never prepared to do, to use their leverage over the GST to get these better environmental outcomes. So we saw reforms such as the new fuel quality standards, the new emission standards for vehicles and the like being committed to by the government. When we add the initiatives added by the Prime Minister in November 1997 to the extra initiatives announced by the Prime Minister as a result of the negotiation with the Australian Democrats at the time of the GST debate, then we should be able to address the extra burden in greenhouse terms that we now face as a result of the economic prosperity that has been experienced in intervening years. 
What it demonstrates, however, is the commitment of this government to achieving its Kyoto target. Some governments have done very little since Kyoto. They are waiting until they see whether Kyoto is ratified by sufficient states to come into legally binding effect, and then they will address the issue. Australia, because it has an energy intense economy, recognised that achieving its target would require very significant structural change economically, and that we could not afford to wait until the Kyoto protocol came into legal effect. We had to commence the implementation of the reform package immediately. That is why the Australian government has been working through the suite of initiatives—and out to November 1997—since the time of the Kyoto conference just a week or two after that prime ministerial announcement.
It is why the Australian government has picked up and is now implementing these extra initiatives that were announced last year, even though the Kyoto protocol is still not legally binding. Some have condemned us for that; they say that we are getting ahead of the game. I cannot imagine Senator Brown ever accepting that Australia is ahead of the game in terms of environmental actions, but the real fact is that it is not that we are ahead of a game; it is just that we are ensuring that the reforms are in place and are being implemented in time to bring in the greenhouse benefits to enable us to meet the first accounting period, which is very rapidly approaching. It is a much stronger position in which Australia now finds itself in the international negotiations as a result of the decision it took to implement its policies rather than to wait upon ratification.
The key point I make—because I suspect that the drafting is nearing conclusion—is that we cannot afford to lose any one of the initiatives. If we lose any one of these initiatives, we will be back behind the eight ball again. We certainly cannot afford to lose this key initiative which, as I said, is going to significantly change the profile of Australia's emissions in terms of lifting renewable energy. It has the pull effect of requiring such a substantial capital investment that will bring renewable energy down to an economically competitive position, a result being the take-up will accelerate and that extra step will be taken towards meeting what we think is a fair but reasonable commitment accepted at Kyoto. I do say that, if we can conclude this debate in a way that this bill does pass today, the Senate will be making a very significant contribution to Australia meeting its target and therefore Australia playing its part in achieving a better global outcome on greenhouse gases.",SENATE,<title>RENEWABLE ENERGY (ELECTRICITY) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,15,1
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2000-10-10,"—I rise to speak on the Democrats' position on the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Bill 2000. To some extent this legislation is very much a Democrats type bill. We would have done it differently of course, and the amendments we put to the legislation expressed the way in which we would have done that. It has been a privilege to be involved in this legislation. It would be easy to reject the bill because our amendments did not get up, but I keep remembering the message that came from just about every one of the submissions to the inquiry, and that was, `Whatever you do, don't sink this bill.' There is a good reason for that. It is an important start in a whole new direction of weaning us off fossil fuels and looking to renewables as the future. For that reason, we will not be insisting on the amendments we supported previously. We believe that, just as it would be easy for us to insist, it would be easy for the government to say, `We don't especially care for this legislation and so we will pull the bill. The Senate has gone too far in amending it.' Certainly industry would be behind that, judging by the submissions that we had. This is not a popular bill with those high energy users out there and with those people who believe that greenhouse is something of a myth, that those of us who are environmentalists complain too much and that the science is at best questionable. We know that is not the case but nonetheless we do need to identify quite a significant sector out there that would be quite happy to see this bill put in the bottom drawer forever more. 
It has been difficult to encourage the government to change its bill, and I think I understand the reason for that. Minister Hill has agreed that we can at least know in advance of the three-year review period what sort of renewable energy sources power will be generated by those who will do the generation. I think it is important for us to have access to information about where the energy is going to come from. If the minister is wrong and it is not going to be three per cent biomass and it is going to be more like 90 per cent biomass, then we will know very early on in the process. It is a small amendment and a small concession by the government but, at the end of the day, we need to balance the risks associated with this bill not going ahead with the advantages of it doing so. It has not been easy for us to come to this decision, but nonetheless I keep going back to the message that came through loud and clear throughout the hearings, and they were, `Try to amend it if you can. Try to improve the bill—there are plenty of ways to do that—but please make sure that it passes the Senate in the best form that the Senate can manage.' So that is what we will do today.",SENATE,<title>RENEWABLE ENERGY (ELECTRICITY) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,15,1
"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,2000-10-10,"—We have just witnessed two of the most amazing performances that I have experienced in this place for quite a long time. We heard Senator Hill—and I will return to him in a few moments—claiming that early ratification of Kyoto is too late, so the government has been off restructuring the economy for the last four years. What an amazing claim from a minister who is failing in meeting the Kyoto targets. But, as I said, I will get to that later on. 
We heard Senator Allison, with all the cards in her hand, saying, `You can have them all; I will give the game away.' Senator Allison, knowing full well that this minister needs this legislation, basically said, `I am prepared to fall over—don't pressure me at all.' After this, the Democrats stand for nothing when it comes to renewable energy. The least they stand for is honesty; the most they stand for is total gutlessness.
—What does Labor stand for?
—Senator Allison put out three press statements last week, and you were not here to read them, Senator Hill, because you were somewhere else trying to wrangle future debates on greenhouse and trying your very hardest, once again, to absolve this government from any responsibility. The Democrats put out three press statements which will be remembered for their dishonesty and for the way they conned the Australian press gallery. The statement put out on 10 October by Senator Allison claimed `Democrats amendments passed by the Senate include ... ' and she then claimed ownership of amendments passed by the Senate. Unfortunately for Senator Allison, they were not the Democrats' amendments. She should have known that and her office should have known that. Gorespeak hits the Australian Democrats! They have short-term memory loss.
The debate had finished only seconds before, but the Australian Democrats claimed credit for amendments passed that were not theirs. The statement said that Democrats amendments passed by the Senate included tax deductibility. That was an opposition amendment. Another amendment passed was `penalties to be CPI indexed'. That was an opposition amendment. `A review of legislation after three years' was not their amendment at all. They did not put up anything like that. With respect to the first two amendments, they might say, `We actually floated suggestions and amendments along the same lines,' but it was the Labor Party amendments that were carried. Amendment No. 3, review of legislation after three years, was not their amendment. 
—It is now.
—`It is now,' says Senator Hill, because it was acceptable to the government. Their softer version of what was accepted by the Senate is now acceptable to the government. There was a distinction between the two amendments. What else do they claim? They claim that they have successfully moved an amendment that the `register of renewable energy certificates must show the energy source used and be published on the Internet'. Whose amendment was that? It was Senator Brown's, the Australian Greens'. As I said, Gorespeak has hit the Australian Democrats. It is not the first time they have done it, but never have they done it more blatantly than they did it last week. It was a dishonest press statement and they ought to apologise—not just to the Australian public but to the journalists who, because of the speed of turnover and the time in which they have to write stories up there, took them at their word. They claimed credit for amendments which they supported but which they now dump.  
The other amazing aspect of their performance last week was that they were quick to condemn everyone else. They were quick to condemn Senator Brown and they were quick to condemn the Labor Party. They asked: `Will Labor destroy confidence in green power today?' I tell you what: we did not destroy confidence in green power that day, but this afternoon they have destroyed confidence in them as well as in green power. They said in that press statement: `There is still time for the Labor Party to get over its attack of gutlessness and to give this legislation back its credibility.' Senator Allison, this legislation had credibility when it went to the House of Representatives. That is why the government was not prepared to accept the amendments that we moved and that Senator Brown and you accepted last week—amendments which, through the whole course of the deliberations of the Senate committee, you thought were quite vital. Will the Australian Democrats now give this legislation its credibility? Will the Australian Democrats now show some guts? It took five minutes from this jet-lagged minister to con you this afternoon. Come on: this is the minister who has got to go to The Hague with something. His own Greenhouse Office says—despite what he says—`This government is failing in meeting its greenhouse objectives.' Its own government bureaucracy is saying that it made promises at Kyoto which it has not kept. We are saying that we want to rip the spine out of the back of this legislation. Why? What sort of concession is there? We will come to the concession later.
Senator Allison claimed last week that, because of the ALP's `display of cowardice', the government will have the numbers to pass this legislation largely unchanged. They did not have to rely on anyone's cowardice in this place, Senator Allison. All they had to rely on was your gullibility and the Australian Democrats going along with you. Form has shown, time and time again, when the Bunsen burner is put on, it is amazing what sort of greenhouse gas emissions affect the Australian Democrats, or what emissions at all affect the Australian Democrats. There has been absolutely no imperative for you to fold within 12 hours of this legislation coming back from the House of Representatives. Make them stew for a while. Let them cogitate. Let them continue those battles between Senator Hill and Senator Minchin. Let them go back to the Prime Minister's office and say to the Prime Minister that the Senate demands some effective legislation. But no. You do not even force this minister back to confront Senator Minchin on this legislation. He has been rolled often enough; what we were trying to do was to give him a bit of strength to go back to the oval office and to say to them, `Prime Minister, you made a commitment pre Kyoto. It is a commitment we need to keep.' This minister has not even been told to go and do that—and why? Because the Australian Democrats have shown the gutlessness and cowardice which they have accused others of showing.
Destroying the environment should not be tax deductible. But in the press statement Senator Allison put out last week she said, `It is important to link the charge with increases in inflation. If the coalition lets industry off the hook, these new targets will be a joke.' That is straight out of the press statement: `These new targets will be a joke.' Senator Allison, congratulations; you are voting for a joke. In your own words you are voting for a joke. You know that not having the charges CPI indexed basically means that this measure will not be as effectual as this parliament wants it to be or as the community wants it to be. You say in your press statement of 31 August, and you are modest enough not to claim ownership of that Senate report:
A Senate report tabled earlier this month concluded that it would probably be more attractive for liable parties to pay the charge rather than comply, a problem that would be exacerbated if the charge were tax deductible and not linked to CPI. 
...	...	...	
At $40, the charge is already too low to encourage the more expensive renewables, wind and solar.
At $40, less the effect of the CPI, it is going to be too low to encourage those industries you want to encourage. So as I say, Senator Allison, in your own words, by letting this minister off the hook on this provision you are voting for a joke. You say you have made some minor gains. Let us look at some of those gains. We have been asked to treat amendments Nos 5 and 6 separately. Amendment No 6, an Australian Greens amendment not an Australian Democrats one, as claimed in that press statement last week, says that there should be a list of:
(i) the eligible renewable power sources from which power is intended to be generated; and
(ii) the estimated average annual output of each source listed. . .  
Senator Allison comes in today and says, `We're not going to insist on subclause (ii). Subclause (ii) is there to keep an eye on the very things that the Australian community and you and Senator Brown and I have raised in debate. We want to know what the sources are. We want to protect against excessive reliance on native forests. If you take away that subclause you take away accountability on the extent of what use and reliance will be made on each particular source. You are taking away accountability for the thing that you railed about last week—the protection of native forests. You are allowing this government the capacity to hide from the truth when it comes to the protection of native forests. That is what you are doing by the deletion of that subclause. Turning to amendment No 6, you say you want to change that from what was adopted before, which was `The Regulator must enter details of the application on the register of applications for accredited power stations' to `The Regulator must enter details of the eligible renewable power sources as provided by the intended generator.'
What is wrong with the increased level of accountability? What you are doing here, together with the revised amendment No. 5, is ensuring that the community will not be able to adequately scrutinise these particular provisions. If you are concerned about native forests you ought to be worried about the capacity these amendments give to a government and a regulator to conceal the facts from the public. So you put out a press statement last week saying that you are concerned about the protection of native forests. What you have done is not just allow the government to use native forests as a source, and we acknowledge that there are some dangers in that but we are supporting it. Unlike us, you want to give the government the capacity to keep those facts hidden from the public. We think adequate scrutiny demands that your amendments, your further concessions, be rejected.
As I say, this is an amazing performance from the Australian Democrats. They ought to apologise to us, particularly to the press gallery for conning them last week, and for the language they used. As for the minister, he has done it again: he has conned the Australian Democrats. Smooth-talking language we are used to from this minister but for him to come in and say, `We're really serious about Kyoto and we've decided not to wait to bring about the structural change that is needed to achieve the objectives of Kyoto'—this is the minister who leads the government in this place, a government that has presided over the rock-bottom level of the Australian dollar, a rock-bottom level that reflects that the rest of the world knows our economy is going in the wrong direction. The level of the dollar reflects what the rest of the world thinks of our economy and the direction in which it is going. Minister, you have failed; this government has failed.
—What a joke!
—This government is a joke, Senator Herron; you are spot-on about that. It is a joke because the direction in which you should have taken us is not the direction in which we are going. What the world markets are doing to the Australian dollar now is basically what they have done in their investment patterns over the last five years: they have found new sources of investment. They have gone into new industries—IT or whatever. If this government were actually doing its job in respect of meeting Kyoto targets, we would have been going through a restructuring of our economy, which the rest of the world would have recognised and respected. The Prime Minister says, `I've been to the Olympics and I've spoken to lots of people and I know about IT.' The trouble is that he obviously did not register with the people he spoke to, because on every day he spoke to someone from the world IT community at the Olympics the dollar kept on going down. They realise that this Prime Minister is on the wrong track and they realise that you are on the wrong track. We want, and we do need, a restructuring of this economy. We need a new economy, we need IT and IT services— 
—What's the pound doing?
—Senator Herron, if it were up to you we would still have the pound as our currency in Australia. Gladly, we do not. If we were doing the right thing we would recognise that IT, IT services and the application of IT to produce the new industries we are talking about are fundamental to our restructuring. But, Senator Hill, all we have seen in the four or five years since Kyoto is a government in gridlock. You and Senator Minchin are like two Greco-Roman wrestlers at Darling Harbour, not able to budge each other. That is what we have seen: putting the `Darling' back into Darling Harbour but not being able to budge each other. It has taken so long to get an outcome from cabinet on this particular legislation. It has been there for so long because the two ministers could not agree. At the end of the day the inevitable happened: Senator Hill got rolled. So if we are really serious about early action, Senator Hill, how long has it taken for this one? If we are really serious about early action, no-one has told the state governments, no-one has demanded sectoral approaches, no-one has told industry and no-one has told the Prime Minister. In the aftermath of the Olympics he is still telling everyone what he knows about IT and, consequently, about reducing the level of the dollar. Commitment requires some action and recognition of the underlying restructuring that needs to take place. We are not achieving our Kyoto targets and, Senator Hill, when you go to The Hague in just a few weeks time they will be waiting to find out what we have done. In terms of what we have done, this sell-out by the Democrats this afternoon by agreeing with you will not stand up to scrutiny.",SENATE,<title>RENEWABLE ENERGY (ELECTRICITY) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,15,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-10-10,"—This is a historic day for the Democrats, and a very sad day at that. In June last year the Democrats passed the GST legislation for the government—gave the government the numbers—and attendant on that a $2 billion plus per annum boost to transport, mining and logging corporations through the diesel fuel rebate to create an added impact on the atmosphere through polluting gases and global warming gases. At the same time the Democrats guillotined new environmental legislation through here at the behest of Minister Hill which took away the requirement that the government hold environmental impact assessments on a whole range of matters and confined it to five or six particular matters and, against the wishes of the majority of environmental groups in this country, handed back to the states the power over the environment. The states being smaller and much more vulnerable, this enhanced the power of the corporate sector to degrade environmental standards in this country when we need more national environmental action, not less. Now the Democrats have endorsed and given the government, on the eve of the conference in The Hague on global warming, a piece of legislation which is of the same order. 
This legislation is not only some of the weakest legislation in the world on this matter but also, as Senator Hill said a moment ago, the single most important contribution that we have made—what a yardstick! In fact, it is the only legislative contribution anywhere that adds a penalty clause. There is a single penalty clause in this legislation which was much weaker than the Greens put forward—$1,000 for the Greens. It has been watered down to less than $100 by the Democrats, but it is over the $40 that the government put forward. It is complicated to explain that, but it was to avoid companies simply paying the $40 a unit to get out of their obligation to invest in and get behind solar power and wind power. But what Senator Allison has done on behalf of the Democrats—none of whom join her on the benches today, and I do not blame them—is put through legislation which is going to be a great boost to some of the most environmentally obnoxious corporations in the country. That includes the forestry corporation in Tasmania—which is first cab off the rank, as I explained to the committee earlier today—which wants to put in a 30-megawatt power station to burn woodchips from world heritage value forests in the Huon, Picton and Weld areas to sell through the proposed Basslink onto the markets in Melbourne, Canberra and Sydney as eco-friendly power. The Democrats have voted for that legislation.  
To me this is not so much energy renewable legislation as forest destruction legislation. Beyond that, this legislation will allow major dams to be built in the future without the past scrutiny demanded by federal governments—such installations as the proposal at Derby to concrete up sea outlets to produce electricity, which is now going to get an inherent public subsidy through the certificates the government and the Democrats want to give to them. Senator Allison says, `But there is a good side to this piece of legislation, which is that the dinkum energy renewable people—the solar power producers and the wind power producers—want to get legislation up which is going to help their industry.' But, by accepting woodchips and other forms of non-renewable energy into this legislation, the real players—the solar power people and the wind energy people—are put at a disadvantage because woodchips and biomass are cheaper. It is mass production stuff. They are going to squeeze out the availability of these certificates to the dinkum players who are on the cutting edge, who are bringing in new technology and who are really the hope for the world against global warming. They are getting massive government assistance in countries like Switzerland, Germany and the United States but they are going to be cut out of this deal by the very fact that into this nest has been laid the cuckoo of woodchip power generation. 
Let me give you an example of the scale of what we are talking about. Senator Hill, quite rightly, was extolling earlier today and on the weekend the virtues of two solar power stations to be built in the centre of Australia to produce a couple of megawatts of power. That single woodchip installation burning world heritage forests in Tasmania will produce 30 to 40 megawatts. There is a limit under this legislation on who gets the certificates. It is quite easy to see how that cuckoo in the nest of this otherwise environmentally acceptable legislation is going to eradicate the chickens we really wanted to foster. That is what is happening here, and the Democrats have accepted that. Senator Allison for the Democrats says, `If we didn't do this the government mightn't pass the legislation.' Goodness gracious, if that is the tack to be taken in here, then the government can get the Democrats to pass any piece of legislation it wants. What will be next—education legislation coming down the line, legislation to reduce democratic wherewithal in this country? It does not pass my notice that Senator Murray—who is a stickler for proper democratic processes—brought two pieces of legislation into this place today for honesty and transparency, and he will be getting my support. But later in the afternoon, Senator Allison caves in to Senator Hill and says, `But we'll stop the public from getting information that they deserve to get,' in terms of what has become a scam piece of legislation that is going to foster the interests of corporations which are not in the business of being environmentally friendly; they are in the business of being environmentally destructive.
In particular, at the outset there was a Greens amendment which was supported by the Democrats and Labor Party but was rejected by Prime Minister Howard and his government in the House of Representatives. Let me read these objects at the start of the act. These are objects which would be in the act if the Democrats stood firm but are now being eliminated by Senator Allison's actions. It would say that the objects of the act are to encourage the additional generation of electricity from renewable sources; it would say that the objects of the act are to reduce emission of greenhouse gases; and it would say that the objects of the act are to ensure that renewable energy sources are ecologically sustainable. I ask Senator Allison: which of those objects does she object to? Is it that the Democrats do not believe that this act should encourage additional generation of electricity from renewable resources? Is it that they do not believe the act should pursue the reduction in the emission of greenhouse gases, or is it—through you, Chair—that the Democrats, through Senator Allison, are objecting to the act ensuring that renewable energy sources are ecologically sustainable? It is on that third one that the government's insistence, now supported by the Democrats, is going to wipe that objection out. You cannot burn wild Australian forests and woodlands—the wildlife that lives in them, essentially, is eradicated by the logging processes behind these furnaces being created and the incentive that this bill will give to them nationwide: in New South Wales, in Victoria, in Western Australia, as well as in Tasmania—and claim that to be an ecologically sustainable process. This bill, by Senator Allison's own actions, is now branded as not reaching the standard of `ecologically sustainable', and she has agreed to have that definition removed.  
When you get to the definitions section, which is next, the government did not want to say that this legislation would ensure that it provides for equity within and between generations—in other words, to make sure that the coming generation is not harmed by our actions now. Patently, this bill is going to harm the interests of coming generations; it is going to foster the woodchip industry; it is going to foster ecologically destructive processes like the proposed Derby tidal power station in the Kimberley. 
Another definition under this legislation is that `ecologically sustainable' means the protection of biological diversity—that is, our wildlife and native plant life—and maintains essential processes of life support systems. Well, you cannot allow that anymore in this Democrats-Howard government legislation because it is going to be involved in fostering the destruction of native forests. That is what Senator Allison and the Democrats have done today. When it does get to the Greens amendment—I might give a score here—the Democrats have agreed to hold the line on 1½ out of 12 amendments which they, with the Greens and the Labor Party, sent to the House of Representatives just yesterday. So they have caved in on 10½ out of 12—somewhere between 80 and 90 per cent.
—You are wrong. It is a half out of 12.
—Senator Bolkus is telling me it is a half out of 12. Well, I am being a bit generous. Amendment No. 5 would insist that the government reveal the eligible renewable power sources from which power is intended to be generated so that the public can know. It then said: `And you should say how much.' The Democrats say, `We will push for the woodchippers to have to fess up and tell the public to whom they are selling this power in Sydney, in Canberra, in Melbourne, in Brisbane'—the national grid is being interconnected to this so-called ecologically friendly power coming from the destruction of our forests—`but they will not have to say how much.' Senator Allison is going to have overnight to consider this. I ask that Senator Allison come in tomorrow and explain why not. I ask Senator Allison and the Democrats to hold a caucus meeting and to review this action that has taken place at the back of the Senate today. I believe that this flies in the face of the Democrats' proud record on the environment, from the Franklin days right through the great forest controversies of the eighties and nineties, up until June of last year, when things began to change and sour. I ask the Democrats to consult their membership, their electorate, their constituency and their voters. I ask all the Democrats to consider overnight what is happening in this place. Is any piece of legislation which has ostensibly got an environmental label on it good enough for the Democrats when coming from the Howard government? Or is it important that we stand strong on environmental principle in a world in which global warming is one of the greatest problems of the age? 
I reiterate: under this government Australians have become the worst polluters per head of population—not due to the individuals but due to the forest industries, the transport industries, the coal burning industries—in the world. The government—knowing that—at Kyoto got the best deal in the world out of the rest of the community of nations. We could increase that pollution by 10 per cent over the same period when the rest of the world had to reduce it. Now we know that, due to the lack of action by this government, even that figure has blown out—that this country was producing 18 per cent more by 1998 and that that is likely to run to more than 20 or even 30 per cent rather than 10 per cent by the target date of 2010. And then in comes a piece of legislation like this which is amongst the weakest in the Western world. The Danes are aiming at 20 per cent; this government is aiming at two per cent—and it is going to get a big slab of that out of burning forests in Australia. What sort of legislation is that? What sort of party is the Democrats to give succour to that legislation? What sort of a cave-in have we seen here today? The Democrats must spend tonight reconsidering this cave-in. Senator Lees needs to be consulted—so do the other senators who are mindful of their environmental history as well as this nation's environmental heritage, which is being sold out by this cave-in today.
Progress reported.
