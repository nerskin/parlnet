The government amendments correct a drafting error in the original debt recovery bill. The Parliamentary Library identified this error. The government amendments simply remove the two rules that are currently in the legislation and replace them with a new single rule. A number of provisions are amended to give effect to this approach and thus the number of amendments. Similar amend-ments are also made to the family assistance law and to the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986.

Because of delays in the passage of this bill, including the debate on the amendments to the bill by the ALP and the Democrats, we identified that Centrelink was going to need time to undertake further systems development to reflect any changes. Therefore, it has been necessary to delay implementation to April 2001.

These amendments will broaden the information that is required to be set out in debt notices and increase the time frame for recipients to respond to debt notices. The government, as well as other senators, would be aware of the problems inherent in existing Centrelink correspondence. For many who are in receipt of benefits, forms and letters from Centrelink, they are confusing and often devoid of what would be regarded otherwise as essential information. While some efforts have been made to improve their content and design over time—and I accept that that work has been going on—I think there is still some way to go. 
Notices in respect of debts can simply advise a person that they owe thousands of dollars and must pay the money to Centrelink within 21 days of receiving the notice. Currently, these notices appear like some form of utility bill. More often than not, they provide no proper details of the basis of the alleged debt. The result for the recipients of such notices is generally panic and disbelief. As such, we have moved these amendments to ensure that information about a debt is presented in a way that allows a person to act in an informed manner and provides sufficient time to respond.  
Labor's amendments as a package would ensure that the notice provides (a) the date on which it was issued—that is, the date of the notice; (b) the reason the debt was incurred, including a brief description of the circumstances that led to the debt; (c) the period of time to which the debt relates; (d) the amount of the debt outstanding; (e) the day on which the outstanding amount is due and payable; (f) the availability of repayment options; (g) contact details for inquiries concerning the debt and (h) the person's appeal rights. We think all that information is necessary to improve the system and provide better information and an opportunity for people to respond. 
Labor's amendments will also increase the deadline for response and repayment from 21 days to 28 days. That brings it more into line with most other notices to pay bills, fines and debts in other arenas and allows a bit more time for people to be able to respond to, as I say, what are quite often large debt notices. Often these debt notices, obviously, go to people who are not in the best of economics circumstances anyway. Many of them have not necessarily had a lot of education or have problems with literacy et cetera. So we think more time and more information will improve the process and empower those receiving the debts to be aware of their options. We think this improves the bill. I commend it to the Senate.

"Newman, Sen Jocelyn",LP,2000-11-29,"—Senator Evans just referred to (h), which I think he would recognise has already been taken out. I wanted to make that clear—(h) is not included. If I can immediately give the response of the government to these amendments, as far as the insertion of additional requirements into the debt notices is concerned, the amendment is accepted, even though it is unnecessary as it merely legislates for matters that Centrelink includes in debt notices as a matter of sound administrative practice.",SENATE,<title>FAMILY AND COMMUNITY SERVICES AND VETERANS' AFFAIRS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (DEBT RECOVERY) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2000-11-29,"—I speak on behalf of the Democrats to Senator Evans's amendment and to amendments circulated in my name a few weeks ago, which are very similar in nature to the opposition's amendments and go to the issue of debt notices. Whilst I note the minister's explanation and welcome her statement about this being already part of Centrelink practice, I think it is appropriate to note that this is a significant issue. It may seem very administrative to prescribe the detail of debt notices but, as Senator Evans has said, these notices often arrive in a circumstance which causes a lot of concern to people. To get a letter out of nowhere saying that you have a debt of thousands of dollars and that you have to pay it within 21 days or else—it is worded better than that, I accept—is how many people perceive the arrival of these notices. That obviously can cause a lot of angst for people who oftentimes, almost by definition, are low income earners. So it is important that it be a requirement that these sorts of details are here. The fact that people react like this now to the way debt notices are currently set out suggests to me that perhaps they are not as clear and specific as they should be and as has been prescribed by these amendments.
A not uncommon piece of feedback I receive from people from financial counselling services and welfare centres—they deal with people who are on the receiving end of debt notices all the time and with welfare recipients, particularly people who have been subject to a debt notice and are trying to wrestle with overpayments—is that it is a common story that the notices cause difficulty in terms of their detail and the way they are constructed. 
It is worth re-emphasising that almost by definition many Centrelink customers are people who do not necessarily have a lot of dough. In many cases, they may have limited literacy or poor English comprehension and may need to seek assistance in dealing with debt notices from agencies and from organisations such as those I have just mentioned, which are not necessarily overly well resourced either. It is something which can take a bit of time to seek assistance with. People can have poor health, limited mobility or lack of transportation. With regard to those issues, I think it is important to allow enough time as well. The main difference between the Democrat amendments and the ALP one, as I read it, is that the ALP amendment extends it to 28 days after the date of the notice and ours extended that further to six weeks. Given that the minister has indicated her support or willingness to accept Senator Evans's amendment, we are certainly willing to accept his amendment as a constructive one—it is obviously a constructive one as it is so similar to the one the Democrats had foreshadowed. I think it would have been preferable to have a little longer time. The difficulty of the department having to wait six weeks or so, I think, is fairly minuscule compared to the benefit to the public and the individual person in waiting six weeks. I think that would have been a better outcome but, nonetheless, we welcome the extension of time that is contained in the ALP amendment.

It does not in fact. It says, `If you have a problem about paying this, please contact us.' The letter is not unfair in terms of indicating that people can make arrangements.

"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2000-11-29,"—I was going to use the time that Senator Bartlett spoke to those amendments to work out what I was doing here. Senator Bartlett is far too quick today. I will formally move these amendments but, as I understand it, the government might be voting for some and not others, so we might have to actually group them separately. I will come to that in a minute. I think I will formally move, say, (2) to (5), speak to the general approach and then get some guidance from the minister as to how she would like to have them put and how the Democrats might like to have them put.

These are all issues that go to interest on debt. The ALP's amendments seek to ensure penalty interest and administrative charges are not levelled at individuals who receive a debt through administrative error. Labor has moved these amendments in fairness to those who have been inflicted with a debt, thanks to the administrative bungle of someone else. These people have not sought in any way to gain a benefit to which they were not entitled. They have done no wrong and have received payments in good faith. We think there is quite a difference in terms of the way they ought to be handled and that to apply some of the interest and administrative charges on these people is quite unfair. Whilst Labor has subsequent amendments to deal with administrative debts, we believe those who receive debts through no fault of their own should be given broader latitude to repay than those who receive a debt due to their own actions. We believe it is most unfair that the government would contemplate penalising those who have not done any wrong and are in fact the victims of another person's oversight or error. That is the distinction we seek to make.
We are also moving amendments which will ensure that subsequent notices that are served on debts, which have not been wholly paid, indicate that the remainder of the debt is due on the 28th rather than the 21st day after notice before penalty interest or administrative charges are applied to the debt. In line with the amendments we have just carried, we think that is a more reasonable time frame. Amendments (5) and (16) deal with protecting the appeal rights of individuals and make it clear that interest on a debt and administrative charge cannot be applied to a debt if the decision is under initial appeal by an authorised review officer and is pending an outcome. So those amendments seek to protect those individuals from interest on a debt or the administrative charge while their decision is being reviewed or appealed. 
That is a package of amendments which we think, again, makes the bill fairer and deals particularly with the question of those who have ended up with a debt through no fault of their own. We think there is a rationale for treating them differently. I understand the government may not accept that rationale, but we are constantly receiving complaints from customers of Centrelink who find that, through no fault of their own, they incur a debt. Obviously that puts them in a difficult position very often in terms of having to repay the debt. We are not saying that they should not have to meet their obligations, but it is a very different situation if you end up $2,000 or $3,000 in debt through no fault of your own because of an overpayment or an oversight. You have probably spent the money, you have incurred costs, you have continued to live on the basis of that income. To then be told that was income you were not entitled to and you are to repay it is often a huge burden. We think that, in addition to the difficulties that people will face when having to repay that debt, to add interest and administrative charges on them is unreasonable. We may have to tick-tack around the chamber in terms of how people want to handle the amendments and which ones need to be grouped together.",SENATE,<title>FAMILY AND COMMUNITY SERVICES AND VETERANS' AFFAIRS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (DEBT RECOVERY) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Newman, Sen Jocelyn",LP,2000-11-29,"—May I expedite matters by responding before Senator Bartlett. Madam Temporary Chairman, I draw your attention to the fact that amendments (2) to (5), (15) to (18) and (25) to (27) are the same amendments to three different parts of the act. When I respond to amendments (2) to (5), I am dealing with (2) to (5), (15) to (18) and (25) to (27). I suggest that, rather than go through the issues three times, that is a logical way to proceed. In that context, when I give the chamber an indication of the government's response to amendments (2) to (5), it will have the government's response to the other two sets of amendments. 
I make it very clear to the chamber—and I think this is something which Senator Bartlett does not seem to have registered, and I do not quite know why—that people in receipt of a social security payment are not subject to the interest and administrative charge scheme. We are talking about people who have been on payments and who are now out of payments and in the work force. That is a very important matter to be made clear. Secondly, the interest and the administrative charge are only going to apply where a person has failed to make any arrangements to repay the debt—any arrangements at all. So, first of all, we are talking about people who are no longer on payments—they are out of payments and in work—and, secondly, these charges will only apply after they have failed to make any arrangements to repay the debt, despite the best endeavours of Centrelink. Over three months will elapse before these charges may be applied.
The scheme is designed to encourage debtors to contact Centrelink and to enter into or continue with voluntary arrangements to repay the debts. Voluntary arrangements are the preferred method of debt recovery. Repayments are made at a rate which will not put people into hardship. The government proposes to reduce the interest charge from the current punitive 20 per cent—that is the current legislated rate—to the lower deeming rate of 3.5 per cent. I think the government has been very reasonable in all these things. This will not apply to people who are on payments—only to people who are now off payments and who have failed to make any arrangements to repay the debt. Three months will have elapsed before the charges are applied. We would prefer voluntary arrangements. The repayments are not being made at a rate which will put people in hardship. We are reducing the punitive interest rate that currently applies of 20 per cent down to 3.5 per cent. All of those things are reasonable. Therefore, in that context, the government opposes the first amendment.
I turn now to the amendment to section 1229A to increase the notice period from 21 to 28 days. The government is prepared to support the increase in the notice period to 28 days. The social security law does provide for notices to be complied with within 14 days and our bill gives a concession to this usual practice by providing that the debtor enter into an arrangement to pay the debt within 21 days after the date of the notice. However, as I say, the government is prepared to support the increase in the notice period to 28 days.
Amendments (3) to (5) relate to interest on debt—the interest regime is delayed where a debtor lodges a request for a review. The government is not prepared to support the ALP amendments because they would allow a debtor to put off entering into an arrangement by asking for a review. That could lead to an increase in the number of frivolous reviews, which I do not think anybody in this chamber would believe was desirable. It would unnecessarily delay the application of the interest provisions. As I say, again, those provisions relate only to people who are no longer on payments and in the income support system and who have refused, or neglected, over a considerable period to make the repayments for which they are responsible. I cannot believe that the chamber would regard that as being unreasonable. I also believe that the chamber would regard the danger of frivolous reviews to be something that we should take into serious account. It is on those grounds that the government will oppose amendments (3) to (5).",SENATE,<title>FAMILY AND COMMUNITY SERVICES AND VETERANS' AFFAIRS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (DEBT RECOVERY) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2000-11-29,"—I wish to speak to the amendments moved by Senator Evans and also to the ones I foreshadowed on 8 November. The running sheet provides a running commentary for us in relation to these amendments. I congratulate the clerks and staff on melding our amendments. Some of the amendments foreshadowed by the Democrats are identical and others are similar to the ones that Senator Evans has moved and obviously in that context we are quite happy to accept the ones that have been formally moved by Senator Evans. The sheet states that Democrat amendments (8), (9), (22) and (31) are in conflict with the opposition's (4), (5) and (18). I recall the minister saying that the government are willing to accept the amendment—I think it was amendment (4)—that extended the notice period to 28 days. Given that we have already done the 28 days and put in something else, in the spirit of reasonableness that I always try to bring to such debates, we are willing to accept that amendment and not proceed. 
There is one area where there is some difference which I would like to explore further before we vote on the issue. I will speak slightly more broadly on the issue and respond to some of the remarks of the minister. I accept that this is a case that applies to people who are now no longer on benefits. That usually, although not always, means that they have got a job or a payment from somewhere. It does not mean they are necessarily swimming in money. It does not even necessarily mean they have a regular or adequate income stream. As I am sure all senators would be aware, many people who move off social security payments do so in a circumstance where they go into irregular work or low paid work or perhaps a permanent job but different hours and different amounts of work each week and different levels of money. That is a very common circumstance. We are still dealing with people who are not necessarily terribly well off. I acknowledge the point the minister made about the danger of one of these amendments providing an incentive for extra frivolous reviews and appeals through the appeals system. I think that is a reasonable point to make, but it needs to be balanced against the reality of what people face in these circumstances. I think to be able to charge interest on a debt that is being disputed is not desirable in principle, despite that risk of possibly providing incentives for people to delay paying interest because of having things reviewed.
Administrative errors do occur reasonably frequently and are unavoidable, particularly with the complexity of our system and particularly in areas like family payments. In those cases people can receive moneys in excess of their entitlement and often are not aware they have been overpaid; by definition, the department is not aware they are being overpaid. I have raised in this place, both in debate on previous social security legislation and in question time a month or so back, a recent Administrative Appeals Tribunal ruling that a family payment debt was incorrectly raised by the department. The AAT ruled the decision making process to decide that that was an overpayment to be in error. That ruling only applied to that particular appeal, but there are any number of other overpayments in the system, which have been raised and which people are probably paying back now, that were raised using that process the appeals tribunal has now decided was wrong. I am still awaiting further information from the minister on this. The department may not be legally obliged to review those cases but I think they are morally obliged to review them and see whether those incorrectly raised overpayments should be reconsidered. It would be useful to know how many people are in that circumstance. I know the minister committed at the time to seek more information on that and I realise these things can take a bit of time, but it is germane to the issue we are talking about now.
The minister frequently provides statistics in relation to debt recovery and overpayments, which are often presented in the context of stopping fraud. None of us here support fraud, of course, and we none of us here support people not being required to repay money they were not entitled to, whether through administrative error or innocent mistake or anything. But the figures that the minister tables are helpful in providing information of how many of those cases are in the area of family payments. Of those only a small percentage end up in the fraud basket. Many, many of the cases are people who have been overpaid either through their own mistake or their inability to correctly forecast their income—which is pretty hard for a lot of people to do, particularly these days with fluctuating levels of work. There are a lot of people who have an overpayment raised through those circumstances without any intent of their own, as well as through administrative error such as in the case of the AAT ruling that I have just referred to. As I have said, the department makes errors from time to time—and that is not a criticism, because we all make errors from time to time. 
The point is that it is unfair to impose interest on this category of debts. People who did not contribute to the circumstance of the excess payments should not be further penalised by having to pay more than the amount of the original overpayment because they are unable to pay within the time frame set by the department. I acknowledge the minister said that this only applies where they have not been able to come to an arrangement or where the repayment regime has broken down, but there is still the basic principle of people being charged interest on a debt that they incurred through someone else's error. I am not saying they should not pay it back. All of us, if we get paid money we were not entitled to, through our salaries or whatever, have to pay it back as we should, regardless of whose fault it was, but I think paying interest on that is undesirable. I acknowledge the positives in the government's legislation—as I always try to do—of reducing the level of overpayments; that is a welcome move. But a key part of these amendments goes to the payment of interest on debts incurred through departmental error.
The other key point is when people are seeking a review of a decision through the authorised review officer or by external appeal to tribunals. In the Democrats' view, it is unfair that interest should be applied to a debt at that time. People are appealing against the debt being there in the first place. Surely the least that can be done is not have interest raised on it while that is happening. I think the minister would acknowledge that very few people appeal decisions just for a second bite of the cherry and rarely is the appeal frivolous. That does not mean that all appeals are successful; obviously many of them are not. But I am sure the minister would strongly defend people's right to appeal and have their decisions reviewed. It is a complex act. Errors can be made by everybody; full facts need to be involved and interpretations need to be made as correctly as possible. So appealing of decisions, including ones like overpayments, is very important.
To be paying interest on that overpayment while you are appealing it is, in the Democrats' view, also inappropriate. People cannot make the tribunals speed up their case. I am advised that at the moment appeals through the SSAT take about 10 weeks, and if cases are appealed on to the AAT the time frame is about nine months. People cannot speed that up. It can be quite a long time. If you have the initial review internally as well, which is usually very speedy, you can be looking at a period of about a year when you have some dispute, and you will be paying interest that whole time. We think that is inappropriate. About 30 per cent of decisions are set aside by tribunals, meaning that in at least one-third of the cases the customer is correct. People appeal all sorts of things; they are not all to do with overpayments, but some of them are, such as the AAT case I have referred to already. 
The threat of financial penalty for exercising a right of appeal is, in the Democrats' view, contrary to natural justice and fairness. The amendments propose that, where a person has exercised and finalised their right of appeal, interest will not be added to the debt during that time. The key component of the opposition amendment that we do have concerns with—because we do not think it goes far enough—goes to the very point that I have been talking about. The ALP amendment, as I understand it, allows for interest to be applied three months after an authorised review officer decision, by which time the SSAT appeal may be under way but not completed. Our view is that interest should not be applied until the whole appeal process has been completed, assuming, obviously, that the matter is resolved in the department's favour. That is the key part, and I think that is in Democrat amendments (9), (22) and (31). 
The Democrats are supportive of the opposition amendments, although we are concerned that (5), (18) and (25) do not go far enough. The principle is appropriate, but it should be applied more strongly. If, like the Democrats, you accept the principle—the principle that, if people are not required to pay interest on a debt that they are appealing, particularly if it arose through administrative error by the department, the appeal should apply to appeals through the whole process—it is appropriate to support these amendments and to support Democrat amendments (9), (22) and (31), which I have not moved yet, rather than ALP amendments (5), (18) and (25).

"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2000-11-29,"—I want to make one quick remark to indicate that it is not quite that simple, because I think the Democrats are voting for some but not others. Senator Bartlett certainly made that clear in his speech. But I will leave the question of which amendment that applies to to a better mind than mine. I would think it would be a lot quicker if we just roll through them. I do not think anyone is going to divide on them. At least that way, if we went one, two, three, four, we would all know where we stood. I am open to guidance from the chair. As long as the chair knows what we are doing, I will go with the flow.
In terms of the issue raised by Senator Bartlett, our amendment seeks to provide some protection during an initial appeal or review period for the person to be protected against some penalty. I suppose ours is halfway between Senator Bartlett's position, which is to say that they ought to be protected throughout the appeals processes, and the government's position, which is to say that they ought to incur the penalty. We are saying that it is a reasonable proposition that during the initial appeal period they be protected from the penalty of interest applying. The system envisages people being allowed to pursue appeal rights. We ought not to penalise them for that. We do not want to have a situation where people feel that they are unable to pursue their legal rights because of fear of the penalty of that. I know it is a balancing act, but it seems to me that, at least in the initial appeal process, people ought not to be fearful of appealing because of the cost they may incur if they are unsuccessful. It is a question of access to justice and the cost of that. We are a bit concerned that there is some suggestion that people may be deterred because of the fear that, if they lose, they have incurred extra costs. 
We have prepared our amendment (6) to provide some protection during the initial appeal period. We are not prepared to go as far as Senator Bartlett proposes, but that is because, as I say, it is a question of balance about when you say that penalty ought to be applied. I understand what Senator Bartlett is saying. Our proposition is that that initial period be exempt. As I say, it is a question of balancing interests.",SENATE,<title>FAMILY AND COMMUNITY SERVICES AND VETERANS' AFFAIRS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (DEBT RECOVERY) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2000-11-29,"—Madam Chair, you will be pleased to know it is not going to be as complicated as Senator Evans might fear. Given Labor's insistence, despite my reasonable arguments, on pursuing their approach, obviously that is better than nothing from the point of view of the Democrats. To ensure that we do not knock each other out and end up with no reflection of the principle we have been outlining, of people being able to be not charged interest while they are having a decision reviewed, we would be willing to reluctantly support those amendments, which I think are (5), (18) and (25). Certainly we would be supporting all the other amendments in any case, as they were identical or similar to ones the Democrats had already circulated.

These amendments seek to codify the circumstances in which a determination may be made that interest is not payable. There may be circumstances in which an individual is unable to repay a debt as agreed. This may include circumstances beyond their control. It is only fair that these circumstances are taken into consideration before there is a determination that penalty interest or the administrative charge is imposed. I understand this determination is currently outlined in a disallowable instrument; our amendment merely seeks to include the reasonable excuse provision in the primary legislation. So it is an attempt to move it from the regulations into the primary legislation to codify the circumstances where the determination may be made that interest is not payable. That is the intention of this group of amendments. I think the government is happy with that, but I will let the minister respond.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2000-11-29,"—I do not need to move amendments (11), (24) and (35) because they are opposing sections. Either way, we deal with these sections together. These amendments deal with the issue of the administrative charge, which is also an important issue of principle and one that, as I was saying yesterday in our brief discussion on this bill, can potentially affect many members of the Australian community. The proposed section that is in the bill, section 1229AB, attempts to reintroduce an administrative charge on debts. This imposition of administrative charges on debts is, in the Democrats' view, punitive and will further push disadvantaged Australians into debt. A person's inability to comply with a repayment arrangement, because almost by definition owing to their financial circumstances they have been unable to comply with a repayment arrangement, should not incur them an extra penalty.
As I said earlier, many debts are due to administrative error, and it is unavoidable with the complexity of our system, particularly with family payments. The bill means that, with debts of this nature that are due to administrative error by the department, the client actually repays more than the original overpayment, essentially meaning they have to pay extra for a Centrelink mistake. It causes inconvenience for people to have to repay money that they were not entitled to. It causes inconvenience for people if they have to pay interest on that money. There should not be the extra burden on them of paying an administrative charge for the so-called privilege of repaying that money.
Many thousands of Australians are already being breached by Centrelink annually and are already suffering financial penalties. Adding an administrative charge should they also incur an overpayment through administrative error is, in the Democrats' view, excessive. We are dealing with people who are, on average, not amongst the highest income earners. I am sure all senators would know that many of those people who are in regimes of having to repay overpayments—clients of financial counselling services, et cetera—already find it very difficult. Even the principle of an administrative charge being imposed is something that the Democrats do not support. We oppose outright the imposition of an administrative charge on debts on social security and vet-erans overpayments in these circumstances. 
I note that the opposition amendments that are foreshadowed again appear to take a middle line. They do not oppose the charge but seek simply to drop it to $50 rather than the $100 that is proposed in the bill. Obviously, if the Democrats' desire to remove these sections is not successful, we would see $50 as less of an imposition than $100, but I urge Senator Evans to at least give consideration to the principle that it is not appropriate for administrative charges to be paid on debts that have arisen through administrative error on the part of the department. I do not think it is in tune with the Australian principle of a fair go, apart from anything else. It is really excessive and just one step too far.  
As I have said before a number of times, nobody quibbles with the need to repay overpayments that people were not entitled to, whether it is through departmental error or their own mistake in terms of forecasting their income or not getting information in on time and those sorts of things. But to make people pay an administrative fee or even to have any potential for people to pay an administrative fee for a departmental mistake is simply unfair. I know budgets are always important for the department, and that is appropriate; it is public money. But, comparing the resources of the department and how much they may struggle with having to wear the administrative costs with the resources of people who have to make repayments, I think the balance should be very much in favour of the general public in these circumstances. So the Democrats oppose these sections of the bill that seek to impose the administrative charge. I urge Senator Evans to give consideration to doing likewise. If he is unable to take that position, the Democrats would support the opposition proposal to lower the charge to $50 as a fall-back which I would not call acceptable but is probably the best that we can achieve.",SENATE,<title>FAMILY AND COMMUNITY SERVICES AND VETERANS' AFFAIRS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (DEBT RECOVERY) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Newman, Sen Jocelyn",LP,2000-11-29,"—For the record, the government opposes these amendments. I point out that the administrative charge would apply only after a period of at least 112 days, which is a pretty reasonable length of time, I would have thought, for anybody. If you put together the low rate of interest, which is going to be 3.5 per cent, and the removal of the administrative charge, I do not think you have got sufficient encouragement to have people enter into an agreement when they have already had 112 days. I remind the Senate once again that we are talking about people who are no longer on social security payments. It is not unreasonable, I believe, to have the administrative charge with the lower interest rate. That would be a very good combination. I remind you again that it is not going to apply until at least 112 days. The government sees no need to endorse these amendments.",SENATE,<title>FAMILY AND COMMUNITY SERVICES AND VETERANS' AFFAIRS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (DEBT RECOVERY) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2000-11-29,"—I feel a bit churlish today because Senator Bartlett has been very cooperative and the minister has been very cooperative and I have been insisting on my amendments. I think the minister has answered some of Senator Bartlett's criticisms. Labor's view is that we cannot support the Democrat proposition to knock these measures out altogether. Those are measures that have to be looked at as part of a package, and the minister, I think rightly, makes the point that the reduction in the interest rate is an important measure in terms of reducing the harshness of the penalty on some of the people who may be affected, and that is a very big part of Labor's thinking on its approach to this bill. 
It is also the case that we do support the government's intention and the need to encourage individuals to enter into repayment agreements and stick to them. We have sought to put other protections in. We have carried the amendments that seek to differentiate administrative debts brought about through no fault of the clients themselves and we have dealt with questions about financial hardship and appeal rights. I think the government is trying to put in a different system with reduced interest rates, and this administrative charge is part of that approach. 
We are not prepared to go down the Democrat path of abolishing that altogether because, as the minister says, the charge is for people who are back off benefits who have had a lengthy period of time to respond, and it is a question of making sure there is some inducement for them to actually stick to arrangements to repay the debts. It is a balancing act again, but we think it is not unreasonable to adopt this sort of approach. Where we differ with the government is that we take the view—these things are always a bit arbitrary—that the $100 is too steep. Those affected will only just be re-entering employment and will obviously have a lot of financial pressures. Many people find it difficult to repay debts quickly, and we think that a $50 limit on the admin charge would be less onerous. It would still have a penalty and still have an inducement effect but without being quite as severe. These are subjective judgments, but I am foreshadowing that, if the decision to oppose the sections is not supported, then we will be moving those amendments to effectively reduce the administrative charge from $100 to $50. As I say, that is done in the light of the other changes the government has made and the changes which, with the support of the Democrats, we have been able to achieve in terms of treatment of administrative debts incurred through no fault of the individual.  
We think our approach is a better balance. Obviously the minister prefers the $100 charge. We think that is a bit steep and we are not prepared to support that level at this stage, but we do support the intent of making sure there is some inducement for people to stick to repayment agreements. I know that under the current arrangements it is hard to have people not continually seek to renegotiate. While this is for a small number of people, at the end of the process you do have to have some means by which you force that to occur. 
I make the point to Senator Bartlett that it is about those people who, at the end of a quite lengthy process, with all the protections which the government had and which we have strengthened today, were not prepared to stick to repayment agreements. We think the administrative charge is then reasonable, so we support the principle. We are not prepared to be quite as expensive as the government in its approach. I thought we would have this debate now rather than do it twice, but we will be supporting the retention of the sections and not supporting the Democrat motion to remove them. I foreshadow that then I will move my amendments which seek to change the charge from $100 to $50. I apologise to Senator Bartlett, who has been most cooperative, but I am not supporting his changes today—maybe next time around.",SENATE,<title>FAMILY AND COMMUNITY SERVICES AND VETERANS' AFFAIRS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (DEBT RECOVERY) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2000-11-29,"—We can always live in hope. I noted the arguments that the minister and Senator Evans have put forward that people have nearly four months to make arrangements and fix things up, and that this is some sort of extra inducement. I still think the point needs to be made that just because people are not on payments anymore does not mean they have heaps of money rolling around the place. Overpayments can be quite sizeable, through no fault of people or any deliberate deceit on the part of people. Many Australians already struggle very much with the burden of the overpayments regime that is put on them. 
If we are looking at the power in this situation, let us not forget that, while there are lots of legal protections in terms of appeals et cetera which are very important, there are opportunities to negotiate and there is assistance through welfare rights centres for people to negotiate with the department, the department is not exactly a shrinking violet in relation to overpayments. It pursues them very vigorously. That is not necessarily inappropriate but it is not as though people necessarily have a lot of say. At the end of the day they have to repay the money, as they should, and that often makes it very difficult for people. That is just a fact of life.
It is not a case of people deliberately defaulting on overpayments; most of the time it is people just finding it too much of a burden. All of us know that many in the Australian community struggle with financial burdens at the moment for all sorts of reasons. That is always going to be the case, sad as it may be, but the basic principle here is still adding an extra administrative fee on people in those circumstances, particularly in cases where it is not in dispute that the debt is raised through no fault of their own. The department already has widespread powers, as reflected in this bill. Already, even without this bill, it has widespread powers to dive into people's bank accounts to retrieve money if those bank accounts are under their control. I saw reports recently of the department—incorrectly as it turns out, with the department repaying the money and apologising, so I just do not want to tackle the department in relation to this—trying to access money in a child's trust account because it was assumed that the account was under the control of the person who had the debt raised against them. These things may be appropriate and may be the only way to go, but they are still an indication that the department is not exactly a shrinking violet about these things; it can go in pretty hard. 
The department may need to get the money back and it is still appropriate for people to repay—I am not saying it is not—but the principle here is that I do not think people need another $50 or $100 charge hanging over their head. I do not think that is why people default on overpayments. I think it is because in the vast majority of circumstances people find it hard to repay, and I think that the basic reality is the difficulty that people in the Australian community have in struggling with their financial situation for all sorts of reasons. Having to repay an overpayment in any circumstance, even if it is incorrectly paid through your employment—that always has to be repaid of course, as it should be—is still hard. It is hard to have to repay money if it is a sizeable debt incurred for any reason. In the Democrats' view, people do not need the sword of a $100 threat hanging over their head to enter into repayments. In the vast majority of cases, people find it hard to meet a repayment regime because they are in difficult financial circumstances, and that reality needs to be recognised. There is already enough power for the department. I do not think they need this extra bit to clobber people into submission.

"Newman, Sen Jocelyn",LP,2000-11-29,"—Sadly, the government are not able to support these either. We would have really considered supporting them if it had not been for the fact that the opposition's amendment No. 2 has impacted on these amendments. Amendment No. 2 related to interest not applying if a debt was due to administrative error. What has happened is that now there will be a selective approach to debtors. We were prepared to consider the opposition's amendments here on the charge being reduced from $100 to $50 if in fact that had applied to all debtors. But, because the opposition's previous amendment has gone through, it now means that there will be different treatment of debtors. We are not prepared to change the administrative charge arrangements in those circumstances. It is a pity because we might have been able to get a resolution that was a compromise position, but that looks as if it is now not possible. I do not suppose I have really got anything much more to say than what I have already said on the Democrats' amendments.",SENATE,<title>FAMILY AND COMMUNITY SERVICES AND VETERANS' AFFAIRS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (DEBT RECOVERY) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2000-11-29,"—As I indicated previously, I am not sure I would see this as an acceptable fall back. If $100 is an unfair thing to have hanging over people's heads, $50 is an unfair thing, from the Democrats' point of view. But it is a smaller threat to have hanging, so without a great deal of enthusiasm we support the amendments.

(9)	Schedule 1, item 16, page 13 (line 4), omit ""A debt"", substitute ""Subject to subsection (2), a debt"".
 (10)	Schedule 1, item 16, page 13 (after line 16), at the end of section 1230C, add:
(2)	Subject to subsection (3), a debt due to the Commonwealth under this Act is recoverable by means of a method mentioned in paragraph (1)(d) or (e) only if the Commonwealth:
(a)	has first sought to recover the debt by means of a method mentioned in paragraph (1)(a), (b) or (c); and 
(b)	can establish that the person who owes the debt has failed to enter into a reasonable arrangement to repay the debt.
(3)	If the Secretary determines that recovery of the debt by means of a method mentioned in paragraph (1)(a), (b) or (c) is not appropriate, having regard to the circumstances of the case, paragraph (2)(a) does not apply.
These amendments seek to codify the circumstances where legal proceedings and garnisheeing action may be commenced to ensure such action does not take place in inappropriate circumstances. Senators would be aware that this year's Ombudsman's report outlined circumstances where there had been overzealous action in terms of garnisheeing, particularly the incidence of garnisheeing of a child's bank account.
Without reducing the necessity for flexibility in the most appropriate debt recovery method, Labor's amendments set out clearly the methods, such as repayment by instalment, that must be considered before rash decisions to garnishee or implement legal proceedings. Basically, we are seeking to codify steps to ensure that action in seeking to deal with debts is not overzealous or overharsh. The government's bill sets out a means by which the debt may be recovered, and our amendments seek to ensure that they give priority to those less harsh measures and those measures which deal with encouraging repayment by instalments under an agreement rather than those that go straight down the path of legal proceedings or garnishee notices. We do not seek to prevent that happening when it is warranted, but we want to try to make sure that we do not get overzealous action in pursuing debts, which we have seen on some occasions—sometimes even in circumstances where the debt proved not to be of the same amount first claimed by Centrelink. We think this is an important protection. It codifies procedures which make legal proceedings the last step and which encourage Centrelink to pursue more reasonable endeavours in the first place, particularly with regard to entering into arrangements with the client. We think it is an improvement to the bill, and we hope it is supported by the Senate.",SENATE,<title>FAMILY AND COMMUNITY SERVICES AND VETERANS' AFFAIRS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (DEBT RECOVERY) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2000-11-29,"—I am not used to hearing the government being so accepting; I am glad to hear it. As that is the case, I do not need to rise up in righteous indignation about how crucial these amendments are because obviously the government already knows that, but they are worth speaking to briefly. As was indicated, the Democrats have similar amendments; as has been the case throughout this debate, our amendments are actually better than the ALP amendments, but we will live with their amendments. 
The issue is an important one and it goes to recognising that in most of these cases you are dealing with people who are struggling financially. I think it is important—and the fact that we are all accepting the amendments indicates that no-one is disagreeing with that, so I am not presenting this as a criticism—to remember that this deal affects real people in the Australian community. As we all know, many in the community are struggling. I do not want to revisit the debate that I had on the previous amendments, but even $50 is a hell of a lot and a big stress if you do not have much money or any money. The threat of a $50 fee is not a big stress for someone on our level of income, but for many in the Australian community who are, for whatever reason, struggling with their financial circumstances, $50 is a lot of money.
On the issue of debt recovery, the same sort of point needs to be acknowledged. I accept that some people will try to avoid repayment, but people on the whole do not default on overpayments deliberately; they do it because they are struggling financially. If you do not have a lot of money, it is hard work to have to repay a debt. As I referred to before, we have seen circumstances where the department, in my view, has been overzealous. We are dealing with a huge number of staff throughout the country, and obviously they will make judgments.  
It is probably worth clarifying the reality of how this whole area of debt recovery works. Centrelink staff have to try to negotiate and to work out the best way of recovering the overpayment—and it is appropriate to recover overpayments that people were not entitled to. The staff have to do this in a way which ideally causes minimum hardship to the person involved. The Centrelink person basically has the power at the end of the day to determine how much, how quickly and where from. When issues of discretion and negotiation are being handled by large numbers of people—I do not know the total numbers, but I would not be surprised if there were thousands throughout Australia that make these decisions on a regular basis—sometimes you will have individuals who are overzealous about it. That is human reality and human nature. As I have said many times, I have a great deal of respect for Centrelink staff, who have to do a very difficult job. There should be a few more of them, I would suggest—then they would be able to do an even better job. It is human nature in some circumstances to be overzealous. 
Without trying to sound like we are moving into some sort of pseudo-Marxian power analysis, this issue deals with people who are not in a powerful position. They are in a weak position, and the department is in an incredibly strong position—that is why these amendments are important. I am pleased that the government is accepting them, because they do add that extra requirement on the department to seek other options before it goes to the last resort. That is a crucial point and part of why these amendments are welcome and why the government is accepting them. The minister will say that the department always seeks other options before going to the last resort, but these amendments will ensure that. The fact that the minister is quite happy to accept them indicates, not just in terms of the legislation but in terms of how she would like the department to be administered, that it is not always done in that way. As I said, human nature being what it is, there is always the prospect, despite the best intentions of whoever is the minister of the day, that the exploration of other options will not happen; these amendments will ensure that it does.

These amendments require the secretary to give 28 days notice if they wish to advise of a change in the repayment arrangements. As I understand it, currently no notice is required. We went for a 28-day period earlier in some amendments that were carried; we think the current situation could lead to potential hardship on the individual. As the minister is going to support these amendments, I had better leave it there.

"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2000-11-29,"—I move opposition amendment No. 13:
(13)	Schedule 1, page 17 (after line 26), after item 30, insert:
30A  Subsection 1237A(1)
Repeal the subsection (including the note), substitute:
	(1)	Subject to subsection (1A), the Secretary must waive the right to recover the proportion of a debt that is attributable to an administrative error made by the Commonwealth if the debtor received in good faith the payment or payments that gave rise to that proportion of the debt.
Followers of social security debates in the Senate will be much happier now because I think we are going to have a good old-fashioned argument about this amendment, and civility and agreement will go out the window. Senators behind me were getting concerned that I had lost my touch, moving amendments that the government could agree to, which was ruining my reputation. I understand the government is not going to support this amendment, so we are back to a more natural state of affairs.
This amendment seeks to broaden the coverage of section 1237A(1) of the Social Security Act that deals with the waiver of a debt arising from error. It will ensure that all debts or the proportion of a debt that is attributable to an administrative error are required to be waived if not identified within the specified period. This particular provision has been amended by both the former Labor government and the current coalition government. The last time the issue was discussed, the coalition intended to remove the discretion of waiver. Understandably, individuals receive debts through no fault of their own. Information may have been recorded incorrectly by Centrelink and an incorrect payment may have resulted. In the opposition's view, it would be unfair to raise a substantial debt against these people, given that they received the payments in good faith. 
As I understand it, the section requires that such debts be waived if they are not detected within six weeks of the initial incorrect payment. However, for this provision to have effect, the debts must be due solely to administrative error. In essence, an individual cannot be seen to have contributed in some way to the debt, no matter how slight. There are clearly circumstances where that is unfair. An example is where an individual declares earnings which may affect their payment, but they are recorded incorrectly by Centrelink or another agency. This may lead to an ongoing payment of benefit above that to which the person is technically entitled, without the individual noticing that to be the case.  
Subsequently, a debt may be raised outside the existing six-week time frame because of the inclusion of the word `solely' in the current waiver provisions. This is the case because a notice may have been sent regarding their payment adjustment and the information used to calculate the changed rate of payment. The receipt of this notice and apparent duty to report the error means that the individual may have contributed to the ongoing overpayment. Thus the debt would not be due solely to an administrative error. The reference to the word `solely' was originally drafted under the Labor administration, but our experience has been that it is proving to be too restrictive. In light of the fact that the coalition have subsequently tightened the section, we believe there is a need to make it fairer.
The change we are proposing will not mean that those who deliberately let an error go unchecked get off scot-free. That is clearly not the intention. The section's reference to the term `received in good faith' will ensure that, where there is a substantial error, there is obviously a reasonable expectation that it would be noticed and Centrelink advised. We believe current case law regarding this provision supports this interpretation. We think this would be a useful addition to protect those persons who incur debts through no fault of their own and that the use of a broader interpretation would provide some relief to those who genuinely are not at fault when incurring debts through overpayments. Experience has shown that this would protect some of those clients who have been getting into difficulty through no fault of their own. We think the interpretation would provide more room for those people's interests to be protected.",SENATE,<title>FAMILY AND COMMUNITY SERVICES AND VETERANS' AFFAIRS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (DEBT RECOVERY) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Newman, Sen Jocelyn",LP,2000-11-29,"—I am sorry to disappoint the Senate, but the government opposes this amendment. It is a perplexing amendment. The opposition amendment would change a provision that Labor itself put into the legislation when it was in government in 1995. If Labor had found that it had had a significant downside and needed to be put back to where it was, I could understand it, but the recent court decisions have confirmed that the provision does operate as it was intended. It is for Senator Evans to make clearer to the Senate why we should go back to the situation prior to 1995. I do not think he has done that. He is busy as I speak, but I will give him the chance to make it clearer.
The amendment does not substantially alter the language used. It has not been made clear why Labor want to amend the existing provision. It is also unclear what the consequences will be. The clause has been in place since 1995 and it has been through the courts. The interpretation of it is quite clear, and there does not seem to be a downside to it. All we are getting is an amendment that creates uncertainty where certainty has reigned for the last five years. The ALP government was the author of the amendment in 1995 that has been tested and has produced that certainty. It is a mystery why the opposition would want to change it when we have certainty. It has been tested. It does not substantially alter the language, but it does put uncertainty in place of the certainty that has been there for the last five years. The government is not prepared to swap certainty for uncertainty without evidence that it is needed.",SENATE,<title>FAMILY AND COMMUNITY SERVICES AND VETERANS' AFFAIRS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (DEBT RECOVERY) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2000-11-29,"—Although we are willing to hear further arguments from the minister, the Democrats are inclined to support this, unless Senator Evans explains things so badly that it switches my mind the other way. I understand what the minister is saying—that this will swap certainty for uncertainty. From my point of view, there is certainty in how the provision is being interpreted and operated. Whether the certainty reflects the intent of the Senate at that time, I do not know—I was not here. I have not read the speeches from that period, but I would say two things: any time you make a change to law, you are adding a bit of uncertainty because sometimes it can be interpreted by a tribunal or a court down the track. Until that happens, you will not be 100 per cent certain how that will be interpreted, particularly when you look at areas of discretion in the administration of the law. By definition, making any amendment can generate uncertainty. If you applied that principle completely, you would never change anything, which at least would mean we would not have to spend so much time here. 
The other point is about how it operates at the moment. I do not know what the intent was when it was put in, but the Democrats certainly have concerns about how it operates at the moment. Just to make it clear to people following the debate, the amendment goes to the issue of waiving the right to recover the proportion of a debt that is attributable to an administrative error made by the Commonwealth if the debtor received in good faith the payment or payments that gave rise to that proportion of the debt. So it is basically subject to the other subsection in the act which requires the secretary to waive the right to recover the proportion of a debt if it was administrative error and was received in good faith.
My understanding of how things are interpreted as the act stands now is that, because of the court cases—probably the ones the minister was referring to; the one I am particularly aware of is the case in relation to Prince—the test of good faith is now interpreted very stringently. This amendment should allow waiver of those debts where the customer is deemed to have had some unintentional degree of liability, changing it from the current provision of sole administrative error—absolutely no error at all on the part of the person involved—to a slightly more generous definition of administrative error in general rather than `sole administrative error'. It should allow for people who did not know that they were being overpaid—where that overpayment arose from an administrative error on the department's side of things—to have that waiver of the debt come into force.
Because of the way things have been interpreted in court cases, it is now very hard to have that test of good faith acknowledged. It has been made very stringent by court cases. Whether that was the intent of the amendment when it was made back in 1995 I do not know, but that is how it is operating. Even if it was the intent back then, the Democrats' point of view is that we are not sure it was a good intent, and we have an opportunity to change our intent. As I see it, this amendment does that, and so the Democrats at this stage are still inclined to lend our support to it.",SENATE,<title>FAMILY AND COMMUNITY SERVICES AND VETERANS' AFFAIRS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (DEBT RECOVERY) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2000-11-29,"—After that brilliant exposition of my amendment, I would be very disappointed if you did not vote for it, Senator Bartlett. I thought you put it very well.
—It wasn't accurate.
—You will get your turn, Minister. The minister makes the point about certainty. I do not disagree with her. The current provisions are certain, and that is our concern. We are concerned that they are not fair. I am not arguing that; in fact, you are very clear. The interpretation of this `solely' provision has meant that people who we think ought not be caught up in the net are being caught up in the net—where in good faith they have been overpaid, they are having debts raised against them which they should not have. I said in my opening remarks that I accepted that the Labor government had drafted the phrase. I know there is a long history to this, and I accept that. We are always accused of learning nothing in 13 years of government. Perhaps you can take it as an interpretation that I learnt something.
We are responding to what we see is concern about how stringently that is being interpreted currently. There is certainty, as the minister said, but we are concerned about the fairness. Our amendment seeks to provide a bit more flexibility, because we find that the way the word `solely' has been interpreted is that many people have, in good faith, received an overpayment which they may otherwise have not noticed. I am not talking about someone being overpaid $10,000 more than they were entitled; we are talking about people who may have over time incurred debts by small extra amounts being paid, and they ought not be caught up in this requirement to repay debts. As Senator Bartlett said, the amendment says: 
... the Secretary must waive the right to recover the proportion of a debt that is attributable to an administrative error made by the Commonwealth if the debtor received in good faith the payment or payments that gave rise to that proportion of the debt.
In other words, if it was through no fault of their own—the Commonwealth made a mistake, the client was overpaid and it is not reasonable that they would have noticed the overpayment—we say that there ought to be the capacity for them not to be forced to repay the debt. It is a mistake by the Commonwealth; it is no fault of their own; there is no reason why they should have noticed it; why should they incur the debt? These are people who are on fixed incomes, are relying on social security, and any sort of debt puts an extreme pressure on them and their lives. We are saying that, if it is not their fault, why should they be made to pay? We accept that where it is clear that they should have noticed they be required to take action. We are not seeking to weaken that. Clearly if they receive an overpayment they have some responsibility to respond to that. But we think this will give us a fairer interpretation. I accept the minister's argument that, currently, it is very clear. But we say it is very clear because people are being forced to have those debts raised against them in circumstances where we do not think it is fair that they should have them raised. So it is a question of whether the current provision is operating fairly or not. We think it is not. We want to find a way, and the amendment seeks to do that, of making it operate more fairly.",SENATE,<title>FAMILY AND COMMUNITY SERVICES AND VETERANS' AFFAIRS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (DEBT RECOVERY) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Newman, Sen Jocelyn",LP,2000-11-29,"—I can see where the opposition is coming from a bit better, but can I just point out what could be the result of it that would surely give all of us concern? It is not unusual to have a mixture of things covered by the existing legislation—for example, where there is a mixture of administrative error on the part of the administration together with a misrepresentation by the customer as to their circumstances. So you can have two things coming together in the one situation. Currently, under the legislation as it was amended by the previous government in 1995, only the administrative error would be waived. If the word `solely' is introduced, the certainty is gone, as I say, because we have to wait until that has been interpreted and a court would ask: `Why did the legislature find the need or choose to change it?' The danger in this circumstance would be, for example, that they would say, `There was a reason for this; we should perhaps waive both the admin error and the misrepresentation of the customer.' That is an example that I have quickly gleaned from my advisers. I really cannot see the benefit of putting in the word `solely'. I can see dangers. I urge you to think again about it. It is working as was intended by the legislature. I do not think that there is any evidence, really, that it is working badly. Senator Bartlett did refer to good faith when he referred to the Prince case. But the Prince case is not relevant here, because that was an issue of good faith. We are not talking here about good faith. This is about the word `solely' being inserted.",SENATE,<title>FAMILY AND COMMUNITY SERVICES AND VETERANS' AFFAIRS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (DEBT RECOVERY) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2000-11-29,"—I just want to say that I thought it was about having the word `solely' removed. I think the key response to the minister's argument is to say that the amendment moved by the opposition specifically addresses that concern by saying:
... the Secretary must waive the right to recover the proportion of a debt that is attributable to an administrative error made by the Commonwealth ...
We address that concern specifically in the amendment. So I do not think that is a valid argument. As I say, we think that the current interpretation of `solely' is too tight and that people are being caught up in the net who ought not be. This is an amendment about trying to make provision so that they are not incurring debts where we think it is unreasonable or unfair to have them incur the debt.

"Newman, Sen Jocelyn",LP,2000-11-29,"—I would like to respond to this particular element. I advise the Senate that, in October this year, the Federal Court indicated that the correct interpretation of section 1237A is one that supports the intention stated in the explanatory memorandum. In Jazazievska v. the Secretary to the Department of Family and Community Services, the court considered that, aside from good faith, the relevant questions for the purposes of section 1237A are:
(a) whether any portion of the debt is solely attributable to administrative error; and
(b) if so, what portion of the debt is so attributable.
If that is your intention, that is already how it is being interpreted now. I do not think you are achieving anything in terms of the proportionality issue that is not already there.",SENATE,<title>FAMILY AND COMMUNITY SERVICES AND VETERANS' AFFAIRS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (DEBT RECOVERY) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2000-11-29,"—I have a couple of issues in response to what the minister has said which I would like to be pondering rather than speaking about, so if somebody else can find something to speak about for a minute that would be good. My understanding of the Prince case that the minister referred to is that the good faith issue is relevant. What this amendment seeks to do is not insert the word `solely' but remove it. The interpretation of `solely' in that particular case, as I understand it, related to a student assistance overpayment that arose through administrative error. As I understand it, there was no question that the student involved did not declare information appropriately. It was basically found that they should have realised sooner that they were being incorrectly paid and therefore they were in part responsible.
The test of faith there was so stringently applied that, without saying they acted in bad faith, overlaying that good faith aspect, if you like, with interpretation of `sole administrative error' meant that it was not solely an administrative error; it was maybe 95 per cent an administrative error and five per cent the person should have realised or whatever—I am paraphrasing a bit. Basically it has made it very stringent and, as I understand it, has meant that this particular part of the act is not able to be used very frequently—that may be why it was put in; I am sure it is appropriate not to have this wide open door, but the Democrats are concerned, in terms of our information about how this is affecting people, to keep reminding us all that this is what it is about—and that the provision is not able to be used to the benefit of many people. The intent may be that it needs to be that tight, according to the department. Our view and our feedback is that it is too tight and that people who received overpayments through no real fault of their own are nonetheless not having access to the provision. That is my understanding of how it operates at the moment, although if someone else wants to speak for a minute that would be good. ",SENATE,<title>FAMILY AND COMMUNITY SERVICES AND VETERANS' AFFAIRS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (DEBT RECOVERY) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2000-11-29,"—I want to reiterate our point. We were at cross-purposes with the minister earlier. What we are saying is that we accept the history of this. We say that it has been applied too tightly. We are trying to find a way of making it less restrictive. We are quite up-front about that. We accept the argument about a proportion of a debt that is attributable to administrative error. Our amendment seeks to reflect that practice, which is that only that proportion ought to be waived, not any other, and the amendment specifically includes that. We find in our experience and in our feedback from clients that this definition of `solely responsible' is being used in such a way that basically nobody can escape because they are being caught in that trap. 
We say that where people have incurred debts through no fault of their own, through an administrative error by the Commonwealth, there has to be some provision that those people have acted in good faith and reasonably do not incur debts. We just do not think that has currently been applied fairly enough. We think it has been too restrictive. I am sure it is certain and I am sure it suits the department, but we have clients saying to us that they—and we have examples—have been treated harshly and unfairly as a result of that definition. We are trying to loosen that to provide for the secretary to waive that proportion of the debt where someone has acted in good faith and the debt has been incurred through the error of the Commonwealth.  
Nothing the minister has said has convinced me that we ought not pursue that. I think what the minister is effectively saying is that we have current systems in place and we are happy with them. That is fine; that is the government's view. What we are saying is that we have a view that they are acting too harshly and too restrictively. We are seeking to use this method to provide a bit more leeway for those people who we think should not be caught up in that definition.

"Newman, Sen Jocelyn",LP,2000-11-29,"—In response to Senator Evans, there are other ways of addressing the concerns that the opposition has put on the table. I understand that there has already been an offer conveyed to the ALP that there are other ways to address the issues. We will be happy to work with them on that. We think it is a mistake to change something when everybody knows what it means by now. There are other things we could do.

"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2000-11-29,"—I understand that the minister refers to some suggestions put to my advisers about that issue. I accept that has been done in good faith. We are faced with a bill now. We are concerned that there is some legislative enforcement of that, rather than merely perhaps changing the guidelines. But as always, if following the end of this debate the minister wants to make a fresh approach to that we always have an open mind to discuss such things, as I am sure the Democrats would. At this stage I intend persisting with the amendment. 
Amendment agreed to.",SENATE,<title>FAMILY AND COMMUNITY SERVICES AND VETERANS' AFFAIRS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (DEBT RECOVERY) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2000-11-29,"—We oppose schedules 1 and 3 in the following terms:
(14)	Schedule 1, item 31, page 17 (line 27) to page 18 (line 2), TO BE OPPOSED.
(25)	Schedule 3, item 14, page 28 (lines 11 to 17), TO BE OPPOSED.
The Democrats wish to oppose schedule 1, item 31, and schedule 3, item 14, which both address the same issue of sentencing. Given that we are nearly at the end of this debate, I will take a bit of time on this issue because it is very important. I urge the Senate to consider this seriously. We have had comments in relation to previous amendments about introducing uncertainty. This is a particularly dangerous part of this bill. 
The sections in question seek to change the current arrangement. Basically the intent of the existing paragraph, 1237AA, subparagraph 1, subparagraph (b), is that, where people are convicted of social security overpayment, social security fraud et cetera, and receive a custodial sentence because of that and are punished by being sent to jail, they are not then also punished through the payment of the debt—avoiding that double jeopardy or double punishment.
What this new paragraph seeks to do, one could suggest, is retain the same principle; but the Democrats are very concerned about how it would operate in practice. To avoid the double jeopardy or double punishment circumstance, this new section will now need to meet the following tests: firstly, that the court impose a custodial sentence on the debtor and that the court in imposing a sentence expressly state that, because the debtor was unwilling or unable to pay the debt, the sentence is longer than the court would otherwise have imposed. The intent there, I am sure, is that the government wants it to be clear that the person actually receives some custodial punishment because of their action—and they were not going to be sent to jail anyway. But the Democrats are very concerned about how this may operate in practice in leaving a person's fate to whether or not a judge is going to specifically say something in their sentencing remarks. I know the way some judges think in terms of judicial independence, and there may be the risk that some may be even less inclined to specifically state something in their remarks because they feel they have got some law that is trying to force them to do so. To suggest or to try to add some legal requirement on judges to say a specific thing in their sentencing remarks is a dangerous thing because the reality is now that many times they do not. That is probably why this change is being proposed, because they do not specifically say, and the department wants them to because it wants to be certain. I can understand that intention, but it leaves the person who, again in this case, whilst obviously guilty of some wrongdoing, is not exactly in a powerful position—it is one of the least powerful positions you could be in. Their whole fate is resting on whether or not the judge does the right thing in the sense of what is required by this paragraph and expressly states that the sentence is being imposed and that it is longer than it otherwise would have been. Unless the judge uses those magic words each time, we will have people who quite likely will be sentenced to jail having to then get this double punishment. 
In terms of how things potentially could operate with this, a defence lawyer—someone who is defending the person who is charged—would be required to argue for their client to get a longer sentence. Now, you try to get any defence lawyer in the country to go out there and say, `Please, your Honour, put a longer sentence on my client so that this provision of the act will apply to them.' I do not think many of them would want to be in that situation. And they would also be saying, `Please, your Honour, can you expressly state this in your judgment.' Sometimes a judge will and sometimes they will not. I think it is a very dangerous principle. I do not know if there is a precedent for it in other legislation. If there is, maybe my concerns could be slightly assuaged. But I find this particularly dangerous. I understand the intent, but the effect of it is very worrying to the Democrats. I could go on about broader, loftier principles of independence and separation of powers and independence of the judiciary, but I am more interested in how it is going to affect the people in this case. Again, you are dealing with people who, sure, have done the wrong thing—that is why they are going to jail—but are having a potential extra risk put onto them. We need to punish people for wrongdoing but we do not want to obliterate them.
There is also the issue of trying to ensure that they can get back into things. As we are talking about social security law, I could talk long about how difficult it is for people when they are released from prison to get enough money to get back into the community and not run the risk of sliding back into crime and other areas. It is a real problem in itself. That is a little extraneous, but I raise it simply to say that we are dealing with people whose lives are already pretty stuffed up and who are already going to have a fair bit of trouble getting it back together. It may be stuffed up completely due to their own fault, but that is not the point. Our concern is that the way in which this may operate in practice may indeed be the reverse of what I am sure is its intent. The intent of the section is to avoid double punishment. Our concern is that it may mean more people being put in that circumstance because the test that is being put in place will be unable to be guaranteed. You cannot guarantee that a judge will expressly state anything in imposing a sentence. I think it will also put an unhelpful dynamic into the whole legal process from the point of view of the defendant and how they put their case in terms of how they would be dealt with by the court if they are found guilty—and obviously this only applies to people who are found guilty. So it is one that we are very concerned about, not necessarily with the intent but with how it may operate in practice. It is one that we think is a dangerous thing in principle and may well be a bad thing in practice.",SENATE,<title>FAMILY AND COMMUNITY SERVICES AND VETERANS' AFFAIRS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (DEBT RECOVERY) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Newman, Sen Jocelyn",LP,2000-11-29,"—I have listened carefully to Senator Bartlett, but I think that it is important that he understand just how this amendment has come forward from the government. The current legislation provides for where the court has indicated in sentencing the debtor that it imposed a longer custodial sentence on the debtor because he or she was unable or unwilling to pay the debt. In those circumstances, the current legislation says the secretary must waive the right to recover the proportion of the debt that arose in connection with the offence. But the government has received a formal request from the Director of Public Prosecutions that this provision be changed because it is inconsistent with sound sentencing principles. So the government has brought forward the changed legislation. We in the government have moved to satisfy the Director of Public Prosecutions by inserting `expressly stated that'. In imposing the sentence, instead of indicating, the court has to expressly state that, because the debtor was unable or unwilling to pay the debt, the sentence was longer than the court would otherwise have imposed, and in those circumstances the secretary must waive the right to recover the proportion of the debt. So at the request of the Director of Public Prosecutions, who says that the provision needs to be changed because it is inconsistent with sound sentencing principles, we have moved from `indicates' to `expressly stating that'. I think the Senate would be very well advised, as the government has been, to take account of and to implement the advice that has been received from the Director of Public Prosecutions.

"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2000-11-29,"—I am a bit caught on how to respond to this issue. I do not have any instructions in the sense that it is not an issue that we have looked at in detail. It was not part of our consideration of the bill. I must admit that Senator Bartlett has raised some concerns in my mind about this. I hear what the minister has to say. I am also conscious that some of the civil libertarians on my side like Senator Cooney will have me hung, drawn and quartered if I agree to something that—
—Take a punt!
—As Senator Abetz would know, Senator Cooney would take a keen interest in such an issue. This is one of those occasions when the Democrats are arguing for the status quo and the government are the radicals. My general inclination in these things is to go with the status quo unless convinced. I accept that there may be a problem. I am just loath to—
—Can I assist you?
—I am happy for you to have another go, Minister. I just indicate that at this stage, subject to being convinced—because Senator Bartlett has raised some serious concerns—I would be inclined to vote with him and, therefore, leave the status quo in place. That is because I do not feel abreast of the argument rather than anything else. I have not had the chance to look at this more closely. I will be interested in what you and Senator Bartlett have to say. At this stage, as I say, I am not across the issue in the detail that one would want to be in making that decision. I have not had a chance to look at the DPP's advice or at any sort of justification. Senator Bartlett does raise some issues which concern me. Obviously his comments about understanding the complex workings of the minds of judges and their sentencing is a fair point. Often a judge just comes down and says, `You have got nine months,' and that is it. I am not sure how then this is intended to work. But I am happy for the minister to provide further advice. I am happy for Senator Bartlett to push his case but, in a sense—and I do not mind admitting it—this debate has come upon me when I am a bit unprepared, in the sense that I have not thought through the issues deeply. Basically, I am a little cautious.",SENATE,<title>FAMILY AND COMMUNITY SERVICES AND VETERANS' AFFAIRS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (DEBT RECOVERY) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Newman, Sen Jocelyn",LP,2000-11-29,"—I draw Senator Evans's attention to the fact that the advice I have received is that the Senate Scrutiny of Bills Committee has not made any comment on this and, as a former member of the Scrutiny of Bills Committee, I well understand your concerns that Senator Cooney be satisfied, but I think he would be guided by the Scrutiny of Bills Committee as well. I offer that to you as a piece of information. Obviously, I have not convinced you. This has not come forward, if you like, as a whim of the government or the department, or for convenience. It has come forward because the DPP asked for it.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2000-11-29,"—I do not think anyone is disagreeing about the intent of how we want this section to operate. It is how it may operate in practice. I appreciate Senator Evans's difficulty. It is a slightly frustrating situation to be in, I guess, although I would say that our amendments were circulated 20 days ago. Certainly, the main source of concern that was raised with the Democrats about how this provision may operate came from the Welfare Rights Centre. I would be surprised if they did not provide the same material to the opposition at some stage. That is not a criticism of Senator Evans: it is more an extra expression of frustration. I was not aware that this change has been generated at the request of the DPP. Far be it from me to argue with the DPP about legal principles. I find it perplexing as to why having the existing requirement that an indication be given of a statement is not a sound sentencing principle, but putting something in that requires an express statement is a sound sentencing principle. It perplexes me that that would also meet the requirements of the DPP.
However, I am more interested in how this will affect people. It may make life a bit harder for the department, and I do not seek to do that, but I am very concerned that it may make life a bit harder for the few people who are in a situation where they get a judge that does not expressly state. Obviously it is a tougher test to have to expressly state something than it is to indicate something. There may well be sound reasons why the government or the DPP wants a tougher test, but the impact on individual people, in the view of the Democrats, may be that that tougher test will lead to a few people being unfairly punished. That is a risk that we do not want to run. Whilst the current system may not meet sound sentencing principles, although I would be interested to see the exposition of that from the DPP at some stage, I have not heard any indication that it works in a way that means that the intent of this section does not operate as it should in relation to avoiding double punishment. My concern is that the way it may operate with this change is that that double punishment may be more likely to be inadvertently applied. That is a circumstance that I am sure none of us want to see. In the Democrats' view, we are running a risk if we allow this provision to stand.

"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,2000-11-29,"—The horticultural industry is of great importance to the Australian economy both domestically and with respect to the revenue earned from exports. Indeed, in the latest figures I have available to me, the total value of the horticultural industry in 1999-2000 was in the order of $5.6 billion and the net export value was around $1.2 billion, a not insignificant amount in terms of our export earnings. The industry comprises some 80,000 growers, many of them small family enterprises and businesses, and of course there are a substantial number of employees in the value adding sectors. It is a group of industries, because `horticultural' encompasses quite a range of different products, various fruits, vegetables, and so on. The industry has been going through some difficult times over recent years—not unlike other agricultural areas of course. Horticulture has been hit hard through such difficulties as problems with prices. We have seen the closure of some of the canneries in the fruit area. There are the ongoing difficulties associated with the importation of concentrates from overseas and the impact that that has upon prices received by Australian growers. We also are aware of the difficulties of trade barriers and protectionism that exist in other countries, which we are constantly endeavouring to break down through the WTO, the Cairns Group, and so on. 
Issues related to quarantine and disease prevention have been prominent in the news in recent times. The Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Committee, of which I am a member, will be undertaking an inquiry early next year into the issues surrounding the draft risk assessment by Biosecurity Australia on the importation of apples from New Zealand. I notice Senator Calvert in the chamber. I think he moved the motion to hold the inquiry; he managed to get in first before quite a few others did. Senator Calvert is aware, as we all are, of the very serious concern regarding the potential introduction of fire blight into our industry. Equally, there are other potential difficulties that the industry may face. One that has also been drawn to our attention is the problem associated with Pierce's disease in the California citrus industry.
I say all that by way of background because we need to understand that, when we are discussing the Horticulture Marketing and Research and Development Services Bill 2000 and the Horticulture Marketing and Research and Development Services (Repeals and Consequential Provisions) Bill 2000 that are before the chamber now, we are dealing with areas of research and development and of marketing for horticultural products now and in the future. If we as a nation and the industries are going to progress, then it is important that we examine closely the arrangements for research and development and marketing of our horticultural products. These two bills are the end product of an ongoing process over a couple of years essentially to privatise the research and development corporations that have hitherto existed. This is not a new feature. Indeed, it appears that these days I am on my feet in this chamber reasonably regularly making speeches, as are other members of our Senate committee, on the processes of privatisation of various statutory R&D corporations. I think we are going to come to one in the next couple of days in the wool industry, but at the moment we are dealing with horticulture.
The legislation that is before the chamber establishes a new horticultural services company to be known as Horticulture Australia. It will be the result of the amalgamation of the two major industry umbrella bodies that currently exist. They are the Australian Horticultural Corporation, or the AHC, and the Horticultural Research and Development Corporation. The other major body is the Australian Dried Fruits Board. Under the legislation, that board will be abolished and its functions incorporated into the new company, Horticulture Australia. However—and I will come back to this later—there will be a specific trust account established to hold the approximately $2 million in funds of the Australian Dried Fruits Board for that industry to access for R&D and promotional activities.
The charter of the new company is to provide marketing and research and development programs to industry—in effect, to carry on the work that has been done or was the responsibility of the two corporations that I mentioned a moment ago. This new company will be an industry owned or member owned company, a not-for-profit company, and therefore will no longer be a statutory organisation. The members of the new company will be the industry representative bodies, who are, in turn, made up of individual growers throughout the horticultural sector. The funds for the new company will be provided by way of the member contributions through statutory levies and voluntary contributions that exist and will continue to exist under the new arrangement. The voting rights for individual members and bodies will be allocated according to the level of funds contributed by each entity. 
As I said, the legislation has been some time in the making, and that has been because of the need to bring about industry consensus across the various sections or products groups within the horticultural industry. I understand that there are at least 29 such groups that currently have grower members or companies paying levies and in turn contributing to the corporations. I am advised that it has not been a simple process to bring all of these groups together and to negotiate with government on the new structure, but we are assured—and I note that in his second reading speech the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry made some comment about this—that there has been a substantial amount of consultation with industry, and also subsequent detailed assessment by government, to bring about this new single company structure. That is an important element because, as we have found in each of the privatisation exercises that have gone on in various industries—in the pork industry, the red meat industry, the wheat industry and now the wool industry, just to name a few—the critical factor has been to get industry consensus. If industry is going to take on more of the ownership and control of these organisations, there is a need for consensus to prevail. 
I am advised that the net assets of the two existing corporations amount to some $20 million. Those assets will be transferred to the new company, along with liabilities. Further, I am advised that all existing staff will be transferred to the new company, retaining their rights and conditions, as should be the case. I mentioned earlier that the Australian Dried Fruits Board will be abolished and integrated into the new Horticulture Australia company. They have some $2 million, I understand, in existing funds and they will be placed into a special trust fund earmarked for R&D for the members of that industry.
The position of the opposition is that we support the process. We recognise that it has been brought about through consultation and negotiation with industry, and it is in line with the general principle that is being implemented across various other agricultural and rural industries. Our support is not unqualified, because there are some important issues that we believe need to be referred to and further pursued during the committee stage of the debate, but in principle our position is that we do not oppose the legislation. We do wish to raise a few matters, and, as I said, we will come to these in more detail in the committee stage. I am sure my colleagues Senator O'Brien and Senator Woodley—maybe even Senator Calvert—will have some questions to ask. Let me mention just a couple of matters.
Firstly, one of the specific functions or powers that will exist under this legislation is that the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry can declare the company to be the industry services body and also the export control body for the industry. It is not necessarily the case that the one company would be declared to be both entities or take on both functions, but as I understand it that is certainly the proposal at this point in time. Indeed the minister, in his second reading speech, referred to this at page 4; but he also drew attention to the fact that there were a range of conditions to be met, one of which included that the company sign a deed of agreement with the government to fulfil industry and public accountability requirements. He then goes on:
If the company changes its constitution in a manner considered unacceptable to the government, becomes insolvent, or fails to comply with the legislation or the deed of agreement, the legislation provides for the government to retain the right to declare another body as the industry services body or the export control body or to retransfer the assets and liabilities to another suitable body.
This is a substantial power that the minister will have and is something that we need to explore a bit further during the committee stage. But it leads me to a very important issue, which is the whole question of accountability for funds. Until now, the R&D corporations have existed as statutory bodies and, accordingly, each year on a couple of occasions through the estimates process we have the opportunity to examine the accounts of the R&D corporations and to raise matters with the minister and with the public servants present at estimates. We also, of course, have the same opportunity through the parliament because the portfolio budget statements are tabled, as are the annual reports of each of the corporations. Under the new arrangements, I understand that that will no longer be the case because this will be a private company. 
Nevertheless, it will be a company that will be receiving matching funds from government. At the moment, that is of the order of $14 million per annum. We have no problem with the provision of matching funding from government or from the taxpayer—from the public purse—to this industry or indeed to other agricultural industries to help in the promotion of R&D, marketing and so on. That has been a longstanding practice in these industries. But we are concerned that the new companies be accountable for how they spend that money. They should be accountable to the government and more so to the parliament. We will be looking for some further clarification from the government in the committee stage as to just how that is going to be the case. I note that in the explanatory memorandum on the Horticulture Marketing and Research and Development Services Bill this issue of accountability is referred to, but it is of course by way of a deed of agreement rather than any specific obligations in the legislation.
The final point I would make at this stage, as I draw my remarks to a close, is another issue of some concern—that is, the powers vested in the minister under section 29 of the Horticulture Marketing and Research and Development Services Bill. Section 29 of that bill deals with the power of a minister to make ministerial directions. I will not read the entire section because the parliamentary secretary and others would of course have this in front of them. Of particular interest and concern is that it states in subsection (3):
The Minister must cause a copy of the direction to be laid before each House of the Parliament within 15 sitting days of that House after direction is given, unless the Minister makes a written determination that doing so would be likely to prejudice:
(a) the national interest of Australia; or
(b) the body's commercial activities.
We are concerned that it is up to the minister ultimately here to decide whether or not such a direction is a disallowable instrument. We would particularly like to get some further clarification on that issue in the committee stage. I will leave my remarks at that. As I said, we are supportive of the legislation in principle but there are a range of issues that we would wish to get some further clarification on in the committee stage. Hopefully, if they are clarified to our satisfaction, we can proceed further.

"Woodley, Sen John",AD,2000-11-29,"—I too wish to speak on the Horticulture Marketing and Research and Development Services Bill 2000 and a further bill which supports this one. I want to speak on it for a number of reasons. Quite clearly, the opposition parties are in support of the legislation, but there are a number of issues which are worth raising in the context of this debate and which will serve to give the government notice of concerns that we have and which will continue to be raised. This legislation provides for the formation of a company to be established under the Corporations Law as the industry services body for Australian horticulture. As we have seen, and as Senator Forshaw has mentioned, this is part of a process which has been taking place in many commodity bodies and it is one that the Democrats have largely supported because it does give autonomy and control to producers to a very large degree.
Although generally we have many questions about privatisation as a principle in itself, certainly in terms of privatisation of these particular industries, where it means giving control to companies that are largely controlled by growers, we have been pretty much in support of the process. However, in terms of the transfer of autonomy to producers, with the special relationship and new relationship which exists between those privatised companies and government, there is a question which is both particular and philosophical. That question has to do with how much autonomy these privatised companies do have, how much they should have and whether or not at times that autonomy is overridden not because the particular company has any failing but because of government involvement in other instrumentalities which bear on the operation of such companies. I will come back to that a little bit later. 
In reference to the bill itself, we note that there are provisions for the continued support of the research and development program and the marketing program. These are important issues in any company operating in Australia today but they are of critical importance when we are talking about primary produce. As all senators know, for many of our rural producers and for many of our commodities it has been a real struggle. It has been a struggle in terms of continuing to receive support for research and development, which is the only thing which keeps many of these industries as world leaders in terms of the product which is grown. We know that many of our products are world leaders, but we also know that most of our commodities are sold into world markets which are corrupted, in many instances by governments that give to their own industries support which we do not give to our industries. So research and development is critical in keeping our producers and our products right at the very cutting edge of development. The same goes for marketing. We need to be right up there in our continued support by the Australian community generally for primary production in this country, and that support by the general community is generally channelled through government programs.
We note that the change in organisation is welcomed by the industry generally. It should lead to efficiencies, and the promise of a more directed research and development program—and therefore a more focused export program—I think is welcomed by everybody. The move by industry and government in this instance follows similar rearrangements of other agricultural industries in which the government seeks to support the industry but remains at arm's length from its management. Often the involvement of government is because of levies which are still collected through government agencies. The problem is that the definition of arm's length is often a very slippery one and very hard to get hold of. I think government would recognise that. Senator Forshaw in his speech raised a number of issues where this relationship in terms of continuing government involvement is one that is not clear. That is not the fault of government; it is simply that we are developing these relationships and the way in which they operate as we go along, and there is not always a consistency in the way in which continuing government relationships are defined in legislation, depending on which commodity we are talking about. 
As well as the issue which Senator Forshaw raised, there is another issue which I suppose is a peculiar Democrat issue that I want to raise here. It is to do with the autonomy of producers. I want to say to the government that it is okay for us to want to transfer to producers responsibility for making decisions about R&D, export and other things. But producers sometimes feel that in certain instances they are not listened to and that there are decisions made by government which affect their industry over which they have little control, which raises in their minds questions about whether or not they really are autonomous and whether they really do have control of their own industry. 
I suppose the classic is the current decision on imports which is being contested very hotly by apple and pear growers in Australia. This is one where the Democrats differ from the major parties. While we recognise that it is not possible to achieve zero risk in terms of imports—in other words, we cannot guarantee that there will be no environmental or economic impacts when we allow imports into the country—the Democrats believe nevertheless that zero risk is what Australian producers and Australian consumers want. I know that we operate on what is called managed risk, but it is another one of these very slippery definitions, because managed risk can mean anything. It can mean whatever the government, AQIS or whoever is involved in the decision happens to believe is acceptable at the time. I have real problems with that. I believe that the goal of any quarantine service ought to be zero risk.
We cannot achieve zero risk sometimes because of the cost—that is the problem—but I believe that nevertheless we should maintain that as the goal and do our best to come up to that. The goal should not be an acceptable managed risk, because that is a very slippery goal indeed. That is why we are having all of these disputes arising and recourse to Senate inquiries after the fact. It has occurred with salmon; it is now occurring with apples. It raises the whole issue of whether or not these industry bodies have real autonomy. They have autonomy in terms of research and development and some issues to do with marketing but, if in fact they do not have the ability to influence decisions such as the decision about the importation of New Zealand apples, one puts a question mark over whether or not they do have control at the point at which it really counts. It is a philosophical debate and it is one that I presume we are going to engage in continually over coming years. It is a debate on which the Democrats have a particular view—if you like, a peculiar view—but nevertheless it is worth putting that view on the table. 
Another part of that debate is the fact that, while the claim is made constantly that AQIS makes these decisions only on the basis of scientific data, it has been very clear in the inquiries we have had that trade imperatives seem to be given equal weight by AQIS, and I have to ask the question as to why. If it is the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service, surely pure science is all that it should engage in and taking account of trade issues is not its job. I know that the whole issue of trade is dealt with by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, but the distinction between the responsibilities at this point seems to be very blurred. That has come out very clearly in some of the inquiries that the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Committee has dealt with.
I will close with these comments. The issue of fire blight is one that has caused a lot of concern in the industry. Some would say that there has been an erosion of our quarantine standards and that the loopholes and this erosion should be dealt with. I guess, as we continue to progress our Senate inquiry, that debate will be very much to the fore. I note, as an illustration of what I am talking about—the concern of industry that sometimes it does not have the control over its future that it feels it should have—that next week, I think it is, there will be a complete shutdown of businesses in the town of Shepparton.
—Yesterday.
—Right, I thought it was Tuesday week but it was yesterday. Thank you for that information, Parliamentary Secretary. As you can see, I am not always up with the game. I am reading from the press release which dealt with that and I note that it was predicting a massive public rally. It said that it was a protest against Biosecurity Australia's plan to allow the importation of potentially fire blight infected apples from New Zealand. We should take note of such protests. I do not think conservative business people in conservative communities—of which I believe Shepparton is an example, and I have had some relationship with Shepparton over many years—engage in these kinds of protests lightly. It raises again very clearly the question, which I think this chamber must take account of, of just how much control producers do have over their own industry if part of what the industry engages in is certainly under their control through this company but other decisions are made over which they feel they have no control. Certainly, it raises the issue of whether or not they really do have the autonomy which this bill seeks to give them. 
I note that fire blight as a disease is very serious. I note that the press release of the Australian Apple and Pear Growers Association says:
""This is a people's protest,"" says local businessman David Jobling. ""Closing the city is symbolic. It's what will happen to Shepparton and many other country towns if Fire Blight is introduced from New Zealand. The apple and pear industry is the lifeblood of this area. If it goes under because of the importation of Fire Blight, we will go as well.""
It notes:
Fire Blight destroys pear orchards and severely damages apple crops. It is endemic in New Zealand and 40 other countries, but does not exist in Australia.
Independent researchers predict Fire Blight would cost Australia $1 billion in 6 years. It would cut pear production in this country by 50 per cent and apple crops by 20 per cent—90 per cent of the pear orchards around Shepparton would be destroyed. 
So I am sure the government is just as concerned as we are about that issue and certainly about the obvious concern that is in the industry and associated industries. It is a very good illustration of the point I am making that, when we come to talk about autonomy and giving control of an industry to growers, sometimes it is very much a qualified control, and we need to take account of the concerns that are being raised here. In conclusion, let me say that the Democrats welcome the chance for increased efficiencies in the industry. We are pleased that growers will have autonomy in these particular instances. I close by saying that industries need to have real control and real autonomy in all of the issues that affect them.",SENATE,<title>HORTICULTURE MARKETING AND RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT SERVICES (REPEALS AND CONSEQUENTIAL PROVISIONS) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1
"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2000-11-29,"—As Senator Forshaw said, the horticultural industries are a key sector of the Australian rural economy. They account for around 20 per cent of the production value of Australian agriculture. That alone demonstrates the importance of the measures contained in the Horticulture Marketing and Research and Development Services Bill 2000 and the Horticulture Marketing and Research and Development Services (Repeals and Consequential Provisions) Bill 2000, and the reason why they should be given close scrutiny by the Senate in its consideration of this legislation.
Last year, 80,000 growers produced horticultural products worth an estimated $5½ billion, which was up from $2.4 billion in 1998-99. Last year, horticultural exports were worth $1.2 billion, which is an increase of 110 per cent over the past decade, and fresh produce exports were worth around $700 million. It goes without saying that these industries are key generators of jobs in regional Australia. For example, in 1999-2000 the fruit and vegetable processing sectors employed 11,200 people. My state, Tasmania, is a key player in this sector. The state of Tasmania has a cool to temperate climate, good soils, good water and a stable work force; this enabled it to generate horticultural exports worth $54.4 million in the financial year 1998-99. My home and my electorate office are in the north-east of Tasmania, which is one of the key areas of horticultural production. 
I recently visited Scottsdale, the location of one of the major potato processing plants in northern Tasmania, where I spoke with members of the community at a meeting I attended with the member for Bass, Michelle O'Byrne. I talked to people who were employed in the farming industry, the vegetable processing industry and other industries such as forestry. Certainly horticulture is a key industry and a key employer in this region, in terms of both production and processing. You will not be surprised to hear that, when we spoke to members of the community at that meeting, the big issue was not this piece of legislation; it was the cost of fuel. That is a matter that has received significant airing in this chamber recently and that will, given what is taking place in regional communities, be a matter of great concern for some time to come. Anyone you want to talk to wants to talk to you about fuel. It is an issue which, as I said, we will be dealing with in other circumstances.
In relation to this legislation, on 12 September this year, horticultural industry leaders signed a memorandum of understanding setting out the main operational and policy items agreed to between the industry and the government for the establishment of a company to be known as Horticulture Australia Ltd. I want to commend the work done by Senator Troeth in successfully negotiating this outcome with such a large number of identifiable industry sector groups—I think about 29 comprise the horticultural sector. Looking at the schedule on page 31 of the constitution of Horticulture Australia, it is evident that they are very disparate groups: the Australian Apple and Pear Growers Association, the Australian Avocado Growers Federation, Australian Citrus Growers Inc., custard apple growers; the Macadamia Society, the Vegetable and Potato Growers Federation, cherry growers, the Potato Industry Council, chestnut growers, almond growers, fresh stone fruit growers, mushroom growers, nashi pear growers, the garlic industry, the passionfruit industry, the tomato processing industry, the nursery industry, Queensland Fruit and Vegetable Growers, the Australian mango industry, the Australian onion industry, the Dried Fruits Association, Strawberries Australia, pistachio growers, the Australian Nut Industry Council, the Australian Rubus Growers Association, the Tasmanian Farmers and Graziers Association, the Pyrethrum Growers Commodity Committee, the Australian Banana Growers Council, the Canning Fruit Industry Council and the Australian Sugarplum Industry Association.  
—And there's more!
—There may well be more. I am certain that this is such a disparate sector that 29 organisations could not possibly encompass the range of horticultural commodity producers and processors that this country can and, no doubt in the future, will support. That is why I say that one can do nothing but commend Senator Troeth for bringing those organisations together. As someone suggested to me, it may be that Senator Troeth was fortunate to get them on the one day that they can agree! One never knows what the future will bring with regard to such a disparate group.
—Two and a half years.
—Senator Troeth suggests across the chamber that it took 2½ years. It took 2½ years to arrive at the one day when these organisations could agree. If that occurs every 2½ years, then the board of this organisation will be unanimous once in each term of government during the coming century. What an organisation we are going to be dealing with! The Commonwealth is going to be dealing with this organisation under the umbrella of this legislation. The two bills that we are considering today provide a new framework for the marketing and research and development activities to be undertaken by this private company, which will operate under the Corporations Law. The company will replace three statutory authorities: the Australian Horticultural Corporation, the Australian Dried Fruits Board and the Australian Horticultural Research and Development Corporation. 
The key to the future of this sector, as with all other rural industries, is, among other things, an effective and efficient research and development effort. According to the last annual report from the Horticultural Research and Development Corporation, current investment in research and development is running at around $32 million. The total value of the research and development program at the end of the last financial year was $101 million. Last year, the number of projects in the corporation's program was 566. There were 1,050 researchers working on these projects, located in 378 research centres, which is quite a network for this new body to oversee. Under current arrangements, with the organisations that are proposed to be replaced by this Corporations Law company, we have a set of arrangements for accountability to the parliament for the expenditure of a large amount of money. That relationship with the parliament and through the parliament to the Australian public is quite clear. Under the Horticultural Research and Development Act 1987 the corporation is directly responsible to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. I understand—the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry may wish to correct me on this—that Senator Troeth has delegated responsibility in this regard. Senator Troeth is nodding. The Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act requires the corporation to report also to the Minister for Finance and Administration. 
According to the annual report there are currently two key stakeholders in the research effort: on the one hand, there are the industries involved in the production, processing, handling, storage, transport and marketing of horticultural products; and, on the other hand, the Commonwealth of Australia. Under the new arrangement to be established through this legislation, these accountability measures will be replaced by a memorandum of understanding between the new company and the Commonwealth. That means that this new entity—an amalgamation of marketing and research and development—will sit outside the direct scrutiny of the parliament. However, it will still have access, as I understand it, to around $14 million of public funds. A deed of agreement will cover the expenditure of levy moneys as well as the Commonwealth's contribution to research and development funds.  
The revenue from the Commonwealth for this purpose was $13.7 million in 1999-2000. I note in passing that, when these bills were before the other place, the government did not provide the opposition with a copy of this important deed of agreement. The government subsequently changed its mind and provided the documentation necessary for the Senate—and, certainly, for the opposition in the Senate—to give appropriate scrutiny to this important shift in the arrangements for rural sector research and development and its administration. It has been suggested, with regard to the way this has been structured, that the government has taken the same approach as it took with the wool privatisation legislation—that is, it chose to push the bill through the parliament without providing any of the detail. In that case, it has been forced to change its mind and provide that detail, which the opposition would say it should provide.
Under the new arrangements, the two stakeholders remain the industry and the Commonwealth government, but the role of the Commonwealth has been radically changed. On the face of it, these bills represent an outsourcing of the marketing and research and development functions to the industry itself, but public scrutiny of the expenditure of significant amounts of public funds will shift from the parliament to the executive—that is, the minister. In fact, the new arrangements provide the minister with significant if not absolute power over the new corporate entity. I am concerned that, in attempting to limit the role of government in the day-to-day affairs of organisations such as those in the horticulture industry, the government may have created greater problems. For example, the minister has the power to give the new company a formal direction with which it must comply, but the minister is then not required to formally account for his or her actions in the parliament. That is one of the issues on which the opposition will be seeking clarification in the committee stage of these bills. 
From what I am saying, it is obvious that we are going to support the bill in the second reading stage with a view to pursuing these matters in the committee stage. There is quite a range of matters which need to be pursued, and it is my understanding that the opposition will be prepared to maintain support for the bill, conditional upon the satisfactory answering of questions raised in the committee stage. It may be—the opposition will keep an open mind on this matter at this stage—that amendments need to be made to the legislation to properly provide the means to scrutinise certain executive actions. Those matters will be the subject of responses that we receive in the committee stage of the deliberation of these bills.
What I am perhaps suggesting is that the committee stage will take some time. Hopefully, it will be possible for the questions to be answered at the time they are asked and to be considered in a timely fashion but, if not, it may be that the committee stage will need to be interrupted for the provision of that information. I say that because we are not seeking to unnecessarily delay this bill. If the answers can be given in a timely fashion, hopefully we can consider them at the same time and move forward. I would not want the government to feel that the opposition are locked into supporting this bill whatever the answers are, because that is not my understanding of our position.
I do not really wish to put a lot more on the record at this stage, but I have quite a deal of material I want to raise in the committee stage. I did want to ask Senator Woodley to come back in the committee stage and explain to us what he meant by `peculiar Democrat issues', because I think there was a bit of ambiguity in what he said. Rather than misrepresent him, I think he should have the opportunity, when we come to the committee stage, to come back and give us an interpretation of just which Democrat he was describing as peculiar or whether that was a general term he wanted to use in relation to his own organisation.",SENATE,<title>HORTICULTURE MARKETING AND RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT SERVICES (REPEALS AND CONSEQUENTIAL PROVISIONS) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2000-11-29,"—I rise to speak on the Horticulture Marketing and Research and Development Services Bill 2000 and the Horticulture Marketing and Research and Development Services (Repeals and Consequential Provisions) Bill 2000. I indicate the support of Pauline Hanson's One Nation for the government's bills and indicate that in the committee stage I will be seeking some clarification from the minister on a wide range of issues. Some of those issues have been briefly indicated by other speakers in the second reading process. 
One of the concerns that we do have is that the minister's accountability to the growers is not clearly defined in the bill itself. We will be seeking some assurance from the minister as to how the growers involved in this industry will be able to seek accountability from the minister for the implementation of the legislation and also whether the growers will have access to the minister in relation to the decisions of the board and a right of redress.
Another issue on which we will be seeking clarification from the minister is in relation to section 22 of the Horticulture Marketing and Research and Development Services Bill 2000. Section 22 speaks to the granting and assigning of a licence, granting a licence subject to compliance with conditions, varying a licence, surrendering a licence and revoking or suspending a licence. Section 23 of the bill gives powers to the secretary of the body if there is no industry export control body. We have some concerns that we could have a situation whereby a person from the department—a bureaucrat—would have the ability to grant or reject an application for a licence. Taking that one step further, I will be seeking some clarification from the minister as to whether, if there were no industry export control body, that secretary would be able to reject an export licence from an individual grower and subsequently grant an application from another grower. I will be seeking very clear answers from the minister about whether we could have the situation whereby a single applicant could be denied but another applicant in that same sector of the industry could be granted. If that is the case, I believe that would not be in the interests of the growers.
Other issues we will be looking at include whether the government is in any way interfering in the rights of the private sector to operate and run their businesses. In the marketing and research section, the bill speaks about the application of the bill both within and outside of Australia. I will be seeking from the minister some clarification as to the extent this bill can have application outside Australia.
The other concern we have is that, in passing this bill, we are centralising more power in the executive of the board. By this bill being brought into existence, are we getting to a position where the people who are participating in this industry are being removed a little further from being able to have control over their own industry and where they will ultimately lose the direction in which the producers would like the industry to travel? Will this company that is to be put in place jeopardise the producers' ability in the future to dictate the direction in which they want the industry to go? As I said earlier on, we will be seeking some clarification from the minister about the accountability of the board to the growers and about the ability of the growers to have a right of appeal against the decisions of the board and to be able to petition the minister.
Our inquiries to people who are involved in the industry itself generally show that the industry does support the government in the introduction of this bill. I would just like to make the comment that the selection of the company that is going to provide this service will be extremely integral as to how this legislation will be administered and what it will deliver for growers. I believe there was an indication just recently in the media that it looks as though there will be an amalgamation of some of the companies that may have been vying for the ability to provide the service. So if the government's intention was to have competing forces working within the marketplace to provide these services prior to establishing this company, that may have been circumvented to some degree by the players within this industry amalgamating. Again, I indicate that we will be supporting the bill but we will be seeking clarification from the minister on a wide range of issues.",SENATE,<title>HORTICULTURE MARKETING AND RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT SERVICES (REPEALS AND CONSEQUENTIAL PROVISIONS) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1
"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,2000-11-29,"—I would like to thank all senators for their contributions to this part of the debate. As has been said, the purpose of these two bills is to create a new horticultural services company that will deliver more effective marketing and research and development programs to horticulture. Senator Harris, at this stage I will deal with your closing comments. We are not seeking to look for other companies to take up this role. What we are doing in this legislation is amalgamating the existing Australian Horticultural Corporation, which provides marketing services to horticulture, and the existing Horticultural Research and Development Corporation, which provides research and development services. In this legislation we are simply combining those two corporations into a new corporation that will perform the services of those companies. There is no thought by the government of looking for another company to actually perform those operations. 
As has been remarked, horticulture is an extremely important growth industry in Australian agriculture. It ranks third behind meat and grains in its total value of production. More importantly, it also provides a great deal of employment. Some 80,000 people are directly employed in regional and rural Australia, with a further 11,200 people employed in processing. So it is a very important industry. The formation of the new company has strong industry support. I would like to correct Senator O'Brien: over the last 2½ years we did not have one day on which all those very small and large industries agreed; we had 2½ years of agreement. This was only brought about by the absolute attention and goodwill demonstrated by all of those industries to move towards the point that we are at now of putting the legislation through parliament. I would like to commend all of the office bearers in those industries who worked so hard to achieve this point.
—I will withdraw my comment.
—Thank you, Senator O'Brien. I would also like to comment on some of Senator Woodley's remarks. If there was any thought that the industries were not being listened to I should explain that the office bearers of those industries went back again and again and again to negotiate with their levy payers to explain the process and to make perfectly sure that this whole process had the total agreement of the industry. So there can be no thought of industry not having been listened to. Industry was a very willing and competent participant in all of these processes, and there was massive consultation.
The proposed approach has strong levels of accountability built into it. That accountability is provided at three levels. The first level of accountability is between the company members, the 28 horticulture industries, that have signed on to the memorandum of understanding and the levy payers who are providing a majority of funds for the company programs. The levy payers will have the opportunity to consider the investment plans developed by an industry advisory committee for each horticulture industry at an annual levy payers meeting. The company will then arrange the most cost-effective delivery of those marketing and/or research and development plans. Each industry body or others that contribute funds to the company through either the statutory levies or the voluntary contributions will hold voting rights in the company in proportion to the level of funds they contribute. So that is the first level of accountability.
Secondly, the company has to sign a deed of agreement with the government to fulfil its industry and public accountability roles. That deed of agreement specifies the accountability requirements of the government for the company. It includes provision for the company to prepare a strategic business plan and an annual business plan within six months of establishment. It defines what research and development expenditure is eligible for matching funds under the government's matching policy for research and development, up to 0.5 per cent of GDP of horticulture. It requires an annual audit to be undertaken of the use of matched research and development funds and marketing funds. Copies of the audit will be provided to the government.
The company annual report is required to provide a comprehensive accounting for the use of funds as well as outcomes achieved for both marketing and research and development funds, public benefits achieved and the extent to which the company's plans are being met. It will also include full financial accountability, including balance sheet and cash flow positions. As well, the deed provides for the company to give consideration to Commonwealth research and development priorities, which I frequently outline to research and development corporations, and also to have in place a fraud control, intellectual property and risk management plan. Every three years the company is required to conduct an independent review to consider the company's effectiveness in meeting its plans and the value for money of its performance.  
The government has also built strong accountability into the company's use of export control powers. This includes the process for declarations and revocations of declarations of specific products and markets that will be regulated under those export control powers. That includes application and consultation, review of the application by the company board, assessment and approval by the Commonwealth Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, decisions by the secretary of that department and a timetable of review of individual export control arrangements as well as the entire scheme. 
The third and final accountability built into the approach to this company is the controls provided by the Corporations Law. If the company changes its constitution in a manner considered unacceptable to the government, if it becomes insolvent or if it fails to comply with the legislation or the deed of agreement, the legislation provides for the government to retain the right to declare another body as the industry services body or the export control body or to retransfer the assets and liabilities to another suitable body. These safeguards have been provided in the legislation to ensure that the company delivers what the industry and the government expect of it. The board will be required to meet Corporations Law requirements for financial and fiduciary responsibility and the company directors will be accountable in the normal manner, as for any commercial company. 
Obviously, the government strongly supports this legislation because it will deliver a new and more commercial approach to the delivery of marketing and research and development services for the horticulture industry. It is a new approach which is driven by the industries included in that overall sector but it has strong accountability for performance built in to the horticulture industry, who will be its members, to the levy payers, who will be the substantive funders, and to the government, which is providing matching research and development funds on behalf of taxpayers. As has been remarked, the legislation is strongly supported by the 28 horticultural industries which have worked with the government to create the new company. Again, having worked with those industries on almost a daily basis over the last 2½ years, I would like to commend their commitment to this legislation and also commend those officers in the department who have worked so hard as part of the horticultural negotiating team to see that this has come to fruition. I commend the legislation to the Senate.

Bills read a second time. ",SENATE,<title>HORTICULTURE MARKETING AND RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT SERVICES (REPEALS AND CONSEQUENTIAL PROVISIONS) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1
"Senator McGAURAN,",NP,2000-11-29,"—The Senate may be aware of a very sad but controversial incident that occurred at the Royal Women's Hospital in Melbourne and became public in July this year. The incident that occurred was a late term abortion, of some 32 weeks, on the grounds that the baby was a dwarf. It is my belief that the Royal Women's Hospital have shrouded the truth of this incident. They would say that it was an abortion of a foetus on the grounds of the mother's extreme emotional stress, but the truth is that it was dwarfism of the baby that led to its destruction.
Given this shocking operation, it is then important to know what the standing of such a procedure is in Victorian law. While late term abortions are not specifically referred to in the law, the Crimes Act creates the offence of child destruction after 28 weeks, meaning that the child is viable at 28 weeks and an abortion cannot be undertaken. Further, medical evidence accepted by the courts states that a child capable of breathing naturally or unnaturally would come within the provisions of the Crimes Act of child destruction. Medical evidence, again accepted by the courts, found that breathing—that is, viability—can commence at 20 weeks. Therefore, the Victorian law recognises that the criminal offence of child destruction can commence at 20 weeks.
The reason the law treats a late term abortion as a criminal offence is because the baby can live separate from its mother—that is, there is no contest of life between the rights of the mother and the child. In some circumstances, this view of no contest is supported by the very medical procedure for late term abortions. To begin with, the child is born, a birth certificate is required, the newborn is destroyed and a death certificate is written. However, as the Senate is aware, the issue of termination of pregnancy is a matter of conscience before the parliament. My position is that late term abortions are morally wrong and illegal under Victorian law. I believe that the majority of the general public have an ethical objection to late term abortions particularly on the grounds of a mere physical defect of the unborn. 
It would then dismay the general public to know that the incident I have referred to of the late term abortion at the Royal Women's Hospital is not a one-off but, rather, one of many. The evidence comes from a freedom of information request made to the medical records department to supply statistics for late term abortions for the past 10 years, excluding miscarriages. This was so the statistics reflected the deliberate medical act of late term abortions. The statistics showed that, for the years 1990 to 1998, no records were kept to distinguish late term abortions from early terminations. There was one total for both procedures. Not until 1999 were separate records kept. The 1999 figure for late terms abortions over 20 weeks was 44. Nevertheless, to complete the picture of the last decade, I am reliably informed that, on average, there have been 32 late term abortions each year between 1990 and 1998.
I make three points in regard to these figures. Firstly, the 1999 figure of 44 is very high, almost one every week of the year, and a significant increase on other years. It is an unacceptable figure, given the general public's view. Secondly, the hospital have failed to act in an open, transparent and accountable manner, particularly given their dependence on public funding. They have attempted to hide the records of one of the most serious procedures in their hospital. Thirdly, the statistics show an appalling cultural acceptance by the hospital of late term abortions—a culture accepted from the hospital board down. This culture is running rife through the Royal Women's Hospital and was reinforced by a very public statement made by a senior and notable member of the hospital who, in the Sunday Age magazine some months ago, was quoted as accepting late term abortions for something as minor as a cleft lip. No other grounds are needed.
The culture has instilled in the doctors that they have no responsibility, but to act solely according to the patient's wishes—no responsibility to the law, to any ethics, least of all to this stand-alone human being. This culture of acceptance of the most shocking late destruction of a child is the shame of the Royal Women's Hospital. It is worthy of note that a late term abortion at the Royal Women's Hospital need not even be based on the grounds of a disability—rather, just the judgment of the doctors as to the physical and mental health of the patient. The hospital is effectively saying, `To relieve your anguish, we agree to destroy your child.' The board of the hospital is to be condemned for its weakness in allowing this culture of acceptance to flourish contrary to the law and public opinion. My claim is backed by information from more than one hospital source. The sources claim the board buckled under staff pressure and overturned the former chief executive officer's very correct decision to suspend the offending doctors involved in the 32-week abortion.
Thankfully what the board could not do was overturn the CEO's legal obligation to refer the incident to the state coroner for investigation under criminal law. This is where the matter now rests. It would seem the CEO paid a very high price for his actions. He resigned from his position very soon after the board's repudiation, no doubt under pressure to do so. The only concession given by the hospital board to the public outcry at this particular late term abortion was to belatedly establish some guidelines and a review panel, all internally managed, of course, and a poor substitute for the high price paid by the child and society's values. The panel is a token gesture to public opinion, especially if 44 late term abortions continue to occur each year. For such pitiless acts this does not seem strong enough action. It seems these procedures have now become as normal as the some 3,700 early term abortions. 
Given these facts, I call for the following outcomes. Firstly, the case of the 32-week abortion now before the Victorian coroner is a test case; the coroner has the power to recommend prosecutions in this particular case. It is my view that this is what the coroner must conclude. Secondly, it is imperative that the coroner brings down a judgment as soon as possible so as to put a halt to the increasing number of late term abortions. Thirdly, regardless of the coroner's decision, the law should be clarified to put beyond doubt the illegality of late term abortions. It cannot be viewed as a moral equivalent to an early term abortion. Presently, the 1969 Victorian Supreme Court decision known as the Menhenit ruling, which allows for early term abortions, is being used to justify late term abortions, yet this ruling directly conflicts with the criminal code relating to child destruction. Therefore, a separate law for late term abortions is necessary. Fourthly, there is a prima facie case against the hospital for breaking the law consistently in regard to the 44 late term abortions as recorded in the 1999 statistics. An investigation is warranted and prosecutions deserving if the law has not been strictly adhered to. At the very least, an investigation would clear the hospital of public suspicions, because presently the circumstances of the 44 are unknown.
Questions need to be asked such as: how many of the 44 cases breach the Crimes Act? How many late term abortions should have been referred to the coroner? And, how many, if any, of the 44 have had a birth and death certificate written, as is required? I fear that without public attention being brought to the Royal Women's Hospital's actions these activities will continue unabated. Incidents like those I have mentioned will go unchecked and, worse, be allowed to become the norm of hospital behaviour, even against public opinion. It is incumbent upon the responsible parliament, the Victorian parliament, and concerned community groups to condemn and prevent this hospital culture from flourishing.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC INTEREST</title>,"<title>Royal Women's Hospital, Melbourne: Abortions</title>",Matters of Public Interest,3,1
"Herron, Sen John",LP,2000-11-29,"—Yesterday Senator Evans asked a question of me directed to the Minister for Aged Care. I have received an answer from the Minister for Aged Care and I wish to incorporate the answer in Hansard.
Leave granted. 
The answer read as follows—
AGED CARE: APPOINTMENT OF COMMISSIONER FOR COMPLAINTS
SENATOR EVANS (2:35PM) - My question is directed to Senator Herron, the Minister representing the Minister for Aged Care. Does the minister recall evidence to the community affairs estimates committee that Mr Rob Knowles, the aged care complaints commissioner, is paid $80,000 a year for working three days a week? Can the minister explain why the position of complaints commissioner was not advertised nor any interviews conducted for the position? Can he confirm that Minister Wooldridge organised the appointment of his friend and Victorian colleague to this position?
SENATOR EVANS - Madam President, I ask a supplementary question. I thank the Minister for his answer to a question I did not ask but was going to ask at some time. He did not answer the key question of whether or not the job was advertised or interviews conducted. I would appreciate him giving me the answer to that. Can he also confirm for me that the job description and role for the complaints commissioner were finalised on only 31 August, more than a month after Mr Knowles was appointed to the position and began receiving his $80,000 a year salary. If you could take that on notice too, I would appreciate that, Minister.
SENATOR HERRON - The Minister for Aged Care has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question. The position of Commissioner for Complaints was created to provide an effective vehicle for the oversight and operation of the Aged Care Complaints Resolution Scheme and is part of the progression of the Government's aged care reforms. The role of the Commissioner for Complaints is formally established in the Committee Amendment Principles 2000 (No 1) signed on 31 August 2000.

"Calvert, Sen Paul",LP,2000-11-29,"—On behalf of Senator Coonan and the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, I give notice that 15 sitting days after today I shall move that the following delegated legislation, a list of which I shall hand to the Clerk, be disallowed.
The list read as follows—
1. Fisheries Research and Development Corporation Amendment Regulations 2000 (No.1), as contained in Statutory Rules 2000 No.270 and made under the Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act 1989. 
2. Fishing Levy Amendment Regulations 2000 (No.3), as contained in Statutory Rules 2000 No.271 and made under the Fisheries Management Act 1991 and the Fishing Levy Act 1991.
3. GST-free Supply (Drugs and Medicinal Preparations) Determination 2000 (No.2) made under paragraph 177-10(4)(c) of the A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Act 1999.
—As usual, I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a short summary of the matters raised by the committee.
Leave granted.
The summary read as follows—
Fisheries Research and Development Corporation Amendment Regulations 2000 (No. 1), Statutory Rules 2000 No. 270
The Regulations specify the research component for the levies attached to the Corporation for the 1997/98 and 1998/99 financial years, and correct an error in the commencement date for amendments made relating to the 1996/97 financial year. The Explanatory Statement notes that `the Attorney-General's Department has previously provided oral advice that such a retrospective commencement is both legally valid and, from a policy perspective, acceptable.' Given the substantial retrospective application of these amendments, the Committee has written to the Minister seeking written confirmation of this advice. 
Fishing Levy Amendment Regulations 2000 (No. 3), Statutory Rules 2000 No. 271
The Regulations specify the levy payable for each permit for the South Tasman Rise Fishery. The Explanatory Statement to these Regulations advises that the levy has been set following a review by AFMA in consultation with the South Tasman Rise Australian Trawl Association and all permit holders. However, there is no explanation of the actual basis on which the $3000 amount has been determined. 
GST-free Supply (Drugs and Medicinal Preparations) Determination 2000 (No. 2) made under paragraph 177-10(4)(c) of the A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Act 1999
This Determination amends the original Determination to allow specified categories of health goods which are released or developed after 1 July 2000 to be included in the GST-free category. The Explanatory Statement notes that the list of products in the original Determination contained `a number of unintended inclusions and omissions'. However, the Statement does not advise whether, as a result of the unintended omission, GST has been imposed on specific drugs and products when it should not have been imposed and whether, as a consequence, any person other than the Commonwealth has been disadvantaged.",SENATE,<title>NOTICES</title>,<title>Presentation</title>,Notices,6,1

"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2000-11-29,"—I table a statement by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Alexander Downer, on the 10th annual statement to parliament on Australia's Development Cooperation Program.",SENATE,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Australia's Development Cooperation Program</title>,Ministerial Statements,10,1
"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,2000-11-29,"—Senator O'Brien posed some questions just before we broke at lunchtime—
—Very good questions, too.
—They were very good questions, Senator Faulkner, and I have devoted considerable time to seeking answers for him. I can only proffer them for his inspection and then see where we go. First of all, I will deal with clause 9, where he questioned the wording `the Minister may declare a body to be the industry services body'. That clause needs to be read in its entirety. It is designed to provide discretion to the minister to declare the body to be the industry services body or the export control body only if conditions (a) to (d) are met and if, in particular, the constitution is appropriate and if the body has signed the deed of agreement.
You also asked what factors the minister would take into consideration in deciding if the constitution is appropriate. Certainly, the minister needs to be satisfied that the agreement reached between industry and government in the MOU, the memorandum of understanding, is fully reflected in the constitution of the company. Particular areas of scrutiny for the minister are the objects of the company, the different classes of membership, the agreed voting allocation, processes for the appointment and composition of the board, the establishment of industry advisory committees and their operation, provision for the annual levy payer meetings, the fact that no agripolitical activity is to be carried out and the fact that the company does not undertake commercial trading of horticultural product.
In relation to section 9(2)(c), the minister would have regard to whether the constitution of the body is considered appropriate for the administration of export control powers. Factors to be considered would include: that the company does not have a trading function which would place it in conflict with export licenses, that the company continues to deliver marketing services to the industry as outlined in its constitution, and that the government is satisfied that circumstances exist which require export control powers to apply—that is, that public benefits will be provided by the use of export control powers. 
Senator O'Brien's next question was: what processes are required for the minister to sign off on the constitution, and who does he consult with? The constitution has been developed with full industry consultation, as I indicated in my second reading speech, to reflect the interests of industry and the government. It has been drafted by independent legal advisers to comply with the Corporations Law and the government's requirements in terms of the scope and intended operation of the company to deliver marketing, research and development services and export control functions to the industry. It will be a registered document held by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission and will be publicly available. 
Another question from Senator O'Brien was: why are the declarations under clauses 9 and 10 not directly scrutinised by parliament? The declaration or cessation of declaration of the industry services body and the export control body are administrative decisions to be taken by the minister under clauses 9 and 10. The decisions must be made by the minister on the criteria set out in clauses 9(1), 9(2) and 10(2). A decision by the minister under these provisions will be subject to judicial review. Provision is made for public notification of these decisions in the Gazette within 14 days so that the industry, the parliament and the public generally are kept fully informed of the minister's decisions. The parliament is in a position to question the minister about these administrative decisions through the normal parliamentary processes should this be considered necessary. The normal parliamentary processes referred to would include questions in the parliament, letters to the minister, direct representation to the minister and committee inquiries, including Senate estimates.
Senator O'Brien also asked what form of judicial review the minister had in mind in references to clauses 9 and 10. The reply to the Senate Scrutiny of Bills Committee indicated that decisions by the minister under these provisions will be subject to judicial review. The judicial review provided for under the bill will be done under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 in the Federal Court to test the legality of the decision making process. This judicial review will satisfy the question of whether the minister's decision is lawful under the act.
Senator O'Brien also asked: will the parliament have access to the documents covered in clauses E4 to E8 of the deed of agreement? These clauses provide for accountability to the government for corporate planning, performance review, records and access, audit reporting and accountability, as per schedule 8 of the agreement. This is in accord with the current arrangements whereby the three current statutory bodies must provide their corporate planning documents to the government of the day. The corporate planning documents will be distributed widely throughout the industry for use in their planning investment decisions in marketing and research and development through the industry advisory committees. While there are no formal requirements for regular performance reviews with the current bodies, the government has built this requirement into the new company's operations. Full and accurate records are a requirement of the current bodies under the companies and corporations act, which applies to all statutory authorities. Because the new company will not be a statutory body, the government has built in this additional layer of accountability. An annual audit report is required, as per Corporations Law, and would be published in the annual report, which will be publicly available.
Senator O'Brien also asked: with regard to clause 10(2)(h), on what basis would the secretary require a change to the deed? This clause allows the government of the day to change the deed of agreement with the company to meet any future changed circumstances that the government believes should be taken into account by the company, for example, if there were a change in government policy concerning government funding or levy collections. With regard to section 16 and expenditure and funding of the industry services body, which was also a question from Senator O'Brien, this reflects the current arrangements that are in place under the Horticulture Research and Development Corporation Act which have been in practice since 1987. There is no intent by the government to change the matching arrangements or the method of payment to the company. That is, the government will match the levies collected from the industry and paid to the company up to a limit of 0.5 per cent of GVP. It should be noted that, under the deed of agreement, there are additional accountability requirements built in to ensure that marketing and research and development funds are kept separate. 
As well, there was a question as to how the government will determine the GVP. Clause 16(4) allows for a regulation to be set to determine the amount. It has been a longstanding practice of governments to request ABARE to calculate the GVP of the whole industry each year as an aggregate amount to be used for matching purposes. This is deemed the most practical arrangement, given the many small and variable commodity groups within horticulture where it is difficult to obtain accurate figures. Senator O'Brien's question which he asked just before we finished at 12.45 p.m. was: why does clause 16(5)(b) make provision for amounts not payable? This clause is to protect the government from being required to make double payments to an industry services body for marketing or research and development should there be a change from one declared industry services body to another during the course of the financial year.",SENATE,<title>HORTICULTURE MARKETING AND RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT SERVICES (REPEALS AND CONSEQUENTIAL PROVISIONS) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2000-11-29,"—The parliamentary secretary has answered a considerable number of the questions that I was going to put to her, but there is one that I would like her to clarify for us. Considering the industry service body will be funded from grower levies, what level of input would the growers have into the management and final decisions of that industry service body?",SENATE,<title>HORTICULTURE MARKETING AND RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT SERVICES (REPEALS AND CONSEQUENTIAL PROVISIONS) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,2000-11-29,"—The new company will have an annual general meeting, which all levy payers may attend. They also have access to decisions made by their own industry groups and the new company through the annual general meeting, their own industry groups, the industry advisory committee—which will be advising on research and development decisions—and, lastly, at the annual general meeting of the board. In my experience, any grower in horticulture who wants to make an opinion known or pass on his view of the way in which the money has been spent always knows who his industry representative is. Certainly there is free-flowing opinion through all of the horticulture groups that are represented in this new body. I do not think you need to have any doubt about the ability of an individual grower to make his opinion known at any stage of the process.",SENATE,<title>HORTICULTURE MARKETING AND RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT SERVICES (REPEALS AND CONSEQUENTIAL PROVISIONS) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2000-11-29,—Could I get some clarification from the minister as to what government expenses the government envisages will have to come out of the levies paid by the industry prior to that being transferred to the industry service body? I note that the minister has said that the cap on these levies will be 0.5 per cent of the GVP of the industry. What percentage of those levies would be likely to be deducted as government expenses?,SENATE,<title>HORTICULTURE MARKETING AND RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT SERVICES (REPEALS AND CONSEQUENTIAL PROVISIONS) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,2000-11-29,"—The only expense to the government is the administrative expense involved in collecting the levies before they are passed over to the new company, and that is contained within a section of the levies unit of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, which exists at present. That function and its expenses will not change. That is what exists now. That function and its associated expenses will be exactly the same.",SENATE,<title>HORTICULTURE MARKETING AND RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT SERVICES (REPEALS AND CONSEQUENTIAL PROVISIONS) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,2000-11-29,"—I have a couple of questions with regard to the interaction between the minister and the operation of the deed of agreement. As I understand it, the way in which accountability is to be provided is by virtue of a deed of agreement entered into between the Commonwealth and the company. Clause 12 of the bill says: 
The Minister may, on behalf of the Commonwealth, enter into a deed of agreement with a body ... for the purposes of this subsection.
Section 9, which gives the power to the minister to declare a body to be the industry services body and/or to be the industry export control body—and Senator O'Brien has already drawn attention to this—is again couched in the terms that a minister `may' make such declarations. In both 9(1)(d) and 9(2)(d) the conditions attached include a requirement that:  
... the body has entered into a deed of agreement with the Commonwealth ...
under subsection 12(1) and subsection 12(2) respectively. As I read that, the minister has the discretion as to whether or not he enters into a deed of agreement. He has the power to declare a body to be the industry services body and has the power to declare a body to be the industry export control body, but he can only exercise that power if that particular body has entered into a deed of agreement with the Commonwealth. Further, such a body can be the one company for the purposes of being both the industry services body and the export control body. But that is not necessarily the case; it can be two separate bodies or companies.
Having said all that, I would like to know why it is couched in the terms that the minister may enter into a deed of agreement. Shouldn't it be the case that, if there is a requirement or a condition to having a body designated as the industry services body or the export control body, there must be a deed of agreement? Therefore, there is an obligation on both the Commonwealth and the company to enter into such a deed of agreement. In effect, the question I am putting to you is: could there be circumstances where there would be no deed of agreement in existence? If that is the case, does that mean that, at any one point of time, there may not be an industry services body or an industry export control body? Further, is it intended that the company being established purely because of this legislation—Horticulture Australia—will be both the industry services body and the export control body? Is the primary intention that it be one company with both of those responsibilities? Or is that just for the time being and then it could be split between two other companies or two other bodies? Perhaps I will leave the questions at that.",SENATE,<title>HORTICULTURE MARKETING AND RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT SERVICES (REPEALS AND CONSEQUENTIAL PROVISIONS) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,2000-11-29,"—The intent of the legislation is to make the new company the industry services body and the export control body, but we have used the phrase that the minister may declare a body to be the industry services body to give him or her maximum flexibility in the future. As I have already described, the situation may arise in the future whereby this one body that has been designated to be both may not be fulfilling correctly its designated constitutional charter, according to the factors which he or she has to take into consideration, of being either of those two forms of organisation. Therefore, it is possible for the minister to declare another body as the industry services body or yet another one as the export control body. It is simply for a degree of flexibility so that, if this new company is not fulfilling its objectives properly, the minister may designate another body as that particular body. But obviously we assume that it would be doing just that.",SENATE,<title>HORTICULTURE MARKETING AND RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT SERVICES (REPEALS AND CONSEQUENTIAL PROVISIONS) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,2000-11-29,"—Thank you for that answer. I did understand the point you just made, but I am particularly interested in the first part of the question I asked regarding the fact that the deed of agreement is intended to be where the accountability measures are contained. The explanatory memorandum says:
The Bill allows for the industry services body to receive funding from the Commonwealth and requires both the industries services body and the export control body to act in accordance with a Deed of Agreement. The Deed of Agreement imposes obligations on the body and contains details about the body's accountability to the Commonwealth.
It may be a semantic point, but what I am a little confused about is that, on the one hand, the legislation says that the minister `may enter into a deed of agreement'—which assumes that he may not, for whatever reason—but, on the other hand, if the company is to be designated as either the industry services body or the export control body there must be a deed of agreement. The minister does not have any power to designate the company as the industry services body or as the industry export control body if a deed of agreement does not exist. The conundrum I have is that, if there is to be accountability, surely the legislation should make it mandatory that there be a deed of agreement that contains the accountability measures. That should be an obligation upon both the Commonwealth and the company. 
The follow-up question to that is: why is it the case that the deed of agreement method, if you like, is used to reflect the accountability requirements? Why can't that be included within the legislation itself? Further to that, could you clarify whether or not this model to be used for the horticultural industry, which says that if there is to be accountability for this company there will be this deed of agreement, has been used in the privatisation of other R&D corporations? It is my understanding that that is not necessarily the case.",SENATE,<title>HORTICULTURE MARKETING AND RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT SERVICES (REPEALS AND CONSEQUENTIAL PROVISIONS) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,2000-11-29,"—I will deal with Senator Forshaw's comments in the order that I think he made them. Firstly, the deed of agreement is not the only basis for accountability on which these whole new arrangements are based. We also have the legislation, and that includes any regulations or any other statutory instruments. We have the deed of agreement and we have the company constitution, and that includes any other corporate governance arrangements between members. The memorandum of understanding is made between the peak industry bodies acting on behalf of industry and the government and other key stakeholders. That is to formalise the policy-level agreement to the key elements of the reform package as well as to provide a blueprint and ongoing policy framework for the new arrangements.
The legislation, which is another prong of this, provides the basis for the public roles of the new company—that is, the industry services body, which is funded by marketing and research and development levies and matching R&D payments, and the industry export control body, which is administering a statutory regulatory scheme. As well, the legislation provides for the transfer of the assets, the liabilities and the staff of the statutory authorities to the new company. It also provides the public accountability framework for what I have just mentioned, including the possible withdrawal of the company's status as industry services body or industry export control body. It provides for other miscellaneous matters as required, including a definition of research and development. As I said, it may include regulations or other statutory instruments.
The deed of agreement specifies the agreed detailed public accountability requirements of the new company in respect of levy and matching funding for industry marketing and R&D services; the administration of the industry export control powers; and the assets, liabilities and staff of the statutory authorities transferred to the new company. This deed is entered into in accordance with the legislation and it is structured to operate in conjunction with the legislation and the company constitution. So the existence of this new company does not live or die by the existence of the deed of agreement. There are other prongs to this as well. There is also, of course, the Corporations Law accountability. The company's affairs are governed by the constitution and the Corporations Law. The company is owned by the members. The board has day to day management and control of the affairs of the company. The members—that is, the levy paying members—oversight the company's affairs through access to annual reports and company books, have the power to appoint or dismiss the board at a general meeting, and have the power to change the constitution at a general meeting and, in some cases, to bring legal proceedings on behalf of the company or in their own right.
As highlighted in the green paper, the standard Corporations Law governance arrangements can be modified by the company constitution. Some of the elements that are in the company constitution that may address your concerns are that the constitution is to implement the agreed policy position and to meet the public accountability requirements. They are things with which we are all familiar, such as the objects of the company; the membership and voting entitlements; the board composition and appointment process; the voluntary levy; levy contribution processes; corporate planning; industry advisory committee structures, processes and funding; peak industry body consultation funding and levy payer meetings; internal decision making processes for the imposition of export controls in some cases; prohibition on agripolitical activities; and the limitation on the distribution of assets to members on any winding up of the company. In relation to your last point, I am advised that similar conditions to this were brought into operation, for example, with the privatisation of Meat and Livestock Australia. So we do have a precedent for this.

"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2000-11-29,"—Could the minister, for the benefit of the committee, clarify who the secretary is that is referred to in clause 24, on page 26 of the bill? ",SENATE,<title>HORTICULTURE MARKETING AND RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT SERVICES (REPEALS AND CONSEQUENTIAL PROVISIONS) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,2000-11-29,"—The secretary referred to in that clause, Senator Harris, is the Secretary of the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. While I am on my feet, Senator Harris, you had some questions before we broke for lunch to which I might refer. You asked, for instance, whether if growers did not like the decisions of the board they would have access to the minister. The intention in privatising the industry services body is that the growers will have greater control and input into the decisions of the board. The minister would be available but he would be the last resort. To all intents and purposes, this is a self-governing company which is run with the authority of the growers and administered by the board that they choose to appoint. 
Senator Harris was also concerned that the company could grant export licences subject to certain conditions, and he asked whether this would constrain private companies' activities. I must say to Senator Harris that export licences are only issued at the request of industry with the majority of industry support. Up till now, industries have come to the government and asked for the issuing of an export licence. The government only acts as a response to industry. 
Senator Harris also asked whether the ability of the Secretary of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, in certain circumstances, to grant licences would restrict people's ability to export and trade. Yes, it will restrict people's activities in order to better manage markets but it must have industry support. I would cite the present export control that operates over the export of Australian citrus fruit to America, which became managed under an export control licence after a request by industry that that system be put into operation. That is an example. 
Senator Harris also observed that the application of the bill will be inside and outside Australia, meaning that research and development moneys could be invested in overseas projects. Yes, the board or the company will be able to invest in overseas projects as per the current research and development arrangements. Those arrangements operate now. If the board chooses to continue or to initiate new overseas investment programs, that is exactly what would happen.

"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2000-11-29,"—I thank the parliamentary secretary for those answers. I would seek some clarification from the parliamentary secretary regarding the proposed industry advisory committee. Can the parliamentary secretary advise us as to the make-up of that advisory committee? Also, would that industry advisory committee have any representation on the board of the industry service body? ",SENATE,<title>HORTICULTURE MARKETING AND RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT SERVICES (REPEALS AND CONSEQUENTIAL PROVISIONS) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,2000-11-29,"—I am advised that each industry has its own industry advisory committee, which has a very broad base. The sorts of people who are on industry advisory committees are not only growers but also processors and transporters, so that the industry advisory committee is as wide as possible. Although those industry advisory committees will not be directly represented on the board, they advise and can consult with the board as to the way in which industry plans can be implemented. So there is certainly direct input, even though they will not be directly represented on the board.  ",SENATE,<title>HORTICULTURE MARKETING AND RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT SERVICES (REPEALS AND CONSEQUENTIAL PROVISIONS) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2000-11-29,"—I thank the parliamentary secretary for the answers which were given to those matters which I gave notice of prior to 2.45 today. In relation to this arrangement in clause 9 of the bill and the permissive nature of the powers granted to the minister, if I can put it that way, I understand what she says about the flexibility that is intended to be granted to the minister now and in the future, but the difficulty is that for the minister to be able to exercise those powers the minister has to have entered into a deed of agreement with the Commonwealth. It seems that, having entered into the deed of agreement, the permissive nature of the powers is a little irrelevant. 
You raise the issue of the cessation of declarations under clause 10 of the bill and how the minister might need flexibility at that point to enter into another arrangement, even though there was an existing deed of agreement between the Commonwealth and, for the purposes of the argument, the current Horticulture Australia Ltd body. That is the body that will be, at the first point, potentially the subject of clause 10 of the bill. 
This goes to the other point I made about these provisions being reviewable at law in an administrative sense. You advise that that is reviewable through the Federal Court—and those proceedings may well take some time. It raises the question in my mind of what occurs in the process of such a review if one body is seeking to have a decision to cease declarations under section 10 of the bill and the minister, at the same time, is entering into alternative arrangements under section 9 of the bill, having signed off another memorandum of understanding or agreement or whatever as provided in 9(1)(d) and 9(2)(d). What would the effect be of entering one agreement where there was a review by the court which struck down the original decisions of the minister under section 10 of the bill? Might I say that nothing in the answer has dealt with the issue of whether the parliament ought to have a greater right to review any of these decisions, be they the decision to enter into a deed of agreement or to make declarations to cease deeds of agreement. 
Under sections 9 and 10 of the bill, I note that you say that the decisions will be published and available and be able to be dealt with by the committees, including the estimates committee, of the parliament. But I would like to know a little more of the reasoning as to why essentially the power within the parliament is restricted to the executive and there is no provision apparently intended to give effect to the declarations by a regulation which would then be the subject of review by the parliament. One might suggest that, particularly at decisions to act under section 10 of the bill to cease declarations, these sorts of matters might be better dealt with by an action which would be reviewable by the parliament and, because of the way in which those matters are dealt with, could be dealt with much more expeditiously than proceedings before the Federal Court and might well obviate the problems that would arise by the review process that the parliamentary secretary suggests is adequate and provided by the legislation.
Another question which I might put in relation to these arrangements—I have to use this because it is the only thing available to me—is about the constitution of the new company and the constituent parts of that company; that is, the 29 organisations contained in the schedule on page 31. It is certainly not unknown that within grower groups of various commodities from time to time alternative organisations arise and there are significant groups of growers who seek alternative representation. But these arrangements would effectively lock in the representational groups, as I understand it, to the groups specified in the constitution. Now it may be—and this may be the answer; but I seek some clarification from the parliamentary secretary—that the minister might make some direction as to the constitution of the body, but I am not sure where that appears in the bill. I can see that the minister can enter into deeds of agreement and may vary the deeds and require variation of deeds but, when the representational capacity of the Corporations Law body is called into question by changes within representational bodies within the constituent groups, is there anything in the bill which would allow the minister to require the admission to the Corporations Law company of significant bodies that are no longer represented by the constituents of the original company? ",SENATE,<title>HORTICULTURE MARKETING AND RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT SERVICES (REPEALS AND CONSEQUENTIAL PROVISIONS) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,2000-11-29,"—I am sure Senator O'Brien would appreciate that at present the industry bodies that have signed up to the memorandum of understanding are designated as peak industry bodies because they are deemed by the minister at present to represent the people in that particular industry and they are seen as the main group within the industry. It is undeniable that in some industries—and not just in horticulture—there are other smaller groups which also claim to have some representational power and want to be or would like to be designated as the peak industry body. The avenue for them to do that is always possible at the annual general meetings of the peak industry bodies where, I presume, a vote of no confidence or what have you would need to be passed in the peak industry body and presumably, if sufficient majority industry support could be gained, another group may become the peak industry body. But that is largely a matter for organisation by the industries themselves. The government does not presume to interfere in that. So it is usually apparent what the major group is in each industry. If another group within the industry seeks to challenge that, they would need to do that through the organisational structure of the industry itself. 
I turn to Senator O'Brien's first question where he asked whether it was necessary to have a much longer and wider view of the ability of the minister to declare or to cease to declare the industry services body and the export control body as such. The minister needs to have that power because, if he made a cessation of declaration of those two bodies and that action then became embroiled in the courts, it would obviously be necessary for the minister to declare another body as the industry services body or the export control body in order to keep operations going. I have no doubt that, if it was necessary to take such an extreme course of action, it would be the subject of debate in parliament. When setting up a new company, it is always advisable to keep arrangements flexible. I certainly do not mean flexible and open-ended in the sense that anything can happen. What I do mean is providing for contingencies so that if any company, either the industry services company or the export control body, did become unworkable, somebody would be able to act in the best interests of the industry to keep those two organisations going by declaring another body or another organisation as the one that would carry out that function. That is the reason why this clause has been written in the way that it has.",SENATE,<title>HORTICULTURE MARKETING AND RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT SERVICES (REPEALS AND CONSEQUENTIAL PROVISIONS) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2000-11-29,"—That demonstrates the point that I make. If there is a delay occasioned by extensive proceedings before the court, the problem that the parliamentary secretary raises has no solution in the bill—in the sense that she suggests something would have to be put in place quickly so there was not a vacuum. By putting something in place you would either prejudice the outcome of the proceedings before the tribunal as to what would happen if you lost, or alternatively you would end up, at the end of the proceedings, with two organisations which were authorised. That is one of the reasons why I would persist with the point. I suggest that, in all likelihood, it would be much more expeditious to have this process the subject of review by regulation, or other reviewable instrument, whereby the minister's decision was reviewable by the parliament. Given the number of sitting days that these matters lie on the table, I suspect that would probably be a much shorter period than the period for judicial review. It may be that judicial review will occur in some cases in any event. I would need to take advice on that. I suspect the minister would be in a much better position if he or she gave effect to that decision by way of an instrument reviewable by the parliament where the parliament had not reviewed that decision.",SENATE,<title>HORTICULTURE MARKETING AND RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT SERVICES (REPEALS AND CONSEQUENTIAL PROVISIONS) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,2000-11-29,"—As someone who has some acquaintance with agriculture, I am sure Senator O'Brien would be the first to recognise that these types of horticultural bodies in particular, which depend so much on valuable export markets for their returns, need to have a degree of certainty with regard to operations, particularly with the writing of contracts and the keeping of contracts, especially with our overseas trading partners. It was felt necessary to write this legislation in such a way so that there would be a solution to the failure of the designated company to provide these services. You cannot very well say, `We need a solution if something happens, but this is no solution.' With the greatest of respect, a parliamentary inquiry or a review by parliament may be the least professional way of dealing with it. Certainly, the minister should have the capacity to put something immediately in place so that a proper examination could take place through the judicial review and the operations of the company on a day-to-day basis could go on as normal so that industry's viability was not jeopardised in any way. That is the way the government sees it. ",SENATE,<title>HORTICULTURE MARKETING AND RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT SERVICES (REPEALS AND CONSEQUENTIAL PROVISIONS) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2000-11-29,"—I thank the parliamentary secretary for her comments. That may well be the way the government sees it, but I understand the Senate Scrutiny of Bills Committee continues to disagree with the government's approach on this matter. I refer to what I understand to be the relevant passages in the parliamentary secretary's original correspondence as to why the declarations under clauses 9 and 10 are not directly scrutinised by the parliament. The committee states:
The Committee thanks the Parliamentary Secretary for this response which indicates that `administrative decisions' such as the declaration or removal of a company as the industry services body will be subject to `the normal Parliamentary processes'.
Under the proposed arrangements, some Parliamentary oversight of such decisions might be possible (for example, through the authority of Senate Legislation Committees to inquire into annual reports and the performance of departments and agencies). However, it is clear that this oversight will be more limited than that which presently exists. For example, it is unlikely that any declared industry services corporation will remain subject to the Senate Estimates processes. 
Given this more limited oversight, the Committee continues to draw Senators' attention to these provisions as they may insufficiently subject the exercise of delegated legislative power to parliamentary scrutiny, in breach of principle 1(a)(v) of the Committee's terms of reference.
As this was presented to the Senate only in the last hour, it is a matter which the Senate might like to think about. Even though there have been representations between the parliamentary secretary and the committee, the committee continues to feel that there is an inadequacy in this provision as to parliamentary scrutiny.
With all the goodwill in the world I think it is difficult to come to the view at this stage that the measures that the government seeks to put in place are adequate. I do not want to unnecessarily draw attention to a particular officer, but I am reminded that, for example, in relation to questions asked in estimates about things such as AWB Ltd and the dairy industry activities where matters have been removed from the government's purview to that of a private company, Mr Roseby has been at pains to advise the committee that he cannot answer the questions, that they are matters to be put to particular companies and that really there is no point in raising those sorts of matters at the estimates committees. This is the sort of potential scrutiny problem which arises. It does not just arise in relation to this aspect of the arrangement; it arises in relation to others.
What appears to be the problem here, as I said in my contribution to the second reading debate, is that this is a device which is designed to concentrate the control of this issue in the executive rather than in the parliament. Combined with what the minister's powers are, when that is the relationship between entities which are declared under section 9 of the bill, this is going to create problems in a scrutiny sense in going behind matters as to financial arrangements between the Commonwealth and these companies and other matters which are relevant—because of this barrier in the formation of the Corporations Law company.
I would be interested if the parliamentary secretary could give us a view particularly on what the Scrutiny of Bills Committee has to say about provisions in clauses 9 and 10 of the bill, given that there has been a degree of interchange between that committee and the parliamentary secretary. The parliamentary secretary has attempted to convince the committee that the government approach is correct, and at this stage the committee is saying that they do not agree with the view of the parliamentary secretary. ",SENATE,<title>HORTICULTURE MARKETING AND RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT SERVICES (REPEALS AND CONSEQUENTIAL PROVISIONS) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,2000-11-29,"—Yes, I have noted the view of the Senate Scrutiny of Bills Committee, but I would like to point out to Senator O'Brien that the whole point is that we are moving from a statutory body to a private company under Corporations Law, as we have with the meat industry and as we have with the grains industry, and that requires a different set of reporting arrangements, outside the traditional ones that have applied to date. That is why the government has worked so closely with the industry to establish new reporting arrangements, to ensure that the government's information requirements are met.
I indicated in my opening remarks on this legislation that the last 2½ years have been spent in almost daily contact with the leaders of the 28 organisations that have signed on to the memorandum of understanding. Those industry groups are totally comfortable with the arrangements that we have put in place for their future, and this legislation in its present form has—more than the majority—the unanimous support of industry. I note the comments of the Senate Scrutiny of Bills Committee, but recollecting from my time on the Senate Scrutiny of Bills Committee and indeed as chairman—
—A very good one too.
—Thank you, Senator Forshaw.
—I was a member at the time.
—You were indeed. I certainly do not mean that all objections should be overridden, but parliament in its widest form is the will of the people and if industry is comfortable with this, if there is no comment—and certainly it is outright approval coming from industry; they are happy with these arrangements—and the government considers that these arrangements are suitable, we can only take it to mean that that is the view of the government.",SENATE,<title>HORTICULTURE MARKETING AND RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT SERVICES (REPEALS AND CONSEQUENTIAL PROVISIONS) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2000-11-29,"—I cannot let that comment pass without this comment: one would expect the organisations who are the beneficiaries of this legislation to support it and one would not necessarily expect them to be looking beyond the immediate tenure of their organisation and to the impact of the legislation for the future. That may not be totally fair, but we have to make assumptions based on the legislation and projected into the future and we cannot be certain that the protagonists now are doing that. I think the purpose of the comments such as those from the Scrutiny of Bills Committee are that this is legislation which deals in part with the body which is going to expend Commonwealth funds. The issue arises: how should that be scrutinised and indeed how should decisions of the minister to appoint and to revoke the appointment of such bodies be reviewable by the parliament? They are the provisions which we are reviewing at the moment. 
There is another provision which we have not touched on at the moment, which deals with their response to section 29 of this bill, where they come to an almost identical view. We will come to that later. We are not here debating whether the organisations who have signed up to the constitution and the memorandum of agreement freely did so. We are debating the legislation which underpins that and the ramifications of the legislation—how it is going to work now and in the future and what the role of the parliament is going to be in that. I understand the government's position and the minister's preference for that power to be held within the executive. The concern that ought to be expressed is that a great many senators would have some difficulty with effectively removing part of the power of scrutiny of the parliament—and I stress the word `part'—because of the new arrangements.
We could have a full debate about the effect of corporation, privatisation and commercial-in-confidence material that we come upon during the estimates process on many occasions, but here we are dealing with a piece of legislation which will create the circumstances which give us problems in other areas. In this case, they are magnified, because even decisions on appointment and revocation are not reviewable by the parliament, so even more of the equation is being moved from the parliament by this process. That is the point I am making. I know where the government is coming from, and it needs a more persuasive argument from the government to justify this aspect of the bill.

"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,2000-11-29,"—I want to add a couple of comments, because what Senator O'Brien said is quite correct. Indeed, if you go back to the speeches in the second reading debate made by Senator Woodley and me—and by the shadow minister in the other place—this question of accountability for Commonwealth matching funds is very much at the heart of the issue. We recognise that there is a tension, if you like, built up in the sense that, if you are privatising the entity and trying to put more control in the hands of growers and industry, that is an appropriate objec-tive in these circumstances. But what seems to be happening—it is something that we have raised on a number of occasions, and it has been raised by members of all parties through the committee process—is that this is leading to a significant reduction—almost elimination—of the opportunity of the parliament, and certainly of the Senate committee, to pursue issues of accountability.
Just to elaborate on that, the parliamentary secretary mentioned earlier that she was following the model of the meat industry. There are different models. Certainly in the case of the wool industry—that bill is going to come on tomorrow—I am sure we will raise similar issues. The question of accountability in the wool industry has been raised by members of parliament not only under the new structure, but also under the existing structure. There have been concerns expressed—I think it is well known—that, even under some of the existing arrangements, whereby information is provided through the portfolio budget statements and/or the annual reports, both those of the department and also those of the specific corporations, you have still got to do a lot of detective work, a lot of searching, to get the information that you want. That has certainly been the case in respect of one major matter in the wool industry. I am sure the parliamentary secretary knows what I am talking about without my going into detail. I highlight the fact that, at least under the current structures, the R&D corporations, when they are all published in the PBSs and the annual reports, provide an opportunity on the surface, laid on the table, to pursue these issues. Similarly, our committee is shortly to report on another issue in the meat industry. Again, the question of accountability—this time not so much in respect of accountability regarding matching funds but in terms of accountability to do with decision making processes which ultimately benefit some people in the industry as against others—was an important matter for the committee to inquire into. We have been doing that.
As I said, I do not want to go into detail in those matters, because they are still to come before the parliament in the next few days, but I am very concerned—and I know other members of the committee are concerned; I am sure all senators would be concerned—that this is a somewhat convoluted process. As Senator O'Brien said, you get officials of the department before the committee—notwithstanding the fact that, generally speaking, in our committee in estimates we have a pretty good understanding with the departmental officers, who at all times try to be as helpful and as forthcoming as possible—who nevertheless respond by saying, `We're sorry, we are just not able to advise you as to what happened to those matching government funds, because they are in a private company.' That has now occurred in, I think, two or three situations.
That also points to the problem that, notwithstanding your comments about what ability the members might have, we find often that, because it is industry bodies or industry organisations that are represented, the grower members themselves are often the ones that are left in the dark. You need only to look at the saga of what happened to AWRAP, the wool research and promotion body. That was the end result. I note—and I ask you to comment on this as well—that, from reading the legislation and the memorandum of understanding, there is more emphasis on accountability in terms of the minister's powers to impose penalties such as withdrawing their status as an industry services body or export control body and so on than there is in terms of being proactive about providing an opportunity to the parliament to pursue accountability issues. I note from the explanatory memorandum that all of the rhetoric is about what the minister can do to penalise or punish the company for doing the wrong thing, rather than focusing on what should be required in the first place to make them open and accountable so that the likelihood of imposing those penalties would be really very much a last resort. ",SENATE,<title>HORTICULTURE MARKETING AND RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT SERVICES (REPEALS AND CONSEQUENTIAL PROVISIONS) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,2000-11-29,"—I would firstly say that accountability has actually been raised under the new structure for wool, but that is something that we will no doubt be discussing tomorrow. What the Labor Party are actually saying is that they do not accept the model which has been developed after 2½ years work with the industry and government, and they want to unravel it. There is plenty of accountability built into the model. What I think you do not understand is that, instead of the old statutory authority arrangements which were set in place by the government and administered by the government, these new arrangements for industry are a partnership. They are a partnership between industry on the one hand, which has to constitute and work in the sense of keeping the wheels rolling along, and a new company. There are various conditions which industry, through its ownership of the company, must meet in order to maintain the government flow of matching dollars.
The government should not be running agricultural companies. That is the view of this government and, I believe, in part it was the view of your government. That is why over the last 10 years there has been a movement away from government running businesses, leaving industry to manage their own affairs. We have imposed conditions on this new company and it must strictly adhere to those because the deed of agreement is a legally enforceable document. If the company does not conform, you are quite right: we will move to what the government then needs to do to designate another company which will carry out the functions for which the company was set up. The ultimate sanction is undeclaring the company so that it cannot receive levy funds, it cannot receive matched funds and it cannot administer export control powers. You cannot have it both ways. There is a partnership between industry and the government. Each side must fulfil its side of the bargain.
Apart from what the minister can or cannot do, the annual reports of the company will be public documents. There will be a company annual general meeting and, as we have seen in various private sector companies in recent weeks, annual general meetings can be very interesting affairs. I would expect the levy payers of the new horticultural company to take the same amount of interest in the way that their money is spent. There are levy payer annual meetings, there are corporate plans which are circulated widely and there is the whole system of parliamentary scrutiny. To go by your remarks, Senator Forshaw, and those of Senator O'Brien, you would begin to imagine that the whole system of parliamentary scrutiny had suddenly been removed, that we had no more questions in question time, that we had no more questions on notice, that we had no more Senate committees and that all of that level of scrutiny was totally removed. It has not been removed; it is in place, just as it has always been. I am sure that if a parliament wishes to inquire into the workings of this company, that is exactly what it will do. But there must be a level of ability on the part of the minister to act when necessary. I am sorry that perhaps the Senate Scrutiny of Bills Committee and I do not see eye to eye on this matter, but we believe that the level of accountability which has been built into this legislation is more than adequate for the purpose for which it is designed.",SENATE,<title>HORTICULTURE MARKETING AND RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT SERVICES (REPEALS AND CONSEQUENTIAL PROVISIONS) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2000-11-29,"—Would the parliamentary secretary, for the record, indicate who is the current secretary of AFFA, which is the agriculture, fisheries and forestry department? Also, turning to the bill, in section 25 it says: 
No action, suit or other proceeding for damages lies against the industry export control body or officers of that body for any loss or injury directly or indirectly suffered as a result of anything done, or omitted to be done, in the exercise or performance, or the purported exercise or performance ...
What we have in the government's bill is the intention to have those officers protected against any action that could be brought against them by a grower or any other third party in relation to their actual carrying out of the functions of their office. When we look at part 2 of the bill, which refers to the industry service body and the industry export control body, it lists it as a company listed by guarantee under the Corporations Law. So we have all of a sudden a company limited by guarantee under which the officers in that entity are immune from prosecution for any actions that they subsequently carry out or, equally as important, any omissions or actions that they do not carry out in relation to those duties. I would seek from the parliamentary secretary an explanation from the government as to why they believe that this section in the bill is required.

"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,2000-11-29,"—I should indicate to Senator Harris that the current Secretary of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry Australia is Mr Michael Taylor. Secondly, with regard to his comment on that particular clause, the clause is standard in all Corporations Law companies, and I would advise Senator Harris to read further to where at the end of that section it says `unless the act or omission was in bad faith'. So there is a capacity for those officers to be prosecuted or moved against in a legal way, and that is standard practice for that particular way of interpreting things.",SENATE,<title>HORTICULTURE MARKETING AND RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT SERVICES (REPEALS AND CONSEQUENTIAL PROVISIONS) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2000-11-29,"—If I can return to the comments that the parliamentary secretary made in response to my earlier remarks, I am not sure whether there was a specific provision in the agreement between the industry bodies and the government that these arrangements would not be reviewable by the parliament or whether there was a general agreement that was signed up to without considering that issue. Be that as it may, the reality is that the difference that we have about parliamentary scrutiny is not on the issue of whether this arrangement should be achieved by way of a Corporations Law company. That has not been the point of my question at all, Parliamentary Secretary. To the extent that you suggested that it was, I think you are not representing my contribution very accurately at all. 
What we were saying was that, when the arrangements between the Commonwealth on the one hand and the Corporations Law company on the other hand are dealt with by the bill, it was more appropriate that the activities of the Commonwealth be reviewable by the parliament and not left in the hands of the executive. That is the thin line of the arrangement that we are really directing our questions at. So it is not accurate to represent our views as being fundamentally opposed to the arrangements that you are seeking to put in place. What we are opposing is the very same matter that the Scrutiny of Bills Committee is saying is a breach of principle 1(a)(v) of that committee's terms of reference, which is that the arrangements may insufficiently subject the exercise of delegated legislative power to parliamentary scrutiny. It seems to me that we should forget the argument about the industry arrangements for the moment, because we are not really arguing about what is in the memorandum of agreement and we are not really arguing about what is in the constitution of the new body; we are really having the debate about the role of the minister and the role of the parliament in this. If we can restrict ourselves to that, we will not get sidetracked to irrelevant issues too often.
Whilst that is under consideration, having had the matter of the secretary injected into the debate, I note that the industry export control body will have certain powers but will not have the power to determine which horticultural product and which markets will be regulated—that is a matter for the secretary. The secretary only will have the power to prohibit export of agricultural products, and that is a power which the Australian Horticultural Corporation currently possesses. I want to find out why this power is being transferred to the secretary and why it does not proceed to the new company. I suggest that, on the face of it, it appears that there is a centralisation of some of the powers of the AHC to the executive, not devolving it to industry, as is apparently the objective of this measure. ",SENATE,<title>HORTICULTURE MARKETING AND RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT SERVICES (REPEALS AND CONSEQUENTIAL PROVISIONS) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,2000-11-29,"—In answer to Senator O'Brien's query, the reason that that power is now vested in the secretary is that it is a regulatory impact, if you like, or something which needs to be regulated by a regulator, I suppose you could say, rather than a company, which at the moment happens to be the Australian Horticultural Corporation. Because it is seen as a regulatory office or a regulatory function, it was deemed that that was best vested in the secretary.
To return to your earlier comments, I understand perfectly the argument you are putting to me, so I would not like it thought that I was attempting to divert the point of the argument. I do understand that the point you are making is about the power of the minister and the parliamentary processes which should and will occur. I simply return to my earlier point that none of those parliamentary processes have changed, that there is the whole gamut of parliamentary scrutiny which can and no doubt will take place. I have never yet noticed that a Senate committee which is intent on pursuing a particular point of scrutiny or undertaking scrutiny of a particular action or whatever is able to be diverted from its course. That is still perfectly possible, and I am sure that in the future it may well take place. I would also like to point out to Senator O'Brien that this actual letter to me from the Scrutiny of Bills Committee indicated that the point of making the minister's powers as they were may be a breach—may be a breach.

"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2000-11-29,"—In the minister's second reading speech mention was made of savings of half a million dollars in relation to fees.

Will it be the government, the industry or actually the individual growers who will benefit from a reduction in the fees that are payable?",SENATE,<title>HORTICULTURE MARKETING AND RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT SERVICES (REPEALS AND CONSEQUENTIAL PROVISIONS) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1

So the actual savings are not cash savings and they will simply be absorbed as less money being spent in the new company's operational structure.",SENATE,<title>HORTICULTURE MARKETING AND RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT SERVICES (REPEALS AND CONSEQUENTIAL PROVISIONS) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2000-11-29,"—The other matter that is raised by the Scrutiny of Bills Committee is clause 29 of the bill. Parliamentary Secretary, you have debated this with the Scrutiny of Bills Committee. In response to their initial Alert Digest, you gave an example relating particularly to section 29(1)(a)(i). You gave as an example the suspension of a joint research project with a country with which Australia might have suspended diplomatic relations. You also gave an example where there might be a disease outbreak that might require a national response. It would appear, however, that there is no limitation on the exercise of ministerial power under this provision; it is open ended. Therefore decisions could perhaps be subjective if left to the minister alone without any guidance. Under this provision, direction to the board of the new company would mean that the board had no choice but to comply. It is true to say that the minister can permit this decision to be a disallowable instrument but only if the minister wishes it to be so, so it is an optional disallowable instrument, if I can call it that. 
Given that the same finding in this area has been made by the Scrutiny of Bills Com-mittee—that is, that it may `insufficiently subject the exercise of delegated legislative power to parliamentary scrutiny'; that is the wording of the finding of the committee in the report to the parliament—it would be interesting to get a response, particularly as your initial response to the Scrutiny of Bills Committee has not changed their view as to what they feel may be an insufficiency in this measure in terms of parliamentary scrutiny.
Whilst that matter is being considered, there were matters raised in the Bills Digest on this bill which raised the issue of what the terms the `national interest' and `exceptional and urgent circumstances' in this provision might mean. Presumably, the government had something in mind, or the legislative drafter had something in mind, with that provision. Given that at the moment the bill gives almost protected action status to the minister's action if he or she so wishes, perhaps we should have something more on the record about that. In your comments to the Scrutiny of Bills Committee, you state:
The minister can be questioned about any directions through the normal parliamentary processes once parliament is informed of these through the regular reporting requirements imposed on the company.
If the minister chose not to table a direction in the so-called national interest, when and how would parliament become aware of that direction?",SENATE,<title>HORTICULTURE MARKETING AND RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT SERVICES (REPEALS AND CONSEQUENTIAL PROVISIONS) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,2000-11-29,"—Perhaps I could deal with Senator O'Brien's last comment first. The minister would normally need to table that and therefore parliament would become aware of that quite rapidly. Secondly, he asked the reason why the bill makes no provision for parliamentary scrutiny of directions under clause 29 or how parliament is to be made aware of and able to scrutinise determinations not to table such directions. Clause 29 of the bill is consistent with section 32 of the present Australian Horticultural Corporation Act 1987 in that it provides for a direction made by the minister under clause 29 to be tabled in parliament within 15 sitting days. Neither the present Australian Horticultural Corporation Act 1987 nor the bill goes the further step of providing for such directions to be disallowable instruments, and this would be inappropriate given the exceptional and urgent national interest grounds on which a direction can be given by the minister.
The only circumstance where tabling would not occur is if the minister made a written direction that tabling would be likely to prejudice the national interest of Australia or the body's commercial interests. This provision is designed to protect the nation and the company in circumstances where tabling the direction could be harmful to those interests. It is seen as necessary to provide such safeguards in the legislation, although it is acknowledged that parliament would not be informed immediately of the determination. I repeat that the minister can be questioned about any directions through the normal parliamentary processes once parliament is informed of them through the regular reporting requirements imposed on the company.
In answer to the question from Senator O'Brien regarding what the national interest and exceptional and urgent circumstances are, I think that the two examples I gave in my response to the Scrutiny of Bills Committee stand up very well. For example, the national industry services body could be required to immediately suspend a research and development program or marketing program because to continue the spending would place the national interest at risk, such as ongoing research expenditure with a country with which we had suspended all diplomatic and commercial relations. A similar situation would be if we suddenly became involved in a military conflict with a country. The outbreak of a horticultural disease is also possible, and that would require an urgent national response, including urgent research and development and/or marketing initiatives to be taken in the national interest. This provision of the bill would allow the minister to immediately engage the company and, if necessary, to direct the company to allocate resources to the necessary research and development and marketing programs.

"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2000-11-29,"—I would like to move to the Horticulture Marketing and Research and Development Services (Repeals and Consequential Provisions) Bill 2000. Section 22 on page 15 of the bill goes to the amounts payable to the industry services body, amounts based on the charges and levies that are received by the Commonwealth. Given that we are moving into a situation where the growers are going to have a limited corporation administering the industry, can the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry advise us as to how those levies and charges can be altered? What happens if this corporation gets into trading difficulties? What happens if substantial research is required—for example, if Australia were unfortunate enough to have an outbreak of Pierce's disease? This is taking over part of the responsibility of the original horticultural groups that were representing the people drying fruit, particularly in Victoria and southern New South Wales. If there were an enormous call on research and development—as we saw in North Queensland with the papaya fruit fly—would the corporate body be responsible for that R&D or the physical eradication of the disease, or would that responsibility still remain with the government departments? Could the parliamentary secretary clarify for us whether the growers—the hard-working Aussie farmers—could be exposed to higher charges and levies because of this change to a corporate body?",SENATE,<title>HORTICULTURE MARKETING AND RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT SERVICES (REPEALS AND CONSEQUENTIAL PROVISIONS) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,2000-11-29,"—The government has guidelines for the initiation of and changes to levies, and there are approximately 12 clauses to that guidelines section. I will not delay the Senate by going right through them, but basically any change to a levy must come as a request from the industry for the government to set in place regulations changing that levy. As I am currently the person responsible for levies within the government, the industry must demonstrate to me that that change in the levy rate has the support of a significant majority of the industry. I do not change the rate of that levy until I am perfectly satisfied that there is significant majority support behind that change, which has been requested by the industry. So that request must come from the industry, and I have to be satisfied as to the level of support behind it.
With regard to trading difficulties, I am not sure quite what Senator Harris means by that, because this company will not be involved in commercial activities; it will simply provide marketing and research and development services to the industry. There is not an element of trading in that, and obviously any undue level of financial difficulty would be picked up in advance, I would say, by the annual report, by the financial audit—by all of those provisions that I outlined earlier in the debate. 
With regard to the allocation of funds for disease, yes, it is the function of the board to decide how the funds that the company has within its disposal will be allocated. Within the bounds of coping with any disease outbreak, there are other sections of government which would also be assisting an industry to cope with that, such as quarantine and other plant and animal health arms of government. Industry would not totally bear the brunt of that, but may well decide as a board to allocate money from its available funds to deal with that disease outbreak—but that is a decision for the board.",SENATE,<title>HORTICULTURE MARKETING AND RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT SERVICES (REPEALS AND CONSEQUENTIAL PROVISIONS) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2000-11-29,"—Could the parliamentary secretary also clarify whether or not this company, which is supported both by industry levies and charges and by government contributions, would be allowed to engage in share transactions of any other companies listed on the Stock Exchange? In other words, is it limited in its ability to speculate in any way, shape or form, considering that it is administering the funds of both the growers and the taxpayers of Australia?",SENATE,<title>HORTICULTURE MARKETING AND RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT SERVICES (REPEALS AND CONSEQUENTIAL PROVISIONS) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1

"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,2000-11-29,"—During the second reading debate and during the committee stage, the opposition indicated that we were supportive of this legislation in principle, but we did have some concerns about the adequacy of the accountability measures in the legislation, which we believe are lacking. What has transpired during the committee stage thus far leaves us with substantial concerns that the accountability measures are not sufficient. Further, we note that the report of the Senate Scrutiny of Bills Committee—and it was tabled only this afternoon—has raised the same concerns that we have raised and has done so very specifically. That committee, which I remind the Senate and the parliamentary secretary is chaired by a government senator— 
—It is always chaired by an opposition senator. You should know that, Senator.
—My apologies. It is chaired by an opposition member, that is correct, but it does contain members of the government. That committee has continued to raise its concerns, notwithstanding the responses in the interchange which has taken place between the parliamentary secretary and the committee. On that basis, we feel we have to consider the real possibility of moving some amendments to the legislation with respect to the issue of accountability, particularly relating to the sections which go to declarations and other actions by the minister. I understand this has been raised with the Government Whip and the parliamentary secretary. Therefore, I move:
That the committee report progress and seek leave to sit again.
In moving that motion, in no way can it be taken that the opposition are seeking to delay this legislation. We are as keen as the government to have it disposed of. I am sure that is self-evident. These are real issues which we believe need to be given proper consideration. It is only in the context of the debate in the committee and the report of the Scrutiny of Bills Committee tabled only an hour or so ago that we have been put in this position.
Question resolved in the affirmative.

"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,2000-11-29,"—I rise to speak on the Privacy Amendment (Private Sector) Bill 2000. Over the last few years, I am sure most people will agree that the growth of e-commerce and the use of the Internet in business have been truly staggering. In the future, we can expect that more and more consumers will look to the Internet to select and to purchase all sorts of goods and services, whether they be filling up the virtual grocery basket or butcher's basket; buying tickets to theatre or sport; or something I suppose I have fallen victim to: purchasing CDs, books and other items; or choosing an investment service from one of the thousands that are on offer. I think that senators who have ever bought a service or product over the Internet will be familiar with the new ritual and how much time we all seem to spend not just shopping but also seeing what is available on the world market.
What normally happens is that a dialogue box opens and the consumer is required to provide those items of information necessary for the Internet retailer or service provider to complete the transaction. This includes the name of the person, a delivery address, phone numbers, fax numbers, credit card numbers and often a range of other items of personal information. Sometimes the consumer is asked to check a number of boxes to show other areas of interest. Quite often we find that a week or so after we have completed a purchase we are emailed by the supplier to tell us that other people who bought the same item have bought a whole range of other items, and the supplier informs us about them and suggests that maybe we would be interested in purchasing those items as well.
The information we provide is used to fill the immediate order placed by the customer. All the information can be added to a database and made available for matching and comparison with other items of personal information the Internet retailer has been able to glean from other sources. By combining personal information from different sources, it is possible for the retailer to provide us with a list of other items we might be interested in and for organisations to build up a complete picture of tastes, preferences, needs and purchasing habits of each consumer. This allows companies to market their goods and services by allowing them to target those customers they already know have an interest in such goods and services. There is no doubt that this offers businesses the ability to improve the targeting of their business. 
The collection and storage of personal information, provided that it is with the full consent of the individual concerned, will allow companies to provide higher levels of service. `With full consent' is a fudgy concept in this context. Quite often we find that the consent one way or another is forced out of the consumer. If we want to access information, we are quite often told that, unless we are making our computer available for cookies, we will not be able to access the information or the service we seek. So consent sometimes can be a meaningless concept, and we need to be concerned about that.
The databasing of personal information also has the capacity to interfere with consumer privacy and may leave some people out in the cold for vital services. There are grave risks that, if used incorrectly or insensitively, personal information which is held, sometimes without the knowledge of those people to whom it relates, may have the potential to disenfranchise customers, thereby cutting them off from the markets and making it even more difficult to get by in a rapidly changing world. For example, information profiles built up on individuals could be used to automatically route individuals to predetermined queues, with the treatment given depending on the consumer profile stored in relation to that caller. It is not too difficult to imagine the most wealthy, highly valued customers being routed for immediate service, middle-ranking customers being routed into a regular queue and problem customers or repeat customers being routed to either a junk mail diversion or to an answering machine where they receive no personal service but are invited to leave messages—or, worse still, have to listen to one. That is an example of the very undesirable way in which it is possible to exploit personal information collected from customers. Personal information amassed on individuals can be used without consumers knowing that the information about their preferences, their previous history of dealings with a company or companies or their credit rating have been stored by businesses to make decisions about how they will deal with the customer and the sort of treatment the customer will receive.
We believe that the fundamental control of personal information must be given back to those people who are the true owners of it—they, of course, being private citizens, in this case customers. The key principle that must underline any effective privacy regime in this area is that of choice. We believe we must recognise that, if someone does not wish a company to collect and use their personal information, that wish must be respected. I for one would like to get access to the New York Times daily service, for instance, but I am not prepared to allow them to insist on me making my machine available for cookies so that they can develop a profile of me. I say the New York Times because it is not just the sideshow operators who are keen to access this information and put unreasonable demands on people in doing so but some of the major, more respectable operators are also part of the game.
Therefore, the collection and use of personal information and the rules that govern these practices are vital threshold issues in the developing information economy. Effective federal privacy regulation for the private sector is long overdue. The exponential increase in the amount of data that has been collected and the potential for misuse of that information have provoked community and consumer concern about the way in which businesses use that information. I think it is of major community concern that the federal government's treatment of private sector privacy issues has been a history of embarrassing backflips. In 1996 the Howard government announced that it would introduce legislation that would extend privacy protection to information held by the private sector. I am proud to say that I was responsible for legislation that extended privacy legislation into the area of credit reference agencies and databanks, but that was over 10 years ago and much has changed in the collection and the speed of collection of information in the computer based society that we have now. In 1996 the government made a commitment, and it backflipped on that commitment in 1997 when it announced that it would not be introducing privacy legislation for the private sector but would encourage greater self-regulation within industry to address privacy concerns. Encourage greater self-regulation: that is a totally hollow concept. This left the undesirable likelihood that each state and territory would develop independent and quite often conflicting mechanisms for regu-lating private sector privacy. As the Privacy Commissioner later reported: 
... it quickly became clear that the major issue is the need for national consistency in privacy standards. Everyone wants to avoid a patchwork of different standards applying across industries, technologies and State and Territory boundaries.
The result has been a confusing and expensive mess. But the projection of government policy obviously emanates from those whimsical days that the Prime Minister still holds dear of locally based economies, corner stores and the like. What we now have in Australia and across the world is markets that are nationally, if not internationally, based. The sorts of state based regimes that the government anticipated being developed—as I say, born of a whimsical view of the world and driven by an ideology that says `leave everything to the states'—are now inconsistent.
Naturally, business was aghast at the prospect that there would be different types of privacy compliance in each of Australia's eight primary jurisdictions, and so they should have been. As I say, commerce crosses boundaries—it crosses national boun-daries and it crosses state boundaries. The case for national privacy regulation, I believe, is so strong that it practically goes without saying. Yet, as we have seen time and time again on this issue, the Howard government squibbed on the national leadership that was so clearly required in this area. So when it finally saw some sense in 1998 and announced a national approach in December of that year, we were told that the government would legislate to introduce `light touch' national private sector regulation based on national privacy principles, which at that time were entirely voluntary. At this time, the government stated that the legislation would have a flavour of `coregulation'. There was a period of consultation with industry, and to a lesser extent with community and consumer groups, and this concluded with a publication of `key principles' in 1999. Time goes on—we are talking about over three years that they have been in government—and they have moved from a position of no position to one of a `light touch with coregulation reflected in key principles'. These principles now form the basis of the bill that is finally before us, introduced in April this year.
While the government may seek to portray this bill as introducing a coregulatory framework, the reality is that it is nothing of the sort. The bill has been widely, roundly and justifiably criticised as introducing the weakest possible protection for privacy, given the federal government's commitment to legislate for private sector privacy protection on a national basis. It is not light touch; it is feather touch—it has very little real effect. Important national privacy principles relating to access, correction, use and disclosure do not apply at all to information collected prior to the commencement of the legislation—one year, in fact, after the legislation has passed. Existing systems need to be tackled. The Privacy Commissioner, while being given some power to regulate the use of personal information by private sector organisations, will in many circumstances be left out in the cold, without any effective way to monitor or regulate privacy prac-tices. Flagrant and systematic breaches of privacy will go unpunished because the bill has no effective sanctions for culpable behaviour of this kind.
While the government and this bill may hide behind a thin veneer of coregulation, in essence what we have in this legislation adds very little to the current position, which is industry self-regulation. This bill falls far short of the minimum standards that are necessary to provide reassurance for consumers by putting in place a comprehensive and readily enforceable consumer privacy protection regime. The bill also allows for industry bodies to contract out of the privacy protection system by developing their own self-regulatory codes. Once the Privacy Commissioner has approved a code, the industry will then be wholly responsible for applying its interpretation of the code to all complaints that fall within its scope. Under the legislation, the Privacy Commissioner has no powers to audit compliance with the code, has no powers to review decisions made under the code and has no powers to direct code adjudicators on how they should go about the task of resolving complaints made under this code. The only thing the Privacy Commissioner will be able to do is to, essentially, read the annual report prepared by each industry sector adjudicator and, based on very limited information that is required to be provided, make a decision as to whether or not to continue to approve the industry code. 
This is weak, `feather' regulation. Essentially, it is just not good enough. It will lead to the problem of multiple and conflicting interpretations of similar code provisions. The interpretation of each code will proceed in a self-contained silo. There will be no central authority to ensure that privacy laws are built up in a consistent and balanced way. We believe that the key role of the Privacy Commissioner in supervising the development of private sector privacy jurisdiction has been totally undersold. The Privacy Commissioner, we believe, should exercise a supervisory role over industry complaint bodies set up to administer approved industry codes. If this does not occur, there is a risk that the codes will be applied differentially across different industry sectors. This will obviously diminish confidence in the protection of privacy. 
But it does another thing—which is anathema to what this government says it believes in. Different codes, inconsistencies and inconsistent regimes in different sectors across the country basically give you a legislative mess. They give you an unworkable system. They give you a system that other countries will not trade with. Already we have problems with the European Community because of the soft regime that this government has signalled. People doing business across the world are insisting on adequate protection on privacy grounds. This government's regime as proposed for our community is nowhere near the sorts of regimes that are acceptable to most developed economies to protect both business and private individuals. As a consequence, we are in real danger of finding ourselves frozen out of the international marketplace because of the inadequacy of the regime that this government is proposing. 
This bill also contains no sanctions for those companies which engage in systematic violations of privacy or which persistently flout the national privacy principles. There will always be the cowboy operators who ignore the rules and attempt to exploit personal information for profit without any regard to privacy. Cowboy operators in this area are no longer on the sideshow of the debate. A cowboy operator can very quickly find himself or herself at the centre of data collection and, as a consequence, affect millions of lives. This bill provides no deterrent mechanism for those companies which break the rules again and again. Accordingly, there is a real risk that companies that ruthlessly exploit personal information for profit will go unpunished. 
Accordingly, we will move a number of amendments to introduce penalties to deter grave breaches of privacy. Part IIIA of the existing Privacy Act already contains strict penalties for breaches of the consumer credit information provisions of the act. They are the provisions that I brought in in the late 1980s. Labor's amendments will create an offence of `serious privacy breaches' to ensure that business takes seriously its privacy obligations. The issue of the treatment of existing data is also, as I signalled earlier, an important one. In respect of this, this legislation will not affect the use of information held in a massive database by Axciom containing the personal information of some 15 million Australians. It has been reported that the information was collected from merging personal information obtained from numerous Internet sites. It will remain possible under this law to sell that information, even though Australian citizens unquestionably did not consent to their personal information being used for that purpose.  
I am sure that all of us bled at the thought of Kerry Packer losing $3 million because of the very poor performance by the West Indian cricket team when we read about it in the paper this morning. What this legislation does, however, is more than compensate for that. One of the big winners under this legislation is Kerry Packer and his data collection operation, which was formed quite some time ago and which already has information on millions of Australian citizens. I suppose, as a compensatory measure, the Prime Minister is keen to ensure that Kerry is not hard done by this Christmas. So we will be moving amendments to prevent the inappropriate use and disclosure of existing information. It is important that we do that. 
Another area needs to be addressed—a third area which is deficient. It lies in the fact that there is no special treatment of information collected from children. This compares, for instance, with the US Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998, which requires that operators of commercial web sites and online services directed to children provide parents with notice of their information collection practices. It sets up a regime to protect children and parents. The American legislation was developed in response to research by the US Federal Trade Commission which revealed that some 89 per cent of 212 commercial children's web sites collected personal information from children but only about 24 per cent posted privacy policies and only one per cent required parental consent. If it was good enough for a Republican presidency, a Republican Congress, to pass such legislation in the USA some 12 years ago, why is it not good enough for this government to put parents back in charge of their children's personal information in this country in the year 2000? Families need to be given the tools to control who collects personal information from the kids, to dictate how that information is used and, most importantly, to determine whether it is shared with third parties. 
So the government's response to this enormously important issue, this issue of immediate and enormous public concern, is weak, it is disappointing and it provides the greatest comfort to big business at the expense of real consumer protection and real privacy protection. So we will be moving a number of amendments in the committee stage to address what we see as the major shortcomings of the bill. We would urge the Senate to support those. Unless we come out of here with some effective regime, as I said earlier, Australian citizens will be the losers and, at the end of the day, so will Australian business because of inconsistent regimes and because of the way that the rest of the world with its regimes will view our legislation here. ",SENATE,<title>PRIVACY AMENDMENT (PRIVATE SECTOR) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,15,1
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2000-11-29,"—The Australian Democrats welcome today's debate on the Privacy Amendment (Private Sector) Bill 2000 for many of the same reasons that Senator Bolkus stated. It is long overdue; it has been a long time coming. While Australia has never enjoyed formal privacy rights, the need for such protection has, of course, increased exponentially with technological developments—again, many of those outlined by Senator Bolkus in his speech on the second reading. The collection of personal data is easier than ever before. The community's fear of crime and the increase in video surveillance, electronic banking and EFTPOS transactions and the Internet each individually are redefining what is personal and what is public. As these technologies converge, the issue of personal privacy becomes increasingly more significant. 
As you have heard, in the lead-up to the 1996 federal election, all main political parties promised to introduce legislation extending the Commonwealth's comprehensive privacy laws to the private sector. I note that at the time the coalition stated:
The Coalition regards personal privacy as a cherished right in a free society.
And they claimed that the government would: 
... work with industry and the States to provide a co-regulatory approach to privacy within the private sector and comparable with best international practice.
This commitment was further cemented by the statement of the Attorney-General when launching a discussion paper on 12 September 1996 when he said:
... privacy protection will be enhanced for all Australians with the extension of the Privacy Act 1988 to the private sector ... I intend to be in a position to develop legislation for introduction next year. 
In essence, the Attorney-General was proposing industry codes of practice, supervised by the Privacy Commissioner and subject to statutory backing—primarily a coregulatory approach. However, in March 1997, the following year—when we would have expected legislation to be introduced—after a Premiers Conference the Prime Minister reneged on this promise. He announced that the Privacy Act 1988 would not be extended to the private sector, claiming:
The Commonwealth opposes such proposals which will further increase compliance costs for all Australian businesses, large and small.
It was an enormous backflip. It was another election promise broken by this government. Those comments marked potentially an end to Australia's international best practice privacy scheme, and it was another election promise broken. The reasons for this decision by the Prime Minister and the relevant information on which the Prime Minister relied in order to make this decision were not made available at the time. Even since then, it has been very difficult. Those people who have talked about compliance costs for businesses large and small have not necessarily provided the significant detail that I think is necessary to prove that compliance costs should be an inhibiting factor to the introduction of such legislation.
As the Democrats said at the time, this backflip was at odds with the major industrialised countries, which have recognised the economic and social benefits of privacy protection. The ministerial meeting of G7 industrialised countries in February 1995 and the APEC ministers meeting in May identified privacy as an issue which was important for commercial reasons. At that time, the EU had adopted a legally enforceable law in the form of the Privacy Directive, which, of course, can prevent the flow of data. Our neighbour, New Zealand, had its own privacy legislation, creating its own comprehensive national privacy scheme applying to both the public and private sectors. In that context, the failure by our government on a federal level to introduce a comparable scheme had the potential to threaten our interactions among nations. We now have a situation—almost four years after that promise was made by the Attorney-General—in which the Senate is presented with a bill which fails in a number of areas. It does not compare with international best practice in its current form. I hope that we can address some of those shortfalls in the committee stage of this bill, and I certainly urge the government to adopt some of the amendments before the chamber. That would significantly improve this bill, whether it is tightening the powers of the Privacy Commissioner or ensuring that there are penalty provisions or tightened exemptions in relation to this bill. This bill has significant and serious deficiencies that should be addressed. I seriously hope that the government will consider the amendments from both the opposition and the Democrats which would do just that.
The Democrats have a long history in relation to privacy debates. We have long been advocates of stronger privacy protections in Australia. Indeed, I would argue our record is second to none. We have long maintained that it is a fundamental principle that a person has the right to know what personal information is held about them and that, if that information is lawfully held, the information is correct. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights identify privacy in terms of their specific concerns. In the international charter, article 17 provides that:
... no one shall be subject to arbitrary or unlawful interference with his (or her) privacy.
The human rights article 12 provides that:
No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his or her privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor attacks upon his or her honour and reputation. 
These are fundamental human rights set out in agreements to which Australia has attested, and our domestic laws should reflect these international commitments. I have said it before and I will say it again: privacy is a human rights issue. 
In 1997, on behalf of the Democrats, I brought to the Senate an exposure draft document which addressed many of these concerns. Once again, the Democrats were years ahead of the pack—certainly ahead of the government and the opposition. When tabling that private member's bill, the Privacy Amendment Bill 1997 and its explanatory memorandum, I stated on behalf of my party:
The Democrats believe that personal information should be protected through a comprehensive national legislative scheme.
... a strong enforceable privacy protection which covers both the public and the private sectors with powers vested in an independent body to investigate and enforce its decisions based on clear principles of what constitutes a breach. 
The proposed amendments to the Privacy Act 1988 set out in the privacy amendment bill 1997 will address this intention in a scheme where industry is either covered by legislative privacy principles or develops its own codes of practice with the co-operation of the Privacy Commissioner and subject to approval by the parliament.
The privacy principles and codes of practice maintain a comprehensive and enforceable privacy protection with powers conferred on the privacy commissioner which are similar to those presently set out in the Privacy Act 1988.
That speech on the second reading and the explanatory memorandum I tabled at that time reflected the long-held beliefs of the Australian Democrats on this issue and the fact that we believe this is a fundamental human rights issue. The Democrats are glad, therefore, to be having this debate today. Finally, we are debating a bill that extends privacy laws to the private sector. However, as I have mentioned, there are significant deficiencies in this bill and, in fact, there are opportunities that have not been taken or missed by this government that would have ensured that we do have a world's best practice regime. We are concerned that the exemptions in this bill are far in excess of those required for the satisfactory passage of the legislation. We acknowledge, of course, that privacy is by no means an absolute right and, accordingly, some exemptions are required in certain circumstances. However, blanket exemptions that remove complete sections of the community from the jurisdiction of the bill, rather than targeting and then solving problems, are clearly unacceptable and prevent the bill from meeting its potential. 
We have maintained that the exemptions in relation to small business, for example, are too wide. The main justification behind the government's move to exempt small business from the application of the NPPs has been the issue of compliance costs, reflecting those statements made back in 1997 by the Prime Minister. Despite this being constantly brought up as the major justification for the broad-ranging exemption, there has been limited discussion on this, certainly in relation to the Senate committee, and limited evidence to substantiate some of these claims. The Democrats believe that the lack of substantial compliance costs or other significant difficulties associated with business and the implementation in other countries might indicate why those other countries have implemented privacy regimes in the recent past without those wide-ranging small business exemptions. They have been able to do it; why can't we? For example, Hong Kong, the EU, Canada, the UK and New Zealand have all enacted similar privacy regimes to that proposed in the bill but none of them came forward with similar exemptions for small business. The Democrats will be supporting some of the measures outlined by the Labor Party to try and tighten those exemptions or improve those areas. We will support those amendments.
I recognise that this has been a significant and a tough year for many of Australia's businesses as a result of the implementation of a new tax system. I commend the way that businesses have coped with that transition and the compliance costs associated with that but, on balance, we believe it is achievable to both implement this legislation by the proposed date in the ALP amendments and to do so in a way that does not have too onerous compliance costs. It is worth doing because it is high time that Australians had a privacy regime that applied to the private sector. We are particularly concerned though about the extent to which the small business operator exemption does apply. Certainly, there was enough evidence before the Senate inquiry into this legislation, and the House of Representatives inquiry, to call for significant tightening and changing of those exemptions. The evidence to the committee—in fact, it was the government's own evidence—by the Department of Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business demonstrated that around 94 per cent of Australian businesses fall under the threshold originally proposed by the government. The fact that an overwhelming majority of Australian businesses are not subject to the bill is clearly an issue of concern. We hope to see that rectified. Again, we will be supporting amendments that have been put forward to tighten those exemptions. 
Another issue which was discussed, certainly at the Senate inquiry on the bill, was in relation to e-commerce. According to the Internet Industry Association, 95 per cent of Australian Internet businesses would not be subject to the legislation. Given that personal privacy and security of data are major consumer concerns relating to the Internet and e-commerce, the provisions of the bill are unlikely, therefore, to give consumers the confidence they need in these new technologies. There is no doubt that new technologies are increasing consumer concerns about privacy. I note the recent findings of the Arthur Andersen legal Internet privacy survey 2000 which, I believe, mirrored the survey undertaken by the FTC in the United States. The survey identified several areas of concern. Seventy-two per cent of the top 100 sites collected personal information. However, only 51 per cent published a privacy policy and only 285 notified users about the specific personal information being collected. Of those sites with a privacy policy, 71 per cent notified that personal information may be disclosed to third parties—though only a third of those sites gave users a choice to allow this disclosure or not. And only 14 per cent of the sites surveyed said that they would give users the opportunity to have at least some personal information about them deleted from their web site records.
Many of these issues have been examined not only by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Committee but also by the recent Senate IT committee, which looked at e-privacy. Finally getting a reference to that committee was a welcome relief to the Democrats. These surveys demonstrate the community's concern. Senator Bolkus, I think, referred to the Acxiom debacle and the concerns raised by consumers as a consequence of that story and issue, although I do not think it is an isolated case. I note also the conclusion of the United States Federal Trade Commission's survey of the 100 most popular web sites in the US: that industry efforts to implement a broad based and effective self-regulatory regime for privacy protection were inadequate. That is what it concluded. The FTC, therefore, recommended a change in policy to the United States Congress in that it should enact legislation to ensure adequate protection of consumer privacy online rather than continue to seek to rely on purely self-regulatory methods. I note that Senator Bolkus also referred to the FTC in the context of providing protections in relation to children. The Democrats will support those amendments as well. We know that consumers are increasingly concerned about issues such as telemarketing. There are plenty of constituent letters and emails that I could refer to to back up that position, but I think most people understand the increasing concerns that consumers have.
Today we also have a unique opportunity to address an area of privacy that has received little attention by the Australian legislatures up until now, and that is the issue of genetic privacy. People in this place know that the Democrats have spent a lot of time working on this issue, arguing for greater privacy protections for Australians generally and, specifically, a legislative framework in relation to the protection of people's genetic information—that unique sensitive information. We have always maintained that genetic privacy and genetic discrimination as related to that topic are best dealt with within a comprehensive privacy regime. Certainly, my private member's bill—the Genetic Privacy and Non-discrimination Bill 1998—identifies genetic privacy as an issue for public debate and seeks to protect Australians from misuse of this unique and powerful health information. 
Today we do have a historic opportunity to pass legislation in this area. I will be moving amendments on behalf of the Democrats to ensure that genetic privacy is a component of this bill in such a way that recognises the distinct differences between health and genetic information—general health information and specific genetic information. I hope that both the old parties will recognise the value of those amendments and will pass them to ensure that, for the first time, we have specific protection of genetic information in Australia. I should note that personal information and personal genetic information are different. The key difference between personal information and personal genetic information is that genetic information is a permanent part of our lives and that of our biological relatives. This is often shared personal information which requires some procedures and some special measures to protect. I have also outlined in this place on a number of occasions the fact that genetic technology opens up the possibility for discrimination on the basis of information made available about a person's genes. Of course, there are case studies already available. That highlights how important it is for Australians to be given some assurance on a federal level, a national level, that their personal genetic information is being protected.

I wish to place on record the role of the Democrats in this long-running debate. Former Senator Michael Macklin's bill in 1987 instigated the debate which culminated in the Privacy Act 1988. At that time, the Democrats sought to extend the Privacy Act to the private sector. I acknowledge Senator Bolkus's comments about his role in the debate but I do not think he believed he would get away without me referring to Senator Macklin and the role of the Democrats at that time. Not only did we instigate, I think, the privacy legislation that resulted, but at that time 13 years ago we were talking about extending—
—You instigate? You didn't instigate it. You can't rewrite history like that!
—I will acknowledge Senator Bolkus's interjection. He accuses me of rewriting history, but I think if you look at the Hansard you will find the key role that Senator Macklin played in that debate. And even 10 years earlier than that you will find reference to Democrat policy and the need to have a comprehensive, enforceable, national privacy scheme that applied to both the public and the private sectors. At the time that Senator Bolkus was playing his role in that debate, the Democrats were arguing that that legislation should apply not only to the public sector but to the private sector. It has taken a long time to get to a point where we are not only debating but examining legislation that does just that. The Democrats support a comprehensive regime which extends privacy protection to the private sector, and have done for a long time. Our bill in 1997 would have extended the Privacy Act in this way but was of course followed by the government's undertaking to introduce its own regime to ensure private sector privacy. Today should be an opportunity to establish such a comprehensive regime and to give Australians, finally, the confidence that their personal information is safe. I hope that the government will take advantage of this opportunity and will pass the amendments that will improve this bill. Otherwise, once again Australians will have good reason to feel that their personal information, be it genetic, health or other information, is not being adequately safeguarded.",SENATE,<title>PRIVACY AMENDMENT (PRIVATE SECTOR) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,15,1
"Payne, Sen Marise",LP,2000-11-29,"—I rise to participate in this debate and to move slightly away from the mutual admiration society that developed on the other side of the chamber towards the end of the remarks of the previous speaker. I would like to place on record the importance of the Attorney-General's contribution to this process—his persistence in consulting broadly across Australia and in ensuring that input to the development of this legislation has been as broad as possible. Rather than engaging in a significant traversing, again, of the lengthy years up until the election of the Howard government, I wish to move from about December of 1998, when both the Attorney and the minister for communications announced that the government would legislate to support and strengthen self-regulatory privacy protection in the private sector. 
This bill has been developed with what I would describe and what many of the participants in the process would describe as a consultative approach. The government decided that the privacy standards in the bill would be based on the national principles for the fair handling of personal information which were developed by the Privacy Commissioner in 1997 and 1998. Those principles themselves evolved from a broad consultation process which involved business, industry, consumer and privacy interests. The government convened a core consultative group in 1998 which consisted again of industry and consumer groups, of privacy advocates and the Privacy Commissioner. It was discussions with that group which prompted the government to determine the approach of embodying a coregulatory system in this bill. At the Attorney's request the Privacy Commissioner continued with the consultative approach in 1989 in relation to the application of the national privacy principles to health information. The end result of that consultation was an information paper released late in 1999. Further in 1999, the government released the key provisions of the bill.
Both the previous speakers in this part of the debate have referred, to some degree, to some of the parliamentary committees which have considered the bill since its introduction. I would have to concur that those considerations have been extensive. They have included the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee and, as Senator Stott Despoja mentioned, the Senate Select Committee on Information Technologies. In some of the public debate that has surrounded this bill in recent times there has been some criticism, depending on from whom it is emanating, that the bill is being rushed or alternatively that the bill is being delayed. Those disparate criticisms are brought together with the facts, which is always inconvenient for people who wish to criticise without any foundation.
This was a decision to legislate which was announced two years ago. Since that time, all interested parties have had many opportunities to make their views known to the government and many have done exactly that. Many of those that criticise are those whose views have not prevailed, and that is of course often the case in public debate. There are some who continue to make a constructive contribution. But there does come a point when decisions have to be made, and it is the view of the government that these are the appropriate decisions to make. What we are about in bringing forward this bill is trying to strike an appropriate balance between the competing interests that other speakers have referred to, and to enshrine in legislation the protection for personal information held by the private sector. The bill is effectively described as reflecting a `light touch approach'. After the principles have been set out, much of the detail is left to guidelines which will be developed by the Privacy Commissioner. So it is not a heavy-handed scheme. It is a complaints based system which will lead to remedies available to the individual whose privacy has been breached. This reflects the current approach in the public sector application of the Privacy Act that we have been told has worked so well since 1989. In pursuing that same line, this is a consistent approach from the government.
In terms of the commencement of the legislation, it is important to note that it will come into effect 12 months after it is passed by both houses and receives royal assent. That time frame will enable organisations to have time to adjust their practices in order to comply with the new obligations. 
I have referred already to the national privacy principles which will provide the standards for handling of personal information, and I have noted the coregulatory approach that the bill takes. I think it is also important to notice—and it has not been acknowledged so far in this discussion—the very important and effective role that we believe the Office of the Privacy Commissioner fulfils in this process. There has been no credit given to that office and those who fill the roles in that office, no credit given to the breadth of consultation they have undertaken or the efforts they have made to work with particular industries that use certain types of information or particular organisations to develop codes that are tailored to those areas. It is very important to acknowledge that.
This will bring about a uniform national scheme that provides for the appropriate collection, holding, use, correction, disclosure and transfer of personal information by organisations in the private sector. This is absolutely vital for the effective operation of business in this country and for the most effective and efficient compliance levels and activity for business to observe. It is almost impossible to imagine what an inconceivable mess there would be if we had ended up going down the road of having separate jurisdictions implementing their own privacy requirements and legislation. 
As I have mentioned in this place before, I was involved, both personally and professionally, in the discussion and development of this new legislation before I even came into this place. The horror that was struck into the hearts and minds of businesses in Australia at the thought of having to comply across eight jurisdictions if they operated on a national basis was enough to send most businesses into terror. Having put this together into a single national system, it is a very effective response to those concerns. 
I want to comment briefly—and I am only intending to speak briefly this evening—on some of the concerns that have been raised about exemptions. I particularly want to go to one of the remarks of Senator Stott Despoja in relation to small business. Whilst Senator Stott Despoja indicated that the Department of Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business gave certain evidence to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee—which indeed they did, and I believe that was an accurate representation—they also noted, and this is recorded in the committee's report:
Although the number of small businesses is high, the amount of business activity that they represent is estimated by the ABS at only 30 per cent. Therefore, a minimum of 70 per cent of business activity would be included in the legislation.
I think it is very important to place that on the record. The other exemptions which have been raised as matters of concern and which I know were addressed in amendments which have been circulated in the chamber and will be discussed at the committee stage particularly concern employee records. The Senate committee recommended that there be a sunset clause inserted in the bill which would allow the exemption to operate for two years while analysis was undertaken by relevant agencies to ascertain whether existing workplace relations and state and territory legislation is adequate to protect the privacy of employee records.
The government has not, as I understand it, accepted that recommendation in whole but has made what I regard as a very important response to it. It has undertaken, I understand from a statement from the Attorney-General today, to review existing Commonwealth, state and territory laws to consider the extent of privacy protection for employee records and whether there is a need for further measures. This review will commence after the bill is enacted but before it comes into effect. It is a review which will be carried out by officers of the Attorney-General's Department and the Department of Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business, and again it will involve consultation with state and territory governments, the Privacy Commissioner and other key stake-holders. This is, I think, an important response to issues of concern which were raised by the Senate committee and which have been raised in other committee reports on this issue.
What the government does not consider necessary is the imposition of additional administrative and financial burdens on Australian employers without giving proper consideration to the need for such controls. What we are about in all of this legislation is an approach that balances the interests and concerns of individuals in relation to the protection of their personal information and the needs of Australian business to operate in an effective manner, at the same time observing, most importantly, the protections which are required under this legislation. I think that covers some of the most important aspects of the legislation from the government's perspective. ",SENATE,<title>PRIVACY AMENDMENT (PRIVATE SECTOR) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,15,1
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2000-11-29,"—The Privacy Amendment (Private Sector) Bill 2000 has quite a long history. It came about firstly—and I suspect more in detail—with the Senate Legal and Constitutional Committee, which conducted an inquiry into privacy protection in Australia which was linked to consideration of the measures contained in the Privacy Amendment Bill 1998. We know that privacy matters have come before this parliament longer ago than that, but the genesis of the current bill was at about that point. I would like to discuss a number of aspects of this committee's report first before leading into the current committee report and the current bill before us. 
The report on the Privacy Amendment Bill 1998 is particularly relevant to the current position. The report firstly notes that there is an increasing level of interest in the community in the protection of personal information and that the community expects government institutions as well as commercial bodies to maintain their personal information in a confidential manner. The committee heard evidence that the protection of privacy has been given a new impetus by emerging technologies which enable access to and manipulation of data. This is particularly important in the areas of health data and genetic information. There are clearly needs for specific legislation, control and access to medical and other health records. 
The report also looked at international responses to the issue of privacy. Many industry groups have referred favourably to the United States system, which is predominantly self-regulatory. Others have accused the system of favouring business to the exclusion of personal rights and it has been suggested that the principles adopted by the European Union offer more rights to consumers. Canada has a similar system to that in Australia, with a federal act applying privacy principles to most federal agencies. However, self-regulation of privacy issues appears now to have given way to proposed legislation which will cover both the public and the private sectors.
The committee looked at establishing a model of privacy protection based on the following criteria. It will have core principles that, if observed, will protect privacy. This criterion is the content of the privacy protection scheme. It will have a guarantee, to a level acceptable to the community, and internationally, of compliance with accepted privacy principles. There will be a guarantee to provide a means for people to exercise and protect their right to privacy—that is, provide an accessible enforcement mechanism. There will also be a guarantee to provide redress when a privacy right is breached, by way of specific remedies, sanctions or compensation. The committee also noted that aspects of this approach were generally accepted within Australia, although to varying degrees, and internationally. The report stated that parliament should consider the wider public interest of developing a system that provides privacy protection but also retains flexibility to be able to meet the demands of evolving technologies and the particular demands, structures and issues that arise across various industry sectors.
There are five sources of international law and standards relevant to Australia in considering the need for privacy protection. Without going into them all, as I suspect they are well known in this house, they include article 17 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights; the Universal Declaration of Human Rights; the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, OEDC, Guidelines for Governing the Protection of Privacy and Transborder Flows of Personal Data; and of course the European Union Data Protection. The opinions of witnesses of the committee were divided on the significance that these provisions have for Australia, and in particular the effect on Australian trade with the EU in the event that Australia's privacy controls are found to be inadequate. The 1998 inquiry of the committee concluded that Australia should adopt a privacy regime applying to the private sector which guarantees an individual's privacy rights. So we have, in effect, a lead that is heading towards privacy protection in Australia. 
What we then came across was a report developed in consideration of a bill. In the modern age, a right to privacy is no longer a trendy phrase. Personal information, more than ever before, can also be an avenue for making money. It is no longer only one of those civil libertarian rights that needs defending; personal information can now be described as commercial information which requires protection. The commercial sector now seeks out this information and defends it against getting into the hands of its competitors, uses it and tries mostly to make a profit from the collection, storage and dissemination of personal information and other types of data. 
Individuals are increasingly recognising that their personal details are valuable and that the individual should have some say as to how this information is used. Of course, what is heightening this are the emerging technologies that are making raw data more useful. We have already come across a whole range of new phrases that are particularly peculiar to this industry. There were phrases that I came across such as `data mining', which conjures in the mind a huge goldmine or metal mine with a range of mechanical instruments—but far from it. It is a unique phrase, and behind this term is a situation whereby the electronic and digital storage of information, combined with telecommunications technologies, allows people to access and retrieve data, match it in certain ways and bring about information from a whole range of diverse sources. It allows the creation of detailed personal files from diverse sources which, when combined, reveal a profile of a person and their spending patterns, which can be very valuable in the hands of many commercial operators.
There have been legislative responses across Australia to these types of situations. In April 1998, as an example, the report from the Legal, Constitutional and Administrative Review Committee of the Queensland parliament looked at this very issue. It was called Privacy in Queensland and it recommended the enactment of a privacy act and the appointment of a privacy commissioner. What we have is a range of states looking at the particular issue of privacy. We have heightened community awareness. We have individuals concerned about their right to privacy and their right to personal privacy in relation to the data. We have, on the other hand, companies, businesses and commercial enterprises seeking to use that data in a variety of ways for commercial profit.
In respect of the Privacy Amendment (Private Sector) Bill 2000, the shadow Attorney-General criticised the new legislation introduced by the government as being too soft. This evening we have heard it called a `light touch'. In the commercial world, we all know what a light touch means. The bill aims to establish a national privacy scheme for the private sector and seeks to harmonise the various disparate interests. These interests include Australia's international obligations and its international concerns, individuals' interests in having their privacy protected, and social interests in ensuring that privacy issues do not trammel human rights.
Businesses do have a legitimate right to have a free flow of information and the need to have a privacy regime that is not so costly that it causes significant business harm. However, tilted against this are individual privacy and human rights concerns that a loss of these privacy rights could cause serious harm to the fabric of society. Obviously a fair balance needs to be struck. This bill does not set a fair balance. However, Labor's amendments will assist to strike a fair and reasonable balance—one that the citizen can understand and one that the commercial operators and business enterprises can set their sails against—so that we can come to a position, at least on the scales, which provides pathways for all parties to feel secure about their personal information. 
It is clear that the Privacy Commissioner requires stronger powers as well to ensure that privacy rights are appropriately protected. The principles that underpin the bill are the national principles for the fair handling of personal information. However, there are still many concerns—concerns that are reflected in the wider community, as I have said. This bill establishes a coregulatory approach to privacy laws. However, it must be a genuine coregulatory scheme. Labor is pleased that this government has not adopted a self-regulatory approach, but vigilance is still required. There must be enough supervision and regulation of the private sector to guarantee a truly effective, efficient and fair coregulatory approach. The government has described the approach as a light touch. The concern is whether this is a euphemism for an inadequate mechanism to protect Australians from misuse of personal information. Labor is not about to wait and see but has decided that the best course of action in the interim is to look at amendments to see if they can strike a fair balance. 
Some of the amendments Labor will be moving to create such a position go to such issues as preventing the misuse and disclosure of personal information which has already been collected, providing people with the right to access and correct existing information and increasing the powers of the Privacy Commissioner to enforce privacy standards and to audit the performance of alternative industry privacy codes. In addition, we seek to ensure one of the fundamental tenets of our society: the right of appeal from industry privacy code adjudicators directly to the Privacy Commissioner. We want to create new penalties for serious privacy breaches and discourage grave or systematic interferences with privacy, and provide special protection for children by giving parents more control over the information collected by commercial web site operators. These are but a few of the general areas or thrusts of the argument that we will put in more detail during the committee stage. It is not my role to go to those particular amendments in detail but to provide an overall overview of what Labor say would provide a fair approach to this bill. 
In addition, I think the Senate can look at ensuring that not only is the Privacy Commissioner properly funded but also the operation is transparent and consumers can make informed decisions about the level of information that they put out and that is kept by companies and commercial operators. Of course, it is not a simple case of yes or no. There are degrees of what people can feel comfortable with, so there must be a range of acceptable levels of information so that in a graduated way the consumer can identify, say, a company or a certain amount of information and say that it is fine for this company or it is fine for this sort of information to be released, but for another company or for other types of information it is not fine, and the consumer can feel confident in saying no. 
The system will not work if it is not funded sufficiently. The Office of the Privacy Commissioner becomes a key player in this. It is one of those matters that the Senate is able to return to in estimates again and again if necessary to ensure that the Office of the Privacy Commissioner is maintained in a properly funded way, is properly staffed and resourced and can continue to ensure that the bill, when enacted, is looked after. The government must make appropriate funding available, and I would give the benefit of the doubt to the government on this issue. The government said that the system will work and that it will fund it appropriately. That is a question that we can pursue.
One of the concerns is that the bill does not have adequate teeth and might be considered a toothless tiger. It contains, for example, no real sanctions for those companies that flout national privacy principles. This is an area where the government could play a constructive role in ensuring that there are measures that act as a deterrent. Hopefully, the Office of the Privacy Commissioner will report on trespasses in respect of the national privacy principles so that, if there are problems, the issue of comprehensive penalties can be considered again. The issue of small business, as has been said, has been ducked in this bill. It appears that they are exempt, although the definition used to decide whether a business is in or out is extremely complex.  
On another note, there is an overarching concern that the bill as it stands may not meet the European Union data protection directive on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data. It is designed to ensure the free movement of such data and the main objective is to remove any potential barriers to trade. I await a clear indication from this government that this bill would meet those requirements and that our trade will not get caught in red tape as a consequence. I would seek an explanation from the minister so that the differences, such as the exemptions relating to employee records and small business, are fully explained and fully compared with the overseas situation. I would seek that a commitment be given that, if there are problems, this government will address them immediately and also a commitment that, if there are problems that affect trade, this government will amend the bill. Balanced against these rights is the cost of implementing the coregulatory model as against a more prescriptive model or a less prescriptive model. However, it must be recognised that in developing privacy protection systems it is necessary to strike an appropriate balance with respect to costs and the need for privacy.
I will turn to the inquiry conducted by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee which looked at the elements of the Privacy Amendment (Private Sector) Bill. The report states that the bill aims to help the private sector which deals with personal information to develop privacy codes of practice and provide at least the same level of protection as the national privacy principles, including complaint handling procedures. Terms like `independence', `trans-parency', `fairness' and `accessibility' should become the norm when we are dealing with these sorts of issues in relation to privacy protection. The dissenting report of Labor senators on the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee inquiry into the provisions of the Privacy Amendment (Private Sector) Bill 2000 stated that the legislation has been a long time coming. The 1998 report was not responded to by this government. 
The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs advisory report on the Privacy Amendment (Private Sector) Bill 2000 was presented by the committee on 26 June 2000. It was a unanimous report by the committee. However, sadly, the government's response, made on 7 September, was short. Of the 23 recommendations that were made, only five were accepted and some others were accepted in part or in principle. That is not a very good record.
In addition, very little detail was worked out and presented by the government in answering the position, so very little can be said about the government's position on those recommendations. In short, the dissenting Labor senators' comments state that the bill is poor and in reality should be withdrawn, more work should be done and the bill should be reintroduced. Unfortunately, the government wishes to persist with the bill in its current format, and in the committee stage Labor will move detailed amendments to improve the basis upon which the bill will be used in the wider community. The test in respect of privacy is encapsulated in this question: does it meet the needs of the community? In the report, the Labor senators remain unconvinced. The Labor senators highlighted a number of concerns. As I have said, they highlighted the concerns that were reflected earlier in my speech, which went to the small business exemption and, in addition, employee records and other matters.
The government's response was to allow a revolving door in relation to the small business issue. The position with the national privacy principles was going to be such that small businesses could come and go as they pleased. That creates all sorts of problems. What about information already collected by a small business should it opt out? What about the use of information should a small business fail and then opt out or be taken over and the new business chooses to opt out, or if there is a merger or a sale of a small business and the new business or the new owners do not wish to continue? One wonders what actually happens to the information. 
In my view, the government senators squibbed out in the majority report. In relation to the European Union directive, they said that the views of the European Union with regard to the operation of the bill should be considered as part of the broader review of the legislation, which was to occur in two years time. So we have another review, another two years wait and another two years of commercial operators spinning information for sale. We started in 1998 with an inquiry which had its genesis some two years earlier, we are now looking for another review—part of the government's response in its report—to spin it out to 2002 and we are also told today that another review appears to be—(Time expired)",SENATE,<title>PRIVACY AMENDMENT (PRIVATE SECTOR) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,15,1
"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2000-11-29,"—I would also like to make some comments with respect to the Privacy Amendment (Private Sector) Bill 2000. In doing so, I would like to draw senators' attention to the dissenting report of Labor senators in consideration of this bill by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee. Labor members of that committee recognised the privacy amendment bill as a final capitulation to a 1996 coalition election promise, which was to extend the provisions of the Privacy Act 1988 to the private sector. That pre-election promise was alive when on 12 December 1996 the Attorney-General, Mr Daryl Williams, released a discussion paper which set out a privacy scheme based on the then existing information privacy principles of the Privacy Act. However, Mr Williams's quest to honour the election promise was quashed a short time later when Prime Minister Howard announced on 21 March 1997 that the Privacy Act would not be extended in accordance with coalition policy. The reasons given for breaking this promise were vague and unclear.
The government introduced the Privacy Amendment Bill 1998 into the House of Representatives in early 1998 and, after less than three hours of debate at the second reading stage, the bill passed its third reading on 1 May 1998. Later, on 14 May, the Senate referred the bill to the Legal and Constitutional References Committee for inquiry with a report date by 12 August 1998. The reporting date was extended on a number of occasions and, after the intervening election, the report was finally presented to the Senate on 25 March 1999. The government certainly ignored that report and went on to again ignore the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs advisory report on the Privacy Amendment Bill 2000. This attitude has been quite consistent in the government's treatment of the issue of privacy and it concerns me greatly that even with this bill that arrogant attitude towards privacy in Australia persists.
My colleagues have already outlined the approach that Labor are taking in our attempt to amend this bill to make it more acceptable. I would like to draw the Senate's attention to yet another inquiry that has been conducted, not as a direct reference to the privacy amendment bill but almost in association with an issue that I believe is really causing a lot of citizens and consumers concerns about privacy in the information age. In the report entitled Cookie Monster? Privacy in the information society by a committee chaired by Senator Ferris, a series of recommendations specifically relating to privacy in the electronic environment were made. I would like to take the time to refer to each of the recommendations contained in that report, as they all provide a further insight into or a further drawing out of the issues relating specifically to the Internet and the challenges of privacy that do arise in the digital or electronic environment. The first recommendation of that committee is that the Federal Privacy Commissioner develop and authorise for display `a privacy webseal'. The report says:
The webseal will—
hopefully—
assure consumers at a glance of the privacy credentials of a particular organisation and will offer at least the following information and services to consumers: It will:
·	enable consumers to opt out of any direct marketing communication from the outset of the customer relationship;
·	provide advice on how to obtain access to and correct one's personal records;
·	facilitate the complaints process by identifying the code adjudicator and providing either a complaints form, or advice about how complaints should be submitted; 
·	provide details on the industry privacy code, if any, that applies to the organisation;
·	provide the complaints statistics of the applicable code ... 
·	provide clear and unambiguous advice about the information handling practices of the organisation ...
It will also provide a link to the web site of the Federal Privacy Commissioner. The committee believed that this proposal would be of benefit to both consumers and online businesses and would assist consumers to protect their own privacy by informing them up-front of their privacy rights and empowering them to take action to protect themselves. Online businesses, on the other hand, would be able to demonstrate a commitment to the privacy principles by providing consumers with a means of doing so.
The second recommendation is something I feel very strongly about:
The Committee recommends that the Federal Privacy Commissioner review the August 1994 `Advice for Commonwealth agencies considering contracting out (outsourc-ing) information technology and other functions', paying specific regard to security and privacy functions, including:
risk assessment of privacy threats arising from outsourcing; and
procedures for monitoring and ensuring the privacy compliance of an external service provider.
The Committee recommends that the Federal Privacy Commissioner issue similar guidelines for private sector organisations that are involved in outsourcing IT functions to external service providers. 
This is a particularly important issue because the recent Australian National Audit Office report into Minister Fahey's IT outsourcing initiative highlighted several flaws in the treatment of privacy under contracts between external service providers and the Commonwealth government. I cannot overstate the sensitivity of this issue, particularly because we are talking about citizens' information being in the hands of private organisations, information that has been quite appropriately collected by the government on their behalf—for example, health information, tax information and social security information—information that is incredibly sensitive and that is indeed protected by the provisions of the very act that we are seeking to amend today.
This issue has been previously raised in a variety of forums, including Senate estimates hearings. The Senate was given assurances by those in the bureaucracy managing the contracts that the privacy of citizens' information would be protected by private external service providers by virtue of a contractual clause which transferred all the privacy protection mechanisms contained in the Privacy Act 1988 to the contractor and yet, in doing so, did not excuse the Commonwealth agency or department from the ultimate responsibility for the protection of privacy. That was all the insurance we had. Despite requesting it, I was never provided with specific copies of the clauses that found their way into the signed contracts, albeit I was shown clauses from the request for tender documentation for various IT outsourcing contracts which certainly looked on the surface as though they would at least transfer that responsibility and the provisions of the act to the private sector.
Nonetheless, the Australian National Audit Office found significant flaws in the system. They also found that the clause in one particular contract did not provide the degree of specificity necessary for the external service provider to guarantee that privacy would be protected. The agencies involved had also failed to put in place an adequate process to independently check that these privacy provisions were adhered to. Despite assurances on the public record given by both the agencies and the Department of Finance and Administration—which are managing the issue of privacy—a very detailed investigation by the Auditor-General has shown that these provisions were not met. As a result, there is an urgent need to look specifically at how this bill extends and protects the privacy of those individuals, and I am not convinced that it does. In closing, I would like to run through the remaining recommendations of the privacy report:
Recommendation 3
The Committee recommends that the media exemption in the Privacy Amendment (Private Sector) Bill 2000 be amended to prevent media organisations from publishing bulk records about Australian citizens that include details of names and addresses, and to enable consumers to obtain access to information about themselves that is held by a media organisation.

"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2000-11-29,"—I rise tonight to discuss the outcomes of recent events in the youth arena and, in particular, the presence of the Youth Roundtable in Parliament House only a few months ago. I raise this tonight on the basis that it is absolutely critical that not just the government but all parliamentarians have the opportunity to hear about the outcomes and recommendations of the Youth Roundtable. Shortly, I would like to work through those recommendations quite specifically.
I would like to preface my comments with a general summary of the Youth Roundtable and the way the government has approached this forum. I need to be a little historic in my reflections because the Youth Roundtable came up as the coalition's response to how young people were represented in Australia, particularly following the defunding of the Australian Youth Action Coalition, which provided a peak body for youth organisations around the country and a cohesive voice for issues confronting young people. Once that organisation was defunded, it was very clear that the coalition were proceeding with their strategy to take away the voice of anyone who opposed them and were not prepared to fund organisations that were critical of how the coalition conducted themselves.
The Youth Roundtable was then positioned by the coalition government as being the alternative consultative model or the alternative voice for young people in this country. However, the Youth Roundtable did not reflect the structure or nature of the youth peak, given that the youth peak itself clearly organised and prepared its structure and thereby its voice. Alternatively, the Youth Roundtable is very much a construct of the government. I am on the record as saying that its nature is much more that of a focus group bringing together 50 young people from around the country to discuss and explore policy issues confronting those 50 young people at the time and related specifically to their field of experience.
While much has been made of the appropriateness or otherwise of the Youth Roundtable, tonight I want to focus on the work of those 50 young people. It is an incredibly important work, despite my concerns about the structure of the Youth Roundtable. The efforts that they have put in need to be not only respected but also listened to and followed through. That is what the government said they would do. I will always persist with my concerns about the Youth Roundtable not being accessible to the wider parliament and, although I was pleased to have been given more access at last year's roundtable, I again place on the record my specific request to the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Dr Kemp, and ask that the opposition shadow ministers and indeed those with portfolios on the crossbench be given the same sort of access to the young people participating in the Youth Roundtable as the government ministers are. This is a taxpayer funded forum, and I believe that all members of parliament should have the opportunity to access the insights of the 50 young people who are privileged to be involved in the program.
I would now like to turn to the recommendations of the various topic groups of the Youth Roundtable, to place them on the record, in particular the education topic group. Firstly, in relation to disability the recommendation states:
More funding for interaction programs to allow young people with disabilities to participate in mainstream education. This included increased funding for:
·	Teacher's aides,
·	Better resourced facilities,
·	Prompt action to requests for environment modifications, greater flexibility to accommodate individual needs (ie therapy sessions) and
·	Programs to support students in the transition from Primary school to high school. 
With respect to vocational education and training, the general comments from the participants included:
·	Start VET earlier ie year 8 or late primary school in addition to mainstream education. This allows young people to start to become aware of career pathways to get a sense of vision and direction for their future.
The recommendation states:
VET should be in all schools and receive adequate funding.
·	Inconsistencies with the implementation of VET programs.
·	The quality of programs often relies on the motivation of school staff and the local industry.
Recommendation 2: National marketing campaign dispelling negative images of young people participating in vocational education programs and to promote VET as being of equal value to academic education streams.
·	VET needs a new image as current one carries connotations of not being as good as academic streams of education that affects enrolments.
Recommendation 3: Establishing VET program in years 11 and 12 where young people can volunteer to work for a few days a week in a supervised and supported workplace.
·	Employers take responsibility for equipment and material costs.
·	A National register of businesses willing to take students should be established.
They then make a general comment with respect to peer support and say:
Peer support allows young people to discuss issues of concerns not related to the school curriculum with older peers.
Recommendation 1: Peer group support programs to be established in all high schools.
·	Teachers should provide back-up support by acting as student liaison officers.
The next issue is career information in schools and they make the general comment:
·	Young people of NES backgrounds are disadvantaged when it comes to receiving career info.
·	More information is required on part-time apprenticeships.
Recommendation 1: career information needs to be more accessible to all students.
With respect to university morale, the recommendations are:
Recommendation 1: The Government needs to have a dialogue with students and universities to discuss more funding for smaller classes, retention of lecturers, better facilities and more research grants.
Recommendation 2: There is a need for greater mentoring and pastoral care services.
Recommendation 3: Introduce a `Foundation' year for all first year students.
Recommendation 4: There is a need to establish links between academia and industry while students are studying.
Recommendation 5: All lecture notes and papers should be posted on the Internet.
I turn to the employment topic group, which stated:
Recommendation 1: Foundation skills should be recognised as a core component of education.
With respect to volunteerism, they state:
Recommendation 1: There should be incentives for young people to participate in volunteering activities.
Concerning young people and mental illness, they state:
Recommendation: Establish a nationwide campaign to reduce stigmas associated with mental illness and employment.
With respect to apprenticeships, they state:
Recommendation 1: Apprentices should be eligible for rent assistance and healthcare cards.
Recommendation 2: Establishment of a workplace mentor program to support new apprentices and educate them about their rights and available services.
Recommendation 3: Establishment of a workplace code of conduct.
I now go to the health and wellbeing topic group, with respect to young women and sport:
Recommendation 1: Restructuring of national coaching accreditation courses to better encompass the needs of individual athletes.
With respect to sexuality based issues:
Recommendation 1: Teachers should receive specialised training to raise awareness of discriminatory language and antidiscrimination education policy.
It is very clear that I will not have the time to work through all of these recommendations so, with the leave of the coalition, I would like to incorporate the rest of the recommendations provided by the Youth Roundtable in the Hansard. I know I have not shown them to the coalition, but I am keen to place these recommendations on the record so that all parliamentarians can see them. 
Leave not granted.
—It is very disappointing that leave has not been granted. I will take the opportunity to place them on the record at another time. (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>National Youth Roundtable</title>,Adjournment,16,1
