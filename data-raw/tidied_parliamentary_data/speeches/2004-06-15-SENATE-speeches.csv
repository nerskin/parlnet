"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2004-06-15,"—My question is directed to Senator Hill, Minister for Defence and Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Is the minister aware of the letter sent to the Red Cross by the commanding officer of Abu Ghraib prison, Brigadier General Karpinski—a letter which Defence confirmed was drafted by Australian legal officer Major O'Kane? Does the Howard government agree with the proposition contained in that letter that prisoners will not be treated according to Geneva convention standards where `absolute military security requires it'? In the Howard government's view, when does `absolute military security' operate to deprive certain classes of prisoners in Iraq of basic standards of treatment? Did any of the Australian military lawyers posted to Iraq give advice or make representations to our coalition partners that all prisoners in Iraq should be treated in accordance with the Geneva conventions?

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2004-06-15,"—Mr President, I note that the minister did not answer my original question. Just to be clear, Minister, let me ask you this supplementary question: what steps have been taken to investigate whether the 100-plus prisoners physically captured by Australian troops have been treated according to the standards of the Geneva convention? Have you made any efforts at all to find out about the fate of these prisoners, including where they were ultimately detained and precisely what treatment they experienced?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Iraq: Treatment of Prisoners</title>,Questions Without Notice,2,1,question
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2004-06-15,"—I do not think that you can opt out of the Geneva conventions, and Australia would not seek to opt out. I do not think you have a choice—you have to comply with the provisions of the convention. One, of course, relates to prisoners of war and the other relates to civilians that might be taken and held. The position of the Australian government is as I have just stated. If somebody is being held other than under a Geneva convention, then it would be the attitude of the Australian government that basic humanitarian standards should nevertheless prevail.

"Minchin, Sen Nick",LP,2004-06-15,"—In response to a series of questions on the Asia Pacific Space Centre from Senator Faulkner and Senator Carr in March this year, I advised the Senate that the Commonwealth had not made any payments to APSC and that around $5 million had been spent on common user infrastructure on Christmas Island. I based that advice on information provided to me by the Department of Transport and Regional Services. Following a recent reconciliation of expenditure by that department, I can confirm that my previous advice that no payments had been made to APSC was correct; however, DOTARS has advised that expenditure on common use infrastructure as at March 2004 in fact totalled $7.4 million. On 18 May this year I wrote to Senator Faulkner and Senator Carr in this regard. The break-up of that expenditure was detailed in those letters, which I am happy to table. I reiterate that the entire sum has been spent on providing common use infrastructure such as a new port and a road that will benefit the wider Christmas Island community. No funding will be provided to APSC unless and until appropriate performance milestones have been achieved.

"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2004-06-15,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Family and Community Services (Senator Patterson) to questions without notice asked by Senators Collins, Forshaw and Moore today relating to family payment debts.
The point I will highlight as I commence my comments is that the government has had three years to reform its deeply flawed family payments system. In those three years, more than 2.9 million incorrect payments have been made to families—that is, 56 per cent of all payments totalling $2.5 billion have been wrong, and 1.6 million families have been overpaid an average of $900 each year. That means that the government has recovered a total of $1.5 billion from families through the stripping of their tax returns, the issuing of debt notices and garnisheeing of future payments. The one thing the government system seemingly cannot do is to pay families their correct entitlement when they need it each fortnight—I stress: when they need it each fortnight. Even the government's research tells it that families do not want to deal with annual assessments of their circumstances—they want financial support when they need it and in accordance with their circumstances. This is the component that the government cannot grapple with.
In the recent federal budget the government tried to paper over the problem by providing this $600 payment, but I hope Australian families will recall that the $1,000 payment that the government gave before the last election lasted for only one year. This time families will receive $600 before this election and a promised $600 after it to flow through the system—the government claims—as an additional family benefits payment. But, when we look at the detail, we discover that that additional $600 will not be indexed in future in the same way that family payments were in the past. Senator Patterson today promised that this $600 would maintain its real value. The trick, though, is in what she means by the `real value'. It is clear from her answers today that she continues to fudge on that issue. I suspect it is because she got dudded in cabinet. She knows that family payments have been indexed by a wage related measure for many years. She knows that the trick—perhaps it was Treasury, it seems that FaCS was not aware of this trick when we questioned them in estimates—of making this $600 a cushion on wage related indexation is the fraud that the Howard government is now running. If indexation had occurred in the way the old formula applied, and you compare it to how indexation will work with this new figure, this additional $600 will disappear in five years. That is the fraud that the government is now peddling. The government has refused to come back to the Senate Community Affairs References Committee with the detail following the estimates process last week. Senator Patterson indicated that, if necessary, the government would legislate to maintain the real value of this additional $600, but what the government still has not dealt with is that the change to the indexation formula changes the value of family payments across the board, not just this $600. This $600 will be a cushion on future increases and there will not be the benefit in the system that this government claims.
If Senator Patterson had said today quite frankly and quite clearly that the indexation of the family benefit would continue on the same basis that it had in the past then she would have avoided this fraud. She did not do that today and that is why she must have been dudded in cabinet. CPI is what the minister refers to, yet anybody who has been around the indexation of family support and pensions knows that, if you want to maintain the real value of pensions and assistance, you link it to a wage related measure. We know this problem, for instance, in relation to the child-care benefit. We know that the affordability of the child-care benefit has been in decline because it is indexed solely to the CPI. There is a long history of indexation across pensions and benefits and this government— (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Howard Government: Family Policy</title>,Questions Without Notice,4,1,speech
"Knowles, Sen Susan",LP,2004-06-15,"—Isn't it interesting that Senator Collins can come in here, day after day, whingeing, whining and carrying on as she does about this issue, yet at no stage has she released a policy. I think she is the shadow minister—I am not too sure; she hides her light under a bushel pretty well—so why hasn't she released a policy? Here they are after eight years of opposition and the shadow minister is about to prance out of this place, still without a policy. Also, this shadow minister, this pretend shadow minister, has not been able to account for Labor, when they were in government, never giving anyone a top-up. 
The Labor opposition quite clearly say in this argument that, if someone provides the wrong information and they are given taxpayers money as a consequence, they should be allowed to keep it at the expense of every other taxpayer. The government do not agree with that. The government say that, if someone provides the incorrect information and they get something to which they are not entitled, the other taxpayers of Australia deserve that money to be put back into the barrel for those who do require it. Additionally, when the Labor Party were in government—and because there is no policy there is no indication that they would change—if someone underestimated their income, they were never, ever given a top-up. Under this government, they are. It is a very marked difference. 
Yet, we have Senator Collins coming in here and screeching from the rafters about things that are completely and utterly wrong. They are wrong from the point of view that Senator Collins does not understand for one moment what the government initiative is all about—no wonder she cannot write a policy. Around two million families with three and a half million children will benefit from the family tax benefit—but she does not understand that—and the vast majority of those families with dependent children are now eligible for family assistance. 
The most important thing that she does not understand is that the new More Help for Families measures will provide an additional $19.2 billion in assistance over five years. This is the largest package ever put in place by any Australian government. If she thinks that a Labor government can do better, then let her put her cards on the table. Do not come in here and screech about it. Put your cards on the table. Let us see the policy. Let us compare what we have done, put into practice and put in the budget with they would do if they were ever given the opportunity to take the government benches again. 
But, no, we cannot compare one with the other because this incompetent shadow minister cannot possibly put together a policy that we can look at. With the government's policy, about two million eligible families will receive a one-off payment of $600 per child for family tax benefit part A—and other eligible children—before 30 June 2004. From 1 July 2004, there will be an ongoing FTB part A supplement payment of $600 per child, which will increase the base and maximum rates of the FTB part A. It is as clear as crystal in the budget papers.
What is the alternative? We do not know. We have not the faintest idea. In this short debate that we now have following question time, it will be interesting to see whether one member of the opposition can tell us what they would do in government that would be different, whether they would allow people to get overpayments and keep them at the expense of every other taxpayer and whether they would adopt the government policy of top-ups if underpayments occurred. I will wait and see whether the Labor opposition have a policy and how it will differ from the policy that the government have put in place which will benefit over two million families in this country.

"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,2004-06-15,"—It is always interesting to note in these debates and very often during question time how anxious the government are to hear the Labor Party's policies. The reason they are so anxious to hear the Labor Party's policies is that they want to pinch them. If you go back and look at some of the things that we have announced, you will find that when the Labor Party announce a policy this government steals it. For instance, only recently Mr Latham announced that the Labor Party would reform the parliamentary superannuation system. Who pinched that policy? It was none other than the Prime Minister. The Labor Party announced that we would make changes in respect of ATSIC. The Prime Minister followed that by announcing that he would follow our lead. We have announced in the past policies regarding the maternity allowance. We said the baby bonus—
—Mr Deputy President, on a point of order: the motion before you is to debate the answers provided by Senator Patterson today in question time. My point of order, therefore, is Senator Forshaw is not debating that. If he wishes to announce his policy on the issue relating to Senator Patterson's answers, then that is fine.
—Senator Knowles, you know there is no point of order. These are fairly wide-ranging debates. I am sure Senator Forshaw, if he is not there already, will get to the point he is making to the Senate shortly.
—I am getting to the very issue in respect of the motion, but one has to deal with these false assertions from the government about lack of policy first. The Labor Party is developing its policy and will announce it in the fullness of time—in particular, when we get the election date out of this government. But let me deal with the questions that were asked of Senator Patterson during question time and the lack of answers that were given—particularly to the one that I asked. We have asked the minister to provide the detail as to how she can be so confident that the value of the $600 payment in family tax benefit A will not be eroded because of changes to the indexation formula. The minister stood up in question time today and said: `You don't need to worry about that. It won't happen.' We have asked the department and we have asked the minister for the detail to be provided. We were assured at estimates that it would be provided. We are still waiting for the answer. The minister's response today was, `The department's too busy trying to get this money out into people's letterboxes during the next few weeks.' The minister says they are too busy to provide us with the detail of this pre-election bribe. The fact of the matter is the detail should be available. It should have been available as part of the development of this policy announcement in the budget.
The reason we do not have an answer, I suspect, is that the minister and the department have been caught out. During the estimates process this issue was brought to light during the questioning of the departmental officials, and the minister did not really understand. And she still does not understand. The fact of the matter is that any value arising out of this initial one-off payment will be eroded over the course of the next five years because of the changes to the indexation arrangements that would have otherwise applied to family tax benefits. 
Senator Collins, in her excellent speech on this issue, pointed out that this government has presided over a system which is giving with one hand and taking back with the other. The only response you get from members of the government, such as Senator Knowles, is to attack the messenger. But Australian families know that even when they advise Centrelink of changes to their income circumstances, even when they comply with the requirements that are laid down, they often find they still end up with a debt. It is no fault of theirs; it is the fault of this system. We have a situation now where 1.6 million Australian families have an average debt to Centrelink of $900 per year. Okay, this government has tried to fix the problem for the short term by paying a one-off $600 payment, but what those families have to understand is there is a sting in the tail—that this government gives with one hand and takes away with another. And that is the cruellest trick you can play on the Australian people.

"Humphries, Sen Gary",LP,2004-06-15,"—As I listened across the chamber to Senator Collins and Senator Forshaw, a phrase that was made famous by the late President Reagan sprang to mind, a phrase he made popular during the 1980 presidential debate. He famously said, `There you go again.' There indeed goes this opposition once again desperately trying to strip some gloss off what has been extremely good news for Australian families in the last few months in the form of additional payments to them under family tax benefits. There have been significant improvements to their financial positions, there have been significant increases in their security and there has been a significant increase in their capacity to meet the cost of living. With the increase in the amount of money available to Australian families, these families are significantly more reassured by the action they have seen from this government than by the rhetoric they hear from the opposition.
The fact is that, however you look at the situation, Australian families today are in toto better off under the present regime and the present arrangements for family tax payments and family support than they ever were under Labor—and not by small degrees but by a country mile. There is more money available to Australian families for income support—$19.2 billion for the next five years—announced under the More Help for Families package, there is wider eligibility and there are larger payments. More Australian families positively benefit from these arrangements. I ask those opposite: do they really think Australian families are focusing on the questions they are raising—these relatively marginal questions, with respect, about overpayments—or do they think Australian families are focusing on the big picture of how payments have improved and how their position has improved under the coalition government? If you think they are focused on the former, you are kidding yourselves.
We keep coming back to this question of overpayments. Labor says there are overpayments to Australian families that have to be repaid to the government and it shows the government is mean and niggardly and that it wants to get this money back. Let me remind people that top-up payments to Australian families who missed out were not available under the Labor Party government. If you underestimated your income under a Labor administration, then too bad, stiff cheese, you lost out. Today people in that position can receive a top-up benefit, but the corollary of that, the other side of that coin, is that overpayments need to be addressed, and that is what this government does with its policy.
I ask members opposite: what is the practical alternative to recovering overpayments made to anybody who is a beneficiary of the Australian government or any government, for that matter? What is the alternative to recovering those overpayments if they are made? I do not know. We have not heard what Labor's alternative is. We do not know what Labor are going to do—if they ever miraculously squeak into office somehow—to address this issue. Are they going to forgive those sorts of debts? Are they going to say, `No, it's all right'? Or are they going to do what they have done in the past and say that there are no top-up payments for Australian families and that if you underestimate your income, too bad, you do not get a top-up. The other side of that coin is that you can keep an overpayment. Is that what you are going to do? Let us know. Let us find out. 
I know that a previous Labor minister once tried to implement a policy of no collection. I recall that many years ago, when he was responsible for the ACT, Tom Uren made the statement in public that he thought it was unfair that ACT public housing tenants should have to pay outstanding back rent. What happened? There was an explosion in unpaid rent to the ACT Housing Trust—so much so that the succeeding minister had to reverse the policy and set about recovering millions of dollars in unpaid rent to the Australian government as administrator of the ACT Housing Trust. So Labor's policies do not actually bear any scrutiny. We do not even know what Labor's policies are in detail. No-one is fooled by this exercise. We know that you do not have an alternative. You are trying to take the gloss off what has been a very good policy that has provided great benefits to the Australian community and Australian families. You are failing miserably in that exercise and you are coming back to this issue by trying to find some currency and some mileage in it. Frankly, I do not think that anyone sees that you are succeeding in that exercise.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Howard Government: Family Policy</title>,Questions Without Notice,4,1,speech
"Moore, Sen Claire",ALP,2004-06-15,"—I rise also to take note of answers given by Senator Patterson today. Here we go again. We have been talking about the system for a number of years now—in fact, since it was first introduced. The system that was introduced to pay family tax under this government is basically flawed. It is not gloss. In fact, the only gloss in this system is the one-off payment which has been introduced—and that is gloss. For all the families in Australia who will be receiving the one-off payment over the next two weeks, that will be gloss. However, what is below the gloss is significant. Debt is not a marginal issue.
We have a statement by the Minister for Family and Community Services that `an amazing amount of money' will be given to Australian families over the next couple of months. One component of that amazing amount of money that will be spent on this issue is a significant advertising campaign. We do not know all the details of the campaign. We have asked about it, but we are still waiting to see what the details will be. But, interestingly enough, one of the reasons for the advertising campaign which we discussed at Senate estimates was precisely the fact that Australian families are confused by the system of family payments. It is not an easy system to understand. One of the reasons that the government must spend about $20 million—an amazing amount of money on advertising for this component alone—is that people do not understand the system. We have heard before in this place and also in Senate estimates about a general acceptance that the system is complex and that some people get caught out by it—not a small marginal number. I take issue with the fact that debt can be considered to be small and marginal when people are traumatised by receiving information from the government that they owe money. 
In this place we have discussed what we consider to be the inbuilt flaw in the system, which indicates that people are in a situation of having to make a choice. They have to guesstimate their forward income, and on the basis of that guesstimate their payments are made. We know that the vast majority of people in the country who take up this payment prefer to have it paid on a fortnightly basis. There is no question about that. Senator Patterson has agreed with that. People see the value of getting that regular income. However, the real kick to this process is that, if you have not calculated your income correctly at the beginning of the financial year or at times throughout the financial year, you will have a significant debt at the end of the time. There is no question about this. We have heard from previous ministers that a debt is a debt is a debt. We say that the system must be enhanced to ensure that people are not caught out by this debt.
Amidst the amazing amount of money to be spent on the advertising campaign around the glossy one-off payments that are to be brought in by the end of this financial year and the glossy growth of the payment over the next couple of financial years, there must be some awareness in the community that you need to consider that a debt may be accruing. We asked quite directly whether the advertising would promote some clear understanding of how debts are accrued. We also asked quite a specific question as to whether this year alone there will be a clear understanding that tax refunds will not be stripped to repay the debt that people may have accrued. You would all understand that in the past this has been a significant issue that we have raised. People have come to our offices and complained that they have received notices from the Taxation Office at the end of the financial year saying that, because they have a family payment debt, their refund caused by other purposes will be stripped and they will not have access to that money. We are trying to understand whether this year—quite significantly a year where we could be deep in an election campaign—the advertising campaign will say that this year alone you will not be stripped.
The minister consistently says that people on this side of the chamber do not understand. We do understand, Minister. We are asking specific questions. We want to get the system to work. But it is not just us who have to understand but the community, the people who are receiving these payments and the people who will be benefited by the gloss but will also be damaged by any debt that they accrue. This is the real issue. This is not some kind of stunt or a whinge or a whine. These are direct questions to the government. Have you seen how the debt will be worked out? How will families be told about it? Will they be helped through this process so that they will not be further traumatised by a payment that is their right? (Time expired)

"Campbell, Sen Ian (Manager of Government Business in the Senate)",LP,2004-06-15,"—I table a statement on behalf of the Prime Minister on resolving deadlocks, together with a report of the Consultative Group on Constitutional Change entitled Resolving deadlocks: the public response,and seek leave to incorporate the statement in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The statement read as follows—
I am pleased today to table the report of the Consultative Group on Constitutional Change entitled `Resolving deadlocks: The public response'.
Following the release of the government's discussion paper on the deadlocks mechanism in October last year, I announced the formation of a distinguished Consultative Group, chaired by the Hon Neil Brown QC, a former minister in the Fraser government, and also including the Hon Professor Michael Lavarch, a former Attorney-General in the Keating government, and Professor Jack Richardson, a former Commonwealth Ombudsman. 
The Consultative Group conducted a national public consultation process, focused on the two proposals canvassed in the discussion paper:
-	the first of which would allow the Governor-General to convene a joint sitting of both houses when a bill has been twice rejected by the Senate;
-	the second of which would allow a joint sitting after an ordinary general election, to consider a bill rejected twice before the election and then once again after the election.
These proposals did not represent an attack on the Senate.
They were not an attempt to extend the power of the Executive.
Not an attack on minor parties.
Since federation the way to resolve deadlocks has been through existing section 57:
-	only six double dissolutions have occurred since then; 
-	of these, on only one occasion, in 1974, was a joint sitting called to consider deadlocked legislation.
It is my view that the requirements of section 57 impede good government today. 
The Senate plays a very important role as a house of review, however, the government is formed in the House of Representatives. 
An elected government, regardless of its political persuasion, should be able to implement the policies on which it was elected in the interests of all Australians.
The introduction of proportional representation in the Senate, combined with the move in 1983 to 6 senators being elected from each state at a half-Senate election, rather than 5 senators, has made it almost impossible for any government to obtain a majority in the Senate. 
A party now needs 57.16 per cent of the vote in a state at a half Senate election to win a majority of seats in that state.
This means that opposition and minor parties have the power to persistently veto important government policies. 
One example of this obstruction is on the government's proposals to change the unfair dismissal laws.
This is important government legislation which has been opposed by the Labor Party 40 times, despite being a key element of government policy, endorsed by the electorate at the last two federal elections. 
The government does not consider it is in the national interest that the Senate should be capable of persistent obstruction of such important measures. 
In recent experience, it can be difficult to engage public interest in matters of constitutional reform, but the Consultative Group heard from people at public meetings in every capital city, and looked at the 293 submissions received by my department from interested members of the public late last year. 
I understand that the discussion at the public meetings, attended by around 240 people in total, was robust, and the issues covered wide ranging. 
While the views expressed at the meetings were not necessarily reflective of the views of the broader electorate, the process was still worthwhile.
I am disappointed that, while the then Leader of the Opposition welcomed the release of a discussion paper, and said that Labor welcomed constitutional reform, there was no submission in response to the discussion paper from the Labor Party.
Nevertheless, some state and territory governments did lodge formal submissions, in which they supported constitutional reform of various types.
I also welcome public comments, in particular from Premiers Carr and Beattie, who have supported the right of the lower house to prevail over an upper house. 
The Consultative Group also had the benefit of reviewing submissions from the Democrats, the Greens, One Nation and Senator Brian Harradine. 
Each of these submissions provided valuable insight to the Consultative Group and the government.
In its report, the Consultative Group has made a number of observations about public attitudes in relation to legislative deadlocks. 
I have previously stated that the government would consider holding a referendum in conjunction with the next federal election, if the period of public consultation revealed a reasonable prospect of community support for a change. 
History shows that constitutional change is difficult in Australia, with only eight out of 44 referenda being passed since federation, so I have always emphasised the importance of bipartisan support.
The Consultative Group concluded that there is not `any substantial measure of support for either of the two options presented in the discussion paper'.
Consequently, the government is not proposing a referendum on this issue at the next election. 
However, the Consultative Group also concluded that “the discussion paper and the consultation processes have provided a starting point for engaging the wider community on constitutional questions”, and recommended “a wider programme of consultation with the community, and more attention given to educating the public about the Australian Constitution and how it operates in practice”.
So that is what I propose.
In the past the government has supported programmes of education on constitutional issues.
In the lead up to the centenary of federation in 2001, the Constitutional Centenary Foundation was funded to encourage and promote public discussion, understanding and review of the Australian constitutional system. 
Further, through the Discovering Democracy programme the government has made a significant investment in resources for schools to teach children about the constitution and our system of government. 
This public consultation process on section 57 has itself made an important contribution to public debate regarding constitutional issues.
In light of the Consultative Group's comments about a continuing programme of education and consultation, I have had an initial discussion with the Leader of the Opposition about how this matter might be moved forward.
He indicated that the Opposition would not favour constitutional reform in this area unless the Senate's power to block supply was reduced or substantially circumscribed. This is not the government's position.
The government will approach future discussion on this issue from the starting point of a disposition to support option two—which would allow a joint sitting after an ordinary general election, to consider a bill rejected twice before the election and then once again after the election. This is a sensible response to the problems addressed by the Consultative Group.
In closing, I wish to thank the members of the Consultative Group for their work on this critical issue of constitutional reform. 
Each of them brought to the role a great deal of experience in constitutional law and knowledge of the workings of government. 
They have each contributed a great deal of time, energy and commitment to the task of consulting with the public on these issues. 
I am personally grateful for the work they have done and for the advice they have provided to me and the government on these important matters.
Mr Speaker, I commend the Consultative Group's report to the House and to all Australians. ",SENATE,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENT</title>,<title>Resolving Deadlocks: The Public Response</title>,Ministerial Statements,13,1,speech
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2004-06-15,"—by leave—I move:
That the Senate take note of the statement.
It is well known that those attempting constitutional reform in this country have a poor success rate, and Mr Howard is no exception. Since the last successful referendum in 1977, seven issues, including that of the republic, have all been bowled over. All have been defeated. While Mr Howard facilitated the republic referendum in 1999, he also ensured its failure. The whole republican referendum exercise cost more than $20 million, not including the constitutional convention. From the outset, it was a complete waste of money in the absence of a Prime Minister's enthusiastic imprimatur. 
One could read Mr Howard's venture last year into constitutional change for Senate deadlocks and double dissolutions as a chance to cement his place in history as a constitutional reformer. But he must have known—anyone would have known—that Australians are extremely wary of anything that might weaken the Senate and are deeply suspicious of and resistant to any proposal that does not have bipartisan support—bipartisan at a minimum; it probably needs more. I think it needs support also from the minor parties in our political process. 
Some might argue it was worth spending almost $200,000 on this flawed exercise to test the waters. I do not agree. Just look at the results. We found out through the Senate estimates process that a total of only 240 people turned up to discuss the white paper, across eight capital cities at a cost of around $850 per person. The report says:
Attendance at the public meetings was minimal and the lack of any positive community response suggests that there is at least widespread public indifference to the government's proposals.
When it came to Mr Howard's own option—a joint sitting to vote for legislation that the Senate has negatived just three months beforehand—the report is blunt. It says:
Option One received a rough passage in most of the Group's consultations. The clear prevailing body of opinion was that the option would increase executive governmental power at the expense of the Senate and render the Senate far less effective in performing its function of review. The Group concludes that the option would have virtually no chance of community acceptance either now or in the foreseeable future.
The option proposed by former Labor Attorney-General Michael Lavarch to hold a joint sitting after an ordinary general election received a lukewarm rather than an icy reception. The report says:
Many persons in the consultation process did not differentiate between Options One and Two in terms of their general mistrust of the political process or their concern about implications for the current system of government. However, other persons saw Option Two as at least preferable to Option One and were open to discussing its merits, particularly when combined with other constitutional reforms such as fixed parliamentary terms. For these reasons, the Group considers that Option Two would have greater potential for success in the longer term, particularly if the government were willing to consider some modification of the option.
Mr Howard need only have chatted to just a few voters anywhere in Australia to have seen that his plans were futile. On the other hand, I suspect that Mr Howard in fact saw the whole thing as futile all along. After all, many less controversial proposals than this have been put before the electorate in the past only to go down in a screaming heap. 
What I suspect Mr Howard was up to, in his usual devious and divisive way, was wasting a great deal of taxpayers' money and people's time to persuade the electorate that he was a victim of Senate obstructionism and that the Senate was responsible for his lack of a third-term agenda. As usual, the Prime Minister put politics before good government. There was no consultation with the opposition or with the minor parties. He did not lift the phone and ring the then opposition leader Mr Crean or, after Mr Crean, Mr Latham to try to engage in a process that may well have led to some bipartisan, broad support in the parliament.
Labor is not opposed to Senate reform. In fact, we have made it clear that we would be prepared to consult on and consider the Prime Minister's second model. We recognise that either model would mean a weakening of Senate powers but we say a weakening of Senate powers is of itself not necessarily a bad thing. Mr Howard will need to deal with the possibility that these mechanisms could be abused and could potentially destroy the Senate as a genuine house of review.  
For example, could we guarantee a conservative government would not reintroduce malapportionment to our electoral system? Could we guarantee a government would not destroy the powers of the Auditor-General, as former Premier Jeffrey Kennett tried to do in Victoria? Could we guarantee a joint sitting would not diminish the scrutiny powers of the Senate? Could we be assured that the appallingly badly drafted and draconian original ASIO bill 2002 would not have passed in its original, wholly unacceptable form after a short delay? 
In addition to these issues, there are others that need to be addressed as part of any attempt to reform the deadlock provisions of the Constitution. The first of those, of course, is removing the power of the Senate to block supply. After the events of 1975, Labor believe that the power to block supply should be removed. We do not believe that the Senate should have the power to bring down a democratically elected government. We remain resolutely committed to constitutional reform to prevent the Senate from rejecting, deferring or blocking appropriation bills.
The second issue is the important one of the introduction of fixed four-year terms. Fixed parliamentary terms would be a genuine reform and would address some of the uncertainties and limitations of our current political system. They would be good for our democracy and they would improve the quality of our government.
The third issue is maximum four-year terms for the Senate. I think we have got to the point where we know that the Australian people will not accept and agree to eight-year terms for the Senate. It is simply too long for accountability and mandates to have any meaning. With such a constitutional change, every election in effect would become a double dissolution election, giving ultimate say over blocked legislation to the people. This is the most democratic way of deciding what happens when the two houses are deadlocked. 
Labor's approach to constitutional reform is different from this failed attempt by Mr Howard. We say constitutional change can be achieved only with real involvement of the people and with bipartisan agreement. That is something that is clearly way beyond the capacity of this Prime Minister, Mr Howard. I believe it can only be achieved with the sort of sensible approach that I have outlined under a future Labor government.",SENATE,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENT</title>,<title>Resolving Deadlocks: The Public Response</title>,Ministerial Statements,13,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2004-06-15,"—I rise on behalf of the Australian Democrats to speak to the report entitled Resolving deadlocks: the public responseand the Prime Minister's statement. The report went to the public response to the Prime Minister's proposals that were released last year for public consultation. I draw attention to the Democrats' submission to the consultative program. That outlines in a fair degree of detail, for anyone who wants to see it, our full response to this important issue. It is still available through the Democrats web site. I attended one of the public forums, which—and I am sure by total coincidence—was also the most strongly attended public forum. It was the one in Melbourne.
—That would have been a coincidence, yes! 
—I am not sure news of my attendance got out in advance, but perhaps it did. That might explain the huge throng of 40 or 50 people that were there. The first person got up and asked the panel to concede that the entire Constitution was a fraud and that everything that had happened since 1901 was illegal. They said that if we just acknowledged that and unravelled everything we could start to have a serious debate. That was perhaps a bit of an indication of where the night was going. Following on from that, there were some very useful contributions from a number of members of the public, from people who were concerned and who had obviously given thought to how to make our political system work better.
One point made at that forum, which I think was a very good one, was that even the term `deadlock' is not the most accurate term. It implies that there is some sort of stand-off when the fact is that, if the Senate rejects a piece of legislation, there is no stand-off. There is a resolution: the legislation has been rejected by the parliament. It is quite a clear-cut situation. The impression that the government likes to keep giving, that there is some unresolved situation just because it has not managed to succeed in getting what it wants, is completely false. The Senate's role under the Constitution—and this has always been recognised as its key role—is to examine legislative proposals put forward by the government of the day. It is clearly seen by the public as the specific role of the Senate, especially in the modern era, to examine the legislation the government has put forward. It puts forward proposed laws. They do not become laws unless the parliament, and particularly the Senate, agrees to them. If the Senate does not agree then they do not become law. The situation is resolved. It might not be resolved to the government's satisfaction, but that is life. There are plenty of things that get through the Senate that the Democrats do not support. They are not resolved to our satisfaction but they are resolved by being passed, even if in a form that we do not like.
There needs to be that simple recognition by people who engage in this debate that legislation being knocked back is not a bad thing in itself. You can have individual opinions about whether or not legislation is good or bad, as people obviously do, but the fact of it not passing is not some constitutional crisis or flaw in our system. It is actually a sign of the system working. It is worth repeating at every opportunity that the amount of legislation that is defeated by this parliament through the Senate is less than three per cent. Over 400 pieces of legislation have been put forward by this government since we came back to parliament after the last election, in about February 2002, and less than three per cent of those hundreds of bills have been rejected. Many of them have been amended and improved significantly. To suggest that there is some impediment to the reasonable operation of government is simply a falsehood. Because the Prime Minister starts this debate from that false premise, everything that flows from it is naturally flawed.
It was very clear from the limited public response at the public forums and in the submissions that there is very strong public support for the role the Senate plays. That is reflected in the fact that the public vote differently in the Senate from how they do in the House of Representatives. The Democrats more than any other party have had consistently over more than 20 years a higher percentage of the vote in the Senate compared to the House of Representatives. I think that is a reflection of the specific and very specialised role the Democrats have developed in the Senate. The support of the public for the Senate is fairly clear-cut. That is shown not just in the response that was there but even in the lack of response. There was no groundswell of public concern about the Senate getting in the way of this or any other government. The public saw the falsehood of the Prime Minister's premise for what it was and quite clearly said: `This is not serious. We're not even going to bother to engage.' 
It is worth noting one conclusion of the report, that quite clearly there is no way that any proposal along the lines put forward would succeed; it would fail and fail dismally. The public has not been convinced of the need for any change. The report did say—and I hope there will be follow-up on this—that there should be a comprehensive program of consultation and education if change to section 57 of the Constitution is to be achieved. Section 57 deals with disagreements between the two houses.
The Democrats put forward an alternative proposal that we believe would work well and that would enhance the value and the power of our democracy for the Australian public. It was simply that, if a piece of legislation had been the subject of disagreement between the two houses a number of times, that question would be put directly to the public via a referendum at the following election. This proposal was seriously put forward and given significant support in the constitutional conventions back in the late 19th century. I am not sure whether it would have been suitable for that time but I am certain it is suitable now, with a much more educated electorate and much stronger communications technology. It would not be that difficult. In fact, it would be simple for questions like that to be put at a referendum at each election. I think that would give people a greater sense of meaning, belonging and power to their involvement in our democracy and would reduce some of the cynicism and powerlessness that people currently feel. It is a significant and valuable proposal that I believe should be considered and given more promotion.
The bottom line is that any attempt to simply look for a way for a government to bypass or get its legislation through the Senate is doomed to fail because the Senate was put here quite clearly from the very start, constitutionally and deliberately, to provide a check on the executive. There is no doubt that the executive of the government of the day, the cabinet, has become far more powerful in recent decades than it was at the start of our federation. There has been a clear and concerted attempt to diminish the power of the parliament, the Senate and the courts and they need to be defended against that. Clearly, the separation of powers and the fundamental underpinnings of our parliamentary democracy are in danger of getting out of whack if we give any more power to the government of the day. If anything, we need to be strengthening the power of the Senate and the parliament to counter some of the extreme advances in executive power and the misuse of power in recent times.
The one exception to that, which the Democrats do believe we should eliminate, is the power of the Senate to block supply, supply being the ordinary annual services of government. That does not mean budget measures; it means appropriations to allow government departments to continue ticking over. That is not a policy issue. It is the last area that should be held up and the Democrats strongly believe, as Labor has indicated, that it should be removed. It is a source of disappointment to us that the Liberal Party, and indeed the Greens, do not acknowledge that and want to maintain that inappropriate weapon. You can certainly hold a government to ransom in any area you like; you do not need to hold up supply and the operation of the ordinary services of government that serve the public while you are doing it. It is a weapon that should be removed. It is the only area that allows a distraction from the important debate about maximising the powers of the Senate to keep a proper check on whoever is the government of the day. It is a reminder that, come election time, the vote that people have for the Senate is just as important as the vote they have for who they elect to be Prime Minister.

"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2004-06-15,"—I join in making comments on the report entitled Resolving deadlocks: the public responseand the Prime Minister's statement. We are a consultative government. If there is something that has been acknowledged about the Howard government over the past eight years it is that we do consult with the people. We want to ensure that anything we put forward does have the support of the Australian people, especially in the important area of constitutional change. Honourable senators will recall that there was a discussion some time ago about the mechanism for dealing with deadlocks between the Senate and the House of Representatives. As a result, in October last year the Prime Minister announced the formation of a distinguished consultative group, chaired by the Hon. Neil Brown, QC. That group also included the Hon. Professor Michael Lavarch and Professor Jack Richardson.
The consultative group conducted a national public consultation process, focusing on two proposals that were canvassed in that paper. The first proposal would have allowed the Governor-General to convene a joint sitting of both houses when a bill has been twice rejected by the Senate. The second proposal would have allowed a joint sitting after an ordinary general election, to consider a bill rejected twice before the election and then once again after the election. We know in this place that there is legislation on which a government can get elected—and, indeed, re-elected—yet have trouble getting it through the chamber. The example par excellence is the unfair dismissal laws that Labor has now voted against 40 times. As a government we have been elected and re-elected on that policy, which would create overnight another 50,000 jobs. We have just seen the unemployment rate go down from 5.6 per cent down to 5.5 per cent, and we would see an even further reduction. But, for whatever reason, the Australian Labor Party and the minor parties have opposed that.
The question does arise, in the context of Australian democracy, of how to resolve such deadlocks. I think it was a worthwhile discussion to have, to see what views the Australian community might put forward to assist in the resolution of those sorts of disputes. That is why I fully agree with Senator Bartlett, who I think was nearly making a bit of an election pitch there for the Democrats, saying that it is just as important in voting for the Prime Minister as it is when voting for the Senate. I simply remind the Australian people that, if you do want a Howard government, you ought to be voting for the Liberal Party or the coalition Senate ticket in your particular state because, if you want the government's agenda to get through—such as getting the burden of the unfair dismissal laws off the back of small business—you need to deliver the numbers to the government of the day.
Senator Bartlett was quite correct in his assessment of why the Senate was set up in the first place—as a bit of a check on the executive. I think it was more as a states house, but I will not get into that debate. Suffice it to say that the voting system for the Senate has changed, as has the number of senators elected from each state. As I understand it at least, there was a time in Australian history when the winner took all in Senate elections and there was not proportional representation. We now have proportional representation with six senators elected at every half Senate election, as a result of which it is virtually impossible for a government to be given a majority in the Senate. In the past majorities in the Senate were achievable. I understand that the Fraser government for a while had a majority in the Senate.  
Now, with the numbers having been changed on top of the proportional representation system, it does make it very difficult for the government to get its legislative program through, even when it has put a policy position very strongly and clearly to the electorate not only at one election but at two elections. So the proposition was considered: what is the way to overcome these deadlocks? Two proposals were put forward and they were then canvassed around the country to ascertain what support there might be for those two proposals. 
We as a government support the Senate and we support its role. It is, therefore, disappointing in a way to hear that the Australian Labor Party and the Democrats do support the abolition of the Senate's right to block supply. We as a government will not go that far. We do not accept that at all. If you genuinely want to block executive power, I would have thought one way to do that would be to block supply, but it appears that the block on executive power that allegedly the left wing parties in this chamber champion does not extend to a blocking of supply—of course, that is just in case those opposite ever get into power. They would not want to face that situation, because blocking supply means that there is such a deadlock that the ball has to be bounced again by the umpire—namely, the Australian people—to make a choice as to who should be the government of the day. I am not sure that that of itself is a strong argument.
The problem is that the Labor Party said that they did not really want to consider Senate reform without the blocking of supply being taken out of the equation. That was only by public comment because it was regrettable indeed that the Australian Labor Party, whilst welcoming the consultative process and the release of the original discussion paper, made no submission in response. You would have thought if the Labor Party were genuine about constitutional reform they would have had the resources to do so. Indeed, Senator Brian Harradine, an Independent senator from my home state of Tasmania, put in his own submission to this consultative group. It was a well thought out submission. I am not sure that I necessarily agree with it, but at least he put some work and effort into it and tried to work through the process effectively, whereas the Labor Party, as we have now come to expect, are opposing this for opposition's sake. They see a discussion paper and they feel they have to publicly welcome it, but then they have no positive policy input. The Labor Party have been lacking in a whole range of areas in the national debate in this country. They just cannot come up with a firm and fixed policy position which might be able to be advanced, other than that they want to remove the Senate's power to block supply. As I said, Senator Harradine, an Independent senator, was able to find the time and the commitment to make a submission. I think it reflects very adversely on the Australian Labor Party, the so-called alternate government, that they were not able to find the time to do so.
There have been some conspiracy theories put around that this was all about trying to diminish the power of the Senate. We as a government sought to see whether there was a process available whereby deadlocks between the two houses could be resolved. The consultative process was a good one. Those involved ought to be congratulated, but it is clear that the consultative process did not provide a clear approach that would be adopted by the Australian people. As a result, the government's decision is not to pursue it at this stage but to support in very strong terms a campaign of educating people about the importance of our constitutional arrangements in this country. Once that is understood, at the next election people will be voting for the Howard government not only in the House of Representatives but also in the Senate.

SITE REMEDIATION AND CONSTRUCTION OF INFRASTRUCTURE FOR THE DEFENCE SITE AT RANDWICK BARRACKS, SYDNEY, NSW—INTERIM WORKS
This work was referred to the Committee on 12 December 2002 and comprised the staged remediation and preparation for residential sale of eight parcels of land at the Randwick Barracks site. The need for the work arose from the reform of Defence's logistics and supply functions, which resulted in the closure of the former Navy Stores complex at Randwick Barracks. Defence decided to prepare the surplus portion of the Randwick Barracks site for sale and eventual residential redevelopment. 
The total estimated cost of the proposed redevelopment was $85.4 million. It was anticipated that the works would commence in June 2003 and would be completed in 2006.
In November 2002 Defence requested Committee approval for the remediation of Stage 1A of the disposal area to proceed prior to consideration of the remainder of the project. Early approval of this project element was sought so that Defence might meet its 2002-2003 revenue targets. The Committee examined the particulars of the Stage 1A works, estimated to cost $4.6 million, and granted approval on the understanding that the remainder of the project would be subject to a full inquiry in 2003.
A public hearing into the remainder of the works was scheduled for April 2003, but was cancelled at Defence's request. The Committee later learned that the cancellation occurred because Defence wished to refine the scope of the project and to re-examine financing and project delivery arrangements.
In order to receive planning approval from the Randwick City Council Defence undertook to meet certain timing and project specifications with respect to the site, including:
	construction of a new community facility and hand-over, free-of-charge, to Council by November 2003;
	a Plan of Management and Bushland Regeneration Plan for the Randwick Environmental Park;
	embellishment of the Randwick Environmental Park to a cost of $1 million by November 2003;
	construction of an army oval prior to the development of any land relying upon the oval's storm-water retention function; as well as
	remediation of the property to a level suitable for future residential use. 
In October 2003, the Committee was concerned to learn that Defence had commenced three `interim works' projects at Randwick Barracks in order to satisfy commitments made to Council.
According to Defence, these `interim works' comprised:
	the Community Facility and Randwick Environmental Park, estimated to cost $4.75 million;
	the temporary relocation of 9th Support Battalion and associated rationalisation of the retained portion of Randwick Barracks at a cost of $0.5 million; and
	preparation for sale of Stage 1B and parts of stages 5 and 6, costed at $3.5 million. 
The Committee noted that these works had been included in the referral made in December 2002 and, under the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, should not have been commenced prior to completion of the Committee's inquiry into the proposal. The Committee therefore requested that Defence cease works at the site and ordered that a public hearing be conducted at the earliest opportunity.
The public hearing held at Randwick on 12 March 2004 generated considerable local interest. In addition to the procedural issues addressed by the Committee, members of the public raised concerns relating to:
	the level and extent of contamination at the site and
	the execution, monitoring and certification of remediation works.
At the hearing, the Committee was assured that the level of contamination at the site was relatively low. In response to public concerns, however, the Committee recommended that a map showing the level and extent of contamination throughout the site be made readily available on the project web page.
A great deal of the written and verbal evidence presented to the inquiry dealt with the remediation of the site, particularly in relation to the removal of asbestos from soil. 
The Committee comprehensively questioned Defence and the State-government accredited site auditor on:
	the level to which the site will be remediated;
	the development of the remediation methodology;
	the deployment of leading edge remediation techniques;
	the advantage or otherwise of staged versus whole-of-site remediation;
	the relative merits of on-site and off-site remediation; and 
	the actual execution of the remediation works.
Having reviewed the evidence presented, the Committee was satisfied that the site could be remediated to a level fit for residential purposes using the proposed methodology. However, members were concerned to learn of the existence of a `regulatory gap' between the role of the site auditor, who signs off on the completed works, and the role of the local Council and state Environment Protection Authority, who control what works will be undertaken at the site.
In order to ensure appropriate monitoring of remediation works as they proceed, the Committee recommended that an appropriate regulatory body be given responsibility for monitoring the execution of contamination remediation works to ensure that proper health, safety and environmental controls are exercised.
The Committee will seek to ensure that this recommendation be placed on the agenda for the next meeting of State and Federal environment ministers.
It is usual for reports of the Public Works Committee to conclude with a recommendation that the works under investigation proceed at the estimated cost. On this occasion, the Committee takes the view that such a recommendation would be redundant as the `interim' works described by Defence have already commenced. The Committee does, however, recommend that the remaining portion of the Randwick Barracks Site Remediation and Infrastructure works be subject to a thorough investigation by the Committee at the earliest opportunity and prior to the commencement of any further work elements. 
Mr President, I wish to thank the many people that assisted the Committee during the course of its inspection and public hearing at Randwick, my fellow Committee members and the secretariat staff.
I commend the Report to the Senate.

PROPOSED FIT-OUT OF NEW LEASED PREMISES FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND AGEING AT SCARBOROUGH HOUSE, WODEN TOWN CENTRE, ACT
Mr President, on behalf of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works I present the Committee's second report of 2004 titled: Proposed Fit-out of New Leased Premises for the Department of Health and Ageing at Scarborough House, Woden Town Centre, ACT.
The report examines the proposed fit-out of Health's new leased premises currently under construction at Atlantic Street, Woden Town Centre. The estimated cost of the proposed fit-out works is $18.5 million.
The Department of Health and Ageing has been situated in the Woden Town Centre area since the development of the town concept in the early planning of Canberra. 
Over time, the Department has expanded to occupy some 46, 000 square metres of leasehold accommodation in Canberra, with 12 of its 15 leased premises being located in Woden. 
The need for the proposed work is driven by Health's objective of consolidating its Canberra activities into two buildings in Woden, one of which will be Scarborough House. 
Health anticipates that the rationalisation of its accommodation at Scarborough House will result in a number of organisational benefits including, cost and operational efficiencies derived from the collocation of fragmented leases and the provision of a modern working environment for employees.
Work elements for the Scarborough House proposal comprise:
	integration of electrical, mechanical, security, communications, fire and hydraulic services into base-building works; and
	general office fit-out to meet Health's requirements, including security and reception facilities, office areas, meeting rooms, utilities, stores, tearooms, first-aid room, and conference and training facilities.
At the public hearing, the Committee questioned Health on issues related to project costs, building amenities and consultation.
When asked to expand on the cost efficiencies to be realised from collocation, Health stated that savings would be generated in a number of areas including security arrangements, energy, repair and maintenance costs, venue hire, and courier and freight charges.
The Committee expressed concern at what appeared to be unusually high relocation costs. The Department explained that the relocation costs provided for a number of moves, which were required to create greater cohesion through the realignment of business entities.
The Committee noted Health's tight project timeline and queried the potential for cost escalation and the provision of appropriate contingency arrangements. Health replied that while it was confident deadlines would be met, the building owners would be responsible for any costs incurred in the event of a delay.
With respect to all cost matters, the Committee requested that Health supply it with a cost savings analysis, a detailed breakdown of relocation costs and a project timeline. The Department subsequently provided that information.
The Committee asked why Health had decided against the provision of child-care facilities on-site. Health explained that employees were not moving outside the Woden area, where adequate facilities already exist. Furthermore, the building has insufficient external space to provide a suitable play area.
Noting the open-plan layout of the office accommodation, the Committee raised concerns about employees' personal workspace environment. Health assured the Committee that individual workspace allocations would be within acceptable departmental ranges and that the issue of sound intrusion had been addressed. 
The Committee was also interested to learn more about Health's staff consultation process. Health described its Communication Strategy which included staff information sessions and a consultative forum comprised of employees from each work area, and union and occupational health and safety representatives. Health developed a process to encourage staff feedback and suggestions from staff, and intended to incorporate these into the architect's brief.
Although Health's written evidence described a range of proposed energy conservation measures, it did not indicate that Health had consulted with the Australian Greenhouse Office to ensure compliance with the Commonwealth Energy Policy. 
When questioned by the Committee, Health confirmed that it had liaised with the Greenhouse Office on achieving energy savings targets.
Having considered the evidence for the work, the Committee recommends that the proposed fit-out for the Department of Health and Ageing at Scarborough House, Woden Town Centre, ACT proceed at the estimated cost of $18.5 million.
Mr President, I wish to thank those who assisted with the inspection and public hearing, my Committee colleagues, and secretariat staff.
I commend the Report to the Senate.

	the temporary relocation of 9th Support Battalion and associated rationalisation of the retained portion of Randwick Barracks at a cost of $0.5 million; and
	preparation for sale of Stage 1B and parts of stages 5 and 6, costed at $3.5 million. 
The Committee noted that these works had been included in the referral made in December 2002 and, under the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, should not have been commenced prior to completion of the Committee's inquiry into the proposal. The Committee therefore requested that Defence cease works at the site and ordered that a public hearing be conducted at the earliest opportunity.
The public hearing held at Randwick on 12 March 2004 generated considerable local interest. In addition to the procedural issues addressed by the Committee, members of the public raised concerns relating to:
	the level and extent of contamination at the site and
	the execution, monitoring and certification of remediation works.
At the hearing, the Committee was assured that the level of contamination at the site was relatively low. In response to public concerns, however, the Committee recommended that a map showing the level and extent of contamination throughout the site be made readily available on the project web page.
A great deal of the written and verbal evidence presented to the inquiry dealt with the remediation of the site, particularly in relation to the removal of asbestos from soil. 
The Committee comprehensively questioned Defence and the State-government accredited site auditor on:
	the level to which the site will be remediated;
	the development of the remediation methodology;
	the deployment of leading edge remediation techniques;
	the advantage or otherwise of staged versus whole-of-site remediation;
	the relative merits of on-site and off-site remediation; and 
	the actual execution of the remediation works.
Having reviewed the evidence presented, the Committee was satisfied that the site could be remediated to a level fit for residential purposes using the proposed methodology. However, members were concerned to learn of the existence of a `regulatory gap' between the role of the site auditor, who signs off on the completed works, and the role of the local Council and state Environment Protection Authority, who control what works will be undertaken at the site.
In order to ensure appropriate monitoring of remediation works as they proceed, the Committee recommended that an appropriate regulatory body be given responsibility for monitoring the execution of contamination remediation works to ensure that proper health, safety and environmental controls are exercised.
The Committee will seek to ensure that this recommendation be placed on the agenda for the next meeting of State and Federal environment ministers.
It is usual for reports of the Public Works Committee to conclude with a recommendation that the works under investigation proceed at the estimated cost. On this occasion, the Committee takes the view that such a recommendation would be redundant as the `interim' works described by Defence have already commenced. The Committee does, however, recommend that the remaining portion of the Randwick Barracks Site Remediation and Infrastructure works be subject to a thorough investigation by the Committee at the earliest opportunity and prior to the commencement of any further work elements. 
Mr President, I wish to thank the many people that assisted the Committee during the course of its inspection and public hearing at Randwick, my fellow Committee members and the secretariat staff.
I commend the Report to the Senate.

PROPOSED FIT-OUT OF NEW LEASED PREMISES FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND AGEING AT SCARBOROUGH HOUSE, WODEN TOWN CENTRE, ACT
Mr President, on behalf of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works I present the Committee's second report of 2004 titled: Proposed Fit-out of New Leased Premises for the Department of Health and Ageing at Scarborough House, Woden Town Centre, ACT.
The report examines the proposed fit-out of Health's new leased premises currently under construction at Atlantic Street, Woden Town Centre. The estimated cost of the proposed fit-out works is $18.5 million.
The Department of Health and Ageing has been situated in the Woden Town Centre area since the development of the town concept in the early planning of Canberra. 
Over time, the Department has expanded to occupy some 46, 000 square metres of leasehold accommodation in Canberra, with 12 of its 15 leased premises being located in Woden. 
The need for the proposed work is driven by Health's objective of consolidating its Canberra activities into two buildings in Woden, one of which will be Scarborough House. 
Health anticipates that the rationalisation of its accommodation at Scarborough House will result in a number of organisational benefits including, cost and operational efficiencies derived from the collocation of fragmented leases and the provision of a modern working environment for employees.
Work elements for the Scarborough House proposal comprise:
	integration of electrical, mechanical, security, communications, fire and hydraulic services into base-building works; and
	general office fit-out to meet Health's requirements, including security and reception facilities, office areas, meeting rooms, utilities, stores, tearooms, first-aid room, and conference and training facilities.
At the public hearing, the Committee questioned Health on issues related to project costs, building amenities and consultation.
When asked to expand on the cost efficiencies to be realised from collocation, Health stated that savings would be generated in a number of areas including security arrangements, energy, repair and maintenance costs, venue hire, and courier and freight charges.
The Committee expressed concern at what appeared to be unusually high relocation costs. The Department explained that the relocation costs provided for a number of moves, which were required to create greater cohesion through the realignment of business entities.
The Committee noted Health's tight project timeline and queried the potential for cost escalation and the provision of appropriate contingency arrangements. Health replied that while it was confident deadlines would be met, the building owners would be responsible for any costs incurred in the event of a delay.
With respect to all cost matters, the Committee requested that Health supply it with a cost savings analysis, a detailed breakdown of relocation costs and a project timeline. The Department subsequently provided that information.
The Committee asked why Health had decided against the provision of child-care facilities on-site. Health explained that employees were not moving outside the Woden area, where adequate facilities already exist. Furthermore, the building has insufficient external space to provide a suitable play area.
Noting the open-plan layout of the office accommodation, the Committee raised concerns about employees' personal workspace environment. Health assured the Committee that individual workspace allocations would be within acceptable departmental ranges and that the issue of sound intrusion had been addressed. 
The Committee was also interested to learn more about Health's staff consultation process. Health described its Communication Strategy which included staff information sessions and a consultative forum comprised of employees from each work area, and union and occupational health and safety representatives. Health developed a process to encourage staff feedback and suggestions from staff, and intended to incorporate these into the architect's brief.
Although Health's written evidence described a range of proposed energy conservation measures, it did not indicate that Health had consulted with the Australian Greenhouse Office to ensure compliance with the Commonwealth Energy Policy. 
When questioned by the Committee, Health confirmed that it had liaised with the Greenhouse Office on achieving energy savings targets.
Having considered the evidence for the work, the Committee recommends that the proposed fit-out for the Department of Health and Ageing at Scarborough House, Woden Town Centre, ACT proceed at the estimated cost of $18.5 million.
Mr President, I wish to thank those who assisted with the inspection and public hearing, my Committee colleagues, and secretariat staff.
I commend the Report to the Senate.

"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2004-06-15,"—I seek leave to incorporate a statement on behalf of the Attorney-General in relation to an order of the Senate made on 1 April 2004 regarding a government response to the United Nations Human Rights Committee views in Young vs Australia. The statement was circulated earlier today to whips and independent senators.
Leave granted.
The statement read as follows—
The Government's response to the views of the United Nations Human Rights Committee in the case of Young v Australia is:
`The Australian Government presents its compliments to the members of the Human Rights Committee (the Committee). The Australian Government has given careful consideration to the Views of the Committee expressed in Communication No. 941/2000, Young v Australia.
The Australian Government recalls the submissions made by it to the Committee in response to the Communication. In particular, Australia maintains that the sexual orientation of the author was not determinative of his entitlement to the pension under the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 (VEA).
The author did not demonstrate that any heterosexual or homosexual partner of Mr Cains would have been entitled to the pension under the VEA. The relevant provisions of the VEA require that the veteran's death be `war-caused'. The records of the Department of Veterans' Affairs do not show that Mr Cains' death was `war-caused', nor does the author allege that the death was `war-caused'.
In addition, the author failed to provide sufficient evidence that he was in fact the de facto partner of Mr Cains. Mr Cains did not at any stage indicate in correspondence with the Department of Veterans' Affairs that he was anything other than single.
Therefore, the author is unable to show that his eligibility for the pension under the VEA is based on a distinction on the ground of sexual orientation as proscribed by article 26 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (the Covenant).
The Australian Government does not accept the Committee's finding that Australia has violated article 26 of the Covenant. Accordingly, the Australian Government does not accept the Committee's conclusion that the author is entitled to an effective remedy, including the reconsideration of his pension application.
The Australian Government avails itself of this opportunity to renew to the Human Rights Committee the assurances of its highest consideration.'
On 29 August 2003, the Secretary-General of the United Nations transmitted to the Australian Government the views of the United Nations Human Rights Committee. In the letter attached to the views, a request was made that Australia inform the Committee, `within 90 days of the transmittal of the views, of all measures undertaken to give effect to the views'. There is no obligation on States to respond to views adopted by the Committee and, accordingly, no deadline within which this must be done. However, the Government transmitted its response to the United Nations on 11 June 2004.

"Webber, Sen Ruth",ALP,2004-06-15,"—by leave—I present the report of the Australian Parliamentary Observer Delegation for the parliamentary elections in Indonesia which took place on 5 April 2004. I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the report.
Leave granted.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
The observer delegation that I had the honour to be part of had as its brief three parts: to observe in the areas of deployment the process and conduct of the 5 April 2004 parliamentary elections, to carry out such observation activities as much as possible in partnership with domestic monitoring organisations and to prepare a report on the results of the delegation's observation activities for both the Indonesian community and the international community—hence our report to the parliament today.
As I said at the outset—and I will try to keep my remarks brief—it was an incredible honour to witness the formation of a flourishing democracy, albeit a young democracy, in Indonesia. I do not think anyone in this place or indeed in all the Australian parliamentary system could begin to imagine the scale of an Indonesian election. The parliamentary elections that we were fortunate enough to observe had four parts to them. There were four ballots taking place on the one day. There were some 147 million voters eligible to vote on that one day spread over some 6,000 islands. There were over 585,000 polling places. That meant that, because there were four elections, over 660 million ballot papers had to be prepared, produced and distributed for that one day of democracy, with over 15,000 candidates facing election on a single day. Indeed, I do not think it would be taking it too far to say that it was probably the largest single democratic event in the world. 
Our delegation comprised four parliamentarians, 16 Australian officials and, of course, a delegation secretary. The fact that there were four parliamentarians as part of our delegation was seen as a strength in that the Australian parliament and the Australian political system was as committed as the Indonesian political system to ensuring a smooth democratic process. In addition to the Australian observation team, there were strong teams from the US, Japan and the EU. Indeed the EU delegation was the only other one led by a member of parliament—a member of the European parliament. I think it would be fair to say that none of us could recall observing any significant violations of electoral laws by any of the political parties concerned throughout the delegation's time in Indonesia. From memory, there were some 24 political parties. From my own personal observations, during the period of the campaign that I was there for, it was peaceful and relatively subdued, albeit a lot more colourful and with a lot more vitality than your standard Australian election.
Apart from making some central observations in Jakarta, I was deployed with two other Australian officials to the area of West Timor. My overwhelming observation in observing quite a number of polling places in West Timor was the incredible pride with which the local population took part in the election. I could only wish that Australians were as determined and eager to vote and as proud of being allowed to vote in our elections as the Indonesian population in West Timor was. Again, it was a very peaceful and relatively subdued day. Some would find that surprising given that there are still some camps with some displaced people from East Timor within the area we were in in West Timor.
To allow for some of the incredible logistical challenges that electoral commissions face when organising such a large election, a couple of days before the scheduled election day the government had passed some emergency laws to allow for the delay in the conduct of the election in some places throughout the archipelago. Election day, as I was saying, was peaceful. It was calm, friendly and incredibly festive. It was a community based event. Local communities were responsible for establishing polling places, which were largely outdoors. The entirety of those small communities took a great deal of pride in the presentation of their polling places. You could almost sense some form of competition between the neighbouring polling places. My overwhelming observation would be that there was a great deal of strength in local community commitment to the democratic process. As I say, it was one that they were fiercely proud of and determined to take part in no matter what level or lack of education or disability some of the older citizens encountered.
With regard to the organisation of the election, apart from some of the last-minute logistical problems in some more remote parts of the archipelago there was only one thing that the electoral commission underestimated—that is, the actual amount of time it would take to calculate the results of the election. We were promised at the time that because the electoral commission had entered the modern age and had computers just like everybody else we would all know the result very quickly. Indeed, it all came down to the man sitting in front of the screen, we were told, to determine the result. As with all things to do with the technological age, the Indonesian electoral commission underestimated the challenges that technology can pose and the challenges that the man sitting in front of the screen can be confronted with, so it did take quite some time for the population to be made aware of the result. 
In concluding, I would like to pass on some congratulations. I would like to congratulate all of the independent monitors who were there, who went a long way to ensuring that it was a peaceful, open and democratic process. I would like to congratulate the staff of the Australian Electoral Commission who had been placed in Indonesia for some time, who played a valuable role in training electoral staff in preparation for the day and who were out in the field monitoring on the day to ensure that their training was being adhered to. I would also like to congratulate all the Australian officials who took part in the observations and the delegation and pay tribute to their professionalism, competence, talent and commitment. In fact, it is a testament to them as official representatives of Australia both from departments based here in Canberra and from the embassy that, despite the challenges mentioned earlier today, we still have a fairly strong and open relationship with Indonesia.
As I say, Indonesia has a thriving democracy. It is a relatively young democracy but, as Senator Stott Despoja was saying earlier, part of the challenge of maintaining that thriving and relatively young democracy is ensuring the freedom of the press and ensuring that we maintain outside observation from important observers like Sidney Jones. In finishing, I would like to place on record my thanks to the Australian embassy staff who assisted in a very competent and professional way with our visit; to the officers from the Australian Federal Police, who were also incredibly tolerant of people like me and competent in the way they discharged their duties; to the delegation secretary, Bev Forbes, who was an incredibly calm, confident and professional delegation secretary; and to my parliamentary colleagues.",SENATE,<title>DELEGATION REPORTS</title>,<title>Parliamentary Observer Delegation for the Parliamentary Elections in Indonesia</title>,Delegation Reports,25,1,speech
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2004-06-15,"—I will speak briefly to the motion moved by Senator Webber on the parliamentary delegation to Indonesia. I think that she has provided an excellent summation of the observer mission and, indeed, I commend to the chamber the report that has been prepared on behalf of the chair of the delegation, Ms Margaret May. I would also like to put on record my thanks and congratulations to the members of the teams—to the Australian electoral and embassy officials. I would like to compliment our chair, the team leader, and to acknowledge that, for some period of the delegation, Senator Webber was the acting chair and I would like to thank her. I would also like to thank Minister Downer for the opportunity for parliamentarians to be a part of an observer mission. As Senator Webber stated in her remarks, it was a distinctive feature of the Australian observer team and I think it is an important one.
The contribution by the Australian government of up to $15 million to the Indonesian elections is an important part not of relationship building but of relationship strengthening between Australia and Indonesia. While this is my second opportunity today to record my ongoing fascination with and interest in the country of Indonesia, I will constrain my remarks. I would like to emphasise, as has Senator Webber and indeed the report, what an extraordinary logistical exercise this was. Senator Webber was right in describing it as the single largest election on any day in the history of the world as we know it. Some people may say, `Aha, but what about India?' In actual fact, the distinction was not only the number of voters but also the number of elections taking place on that day. There were 24 political parties, 2,057 separate elections, 585,219 voting stations to be correctly equipped for a maximum of 300 voters at each station, 660 million ballot papers to print and distribute, 581,000 KPU members and staff to train, 3.9 million polling station staff to train, 1.1 million polling station security staff to train, 15,276 representatives to be elected and some 448,705 candidates. I love the idea of 24 political parties. It sends a message to some people who dare to complain about the number of minor parties in Australian politics. 
It was an honour to be part of the delegation. It was an extraordinarily exciting opportunity and, as the report quite accurately reflects, the elections were relatively fair, free and peaceful. We were really excited to be a part of elections that perhaps had had a greater build-up than their outcome. The expectations of violence and other activities were greater than what actually happened on the day. I would like to pay special tribute to the team members with whom I worked: Nic Notarpietro from AusAID, Dr Bradley Armstrong from the Australian Embassy in Jakarta and, of course, the AFP—Sean, thank you very much for your assistance.
I would like to pay tribute to every member of the delegation. It was really exciting to be part of such an accomplished, diverse and professional team—AusAID, DFAT, Defence, ONA, AFP and, of course, the embassy. In Australia, we are incredibly well served by these people and I know earlier Senator Eggleston in his remarks on the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade report, Near neighbours—good neighbours: an inquiry into Australia's relationship with Indonesia, referred to the importance of language. I might add for the record that I think it was only the members of parliament who were perhaps somewhat deficient in our knowledge of Bahasa—or, in my case in Bandung, my lack of Sundanese training—whereas our officials and bureaucrats were expertly trained and got us through all manner of situations and circumstances. I offer my tribute to them, my thanks to the government and the minister, and my best wishes to the Indonesian people and their government for a fair, free, peaceful and safe campaign with, of course, the presidential election due to take place on 5 July.

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2004-06-15,"—It is unfortunate that the government has taken this particular course in relation to the amendments to the Age Discrimination Bill 2003 that were moved by the opposition. The legislation itself is in fact welcomed by the opposition. However, I think it is, in truth, an indictment of this government that it us unable to deal with this legislation in a more pragmatic way. The Senate committee report proposed significant recommendations that could have been taken up by the government, but it failed to take them up. Labor's amendments, in fact, would have strengthened this bill significantly and given older people and younger people in our community much greater protection in the workplace and generally, particularly in the area of age based harassment by stamping out a loophole that still allows age based discrimination in some circumstances. With the amendments that Labor were proposing, we believe the operation of the Commonwealth age discrimination legislation would have gone from being perhaps the weakest in the land to being on a par with the best.
As amended by those proposals, we considered that the legislation before us would have been better able to fulfil its mission, one which the government and the opposition agreed to—that is, to protect Australians from negative age discrimination and a culture of utilising our nation's best talent base irrespective of a person's age. There is, I think, strong consensus in the community that if the government is serious about retaining older people in the work force it needs to act to change its current attitudes towards older workers. There is also strong consensus that we need to be giving our young people greater comfort than what this bill presently provides. It demonstrates that the Howard government is happy to talk about removing discrimination but that in reality it is happy to retain and entrench discrimination when it suits.
Labor in this instance will not refuse to pass this legislation because of the benefits that it will bring. But we express, as I have been doing, our serious concern that the government is not prepared to support a stronger Age Discrimination Bill, one that would have been a piece of legislation that this government could have been proud of. Instead, it is prepared in this instance to settle for second best. While the opposition will not oppose the passage of this bill, that does not signify that we acquiesce to this second-best piece of legislation. What it does mean is that we still agree to the benefits that this legislation will bring by ensuring that age based discrimination is eliminated as far as this bill can do so, and we ask the government to consider during the next period the amendments that were not agreed to in the House this time. Labor will continue to seek a change for the betterment of Australians, especially in the area of age discrimination.",SENATE,<title>AGE DISCRIMINATION BILL 2003</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,35,1,speech
"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,2004-06-15,"—We Democrats are very disappointed that the government has decided not to agree to the amendments that were made by the Senate to the Age Discrimination Bill 2003. Age discrimination legislation is long overdue. The Democrats welcomed the introduction of the bill; however, we were disappointed with the approach taken at the time by the government. As we looked more closely at the detail and examined the speeches of government members it became quite clear to us that the bill was little more than an attempt to facilitate the government's policy of keeping older Australians in the workplace, and for longer. Many of the arguments made in favour of this legislation were associated with the economic benefits it was argued would flow from older Australians remaining in the work force longer. 
The Democrats share the view that older Australians should be able to remain active within the work force without fear of discrimination. However, we believe that freedom from discrimination on the basis of age is a fundamental human right which deserves protection in itself. It is a right which applies equally to younger Australians and to older Australians. We Democrats believe it should have been protected years ago, not just now that the government has discovered the apparent economic benefits. Of course, the government's motivation for introducing age discrimination legislation is really quite irrelevant if in the end what we achieve is comprehensive protection against discrimination on the basis of age. However, in this case the government's attitude was actually reflected in the provisions of the bill, which did have a number of weaknesses. The Democrats and the opposition sought to address a number of those weaknesses by way of amendment in the Senate.
The Democrats thought that the most obvious weakness in the bill was the absence of an office of the age discrimination commissioner, and we introduced amendments to bring about such a commissioner. Unfortunately, those amendments were not supported by the opposition and therefore failed. However, there were a number of other amendments which were passed by the Senate. In particular, the prohibition against age discrimination was extended to include discrimination on the basis of a person's relative or associate. The prohibition was also extended to apply to unpaid work as well as to paid employment. The Senate removed the provision in the bill which would prevent a person who has been discriminated against on the basis of their age and disability from seeking redress under both age discrimination and disability discrimination legislation. The Senate introduced a prohibition against harassing a person because of that person's age. It also removed the dominant reason test from the prohibition against discrimination so that a person could seek redress if they had suffered discrimination and at least one of the reasons for that discrimination was their age. The final amendments made by the Senate were aimed at ensuring that the exemption for positive discrimination was based on an objective rather than a subjective test. They introduced a requirement of reasonableness.
The government, through the House of Representatives, has rejected each and every one of the amendments made by the Senate. The reasons for opposing the amendments are brief and unconvincing. We Democrats believe that the Senate's amendments significantly improved what was otherwise a very weak bill. The government's rejection of these amendments simply confirms that its motivation in introducing this legislation had little to do with a genuine commitment to protecting the rights of Australians. This is clearly reflected in the reasons provided by the House of Representatives for rejecting the amendments. For example, in rejecting the amendment which would have removed the dominant purpose test from the bill, the House states:
In the area of age discrimination, action should be unlawful only where age is the dominant consideration. It is critical that the legislation not restrict employment opportunities for older Australians by imposing unnecessary costs and inflexibility on employers acting in good faith. The dominant reason test will be most appropriate to promote the attitudinal change it seeks to achieve.
In other words, the government's intention is not to provide any real avenues of redress for those who have suffered age discrimination but merely to promote an attitudinal change. So this legislation will operate more like a vision statement than a regulatory regime. We Democrats are deeply disappointed that the Senate's amendments have been rejected; however, we will not be insisting upon them. As I said at the start of my remarks, and in my speech in the second reading debate on this bill, age discrimination legislation is long overdue in Australia. We have taken the view that it is better to have a weak prohibition against age discrimination than to have none at all.

"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,2004-06-15,"—I thank honourable senators for their comments. The Age Discrimination Bill 2003 delivers on a key government commitment and a key government policy initiative and it is integral to the government's strategy for addressing the ageing of Australia's population. Our aim in prohibiting age discrimination is to promote a change in people's attitudes about younger and older people. As Senator Greig has correctly pointed out, the government's objective is to encourage and foster attitudinal change without imposing unnecessary and unrealistic restraints on decision making in business and other sectors of public life. The amendments moved originally in the Senate by the opposition and the Democrats were not necessary and they were rightly rejected by the House of Representatives. In our view they would only have compromised the effectiveness of the bill. For example, the amendment purporting to extend the bill to unpaid work would undesirably fetter the voluntary sector.
The Attorney-General tabled a statement of the government's reasons for rejecting the amendments in the House of Representatives and I need not repeat the reasons the government will not accept the amendments. As I said, I thank honourable senators for their comments. I need only observe that the strong support for the government's age discrimination legislation from business and community groups and from individuals throughout Australia is testament to the demand for this legislation.

"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,2004-06-15,"—I will speak very briefly on the Australian Federal Police and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2004 as we spoke at some length in earlier discussion on this legislation. The key amendment to which the House of Representatives has disagreed—I am assuming there was only one but perhaps there were other amendments—came from we Democrats, who were looking for opportunities to militate against what we saw as the inappropriateness of the Federal Police Commissioner being chastised for speaking out publicly on an issue which caused the government some embarrassment as it appeared to suggest policy differences. It was our view that those senior public servants, and the commissioner in particular, ought not be placed in the difficult and possibly invidious position of not being able to speak out on what they believe to be matters of public importance, at the risk of their own employment.  
The amendment we therefore moved, and won support for from the opposition, was to ensure that such speaking out by the commissioner would not place her or his employment in jeopardy. The amendment therefore was self-explanatory and it was our hope that it would be adopted with a view to ensuring that there was greater transparency and accountability in terms of the processes for senior public servants, an example of which we saw in the recent scenario involving Commissioner Keelty. It remains our view that that amendment ought to have been supported and should have become a part of the legislation. However, although the House of Representatives has not seen fit to embrace it, we will not stand in the way of the passage of the legislation as a whole given that the broader provisions of the legislation certainly have merit.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN FEDERAL POLICE AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2004</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,36,1,speech
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2004-06-15,"—There was, as I understand it, only one surviving amendment after the day of the long debate that we had in relation to the Australian Federal Police and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2004, where the Democrats won the Labor Party's support for more transparency in relation to the appointments, ensuring that the government will not be able to deal with people as they will. As the member for Barton made clear in the House of Representatives, the opposition has supported this legislation to complete the integration of the AFP and the APS and we will not be opposing the passage of this bill.
We are—as I think the Democrats are—disappointed that the government has not accepted an amendment proposed by the Democrats to reaffirm the right of the AFP Commissioner to express an honestly held view. This right, of course, faces no greater threat than the Howard government. Indeed, last fortnight in the Senate estimates we heard further evidence of how Commissioner Keelty was harangued by the Prime Minister's office and department after he made comments about Iraq that the government did not like.
As the member for Barton noted in the other place, the basis of the government's opposition to this amendment is entirely disingenuous. The minister says that it would prevent a commissioner from being dismissed for making racially discriminatory comments and my recollection was that that was the argument that Senator Ellison also relied upon. I must say I did have to consider that for a while but, having considered it, I think it was appropriate to come back and say that, in the first place, it would be easy for the government to clarify that the legislation does not go so far as to make unlawful those acceptable comments that are otherwise lawful.
In the second place, the minister now concedes that racially discriminatory comments justify dismissal. Why doesn't he then use his influence to ensure that the Western Australian branch of the Liberal Party does something about previous matters that have arisen? I will not go to the particular case; I am sure Western Australian senators, and perhaps other senators here, know what I am talking about: actions which are taken in cases such as those which offend the Racial Discrimination Act. I particularly refer to a judgment by Judge Carr—and I will not go to the title but it was not that long ago, in 2002—which was not appealed. In my view, it is another case of the Liberal Party having double standards. It was a sure sign that the government was desperate in its search for an excuse not to support this amendment. When you reflect upon that case—the case in Western Australia under the Racial Discrimination Act, by a Liberal Party senator—you may think that it is strange that Senator Ellison would also raise that as an argument as to why he could not include it in this bill. I also put the argument, earlier, that you could amend the provision to ensure that unlawful comments would not be made lawful as a consequence.  
I think it really underlines the Western Australian position and the government's position that they really cannot see their way clear to have a bill which ensures that Commissioner Keelty, in this instance, can act with complete honesty in a range of public matters. Nevertheless, we should not be sidetracked. I could certainly go on a little about that, but it is a debate that has been had. The real debate is the integration and I think the government has got that right. We have supported that, and we think that it will provide a new regime for both the AFP and the APS to ensure that they get on with crime fighting. We do not resile from our belief that the government was wrong to negate this amendment but, as we have indicated in the other place, in view of the importance of completing the APS-AFP integration and giving the AFP appropriate powers of cross-jurisdictional investigation, we will not be opposing the passage of this bill.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN FEDERAL POLICE AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2004</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,36,1,speech
"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,2004-06-15,"—I again thank honourable senators for their comments. I emphasise that the Australian Federal Police and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2004 is an important and integral part of the government's efforts to protect Australians from terrorist attacks and to consolidate and enhance national security initiatives. It is the culmination of a process that began with the horrific events in the United States on 11 September 2001 and in Bali a year later. This bill will finalise the integration of the Australian Protective Service with the Australian Federal Police and enhance the ability of the Australian Federal Police to investigate state offences incidental to multijurisdictional crime.

"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2004-06-15,"—This has come on at short notice. I will restate the position of the opposition in respect of the amendments that were carried last time in respect of the Postal Services Legislation Amendment Bill 2003. The ALP did move a number of amendments. I think they have been identified by the government today as amendments Nos 6 to 9. As I understand it, those amendments were rejected by the House when the bill was returned to the House for further consideration. The position of the opposition is to insist upon the amendments that were passed last time.",SENATE,<title>POSTAL SERVICES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,37,1,speech

I think it would be easier for all concerned if this bill was put off briefly and we dealt with the remainder of the Tax Laws Amendment (Personal Income Tax Reduction) Bill 2004 rather than my having to fill in time before he gets here, but if that is the way the government wishes to do it I will do it that way.

Progress reported.",SENATE,<title>POSTAL SERVICES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,37,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2004-06-15,"—The Tax Laws Amendment (Personal Income Tax Reduction) Bill 2004 legislates an exclusive tax cut for higher income earners that the government has put forward out of the budget. I spoke just briefly before question time on the third reading, but I was sat down just before I was about to finish. As I do not now have to finish within 10 seconds, I will elaborate more fully. The enormous tax cuts coming out of the federal budget are a simple matter but do need to go on the record as an issue of public significance and public debate. The tax cuts are aimed specifically and exclusively at the highest income earners. The top 20 per cent to 25 per cent of income earners are the only people that will benefit from these income tax cuts. The Australian Democrats have said all along—indeed, even before the budget—that if there are going to be income tax cuts they should be shared fairly amongst the entire community. There is no doubt that lower income earners can and would benefit from income tax relief. 
The Democrats attempted to address that by moving amendments in the committee stage of this legislation to make these tax cuts fairer. Providing $10 a week extra for low-income earners might not sound like much and might not make much difference when you are on $100,000 a year, but when you are only on $30,000 a year that extra 10 bucks does make a difference, and that would have been one way of clearly making these tax cuts fairer. That measure was not supported by either Labor or the coalition, and that is a disappointment to us.
Leading up to the budget the Democrats also outlined a range of areas where we could be saving extra money, increasing our revenue or reducing lost revenue by closing tax loopholes in areas such as the incentive that gives people a tax break for company cars. That measure, closing a tax loophole, incidentally, but appropriately on a day like today with the Prime Minister's announcement, would be good for the environment. That area currently encourages more car use, with the taxpayer paying for it. Modifying negative gearing could save an enormous amount of money and reduce the upward pressure on the price of housing. The massive capital gains tax discount that was supported by the ALP a few years ago was another area where a massive tax gain for higher income earners was provided, leading to the upward pressure on the price of housing. The long-abandoned promise by the coalition to tax trusts as companies would not just create a fairer tax system but also raise significant amounts of money. And there are many other smaller measures as well. So there is a range of measures that would make our tax system fairer and more equitable and would raise extra revenue that could pay for these tax cuts or that could go into extra services that the Democrats also believe are necessary.
It is important to acknowledge and note for the record what is happening here. I mentioned the capital gains tax cuts that were made by this government with the support of the ALP. Huge gains were described at the time as overwhelmingly benefiting the wealthy as well as giving retrospective tax cuts to those already holding assets. At the time of the business tax changes Margo Kingston wrote that the Democrats had been fighting hard to stop the potential for massive rorting by the rich and fighting for the promised tax avoidance measures to be legislated to ensure that those tax avoidance measures that were supposed to be addressed were legislated for and in place before the other parts, the lower company tax rates and the capital gains tax rates, kicked in. She said that Labor `shook hands with its traditional enemy rather than join the Democrats to improve the package for its own constituency'. It is doing it again and it is doing it for the same electoral reasons: it wants it off the agenda. It says it is coming down with its `fairer and broader' tax proposals for the election. If Labor's proposals are good, then we will support them in the Senate if it gets into government. But what if it does not? We are then stuck with incredibly unfair, badly targeted, regressive income tax changes. In effect, Labor is helping the government get through parts of the changes that it wanted with its package attached to the GST. Labor made great play about the GST at the time and criticised it mercilessly, but now it is actually helping the government deliver some of the most regressive components of that—the income tax cuts for higher income earners—and it has to be highlighted that that is what is happening here. 
I have no doubt that Labor are genuine in saying they will put forward a tax package that is going to be broader and fairer—and we will be the first to say so if that is what happens—but the fact is that that is not what is before the parliament. We cannot put that in place. At the moment there has been no attempt by the opposition to make this existing legislation fairer or broader. So we have something that is unfair and narrow that is going to become law. That is l-a-w law and it is not going to be undone. The trouble with passing a bad law and saying `We'll fix it up later; just trust us' is that sometimes you do not get the chance. That is an unfortunate reality that many people have had to live with as a consequence of this sort of approach. We are elected to the Senate to consider legislation on its merits, not only on its merits when it suits us electorally or in terms of the electoral timetable. This legislation, on its merits, deserves to fail. It is clearly regressive and unfair. Because it is a matter of such significance and public debate, I felt it necessary to put clearly the Democrats' position on the record for the final vote on this legislation. It will obviously pass into law, because the numbers are there, but it is badly targeted. It is clearly not fair and, it should be mentioned also, is being rushed through in very quick time.
These are measures that were announced only a month ago. Coupled with the additional family tax payments that were rushed through in the last sitting week, we will have a massive injection of funds into the economy. Many economic commentators are saying that this is likely to lead to upward pressure on interest rates and is a very dubious economic responsibility. This government like to pride themselves on being economically responsible, but the fact is that a large proportion of the credit for the good economic statistics that the government continue to point to must go to the Senate, because it is the Senate that passes these measures. It is the Senate that passes the vast bulk of legislation, the vast bulk of budget measures. The government cannot have it both ways. They cannot say that the Senate is holding up their program and then, when it does not and they get good figures as a consequence, say that it is all their own work. So the Senate is able to be economically responsible, and the Democrats put a lot of importance on being economically responsible. This massive injection of funds—there are huge amounts, billions and billions, in a very short space of time—is not economically responsible. It is not equitable in any definition of the word. In our view, there has not been proper scrutiny of how that amount of public money could best be used. That is another example of poor legislation being rushed through unnecessarily quickly because it suits the political timetable of other parties. 
In the last sitting week we saw Labor allow through extraordinarily quickly massive amounts of money to be spent on extra payments for family tax benefit. Within two days of it being announced in the budget, it was introduced as legislation through the House of Representatives and the Senate. As I pointed out at the time on behalf of the Democrats, that is irresponsible. But the shadow minister, Mr Swan, had the gall to go on radio and television to complain about the hidden clawback that was in that legislation that the government had so-called `snuck through'. The only reason it got through without being exposed was that it was rushed through without being looked at properly. The information that Mr Swan used to point to this so-called clawback came from Senate estimates. As I said at the time—and, indeed, attempted to do at the time—if we had simply postponed that bill until after the Senate estimates process, which is there to look at the budget, we would have found this so-called clawback and we could have fixed it up. That opportunity has been lost, and we will be lucky if it is ever fixed up. That is why we should not rush through legislation without looking at it properly. That is why we should not pass laws that we know are not as good as they could be or, in this case, are clearly not good at all. That is why the Democrats oppose it. We are disappointed that such a massively unfair tax cut is going to be put through with very little examination of its consequences and of what much better opportunities—much more effective value-for-money expenditure of this enormous amount of money—could have been put forward instead.
Question put:
That this bill be now read a third time.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (PERSONAL INCOME TAX REDUCTION) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Third Reading</title>,Bills,39,1,speech
"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2004-06-15,"—The Customs Tariff Amendment (Fuels) Bill 2004 and the Excise Tariff Amendment (Fuels) Bill 2004 have the following implications. They impose both customs and excise duties of 1c per litre for high-sulfur diesel on top of the normal rate retrospectively from 1 July 2003 and 2c a litre from 1 January 2004. The bills increase the rate of both customs and excise duties on aviation fuels by 0.306c per litre, impose both customs and excise duties on biodiesel at the normal rate of 38.143c per litre on ultralow-sulfur diesel and amend the excise tariff to enable previously paid duties to be deducted in the formula for calculating excise duty payable on ethanol-petrol blends.
The duty rate differentials for high- as opposed to low-sulfur diesel were first announced by the Prime Minister all the way back in May 1999—last century—in what was then described as the Measures for a Better Environment package. The new duty rates will finally give effect to the government's decision to encourage the early introduction of ultralow-sulfur diesel, which will be mandated by 1 January 2006 under the Fuel Quality Standards Act 2000. Labor supports the initiatives to encourage cleaner fuels and has previously indicated its support for the changes, particularly those which encourage the early introduction of ultralow-sulfur diesel, known as ULSD. Yet again it has taken the government too long to implement them.
The government first announced these measures on 31 May 1999 and it has taken five years to get this far. Meanwhile, refiners have been living with great uncertainty—uncertainty which has largely stifled the large investment decisions needed to produce cleaner petrol and diesel. It is not only the fuel producers who have suffered as a result of the government's tardiness on these bills; consumers should have been encouraged to use low-sulfur diesel long before now. Cleaner diesel is better for the environment and better for public health, but Australia will struggle to meet its deadline for new clean fuel standards in 2006 because of the delay in the introduction of these bills into the parliament. This is just one example of the Howard government's disregard for the consumers in the fuel sector.
High petrol prices are putting financial pressure on Australian families. Most parts of this country are experiencing prices of at least $1 a litre. Of course in many regional areas, such as in my home state of Tasmania, prices are much higher. As the Treasurer has said, a big part of the problem is the war in Iraq and the instability in the Middle East—something for which this government must surely take some responsibility. High oil prices demonstrate the need for increased competition in the Australian petroleum industry to provide relief for consumers and their families. That is why Labor in government will implement a six-point plan to put downward pressure on petrol prices. 
Labor will ensure that consumers continue to have access to a competitive retail petroleum market. Our six-point plan will strengthen the Trade Practices Act and give the ACCC more teeth to take action against major oil corporations and their alliance partners misusing their market power to the detriment of the market and, consequently, the detriment of the consumer. A number of reports have recommended reforms to the Trades Practices Act, but the Howard government has refused to legislate them. Only Labor is committed to stimulating competition and, in this case, delivering lower petrol prices to consumers. Further, despite government scaremongering, Labor has no intention of moving against the shopper docket scheme.
Today the Prime Minister released his long-awaited energy white paper. This white paper fails to deliver a policy which guarantees reliable, affordable and environmentally sustainable supplies of energy to all Australians. Instead, after 8½ years of drift and inaction, all the Prime Minister has produced is another short-term election fix—funding announcements on the eve of an election, most of which will not be available for two years. The Prime Minister still has his head in the sand on climate change and, unlike Labor, has no plan to address Australia's growing dependence on imported oil or the looming crisis in energy infrastructure investment. Australian households and industry face a supply and price crisis if regulatory impediments to investment are not adequately addressed and energy market planning issues are not dealt with. The Prime Minister's failure to match Labor's commitment to ratify the Kyoto protocol and to   increase the mandatory renewable energy target puts Australia on the path of an environmental crisis and perpetuates investment uncertainty for industry.
Labor supports technologies designed to allow us to burn our coal more cleanly and efficiently but it believes an equal effort needs to be made in increasing the role of renewable energy in Australia. The Prime Minister's white paper fails to deliver the correct balance. In transport fuels, Labor has supported recent initiatives to tax fuels on an energy content basis and to encourage a greater uptake of alternative fuels. Today a desperate Prime Minister turned the clock back, consigning policy to the waste bin in deference to a quick political fix. This is at a time when we are consuming oil three times faster than we are finding it, leaving us increasingly exposed to externally induced fuel price hikes.
Labor places high importance on energy efficiency and will be looking at the detail of the government's plan to ensure that it is well targeted, effective and efficient. There is a large amount of business to be undertaken in this place, and I believe we are sitting late tonight to attend to that. I will end my comments by saying that Labor supports these bills. I understand that there is to be some amendment pursued by the Democrats. Labor will be looking at that in the context of the debate.",SENATE,<title>CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT (FUELS) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,41,1,speech
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2004-06-15,"—The Customs Tariff Amendment (Fuels) Bill 2004 and the Excise Tariff Amendment (Fuels) Bill 2004 will amend the Excise Act to increase the customs and excise duty rate on aviation fuel by 0.306c in order to fund the Civil Aviation Safety Authority, to introduce a differential excise and customs duty on ultralow-sulfur diesel to encourage the quicker take-up of the cleaner fuel and to impose an excise on biodiesel for the first time.
The Democrats successfully negotiated the differential excise on ultralow-sulfur diesel with the government in 1998. We did that to encourage the take-up of ultralow-sulfur diesel. The Democrats will be supporting this initiative. Prior to our raising this issue with the government, there was no national fuel standard for diesel fuel in Australia—with the sulfur levels in diesel many times higher than those allowable in Europe and other parts of the world. In addition to introducing a fuel standard, there were a number of other measures which encouraged the use of alternative fuels such as biodiesel. There are great benefits in moving to low-sulfur diesel. Of course all diesel now is low sulfur, but there is an opportunity through this differential to encourage petroleum companies to move to ultralow-sulfur diesel, which has been called for by the truck and auto manufacturing sector for some time. 
The legislation also deals with the introduction of customs duty and excise on biodiesel. Biodiesel is a renewable fuel which can be produced from vegetable oil or other organic matter. It can be blended with petrodiesel or used on its own to power diesel engines. Biodiesel burns more cleanly than petrodiesel, producing less harmful particulate emissions than low-sulfur diesel and, because it is renewable, it does not contribute to greenhouse gas emissions. Prior to the 2001 election, the government set a production target for biofuels of 350 megalitres by 2010 and agreed not to impose excise on biofuels. The Democrats, along with the industry, were very disappointed when, in the 2003 budget, it was announced that there would be an excise imposed on this clean and renewable fuel. The government has been collecting excise on biodiesel since September last year, and the passage of these bills will provide legislative backing for that collection of revenue.
We believe that biofuels, together with other alternative fuels such as natural gas and LPG, should be excise free. We believe that this would provide a competitive advantage to alternative fuels and encourage the take-up of those fuels in the marketplace. This has been demonstrated by the successful uptake of LPG as a transport fuel, particularly by the taxi sector of the transport market, in many parts of the country. This was a debate that we had with the government last year. However, the government has indicated that it will not back down from its decision to impose a new tax on clean fuels, and the ALP has indicated its willingness to support the government's stand. Recognising that the new tax would be introduced with the support of both major parties, we did manage to negotiate an extension of three years to the time frame for the payment of cleaner fuel grants on alternative fuels so that now they will be in place until 2011 and they will be phased out over a five-year period until 2016, which is effectively an excise break for the alternative fuels industry. We would like to have seen a much longer time frame for the grant, but this was all the government was prepared to give. That was very disappointing in the light of the government's previous commitment to not tax alternative fuels.
As some senators in this place may be aware, biodiesel is relatively easy to produce. It can be produced by people in their own backyards using raw ingredients. Many Australians, both in the cities and in regional areas, do so. There are a great many people who enthusiastically produce the fuel to power their own vehicles—diesel powered four-wheel drives or farm machinery. Under the proposed legislation, these hobby producers or small-scale backyard producers who produce biodiesel for their own use will also be subject to the excise, and that involves imposing a very costly and onerous testing regime and licensing requirement on those people. That is unrealistic for people who are producing fuels for their own use. In order to obtain a licence, producers have to have the fuels tested, and testing a single batch of biodiesel can cost many hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars—and often backyard biodiesel production is around the 50-litre mark. 
Requiring hobby producers to meet these requirements will force them to either stop making this renewable fuel and driving their cars on what is an environmentally sound fuel that is often made from recycled oil, sometimes fish and chip oil, and instead use fossil fuel petrodiesel or—as some will no doubt choose to do—continue with their hobby, break the law and produce biodiesel regardless. The Democrats will be moving amendments to the Excise Tariff Amendment (Fuels) Bill which will seek to exempt the non-commercial production of biodiesel for personal use from that excise. Those amendments will be modelled on provisions in the Excise Tariff Act which exempt home-brew beer from this excise.
As Senator O'Brien has said, the Prime Minister's statement today on energy was a disappointment. The Prime Minister talks about energy security, but his idea of energy security is how well our infrastructure is secured against terrorism. I think he misses the point here because energy security is about security of supply, not about the security of something we have already got. As we all know, it is the case that fuel supply will peak in the next few years, and peaking means that you cannot keep increasing consumption, which is what we are currently doing worldwide.
The Democrats would argue that you also cannot sit back and rely on exploration which might find petroleum very much deeper than most of the reserves we currently tap into, which makes it difficult and expensive to extract. And you cannot rely on sources such as shale. The shale oil mine in Central Queensland has struggled to produce oil from shale. The problem is that it is very expensive to, firstly, dig out of the ground and, secondly, crush, heat and extract the oil from. So we cannot possibly look at a sustainable greenhouse future that depends on such very greenhouse intensive and costly sources of energy.
It is important that we promote fuels like biodiesel and it is a great shame that the government proposes to impose an excise on biodiesel in this bill. We accept that agreement has been struck with the opposition and that we have lost the debate to not have excise imposed on biodiesel. To some extent we are going to have to live with that, but small-scale biodiesel producers will be the losers out of this. In fact, those who write to me have told me already that they will not continue to produce biodiesel. Not only will this be a problem for emissions and the use of cleaner fuels but it will mean that a waste product which is currently going to landfill—or whatever other destiny is currently available to fish and chip oil—will not be recycled and used effectively as a transport fuel.
We will be moving to exempt small-scale producers from this measure. As I have indicated, it can be very costly to do the testing. That is one of the main reasons for wanting this exemption, but obviously the government is not going to gain very much from collecting an excise from people who produce 50 litres of biodiesel on an irregular—or even on a regular—basis. It seems to me that, as long as they are not selling this on and they are not a commercial producer, they should not be caught up in the excise regime and that there is also a good argument for them not having to test their product. The Democrats will be supporting these bills, but I do hope to persuade honourable senators to support my amendment, which has been circulated. ",SENATE,<title>CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT (FUELS) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,41,1,speech
"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2004-06-15,"—The amendments contained in this bill have been previously tabled as the excise tariff proposals. The proposals now require incorporation in the Excise Tariff Act. This bill contains three government initiatives: the introduction of excise differentials between diesel with high sulfur content and ultralow-sulfur diesel, an increase in excise duty rates for aviation fuels and the imposition of an excise duty on biodiesel.
The excise differential for high-sulfur and ultralow-sulfur diesel is part of the government's Measures for a Better Environment package to encourage the production and use of cleaner fuels. The production cost for ultralow-sulfur diesel is higher than for high-sulfur diesel. Without the differential, ultralow-sulfur diesel would be uncompetitive in the marketplace, as users generally regard high- and ultralow-sulfur diesel as interchangeable and would not be prepared to incur the additional cost of ultralow-sulfur diesel. The imposition of an excise differential is intended to even up the price between high-sulfur diesel and ultralow-sulfur diesel and reduce the price disincentive for the production of ultralow-sulfur diesel. The bill amends the Excise Tariff Act to incorporate the excise differentials for high-sulfur diesel and similar products with high-sulfur content that may be used as diesel substitutes.
An increase in duty on aviation fuels is required to provide supplementary funding for the Civil Aviation Safety Authority, CASA. The duty on aviation fuels provide a substantial proportion of funding for CASA, which is estimated to receive 11 per cent less than the forecast revenue due to reduced worldwide demand for air travel, cessation of Ansett operations and the introduction of larger and more fuel-efficient aircraft. The increase in duty will ensure that CASA is adequately resourced to continue its safety regulatory responsibilities and maintain Australia's enviable aviation safety record.
The imposition of excise duty on biodiesel was announced by the government in the 2003-04 federal budget as part of the government's broader fuel tax reform arrangements that bring all currently untaxed fuels into the excise and customs duty systems. The reform establishes a broad, sustainable taxation framework, providing increased certainty for investors as well as establishing a fairer and more transparent fuel excise system with improved competitive neutrality between fuels. On 16 December 2003 the Prime Minister announced the final excise duty rates for fuels. Biodiesel will receive a discount of 50 per cent on the usual excise rate. The discount was set having regard to a range of industry, regional and other factors. Grants are provided under the Energy Grants (Cleaner Fuels) Scheme for the production of biodiesel fuels and biodiesel fuel blends. These grants will offset the excise duty, effectively providing an excise-free rate for biodiesel until 1 July 2011. After 1 July 2011 the grants will be reduced by five even annual instalments until the final excise duty rate for biodiesel—19.1c per litre, half the rate applying to conventional fuels—is reached on 1 July 2015. Grants are similarly provided for imported biodiesel to offset customs duty. Complementary changes to customs legislation are being addressed through the Customs Tariff Amendment (Fuels) Bill 2004.
Having regard to the time of the evening, I will not at this stage respond to Senator Allison other than to indicate that the government is not disposed to support her foreshadowed amendment. I will elaborate on the reasons at a later time in the evening. In the meantime, I commend the bills to the Senate.

"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,2004-06-15,"—I rise to speak to the House of Representatives message regarding the Senate amendments to the Postal Services Legislation Amendment Bill 2000. I preface my remarks by restating that Labor remain opposed to the bill. This is because the provisions deregulating certain aspects of Australia Post's reserved service remain in the bill. Labor previously sought to remove these provisions in the Senate but was defeated by the coalition and the Democrats. With regard to the House's message, the government has rejected Labor's amendments (6) to (8). Labor moved Senate amendments (6), (7) and (8) to strengthen the Auditor-General's postal monitoring role. We wanted a stronger consumer focus in that role.
It is a pity that the House has not agreed to these amendments. The government is saying the ACA must have this role, but the ACA as we know it will not exist in a few years. The government should have agreed to these amendments to improve consumer outcomes in postal services, but this government is really only interested in deregulating Australia Post's reserved service. It is rejecting these amendments that would have improved the monitoring of Australia Post by the Auditor-General. We will insist on the amendments, despite the government's attempts to defeat them. The government has, however, agreed to an amended version of the Democrats' amendment imposing a strict penalty regime on persons infringing Australia Post's reserved service. We supported this amendment, but we note that the Democrats only moved this because, by and large, they felt guilty about voting with the government to partially deregulate Australia Post's existing level of reserved service. As was stated in the previous debate on this bill, deregulating aspects of Australia Post's reserved service is just not on for Labor. Labor remain committed to Australia Post remaining in full public ownership with its current level of reserved service intact. 
The Democrats have tried to argue in the debate on this bill that the deregulatory measures in the bill simply formalise existing arrangements made by Labor. This is not true. This bill extends the exceptions to Australia Post's reserved service beyond what was originally legislated by Labor. The bill allows aggregators to pick up mail from their customers legally for the first time. It also allows document exchange centres to pick up and receive mail from their customers legally for the first time. This allows Australia Post's competitors to get closer to an end-to-end service that excludes Australia Post. Just because Australia Post and the government were not enforcing the existing reserved service does not make that legal. The Democrats have been sucked in by the government's claim that this section was legitimising existing practices. Again, this is a false claim. The government is making legal practices which are, in fact, currently illegal.
The Democrats are set today to again vote with the government to pass this bill which partially deregulates Australia Post's existing level of reserved service. We will remind them of this, of course, up until the next election; so, I suspect, will the Greens. Australia Post's reserved service enables Australia Post to provide all Australians with a decent standard letter service at a uniform price. Labor support this policy absolutely. We do not support the gradual deregulation of Australia Post's reserved service by stealth. And we do not support the government's attempts to deregulate and ultimately privatise Australia Post. Labor still oppose this bill regardless of the fact that some otherwise worthwhile amendments are contained in it. Labor will never support the deregulation or the ultimate privatisation of Australia Post.",SENATE,<title>POSTAL SERVICES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,42,1,speech
"Cherry, Sen John",AD,2004-06-15,"—The Australian Democrats will be supporting the motion moved by the government. We will not be insisting on the amendments which were moved on the last occasion the bill was before the Senate and we will be supporting the substitute amendment which has been proposed by the government in place of the amendment we originally moved. I wish to state quite clearly exactly what the final package that has been agreed to as a result of these amendments is. There are a number of clarifications of the boundaries of the exemptions to the reserved business provisions which were already in the act and which were put into the act by the previous, Labor, government more than 10 years ago. The clarifications relate primarily to the issue of picking up and delivering mail through aggregated services and document exchanges. The fundamental issue, of whether there should be aggregated services or document exchanges in the first place, was a matter decided by the previous, Labor, government.
The issue of pick up and delivery is a very small adjunct; it simply clarifies the boundaries of that service. From all the best evidence we have received, we believe it is not a threat to Australia Post's business and Australia Post believes it will not significantly impact on its services in the future. Indeed, all the evidence suggests that Australia Post has been quite forceful in defending its reserve business powers, and I am very pleased that the government has agreed to an amendment to ensure that where there are breaches of the reserve powers of Australia Post there is a pecuniary penalty in addition to the civil penalties provided by the act. This brings the postal services legislation in line with the telecommunications services legislation, which already has a provision allowing for pecuniary penalties in the case of breaches of marketing arrangements. 
I note that this legislation includes the provisions already agreed to by the Senate which give the ACCC a monitoring role for the first time in respect of the pricing of Australia Post. I am pleased the government has dropped its insistence that there be an additional monitoring role for the Australian Communications Authority. It was our firm view that the monitoring role proposed for the Australian Communications Authority was a waste of money. It would have cost an estimated $3 million, which was an impost by a regulator which, in our view, has not sufficiently been regulating telecommunications services and was not going to value add significantly in the area of postal services.
I am disappointed tonight that the government did not accept the amendments which were proposed by the opposition on the last occasion which were at least to expand the monitoring role of the Auditor-General. However, as a result of this legislation we will maintain the status quo, which is that the Auditor-General will continue the role of monitoring the performance of Australia Post. I reject the assertion by the government, in its message from the House, which says that the Auditor-General only audits—an argument which was made by the minister on a previous occasion. The Auditor-General has a much broader role than auditing and in the modern world performance auditing is a role which takes in a whole range of performance functions way beyond the issue of financial auditing. From that point of view, the status quo of the role of the Auditor-General is, in my view, a much preferable position to the position of providing a whole new cumbersome bureaucracy through the ACA. From that point of view, the Democrats will be supporting the government's proposals on this occasion by not insisting on the amendments with respect to enhancing the role of the Auditor-General. We believe the Auditor-General has been doing a very good job to date. If the government does not want the role enhanced, then frankly it is not up to the Senate to insist on that role being enhanced.
For the record, I should declare a small interest in that I have worked as a mail sorter on many summer holidays. My father was a country postmaster for over 28 years. As a result, I have a lot of emotional attachment to Australia Post. I am confident that this bill we are passing tonight will not result in a watering down of Australia Post services, but the Democrats will certainly be monitoring it. We opposed the deregulation bill when it was first proposed for Australia Post in 2000. We do not support the deregulation of Australia Post beyond this clarification of the existing reserve business powers and we certainly put the government on notice that we will be monitoring very carefully how this bill operates in practice to ensure that this is not used as any sort of vehicle for further deregulation.",SENATE,<title>POSTAL SERVICES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,42,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2004-06-15,"—Monitoring does not stop the process from happening and once the legislation goes through this process of attrition of the protection of Australia Post will continue. The government is slowly but surely getting its way here. Senator Crossin is absolutely right: the Greens will be continuing to oppose this piece of legislation. We want Australia Post kept very much in the public domain, without erosion. We are concerned about the enormous potential, which the government has stated, for handing across the most lucrative parts of Australia Post to the private sector, where inevitably the public would lose out to the big end of town. It is as easy as that. We will continue to oppose the amendment which has come from the government in the House of Representatives.

"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2004-06-15,"—I thank my colleagues. I want to make a few brief comments in the chamber's consideration of amendments made by the House of Representatives to the Postal Services Legislation Amendment Bill 2003. As earlier speakers have noted, the House of Representatives has rejected Senate amendments Nos 6, 7 and 8 which proposed enhancements to the role of the Auditor-General. The government was keen to improve the level of monitoring of the quality of service of Australia Post and, as a result, to increase consumer confidence in the operations of Australia Post. The opposition and the Democrats—perhaps it is due to my lack of familiarity with this bill—do not appear to have persuasively articulated in a way which can be readily followed why they have decided not to support the proposed consumer focused role for the Australian Communications Authority, the ACA. It is thought by the government that Senate amendments Nos 6, 7 and 8 are a poor attempt by Labor to try and make up for the fact that they do not support the government's proposals to give an enhanced quality of service monitoring role to the ACA, and those amendments were appropriately rejected by the House. I want to make a couple of comments clear. The government believes that there is an important consumer focused monitoring role that the ACA could have performed. However, the government will not let politics continue to get in the way of this bill and is certainly not prepared to let the opposition hold up the otherwise important reforms in the bill that the Senate has decided to support.
The House has also rejected Senate amendment (9), which provided an additional mechanism in the Australian Postal Corporation Act 1989—the APC Act—to regulate breaches of Australia Post's reserved services and has replaced it with a similar amendment in which a minor legal drafting issue was addressed. The House's amendment does not change the government's objectives or intentions or the operation of the bill. It clarifies legal uncertainty arising from the drafting of the Senate amendment and provides consistency of drafting and interpretation of the reserved service infringement provisions in the APC Act. The amendment is not expected, therefore, to have any significant impact on either Commonwealth expenditure or revenue. While the government is disappointed that the opposition has obstructed the passage of many of the important consumer protection reforms in this bill, we are determined to get on with the business of reform in this area and look forward to the Senate passing the bill now in its amended form.
Question agreed to.
Resolution reported; report adopted.",SENATE,<title>POSTAL SERVICES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,42,1,speech
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2004-06-15,"—The Tax Laws Amendment (2004 Measures No. 1) Bill 2004 introduces a range of new measures. Labor supported the bill in the other place but referred schedules 7, 10 and 11 to the Senate Economics Committee for further consideration. These schedules deal with charities and Labor wanted to further investigate their effect on the charitable sector and the integrity of the tax system. While Labor continues to have some reservations about these schedules in the bill, on balance it will support the bill in its entirety. 
Schedule 1 of the bill extends eligibility for the medical expenses tax offset to include the cost of maintaining properly trained dogs for guiding or assisting people with a disability. The medical expenses offset provides a tax offset of 20 per cent of eligible medical expenses over a $1,500 threshold. While the cost of maintaining guide dogs for the blind is already eligible to be a tax offset, this amendment will extend eligibility to hearing and other disability guide dogs. This is an equitable extension to eligibility for the offset and will provide much needed support for people with disabilities in the community.
Schedule 2 of the bill will provide an income tax deduction for certain expenses incurred in travel between workplaces. Prior to a decision of the High Court in 2001, Commissioner of Taxation v. Payne [2001] HCA, it was understood by the ATO and taxpayers that such a deduction was allowable. However, the High Court held that the cost of travel between two separate workplaces was not tax deductible. The amendments will ensure that where an employee is travelling directly between two workplaces the cost of that travel is deductible, for example, the cost of travel between a full-time job during the day to a part-time job in the evening.
Schedule 3 of the bill will ensure that small business do not become ineligible for the small business capital gains tax concessions because deductible gift recipients are beneficiaries of a discretionary trust controlled by that small business. Under the new capital gains tax rules, small businesses must have assets of less than $5 million to be eligible for concessional treatment, including the 50 per cent active asset reduction, the 15-year asset exemption and the retirement exemption and rollover relief. This asset test includes the assets of trusts which are deemed to be controlled by small business. If a discretionary trust lists a charity or a deductible gift recipient as a beneficiary, they are viewed as controlling that charity and assets of the charity are included in the assets of the small business, possibly denying the business access to the capital gains tax concessions. The proposed amendments will ensure that the assets of the charity or deductible gift recipient which is a beneficiary of a discretionary trust are not included in the asset test to determine eligibility for a small business CGT concession. In addition, the amendments will ensure that the determination of whether a trust is controlled by a small business is based on actual distributions, not on simply being a beneficiary.
Schedule 4 of the bill makes changes to the transitional arrangements in place for the move from the Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme and the Diesel and Alternative Fuels Grants Scheme to the new Energy Grants (Credit) Scheme. On 1 July 2003 the Energy Grants (Credit) Scheme will replace the Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme and the Diesel and Alternative Fuels Grants Scheme. To facilitate the transition to the EGCS a credit could be claimed for fuel purchased in the three years before its introduction under the EGCS rather than under the Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme and Diesel and Alternative Fuels Grants Scheme. As a consequence, individuals can make claims under the transitional EGCS that did not exist under previous schemes. For example, the use of diesel to generate electricity in a retail or hospitality business without access to grid power became eligible under the DFRS on 1 July 2002. Under the transitional EGCS such activity would be eligible from 1 July 2000. The proposed amendment will ensure that fuel purchases are only eligible under the transitional EGCS arrangements where they were also eligible under either the DFRS or the DAFGS. The amendment will act retrospectively to include the recovery of claims lodged before the amendment is passed. 
Schedule 5 of this bill deals with the cost base of assets for capital gains tax purposes and the impact of the GST. Capital gains and losses are calculated with reference to the cost of the asset when it is acquired—the cost base. The cost base also takes into account any subsequent expenditure or alterations to the asset which have the net effect of increasing or decreasing the value of the asset: for example, renovating a rental property.
—Don't let us keep you up, Nick. There's is a long way to go.
—I know. I think that my voice might survive it. Due to oversights in amendments to the capital gains tax provisions at the time the new tax system was introduced the value of net input tax credits are included in the cost base of assets in certain circumstances: for example, to renovations post-September 1999. This inflates the cost base of assets, minimising capital gains and maximising capital losses. The proposed amendment would ensure that net input tax credits are never included in the cost base of an asset, which will make sure taxpayers do not receive a windfall gain from this oversight.
Schedule 6 will ensure that Australian business numbers can be disclosed to the heads of Commonwealth agencies and state and territory departments in respect of all agency and department functions. Regulations already allow for this, but it is uncertain whether these regulations are watertight and would hold up to a challenge in the courts. The amendments will simplify compliance for business as they will not have to provide their ABN to every government department they have dealings with.
Schedule 7 provides a new income tax deduction for contributions related to fundraising events where the donor receives a benefit. Under the current law and consistent with general tax principles, no deduction is allowed where the individual receives any personal benefit. This amendment will allow donors a tax deduction for contributions to charities where they receive a benefit in return. For example, individuals could claim a deduction for the cost of entry to a charity dinner. As political parties are not deductible gift recipients, it will not apply to these functions. While these amendments are contrary to basic tax principles, Labor considers that the limits placed on eligible contributions provide significant safeguards to ensure that the integrity of the tax system is not jeopardised.
Schedule 8 of the bill deals with distributions to certain entities. When the Board of Taxation conveniently recommended that the government not proceed with its promise to tax trusts like companies, it also recommended amendments to section 109UB of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. These amendments aim to ensure that a trustee cannot shelter income in a discretionary trust at the company tax rate through creating a present entitlement to a private company without paying that entitlement and then distributing the underlying cash to a beneficiary, usually through a loan payment or forgiven debt. This practice means that the income is only ever taxed at the company tax rate and not the beneficiary's marginal tax rate, creating an obvious tax advantage. The current law deems that loans in these circumstances are treated as dividends and therefore taxed at the beneficiary's marginal tax rate. The amendments in this bill would include a payment from the trust or forgiven debt in the same way as loans are currently treated.
The Senate should note that this amendment is necessary only because of the complete lack of backbone of the Howard-Costello government in relation to tackling tax abuse issues. After accepting the Ralph review's recommendations to tax trusts like companies, the Howard-Costello government performed a 2001 election backflip. This was after the Treasurer had given a signed undertaking to the shadow Treasurer to implement measures contained in the review of business taxation which would have ensured that the government's business tax reforms were revenue neutral. 
Section 46FA of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 provides certain resident companies a deduction for nonpayment of certain unfranked or partly franked non-portfolio dividends to their wholly owned foreign parents. Schedule 9 reinstates this deduction because it was inadvertently made inoperative when the intercorporate dividend rebate was repealed as part of the consolidation reforms.
Schedule 10 requires public benevolent institutions and health promotion charities to be endorsed by the Commissioner of Taxation to access relevant tax concessions. The amendments are in response to recommendations of the report of the inquiry into the definition of charities and related organisations. Following concerns raised by Labor about the loss of PBI status by a number of organisations, the government has provided transitional relief in the budget. Labor welcomes this. It is another government backflip and it will ensure that workers in crucial sectors do not face substantial drops in income. The amendments will require public benevolent institutions and health promotion charities to be endorsed by the commissioner in order to access all relevant taxation concessions such as income tax, GST and FBT relief. The organisations will be required to display their charitable status on the Australian Business Register.
Finally, schedule 11 of the bill seeks to specifically list three organisations in the tax law as deductible gift recipients. Donations and contributions for deductible gift recipients over $2 provide the donor with an income tax deduction. Organisations that do not meet the general requirements in the tax law can be specifically listed as deductible gift recipients. Schedule 11 of the bill seeks to specifically list in legislation the Dunn and Lewis Youth Development Foundation Ltd from 10 November 2003 to 9 November 2005, Crime Stoppers South Australia Inc. from 19 September 2003 and the Country Education Foundation of Australia Ltd from 20 August 2003. In addition, the specific listing of the Bowral Vietnam Memorial Walk Trust will be extended until 16 August 2005. With those comments I indicate that the Labor Party will be supporting the bill.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (2004 MEASURES NO. 1) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,43,1,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2004-06-15,"—I rise to speak to the Tax Laws Amendment (2004 Measures No. 1) Bill 2004. This is another 64 pages of taxation legislation. It is an omnibus bill covering a range of largely non-controversial areas. The 11 schedules to this bill are as follows. Schedule 1 will amend the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 to broaden the list of eligible medical expenses under the medical expenses tax offset to include payments made in maintaining properly trained dogs for guiding or assisting people with a disability. Schedule 2 will amend the income tax law to provide an income tax deduction for certain expenses incurred in travel between workplaces following a recent tax case which has challenged the long accepted deductibility of such travel. Schedule 3 will amend the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to improve the operation of the test that is used to determine when an entity controls a discretionary trust for the purpose of applying the small business capital gains tax concessions.  
Schedule 4 will amend the transitional arrangements of the Energy Grants (Credits) Scheme which deal with the treatment of claims for fuel purchased in the three years preceding the introduction of the scheme. The changes will rectify an anomaly that may result in an unintended entitlement to concessional treatment in certain circumstances under the energy grants scheme that did not previously exist in the schemes that it replaces. Schedule 5 will amend the Income Tax Assessment Act to ensure that GST net input tax credits are excluded from the reduced cost base and other relevant amounts used for the purposes of working out the amount of a capital gain or capital loss. 
Schedule 6 will amend the A New Tax System (Australian Business Number) Act 1999 to put beyond doubt the scope of the purposes for which protected Australian business number information is able to be disclosed to Commonwealth agency heads and states and territories' department heads. Schedule 7 will amend the income tax law to provide an income tax deduction for contributions of cash or property to deductible gift recipients where a minor benefit is received in return. Schedule 8 will amend the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 to ensure that a trustee cannot shelter trust income at the prevailing company tax rate by creating a present entitlement to a private company without paying it and then distributing the underlying cash to a shareholder of the company. The rules replace the former section 109UB of the Income Tax Assessment Act that had a similar but more limited application. 
Schedule 9 will amend part III of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 to ensure a deduction available to certain resident companies for on-payments for certain unfranked or partly franked non-portfolio dividends of their wholly owned foreign parents continues to be available to taxpayers. This deduction was inadvertently made inoperative with the removal of the intercorporate dividend rebate within wholly owned companies in connection with the introduction of the consolidated regime applying generally after 30 June 2003. Schedule 10 will amend the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to require charities, including public benevolent institutions and health promotion charities, to be endorsed by the commissioner in order to access all relevant taxation concessions. The amendments in schedule 10 will also require any charities so endorsed to display their charitable status on the Australian Business Register. Schedule 11 will amend the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to update the specifically listed deductible gift recipients.
This bill was examined by the Senate Economics Committee, on which I sit, and the contentious schedules examined were 7, 10 and 11. Schedule 7 allows a tax deduction for the net amount of a tax deduction above $250, where the value of any minor benefit received is no more than the lesser of 10 per cent of the donation or $100. For example, if the Cancer Council has a fundraising dinner for which it charges $500 and the actual cost of the dinner is $50, a tax deduction will be available for the remaining $450. Evidence provided was that this concession was too limited to be of any real benefit to most charities. As noted in our minority report to the Senate committee, the Democrats believe that that $250 represents too high a threshold for ordinary Australians to contribute to charities even if they are getting a tax deduction.
Schedule 10 expands the requirements for charities to be endorsed by the Taxation Office. Currently, to obtain an income tax exemption or deductible gift recipient status, the charity must obtain endorsement by the ATO. This bill will extend the endorsement to claims of GST concessions and, more importantly, the fringe benefits tax concessions available to PBIs. Due to the fact that a vast range of charities have been self-assessing as PBIs for a long time, the endorsement requirement may cause considerable angst for the sector. The Treasurer announced in a budget release that, despite conducting a Board of Taxation inquiry, the government had decided to walk away from codifying the charities definition inquiry recommendations. The government has amended the bill so that it applies from 1 July 2005, not the original 1 July 2004, but we see this as simply deferring the inevitable confusion within the sector. In the Senate Economics Committee, ACOSS stated that it was opposed to schedule 10 on the basis that it would deepen the concern and confusion surrounding the definitions of `charitable' and `public benevolent' status. My colleague Senator Cherry has been working extensively on this issue for several years, and he and I have tried hard in this area of charities. 
The issue of schedule 11 involved the potential for tax abuse via donations to the Country Education Foundation. Evidence given before the committee was that this would not be possible. The Democrats support the bill, but I have recorded our reservations with reference to schedules 7 and 10.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (2004 MEASURES NO. 1) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,43,1,speech
"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2004-06-15,"—I thank Senator Sherry and Senator Murray for their contribution and for their indication of support. The Tax Laws Amendment (2004 Measures No. 1) Bill 2004 provides a tax deduction for contributions of cash or property to deductible gift recipients where an associated minor benefit is received. I intend to highlight some of the main features of the omnibus bill. Currently, a personal tax deduction under the income tax law is only allowed for gifts to deductible gift recipients—that is, where the donor does not derive any material advantage or benefit in return for the gift. The amendment provides that, if a minor benefit is received by a person in return for making a contribution of cash or property, a tax deduction will be available based on the value of the contribution less the value of the minor benefit. The measure will not apply to fundraising events held by political parties, as earlier speakers have noted, which are not deductible gift recipients. This is yet another example, I would submit, of the government leading the way in making it easier for individuals to give to their communities. The new arrangements can but enhance the ability of deductible gift recipients in Australia to use special events, such as dinners, to fundraise.
Schedule 10, which I want to mention, will require charities, public benevolent institutions and health promotion charities to be endorsed by the Commissioner of Taxation in order to access relevant tax concessions. In addition, endorsed charities will now have their charitable status displayed on the Australian Business Register. These changes are part of the government's response to the report of the inquiry into the definition of charities and related organisations. The changes will allow greater scrutiny of the use of tax concessions by charities, improve public confidence in the provision of taxation support to the charitable sector and provide charities with certainty of their entitlements. I would like to foreshadow that I will be moving amendments to postpone the endorsement measure until 1 July 2005 in order to ensure that charities have sufficient lead time to comply with the new arrangements.
The third charities related measure will improve the operation of the test that is used to determine when an entity controls a discretionary trust for the purpose of applying the small business CGT concessions. These concessions are available only to those businesses that control assets of less than $5 million. Currently, in working out the assets controlled by a small business trust, the assets of any potential beneficiaries are included. This means that, where a small business trust has a charity as a potential beneficiary, the test inappropriately includes the assets of that charity in determining access to the CGT concessions. The changes will ensure that those businesses are not prevented from accessing the capital gains tax concessions simply because of the assets held by a charitable beneficiary. In doing so, small businesses will be encouraged to include charities as beneficiaries of these trusts. The bill also updates the specifically listed deductible gift recipients in the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997. It adds to these lists new recipients announced since 10 December 2002. Deductible gift recipient status will assist these organisations to attract public support for their activities. 
The bill broadens the list of eligible medical expenses under the medical expenses tax offset to include payments made in maintaining a dog that is properly trained for guiding or assisting a person with a disability. This will offer taxpayers with hearing dogs and assistance or service dogs the same treatment under the medical expenses tax offset as is currently available to taxpayers who maintain a dog that is trained to guide or assist the blind. The bill provides an income tax deduction for transport expenses incurred in travel between workplaces. For example, the expenses of travelling directly from one job to a second job will be deductible. Expenses incurred in travelling between two places of unrelated income-earning activity were previously allowed as deductions under a longstanding interpretation expressed in published tax rulings and in TaxPack. However, the High Court decision in the Payne case overturned the former interpretation and held that expenses incurred in travelling between two places of unrelated income-earning activity were not deductible under the general deduction provisions; hence the amendment inserts a specific provision into the income tax law to ensure that the deductibility of such expenses is reinstated.
On trusts and improving the operation of integrity rules, the bill inserts certain rules dealing with payments, loans and forgiven debts made by a trustee to a private company shareholder or a shareholder's associate. These amendments address issues concerning the effectiveness and fairness of certain antiavoidance provisions contained in the current law. Broadly speaking, the amendments will more effectively ensure that a trustee cannot shelter trust income at the prevailing company tax rate and then distribute the underlying cash to a beneficiary. In addition, the amendments have been designed with targeted safeguards to ensure that ordinary commercial transactions are not inadvertently caught by the rules.
I should mention, in relation to comments that were made concerning the government's response to the Board of Taxation report on the taxation of discretionary trusts, that in fact the board did and does support the government's decision not to tax discretionary trusts as it does companies. In fact, the government has introduced a number of trust integrity measures over recent years to address loopholes. Consistent with the board's findings, the government has now introduced rules that replace section 109UB, as earlier speakers have noted, and extend the scope of the former provision by catching a broader range of transactions but at the same time providing some flexibility by preventing legitimate commercial transactions from being penalised. In addition, I should say in the government's defence that other loopholes and areas addressed include the use of non-resident trusts to transfer funds offshore, the inappropriate utilisation of losses, tracing distributions through to the ultimate beneficiaries, personal services income rules and, of course, revised social security means test treatment of private trusts and private companies. So I do not think that it can be said that the government has simply put trusts on the backburner when quite clearly the government has moved to address the issues identified in the Board of Taxation report and indeed beyond it. 
The bill also clarifies the transitional arrangements governing the replacement of the Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme and the Diesel and Alternative Fuels Grants Scheme with the Energy Grants (Credits) Scheme. Technical amendments are also being made to ensure that the GST which may later be recovered does not count as part of the cost of an asset when calculating capital gains tax. The changes to the Australian business number rules will also ensure that the law operates as intended to prevent situations that require businesses to provide duplicate information to government. Further technical amendments will remove an unintended disincentive for foreign companies to invest in Australia through holding companies. Although there are indeed, as Senator Murray has said, a large number of pages in this omnibus bill they address—as he has also said—largely uncontroversial measures that most definitely needed attention. I commend this bill to the Senate as meeting the policy objectives for the reasons that I have outlined.

"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2004-06-15,"—We are considering the Tax Laws Amendment (2004 Measures No. 2) Bill 2004. I would be fascinated to know from the minister why the date 2004 appears twice in the bill title but only once in other bill titles. I am a bit intrigued as to why there is a difference. This bill we are dealing with is another omnibus tax bill introducing a range of largely technical amendments to the tax law. While Labor supports all the measures in the bill it welcomes in particular the Howard-Costello government's backflip on providing public ambulance services with the same fringe benefits tax treatment as public hospitals. Labor understands that there are some concerns that this will result in a reduction in the level of fringe benefits tax concession provided to public ambulance officers from $30,000 per employee to $17,000. However, given the compensation in the budget for this decrease, Labor will support the changes.
On 2 December last year the government voted against a Labor amendment to the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5) 2003 which would have provided this relief. In doing so, the government created anxiety and uncertainty amongst ambulance officers around the country. Many ambulance officers faced a drop in income of up to $200 per week and yet the government did nothing. It was not until the issue was highlighted on Neil Mitchell's radio program on 3AW in Melbourne that the government responded. Within 24 hours the Treasurer, Mr Costello, had overruled the Assistant Treasurer, Senator Coonan, and announced an FBT exemption would be granted to public ambulance services. There is a growing list of issues where the Howard-Costello government has been forced to follow Labor's agenda. I want to pay in particular a special tribute to Labor's Assistant Treasurer, the member for Kingston, Mr Cox, in the other place, who conducted a one-person campaign in respect of this issue. He has argued hard, long and strongly in respect of the ambulance officer issue.
We welcome the government's decision unveiled in the budget to implement another Labor policy—that is, we recognise the need for transitional relief for organisations that have recently lost their public benevolent institution status and therefore their fringe benefits tax exemption. Having acknowledged the backflip by the government with regard to ambulance officers I want to draw one issue to the attention of the Senate that I think is unresolved—that is, the position of the St John Ambulance service in Western Australia and the Northern Territory. I want to thank my colleague Senator Crossin from the Northern Territory for drawing this issue to our attention. We think there are still some unresolved issues in respect of the St John Ambulance service. We do not believe they are reflected in the bill. We will support the bill as far as it goes. However, we think there are some issues relating to the St John Ambulance service that do need resolving. Workers in these organisations, particularly in the disability area, are notoriously underpaid and have relied on their salary-sacrificing arrangements just to get by.
Moving to the detail of this bill, schedule 1 amends the taxation of life insurance companies. Before 1 July 2001, life insurance companies were exempt from tax or taxed concessionally on certain income. As part of the government's business tax reforms, life insurance companies are now taxed as companies. These were major reforms and the amendments in this bill seek to respond to industry and ATO concerns about the operation of the new tax regime. The amendments deal with three main types of income generated by life insurance companies. These are: the ordinary class of taxable income that is taxed at the company tax rate, and income derived in relation to risk business and ordinary investment business is included in this class; the complying superannuation class of taxable income that is taxed at the rate of 15 per cent; and non-assessable, non-exempt income derived in relation to immediate annuity business.
The bill clarifies that tax losses in each class of income can only be used against taxable income in each class of income—that is, if a tax loss occurred in the superannuation business, it could not be used against taxable income in the ordinary side of the business. The amendments also modify the taxation treatment of each type of business. In relation to risk business, the amendments ensure that provisions in the ITAA 1936 relating to reinsurance with nonresidents only apply to accident and disability risk covered by the relevant reinsurance contracts. Certain reinsurance commissions are included in assessable income and the basis for determining the amount of the decrease in the value of policy liabilities that is included in assessable income is the same as the basis for determining the amount of the increase in the value of policy liabilities that is deductible.
In relation to ordinary investment business, the amendments clarify that the deduction for the capital component of ordinary investment policies does not apply to other types of policies, ensure that funeral policies issued by friendly societies are taxed as ordinary investment policies, ensure that the amount of the reduction in exit fees over the term of a life insurance policy is deductible and ensure that the risk rider premiums are included in assessable income.
In relation to complying superannuation business, the amendments clarify the scope of the deduction for the capital component of premiums received in respect of virtual pooled superannuation trust policies; clarify the scope of the liabilities that can be supported by virtual pooled superannuation trust assets; allow up to 30 days after the time that the transfer value of the virtual pooled superannuation trust assets is determined or the time that the value of the virtual pooled superannuation trust liabilities is determined, whichever is later, to transfer excess assets out of the virtual pool of superannuation trust; and impose administrative penalties for the failure to undertake the required valuations of assets and liabilities or to transfer excess assets out of the virtual pooled superannuation trust within the specified time periods.
In relation to immediate annuity business, the amendments modify the types of policies that are exempt life insurance policies; clarify the scope of the liabilities that can be supported by segregated exempt assets; allow up to 30 days after the time that the transfer value of the segregated exempt assets is determined or the time that the value of the exempt life insurance policy liabilities is determined, whichever is later, to transfer excess assets out of the segregated exempt assets; and impose administrative penalties for the failure to undertake the required valuations of assets and liabilities or to transfer excess assets out of the segregated exempt assets within the specified time periods. I hope all the senators in the chamber have been following this in great detail. The bill also includes a number of technical amendments to the operation of a life insurance regime. 
Schedule 2 of the bill deals with the consolidation regime. The consolidation regime was introduced on 1 July 2002 and allows groups of companies to be treated as a single entity for taxation purposes. The amendments in this bill will provide greater flexibility to consolidated groups and clarify the operation of the consolidation regime. There is a range of amendments to the consolidation regime included in the bill, including: allowing corporate unit trusts and public trading trusts to head up a consolidated group, which is appropriate as these types of trusts are taxed like companies; aligning the period in which a choice is made to continue as a consolidated group when shares are exchanged in one company for shares in another company, with a notification period for events affecting consolidated groups; implementing special rules for determining the income tax consequences that arise where a partner or a partnership leaves a consolidated group; modifications to the clear exit pool and the pay-as-you-go, PAYG, instalment liability rules; and clarifying that a group liability can be subject to only one tax-sharing agreement.
Schedule 3 of the bill deals with the venture capital regime which established three kinds of limited partnerships as a mechanism for accessing tax concessions. These amendments ensure that limited partnerships that are separate legal entities are eligible to access the venture capital concessions. Schedule 4 of the bill will allow for continuity of FBT treatment for non-remote housing benefits where administration and payment of FBT is devolved by state or territory governments to a departmental level. Schedule 5 of the bill amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to ensure that a capital gains tax, CGT, event is not inadvertently created by the disposal of new interests in demerged entities.
Schedule 6 provides an explicit income tax deduction for individuals that must make United Medical Protection Ltd support payments. Without these amendments, only a practising doctor could claim a deduction for UMP support payments. Retiring or non-practising doctors that are required to make support payments would not be eligible for a deduction because these payments do not relate to their taxable incomes. These amendments ensure that all individuals that make UMP support payments can deduct these payments from their taxable income, which is done on fairness grounds, as retired or non-practising doctors are effectively incurring expenses related to past income. Schedule 7 of the bill will ensure that the goods and services tax, GST, insurance provisions apply as intended to transactions undertaken by operators for compulsory third party, CTP, schemes.
Schedule 8 of the bill provides a limited response to recommendations made by the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation, from their inquiry into taxation and transfers from overseas superannuation funds. Australian residents can transfer superannuation funds from overseas accounts into Australian superannuation accounts. If such a transfer occurs within six months of the individual becoming an Australian resident, the funds are not taxed. But if the transfer occurs after six months, any investment earnings from when that individual became an Australian resident are taxable. Currently that tax must be paid by the individual at their marginal tax rate, not the concessional 15 per cent superannuation tax. This can create a significant financial difficulty for individuals because they cannot access the superannuation funds, to actually pay the tax, until retirement. To avoid the situation of individuals not being able to meet their tax liability or being deterred from bringing overseas superannuation to Australia, the amendments in this bill make the superannuation fund liable for the tax. The investment earnings on the overseas superannuation will be taxed at the normal concessional 15 per cent superannuation rate rather than the individual's marginal tax rate. The bill also amends the foreign investment funds rule to ensure that transfers of overseas superannuation into complying Australian super funds are not taxed twice. 
Schedule 10 includes some minor amendments to the simplified imputation system. The bill contains a minor amendment that ensures the provisions for the carrying forward of excess foreign tax credits operate properly following changes to the tax credit provisions that were made as a result of the Timor Sea Treaty. Finally, schedule 12 of the bill amends the alienation of the personal services income provisions to clarify when the Commissioner of Taxation can make a personal services business determination which is consistent with the policy intent. The effect of the commissioner granting a PSB determination is that the PSI provisions do not apply to the taxpayer. With those comments, the Labor Party will be supporting this bill.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (2004 MEASURES NO. 2) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,44,1,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2004-06-15,"—I rise to speak to the Tax Laws Amendment (2004 Measures No. 2) Bill 2004. Senator Sherry, in opening your remarks you asked the minister why bills are now titled like this. I suspect you will have to ask Senator Crossin and the Scrutiny of Bills Committee, on which I sit, because we criticised the way in which tax bills were being titled, particularly when they were going from one year to another, and they have come up with this solution—which, from your remarks, you do not think is much of a solution. I must admit that, despite having the tax portfolio, I remain as confused as ever about these titles. Still, I am not confused about what is in this bill. This is another 166 pages of tax law, on top of the 64 pages in the bill that we have just dealt with. I am of the view that the next government should introduce an efficiency dividend idea: that no tax law can be introduced into the Senate chamber unless the equivalent number of pages are knocked out of the tax act so that we get a tax page neutral measure. The number of pages is just climbing and climbing—and we have still got to get to the new international tax bill, which will add some more pages.
The Senate must obviously place a degree of reliance on the work of the Treasury officials responsible for the tax laws. A lot of this bill we are now debating is technical amendments that have no revenue impact but simply correct earlier errors. I do not condemn either the ATO, who had these legislative design responsibilities earlier, or the Treasury, who have them now, one bit for making errors in tax law. It is very difficult to get all the cross-referencing accurate, which I think is another sign that we really do need to make one more effort to simplify the system.
The 12 schedules to this bill are generally noncontroversial. Eight of them have a nil or negligible impact on taxation revenue; the others range from a revenue gain of $1 million to a revenue cost of $5 million. Schedule 1 to this bill modifies the operation of the income tax law affecting life insurance companies. In particular, the amendments affect: the basis of working out the ordinary class and complying superannuation class of taxable income or tax losses, the taxation treatment of risk business, the taxation treatment of ordinary investment business, the operation of the virtual pooled superannuation trust and the operation of the segregated exempt assets. There are also a range of technical amendments. Schedule 2 to the bill provides greater flexibility to and clarifies certain aspects of the consolidation regime—much beloved by me and other policy wonks—and ensures that the regime interacts appropriately with other aspects of the income tax law. Democrats have long been supportive of the intent of the consolidation regime. 
Schedule 3 to this bill amends the ITAA 1997 and the ITAA 1936 to ensure that a limited partnership, formed with a legal personality separate from its partners and taxed as an ordinary partnership under the venture capital regime, is a `partnership' for income tax purposes. Schedule 4 to this bill amends the FBTAA 1986 to allow for continuity of FBT treatment for non-remote housing benefits where administration and payment of FBT is devolved by state or territory governments to a departmental level. Schedule 5 to this bill amends the ITAA 1997 to ensure that capital gains tax event K6 is not inadvertently triggered by the disposal of new interests in demerged entities.
Schedule 6 to this bill amends the ITAA 1997 to ensure that all individuals who make UMP support payments will be entitled to an income tax deduction for the amount of their contributions in that income year. This is part of the package aimed at resolving the medical indemnity crisis that my colleague Senator Ridgeway has been heavily involved with. The Democrats support the deductibility of the medical support insurance payments. Schedule 7 to this bill amends the GST act to ensure that the goods and services insurance provisions apply as intended to transactions undertaken by operators of compulsory third party schemes.
Schedule 8 to this bill amends the FBTAA 1986 to provide public ambulance services with the same FBT treatment as is provided to public hospitals. It has the largest revenue impact, being $5 million a year, but—to use that extremely hackneyed phrase—does put everybody on the same level playing field. Public ambulance services will be able to access an FBT exemption of up to $17,000 of grossed up taxable value per employee and will also be able to access the remote area housing FBT exemption under the same criteria as apply to public hospitals. Senator Sherry tends to be a great player for his team and does not mention other teams that much, so he failed to give us credit for being the joint proposers of this measure in December last year. It was rejected by the government at the time and has now been accepted. We raised it with the government and with the opposition and we are glad that the government has seen fit to come to the party. As a result of a recent court case, technically most public ambulance services have lost their public benevolent institution or PBI status. This means that they cannot provide employees with up to $30,000 in tax-free fringe benefits. The schedule will give all public ambulance authorities a $17,000 FBT exemption, in line with the treatment of public hospitals. That treatment has been in place for some time now—four years, I think.
St John Ambulance in both Western Australia and the Northern Territory will—as has been mentioned earlier—remain a public benevolent institution and would like us to amend the bill so that they continue to obtain the $30,000 FBT exemption. The difficulty that emerged for ambulance services was that in most states and territories they were considered to be government instrumentalities for tax purposes and therefore were not entitled to the FBT allowance of $30,000—in fact, they were not entitled to any FBT allowance. Now they have been given the $17,000 allowance, which is in line with the treatment of public hospitals. But, of course, we would then have the situation where St John Ambulance in Western Australia and the Northern Territory, which are not government instrumentalities, would be operating on a more beneficial basis than were the rest. St John Ambulance in Western Australia came to see me about this matter and I was sympathetic to their plight. But I had forgotten that the government in its budget had in fact given a three-year funding top-up, if you like, to compensate them for the change and to allow them time to adjust their employer relationships and to put new employees coming into the system on the new arrangement. I understand St John Ambulance in both Western Australia and Northern Territory being concerned that there is going to be a shift in the arrangements, but I can see no way around the good principle that the government is putting forward, that everybody should be on the same basis when they are delivering the same service. So it is an awkward one.  
There will be administrative uncertainty as a result of this change if staff work in dual roles—for example, if they work partly for the public ambulance service and partly in other PBI activities, such as the provision of first aid training. I note that the Treasurer announced on budget night the matter I mentioned earlier: the provision of financial grants to compensate ambulance authorities for the next three years. Minister, I now ask you, on the record, to cover the situation for Western Australia and the Northern Territory and indicate the way in which government will assist in overcoming any transitional difficulties.
On 3 December 2003, in rejecting the Democrat and Labor amendments, Parliamentary Secretary Ross Cameron said:
The other concern with the amendment is that the bill may actually have a deleterious effect on the availability of tax concessions to ambulance services. For example, ambulance services that are at present public benevolent institutions are entitled not to $17,000 but to $30,000 gross taxable value per employee. If we look at an organisation like the St John's Ambulance Association—which, for example, is providing ambulance services under contract to the Western Australian and Northern Territory governments—as a public benevolent institution but not as a public hospital we see that St John's is currently entitled to the higher value of $30,000 per employee. It seems to me on first reading of the opposition's amendment—
it was a Democrat-Labor amendment—
that there is a real possibility that, if St John's were to be treated in the same way as a public hospital, they would lose that higher entitlement. I am sure that is not the intention of the opposition but that appears to me to be a likely consequence of the amendment. So for those reasons the government will be opposing the amendment.
Clearly, the government decided, in the interests of integrity and consistency, to take away the higher entitlement of the St John Ambulance in Western Australia and the Northern Territory and bring up, from no entitlement to a $17,000 entitlement, the rest of the states and territories.
The last thing I want to mention before going off this schedule is that Senator Stott Despoja has raised the matter of the Julia Farr Centre in Adelaide, which provides services for those with an intellectual disability. That was affected because the state government had the power to appoint some board members and that was sufficient to have it regarded as a government institution for the purposes of tax office rulings. I think there is an issue when you have government participation or partnership in PBIs putting at risk their status. I think there needs to be some kind of panel or appeal body, which is simple and easy for people to access, to ensure that a `technical infringement', if you like, does not result in the loss of a meaningful benefit to great inconvenience to the PBI concerned. 
Schedule 9 to this bill amends the ITAA 1936 to alter the taxation treatment that applies when payments are made from overseas superannuation funds. The amendments give effect to the government's response to the report by the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation on taxation of transfers from overseas superannuation funds. The key change will enable a taxpayer who is having their overseas superannuation paid directly to an Australian complying superannuation fund to elect to have part of the payment treated as a taxable contribution in the Australian fund. By the taxpayer doing so, the fund, rather than the individual, will pay relevant tax arising on the payment and tax will be paid at the concessional superannuation fund rate rather than at the individual's marginal rate.
Schedule 10 to this bill amends, as part of the implementation of the SIS, division 207 of the ITAA 1997, the tax effect of receiving a franked distribution. The amendments will include adjustment rules to provide the calculation to adjust an entity's assessable income where a franked distribution flows indirectly to the entity through a trust or partnership and the entity has no entitlement to a tax offset. This bill will also amend the rules in the trans-Tasman imputation measures that adjust the assessable income of an Australian shareholder in receipt of a supplementary dividend paid by a New Zealand company.
Schedule 11 to this bill changes the provisions dealing with the carry-forward of excess foreign tax credits to ensure those provisions refer to the correct paragraphs in the general foreign tax credit provisions. Schedule 12 to this bill amends the alienation of the PSI provisions contained in part 2-42 of the ITAA 1997 to clarify when the commissioner can make a personal service business determination, as is consistent with the policy intent. 
That is our review of the bill. The Democrats will be supporting all the schedules of the bill without amendment but we seek clarification from the minister with respect to the two issues I have raised. The first is the treatment of Western Australia and Northern Territory St John Ambulance organisations, with a continuing regard to assisting them in this transitional period. The second issue is the situation raised by Senator Stott Despoja where appointments from a government to a PBI's management board, or other bodies, disturb its tax status because it could be conceived as being a government instrumentality.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (2004 MEASURES NO. 2) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,44,1,speech
"Webber, Sen Ruth",ALP,2004-06-15,"—The Tax Laws Amendment (2004 Measures No. 2) Bill 2004—don't bills have complicated names these days?—contains a number of measures announced in this year's budget. As Senator Murray has already said, like all tax amendment bills this is a complex piece of legislation that goes to 12 schedules. Senator Murray concentrated on a number of schedules. Because I am from Western Australia I want to concentrate my remarks on only one.
While the ALP will support the measures in the bill, there is still some concern in my home state of Western Australia regarding the provisions of schedule 8—public ambulance services. The problem is that all this government seems to have is a one size fits all solution: it is clearly evident in this schedule. Ambulance services in Western Australia are not provided by the government. The St John Ambulance service in Western Australia is directly affected by the provisions of this legislation—or so I am told. 
In December last year the government voted against the ALP's amendment—and, as Senator Murray has reminded us, it was cosponsored by the Democrats—to the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5) 2003, which would have provided relief to public ambulance services. Essentially, the government has now returned with schedule 8 and ensured that public ambulance services are treated in the same manner as public hospitals—which is a good thing. However, the shortfall occurs in the case of the St John Ambulance service in Western Australia.
—And in the Northern Territory.
—Yes, I am parochial, Senator Crossin, so I talk about Western Australia, but indeed it is true also in the Northern Territory. The St John Ambulance service in Western Australia is not a public ambulance service. By definition, the St John Ambulance service in Western Australia does not fall into the category of a public ambulance service. The reality is that the St John Ambulance service is a public ambulance service in all but name. However, in terms of the law, the St John Ambulance service is operated by a non-profit organisation that, although supported by the government, is not defined as a public ambulance service. Western Australia is disadvantaged—as indeed is the Northern Territory—because our ambulance service is different from those in other states. Therefore, the St John Ambulance service will not fall under schedule 8 guidelines and ambulance officers in Western Australia will be subject to a potential loss of income.
The facts are that the St John Ambulance service in Western Australia covers the largest area covered by any ambulance service in the world—some 2½ million square kilometres. It is often staffed by volunteers and private staff. On any given day it receives over 300 calls for assistance. There are over 280 ambulance paramedics located in some 29 locations. Over 2,500 volunteer ambulance officers provide services across Western Australia. There are nearly 400 ambulance vehicles and 10 patient transport vehicles. It may come as a surprise to people in the rest of Australia that ambulance services would be provided by something that is not public. By any commonsense approach this is a public ambulance service provided by a non-profit organisation for all the people of Western Australia. It is a service that is jointly funded by government and the public and yet does not fall under schedule 8 of these taxation amendments. There is clearly a need to address the inequality in treatment between ambulance services in other states and those in Western Australia and, as Senator Crossin reminds me, those in the Northern Territory.
The St John Ambulance service in Western Australia deserves equal treatment under the law as applies to ambulance services in other states. Indeed, as Senator Murray has said, the arrangement in this legislation is an awkward one. We can argue about whether the definition of a public ambulance service is correct but on the ground the employees of the organisation providing public ambulance services in Western Australia deserve equal treatment. One wonders why the government, when it was making the decision to make these changes contained within schedule 8 that ensure public ambulance services are treated the same as public hospitals, did not consider the situations in Western Australia and the Northern Territory.
Let us be clear about this. Labor first raised concerns about this issue in December last year when we attempted to amend the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5) 2003. In fact, the government was caught on the hop at that time. It shows how much it knows about the operation of ambulance services Australia-wide. The Treasurer announced after the issue was made public on Melbourne radio that the government was going to make the same FBT exemption as would apply to public hospitals. The government has had over six months to make sure it gets the schedule right, yet somehow it has managed to overlook the situation in Western Australia and the Northern Territory. The fact remains that the government came up with a fix last December, worked on it until the budget this year, drafted the legislation and still managed to overlook the operations of the St John Ambulance in Western Australia—yet another example of the people that this government tends to forget. It made sure it got the issue off Melbourne radio within 24 hours last December, but it ignored the unique situation in my home state of Western Australia.

"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2004-06-15,"—In summing up on the Tax Laws Amendment (2004 Measures No. 2) Bill 2004, I will address the schedules from the government's perspective. In response to Senator Sherry, the renaming of the omnibus tax bills follows, as I understand it, suggestions of the Office of Parliamentary Counsel responding to concerns—Senator Murray is quite right—of the Scrutiny of Bills Committee. Senator Crossin would no doubt be able to confirm this. The committee had noted the confusion caused when omnibus tax bills, formerly called TLABs, were introduced in one year and passed in another and so changed their name—that is, the number would change along the way. By placing the number of the bill and the year in which it was introduced in parenthesis, this element of the name of the bill will remain unchanged whatever the bill's fate. I hope that clarifies it for Senator Sherry.
Tax reform that makes businesses more competitive represents an investment by this government in securing a successful economy, and it is in this setting that jobs, investment and trade opportunities are created, all of which are fundamental to our continuing economic prosperity. This bill, although once again Senator Murray chides us for its length, does deliver on the government's commitment to creating an environment in which businesses can have certainty and can prosper, and of course that benefits all Australians.
We have been responsive to industry calls to remove impediments to business investment and restructuring that occur in some parts of this bill. In particular, the engagement and consultation we have had with business and industry in the design and implementation of tax reform has been a hallmark of the approach. This bill does demonstrate our commitment to consultation and to a preparedness to both listen and act.
Amendments are being made to improve the practical operation of the income tax law affecting life insurance companies and to ensure those provisions interact appropriately with other provisions in the income tax law. The government is implementing further measures to give taxpayers greater flexibility and certainty as they move into the new consolidation regime, which has been of course a mighty task. As the new consolidation regime has changed the tax landscape for many corporate groups, we have continued to consult actively with business on the implementation and to make changes where absolutely necessary, and the bill reflects the results of that ongoing consultation.
Amendments are also being made to ensure that limited partnerships with a legal personality separate from their partners are able to access venture capital tax concessions, which of course has been sought by industry. The concessions encourage non-resident investment in the Australian VC industry by providing incentives for increased investments in start-ups and expanding businesses that would otherwise have some difficulty in attracting investment. The law is also amended to ensure that the pre capital gains tax status of membership interests is fully preserved following a demerger. This would ensure that capital gains tax is not inadvertently triggered by the disposal of new interest in demerged entities, creating a taxing point. Therefore, the measure will remove an obstacle to an entity choosing to restructure by demerging.  
Several technical amendments are also being made to the GST law to ensure that the insurance provisions apply to intended transactions undertaken by operators of compulsory third party schemes. Once again these amendments address the needs of the industry for clarification of some specific issues brought to the government's attention. As part of the further implementation of the simplified imputation system, the amendments will complete the rules that deal with the receipt of a franked distribution indirectly through a partnership or trust. 
In addition to this range of business tax measures, the bill also implements a number of other tax measures. It has introduced a scheme to address the unfunded incurred but not reported liabilities of MDOs and introduces a contribution scheme which imposes a liability on doctors to fund the scheme. The bill ensures that individuals who make United Medical Protection Ltd support payments will be entitled to an income tax deduction for the amount of their contributions in that income year.
A recent court decision, as we all know from questions in this place and other explorations, found that some public ambulance services were ineligible for the fringe benefit tax exemption of up to $30,000 per employee available to public benevolent institutions. The government subsequently announced that it would make an FBT exemption of up to $17,000 per employee available to public ambulance services consistent with that available for public hospitals. So it was intended to be a level playing field. In addition, as announced in the budget, Commonwealth grants will be made to support organisations in the transition to this lower FBT concession. During the debate I was asked how the grants would be calculated for public benevolent institutions. I can advise Senator Murray in particular that the ATO is working with those organisations to correctly calculate the extent to which they are entitled to the compensatory grant. The ATO will be contacting all affected organisations to ensure that the grants compensate for the change in public benevolent institution status and the effects of this on their fringe benefit tax liability.
I was also asked specifically about Senator Stott Despoja's identified circumstance—I think it was the junior fire service in South Australia—and obviously it is important as Senator Murray has identified that some technical infringement is not seen to be prohibitive to the accessing of benefits to which they would otherwise be entitled. It obviously depends very much on the particular circumstances and I would certainly consider that this would come within the category of ATO consultations that I have just identified.

"Santoro, Sen Santo",LP,2004-06-15,"—Ronald Reagan has left us, an occurrence that countless millions across our world find to be very sad. Death is the inevitable finality of life, the last of the fundamental rites of passage in the human existence, but it is never something we want to face for ourselves, for our loved ones or, indeed, for our friends. President George W. Bush said it best, I believe, in America during the week-long process of saying goodbye to the former President. He said that President Reagan belonged to God now but we liked it better when he belonged to us.
In fact, a lot has been said about Ronald Reagan since his death and even more written. In a way, that is strange, because President Reagan was really a man of few words. His was a measured pace. The message that he delivered was clear. It was concise. It was simple. In an age of the unelected smart alec, it is the in thing for the chattering classes to denigrate those who express views that fail to accord with the perceived wisdom of the moment. That is a blot on the landscape of Western democracy. We must never forget that democracy thrives best on courtesy in an environment where Voltaire's famous rule is unchallenged and where, as in the past, it is possible to argue without stooping to baseness. President Reagan was a courteous man. He was also a surprising man.
Someone, and I think it was Colin Powell, the American Secretary of State, once President Reagan's national security adviser—but it does not really matter who it was—said after his death that he was a B-grade actor and an A-grade President. That is not a bad one-liner. President Reagan might in fact have got a laugh out of it himself. If he had said it himself—and that is by no means an inconceivable notion—he would certainly have done so with panache and with that hint of a wicked, slightly self-deprecating little smile that was one of his trademarks. Who could forget his `Honey, I forgot to duck' line to his wife Nancy after the 1981 assassination attempt? But to say that he was a B-grade actor and just leave it at that is also to denigrate him, for B-grade movies—like the flip sides of records, another entertainment genre that has ridden off into the sunset—were the staple of the film industry, the entertainment of millions of people around the world. We remember President Reagan's courage not only in office but when afterwards he was afflicted by Alzheimer's disease and announced that fact publicly and said that he was going away into a long sunset. Would that we could all find that much courage in such circumstances.
The words of two of his greatest international collaborators in ending the Cold War, expressed last week during the ceremonial farewells, bear repeating here tonight. Former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said:
He will be missed not only by those who knew him and not only by the nation that he served so proudly and loved so deeply but also by millions of men and women who live in freedom today because of the policies he pursued.
She further said:
Ronald Reagan had a higher claim than any other leader to have won the Cold War for liberty, and he did it without a shot being fired.
To have achieved so much against so many odds and with such humour and humanity made Ronald Reagan a truly great American hero.
Former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev said:
I feel great regret. Reagan was a statesman who, despite all disagreements that existed between our countries at the time, displayed foresight and determination to meet our proposals half way and change our relations for the better, stop the nuclear race, start scrapping nuclear weapons, and arrange normal relations between our countries. 
And here is another tribute from a little country far away that I think captures precisely what Ronald Reagan really meant to the world that he changed. It is from the former Speaker of the Lithuanian parliament, Vytautas Landsbergis. He said:
A man died who believed in freedom and changed the world. This is President Ronald Reagan, to whom Lithuania is grateful and will remain grateful for his firm resistance to the Evil Empire, giving us an opportunity for us to regain our freedom and return to democracy.
Honourable senators will know that, as much as I am an Australian patriot, I am also an unabashed supporter of the American nation and the American people. I am an unabashed supporter because the values that are America's heritage are good values—and because they are Australian values too. 
I believe that America's democracy and the American people's commitment to freedom for their country and for others is the most powerful weapon for good. These are commitments that Australians freely share and seek to foster in a violent world. It is customary in some circles to decry the alliance we have with the Americans. Some people promote a view that Australia's distinct national objectives can be achieved without that alliance or, if not without it, while we are chorusing catcalls from the sidelines. Some of them even write songs about this great self-delusion. They set them to catchy tunes and make a lucrative career out of performing them and displaying their ignorance of history. I do not know of one American, or of one American administration, that has or has had imperial designs on us or indeed anyone. The United States was founded on liberty. Its revolutionaries fought for their freedom and that of their fellow colonists and founded a magnificent and enduring nation. It is true that, in the nearly 2½ centuries since then, international affairs and global politics have drawn America into conflicts and compromises. It is true that, in those intervening years, the face of America has changed. The same is true of every nation, and our own is no exception. But the genius of America has been to harness popular will to great projects, to hold fast to the democratic ideal and to take those benefits to the four corners of the world. The genius of American leaders has been to focus on the dream, to look for the shining city on the distant hill and to take their countrymen towards it. Those dreams, those precepts, that unshakeable faith, are also Australian traits. We too in this country are builders—in our own way, to our own design and according to our own national imperatives.
More so than most, President Reagan was a man who dreamed, a visionary who spied the shining city and who would not accept that it was an unreachable goal. I would like to share with honourable senators a tribute I posted on the Ronald Reagan memorial web site:
President Reagan was the voice of liberty. He enunciated the West's final challenge to monolithic communism in the heady days of the 1980s when the inherent contradictions of Marxism finally and fatally cracked. He stood tall among world leaders, yet forever retained the common touch.
His was a moral authority, exemplified in his response to the Challenger disaster and his truly inspired speech in Normandy on the 40th anniversary of the D Day landings. History will mark him as a great man.
