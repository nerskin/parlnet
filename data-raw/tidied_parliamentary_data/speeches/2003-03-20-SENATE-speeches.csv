"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2003-03-20,—by leave—I would like to speak briefly on the order of business for the day. It is private members' time on Thursday afternoons. I draw to the Senate's attention that that time is available for private members. I have sought from the opposition on a number of occasions the opportunity to discuss legislation that I have before the chamber. I will be writing today to the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate to seek time for the discussion of Greens legislation. It is very important to recognise that this time is for private members and not just for the opposition.,SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Consideration of Legislation</title>,Business,3,1
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2003-03-20,"—by leave—I would like to make a statement in reply. The normal procedure is for those matters to be reappraised. If there is a time that you want, I am sure you can come and talk to me and we can arrange it.
—I have done that a number of times. Right throughout last year you were approached.

If the Greens do want to renew their approach, I am sure the matter will be taken into consideration and dealt with.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Consideration of Legislation</title>,Business,3,1
"Hogg, Sen John",ALP,2003-03-20,"—When I spoke on the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Legislation Amendment Bill 2002 a fortnight ago, I referred to the difficulties a Mr Millar was having in respect of the operation of this legislation in terms of his small business on the Sunshine Coast in Queensland. I drew to the attention of the chamber in that debate the particular difficulties he had experienced in the audit process. Given that there is a need to expedite these bills today, I am not going to take terribly much longer, except to say that there was a PricewaterhouseCoopers survey, an issues paper in 1998 and a report on 13 January 1999. That report basically recommended changes in fee structures and changes in the categories, particularly the low-risk category that would have interested Mr Millar and operators similar to Mr Millar.
Mr Millar's perspective was that the recommendations were ignored. That in part is true, but one hopes that the problems and the difficulties that Mr Millar and similar operators have experienced over a long period of time will be addressed as a result of this particular piece of legislation that is before this chamber today. It seems to Mr Millar— and to me, from my discussions with him— that, at the end of the day, what he is seeking and what other operators similar to Mr Millar are seeking is just for commonsense to come into play. Mr Millar has expressed to me that he and other operators are not against regulation, so the issue of regulation is not in question. What they are opposed to is the overregulation, particularly of their one person operated small businesses, that has existed under the legislation since 1994. Mr Millar now hopes that, with this legislation, any of the difficulties that have confronted his business—not only those from the red tape point of view but also those which have imposed excessive financial burdens upon his business—will be removed.
To save taking this into the committee stage, I have a question I will raise now in my speech on the second reading debate which I would seek a response to from the parliamentary secretary, if he would be pleased to do so. The question is: what benefits will flow from the current legislative amendments to small manufacturers of agricultural and veterinary chemicals from being able to access the low regulatory scheme? I am sure that the parliamentary secretary will provide an answer that will give some hope to Mr Millar and similar operators. I believe the sooner the legislation is up and running, the sooner people such as Mr Millar will be able to get about their business and make a success of their life. ",SENATE,<title>AGRICULTURAL AND VETERINARY CHEMICALS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,17,1
"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2003-03-20,"—The Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Legislation Amendment Bill 2002 introduces reforms to the National Registration Scheme for Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals. These reforms will streamline and improve the operation of the scheme, which was created by Labor in 1991. The key reform in this bill is the introduction of a new low regulatory regime for certain agricultural and veterinary chemicals. This amendment constitutes a response to a recommendation of the national competition policy review of agricultural and veterinary legislation.
The bill will also expand the deemed permits mechanism to ensure that stockpiles of chemicals that lose registration can be utilised safely. This utilisation, including disposal, must be consistent with the instructions contained in the deemed permit issued by the National Registration Authority. The bill's labelling changes will require agricultural and veterinary chemical labels to contain instructions for use and introduce greater consistency in the use of language relating to these instructions.
Administrative changes include an enhancement of the National Registration Authority's capacity to vary conditions of approval, registration and labelling; a new capacity for the National Registration Authority to seek public comment as part of any reconsideration process; and increased penalty provisions. The bill is designed to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the National Registration Scheme by reducing the administrative burden on businesses. It is intended, however, to continue to protect public health, environmental safety and our trade credentials.
I want to briefly address the importance of farm chemicals to Australian agriculture. Farm chemicals assist Australian farmers, graziers and orchardists to produce quality products for domestic and international markets. While farmers quite sensibly seek to minimise the use of chemicals in production, they make an important contribution to the productive capacity of our land. Dependent on this system are no less important matters than the prosperity of Australia's rural industries, the maintenance of our export markets and the health of rural workers, animals and the environment.
There are three components to an adequate agricultural and veterinary chemical control regime: registration, control and residue monitoring. While this bill concerns the registration of chemicals, it is important to acknowledge that, if one component of the regime fails, the whole program fails. The proper assessment, registration and regulation of agricultural and veterinary chemicals does, of course, provide an important safeguard for the health and safety of Australian consumers and the natural environment. In this regard, I am pleased to note the outcome of the 20th Total Diet Survey released on 28 February 2003. The survey found very low levels of chemical residues and contaminants in our food. In so doing, it reaffirmed the fact that Australia's food supply is safe and clean.
You will not find any acknowledgment of this in the second reading speech by the minister, but the matter of the assessment, registration and regulation of agricultural chemicals is one that Labor primary industries ministers addressed seriously. Labor worked cooperatively with the states on a range of agricultural issues. One of the outcomes of that cooperation was the creation of an effective national chemical registration scheme.
In the context of the antagonistic speech by the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry at the opening of the Outlook 2003 conference two weeks ago, it is worth pausing and reflecting on the good that can be done when the Commonwealth recognises it has national responsibilities and acts accordingly. It is obvious to almost everyone in the country, except Mr Truss, that ongoing brawls with the states are a waste of time and energy. The previous Labor government could not have built the National Registration Scheme between 1992 and 1995 without cooperation from the states. Labor remains a supporter of the scheme we established. Accordingly, I am pleased to indicate our support for the changes proposed in the bill, changes that are designed to improve its efficiency and effectiveness. 
I do, however, have one final matter to address. A few weeks ago the National Registration Authority's web site started advising visitors that a decision had been made to change the name of the authority to the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority. The site says the new name better reflects the function of the authority and will help engender continuing confidence in the regulatory system. Senator Troeth also issued a media release making the same point. However, because the legislation that controls the operation of the authority refers to the NRA, the name change will literally be in name only. That is, the new name will be used in public communication but not in formal documents or processes. The NRA advises legislative amendment will be sought later this year to formally effect the name change. Given the subject of the amendment bill before us, including the broad scope of its changes, I ask the parliamentary secretary to advise the Senate why the legislative name change was not implemented concurrently with the public name change. Is the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry incompetent or just inefficient?",SENATE,<title>AGRICULTURAL AND VETERINARY CHEMICALS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,17,1
"Boswell, Sen Ron",NP,2003-03-20,"—I have sought advice. In response to Senator Hogg's question, while I believe that it is inappropriate for me to discuss the details of the individual circumstances relating to any registration or application, I can say, without intending to prejudice the NRA's future deliberations on the matter, that it is the intention of the signatories to the National Registration Scheme to include chemical products such as those made by Mr Millar in the low regulatory scheme where a suitable standard, including those aspects relating to quality control, can be developed by the NRA. I think that answers Senator Hogg's question, and he will no doubt give that message to Mr Millar. In response to Senator O'Brien's last question, I have an answer here. It says that the name of the bill is irrelevant. The decision by signatories to the NRA's scheme is to change the name at a later time.
—So is he incompetent or inefficient?
—He is neither incompetent nor inefficient; he is a great minister. I keep telling Senator O'Brien that. I think most of the people in rural Australia would acknowledge that Minister Warren Truss does an excellent job. But, as a part of Senator O'Brien's job, he has to lead the attack for the Labor Party. I do not think many people are convinced by his weekly attacks on Warren Truss.

"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2003-03-20,"—I have further information in relation to a number of questions that were asked of me. One was from Senator Evans in relation to laser designators on our FA18s. I will seek to have further information incorporated in Hansard. I am pleased to say it confirms what I said in the Senate yesterday.
The document read as follows—
Do all of the FA18s deployed to the Gulf have the necessary laser designators to guide paveway bombs? If not, doesn't this mean that some of our aircraft are unable to use precision laser-guided bombs? Wouldn't the use of so-called `dumb' bombs inherently increase the risk of damage to non-military targets? Also, will our aircraft be armed only with Australian munitions, or will we also be using US munitions, including their JDAM precision bombs?
All our F/A-18 aircraft deployed to the Middle East are fully equipped for the roles they will undertake. This includes the necessary laser designators for precision guided weapons of the Paveway family.
The aircraft equipment that enables the delivery of precision Laser Guided Bombs is considered to be mission critical. Therefore, if this equipment was unserviceable the aircraft would not be used for the delivery of precision munitions.
The F/A-18 can deliver Australian and US Laser Guided Bombs and their weapons will be drawn from US sources and paid for by Australia under a Foreign Military Sales contract. Any task that can be completed using dumb bombs will have passed the targeting analysis phase that includes estimation of weapons effects and accuracy, weaponeering, and collateral damage assessment. Dumb bombs will only be used against appropriately selected targets in accordance with Australian Rules of Engagement and Laws of Armed Conflict.
The US are also using JDAM (Joint Direct Attack Munitions) which uses a geographic homing system. Our F/A-18 Hornet aircraft cannot use these weapons as the weapon requires aircraft navigation information and our aircraft are not configured to pass this information.
—I have further information for Senator Lundy, which is that no ammunition containing depleted uranium has been used by the ADF since mid-1990. The Javelin does not use depleted uranium. That is also consistent with my answer. That is two out of two. The third one was the question that was asked by Senator Hogg in relation to NBC suits. The advice I have been given is that all ADF personnel currently deployed to the Middle East area of operations have been adequately issued with the required NBC equipment. The exact numbers cannot be advised due to operational reasons. The ADF does not use any of the US NBC suits, or the older suit called the battledress overgarment. The US is in the process of changing from a different type of suit for each service to a common suit for all services. The ADF uses a common suit for all personnel and our suit is used widely throughout the world, most notably by the British forces. In rigorous testing 12 months ago in Australia, the current NBC suit used by the ADF was found to meet all documented specifications. In its ability to address seam leakage connection requirements and protection et cetera, this suit meets the ADF's requirements. Each Australian suit can be used continually for up to 30 days, dependent upon the degree of exposure.

"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2003-03-20,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Defence (Senator Hill) to questions without notice asked today relating to military action against Iraq.
In particular, I want to refer to the issue raised in the third question about the non-release to date of the Gulf War health study. This health survey was prompted by concerns about the health of those members of the Australian Defence Force who returned to Australia from the Gulf after that war in 1991.
A common descriptor has come to be applied to a lot of the ailments, illnesses, problems or mysteries that seem to apply across this particular community. That descriptor is `Gulf War syndrome'. A lot of research has been done in this area, particularly of late in the United States, where there are some hundreds of thousands of soldiers who were involved in warlike activity. There are now tens of thousands of persons in that country suffering from what is known as the Gulf War syndrome. The causes identified by various research projects and US congressional hearings are, variously, oil fire smoke, the use of depleted uranium in particular weapons, botulinum, nerve gas inhalation, particular types of vaccinations, particularly pyridostigmine bromide, and some vaccines being applied in an experimental sense.
Our deployment in the Gulf was in the order of 2,000 people back in those days, of whom 1,800 were in the Navy, but in excess of 200 were on land and involved in various activities. A lot of the land based vets who have returned to Australia suffer similar types of symptoms and are very concerned as to the state of their health, as their families are. What they say—and it is not seriously disputed by anyone—is that they have been given no hard information as to the vaccines and medical preparations that they were given at that time. They honestly believe that their service is a significant contributory factor to their current illness and, hence, the decision of the government of the day some three years ago to create the study.
As I said, the study was commenced over three years ago. It was to be delivered more than 12 months ago. It was delivered to the minister, we are told, some two or three months ago. Since that time it has not been released. It remains in the minister's office and it has been referred to the office of the Prime Minister for consideration, for spin doctoring, for review—I do not know. We are not told what is in the report and neither are the veterans who attended the Gulf War in 1991 or their families, who jointly suffer from the afflictions those men currently suffer. So where is it? Why is this report being covered up? Why is it not being disclosed? Why is it being kept secret?
The information given to us by Minister Vale in the House is minimal. She says that we do not know because she has not released the report. Minister Hill today gave a little bit more information on the public record than that which had previously been made available. Still, the point is that they claim that the physical conditions suffered by the men who attended the Gulf War are no different statistically to those in a similar sized cohort from non-military personnel around Australia. There is a higher incidence of psychological disturbance. There is a higher incidence of post traumatic stress disorder being observed. But, for reasons unknown, the government refuses to release that report. 
This causes ongoing concern and great consternation. One asks a series of questions: have all 200 persons who served in the Gulf been surveyed? Were they included? Why were those involved in Operation Blazer not included in the study? What are the illnesses suffered? Why are there so many claims for compensation? Why are there hundreds of claims of disability from men and women who, by and large, served on ships on patrol in the Gulf? Why is there a huge number of people making claims of total and permanent incapacitation and other disabilities? What is it about this Gulf service that has caused this abnormally high level of compensation claims? What vaccinations were given? How good are the records? Do the records exist at all? Were the vaccines given to these people approved? Were they done on an experimental basis?

"Lightfoot, Sen Ross",LP,2003-03-20,"—I rise to take note of the question initiated by Senator Bishop and to which he has just spoken. I do not have the answers to the questions Senator Bishop has posed, but I do know that the Prime Minister and the staff of other senior ministers are examining the report to which Senator Bishop has alluded. Some answers have been released with respect to that. I am pleased to say that, on some definitive study of that report, while there are some negatives—and we know that already—the findings are, on balance, positive. I give an example: the mortality and cancer rate for the Gulf War veterans is below that of the general community. In addition, no unique patterns of symptoms that could represent a so-called Gulf War syndrome could be identified in the study so far undertaken of the report. On the other hand, some of the negatives with respect to that are that the report does conclude that Gulf War veterans have a higher incidence of psychiatric disease than a comparison group of military personnel who did not attend the war in the Gulf.
The people who deserve some congratulations with respect to these studies are a team at Monash University led by Professor Malcolm Sim, who determined that result. As well as that university and professor, the Australian Gulf War veteran community also participated in that study. I think, given the importance of the report, the government should continue to give it further careful consideration. My advice is that when this consideration is complete the study will be released. I do not think that I need to remind colleagues in the chamber today that the government—and I think this goes for the other side too—care for our Gulf War veterans and for all veterans. For example, Gulf War veterans—and this goes for all veterans, but the Gulf War veterans are the subject of this motion to take note—are eligible for full benefits from the Department of Veterans' Affairs and in respect of health care and disability and service pensions as well.
I finish by drawing a parallel with the Vietnam veterans who came home in the mid-seventies and who fought in a terrible war. It was a terrible war, a different war, a sustained war, and many of our young people—501 young men—did not come home in the same condition that they left. The disgraceful treatment of those veterans in the mid-seventies was quite appalling. I know: I have a lot to do with the RSL. I am a member of the RSL myself. I trust and I pray that that never ever happens again in our history. When our young men and women come home from the skirmishes that we are currently undertaking—like the war that has commenced in Iraq—and when they come home in the future from other duties that they have been sent to on behalf of the people of Australia, I hope that we treat them differently from those who came home from Vietnam and are still suffering. In my personal view, there is nothing that could be described as `too much' or something that is overadequate with respect to our veterans, and that of course goes to our Vietnam veterans who are middle aged and older today. I trust that, when our veterans come home from this war in the Middle East, they will be given a hero's welcome—as rightly they should—unlike those Vietnam veterans of the mid-seventies were.

"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2003-03-20,"—In speaking on the motion to take note, I want to address Senator Hill's answer to the question that I asked in question time today, because, in considering why today we are at war with Iraq and why we are part of a process which I suspect will involve dramatic loss of life, one should understand why we are there. It is pretty clear from the answer that Senator Hill was very keen not to address a substantial point of my question, and that was: why was the Australian Ambassador in Washington, Mr Michael Thawley, telling people such as the National Cattlemen's Beef Association that Australia's support for the US military in Iraq was the reason that the FTA negotiations would proceed with or without the objections of US cattlemen? It is not surprising that he did not want to answer that. In Tuesday's Age, Tim Colebatch said:
Naturally, ministers and officials on both sides publicly deny any link.
But he goes on to say:
... let the record be straight. US farm groups were told by officials from both countries that the free trade negotiations, in effect, were in return for Australia's soldiers fighting in Iraq.
That is, we have our armed forces in another part of the world, participating in an action against Iraq—let us ignore the justification for the moment—and that is leverage for this country to negotiate with the United States on trade. It is almost making our troops mercenaries in the interests of trade negotiations. I really hesitate to say that, but it is a very shabby thing for this government to do: to be bargaining for a trade agreement on the basis of our participation in a war. It is not surprising that Senator Hill does not want to address himself to the substance of my question, because it is clear that it is the truth that this government has for many months been committed to the wishes of the United States in relation to action against Iraq on the basis of some nod and wink from the Bush administration that the US-Australia free trade agreement negotiations would proceed.
But, as I said earlier in this place, those negotiations will proceed probably long after the conflict in Iraq has concluded. In fact, Mr Colebatch said in his article on Tuesday that in terms of agriculture the detailed negotiations will not begin until July—and that is the earliest they can begin:
... because US law requires its trade advisory body, the International Trade Commission, to report on the potential impact on agricultural liberalisation before talks begin.
The government has made play of the fact that, on the one hand, many matters are on the table but that it will try to negotiate the best outcome for Australia's interest and that certain matters—in simple terms, matters such as our quarantine regime—are not up for negotiation. But, frankly, if you want an outcome there is more than one way to skin a cat. What I have detailed in earlier contributions is the way that this government can compromise our quarantine arrangements by concertinaing the process, by denying the scientific community in this country—who are engaged by our industries to protect our interests—the opportunity to properly put their case. That is the way that our interests can be suborned for the sake of an outcome on a free trade agreement.
The fact of the matter, as the ACIL report has made clear, is that agriculture—and indeed Australia—will probably not be a net beneficiary from the US-Australia free trade agreement discussions. If that is a substantial basis for the commitments that this government has given to the US administration for our presence in Iraq then it is a pretty poor price to pay and it is against this country's interests. That is one of the reasons this opposition is saying that we should not be involved in this war.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Iraq</title>,Questions Without Notice,21,1
"Johnston, Sen David",LP,2003-03-20,"—May I commence my response on the motion to take note by saying to honourable senators opposite that I am gratified by the expressions of support for our service men and women that I have heard in the debate and that were inherent in some of the questions that have been asked, both in the principal debate and in question time. It is very gratifying that, through all of the politics of this matter, the opposition can make clear statements of support for our service men and women in the field. But I must also say that the message that is being sent by the opposition is mixed and confused, and runs the risk of being confused, because of the substantive policy position that the ALP has adopted with respect to the action currently being undertaken in Iraq. At the Press Club luncheon today, the Leader of the Opposition was asked a number of questions about his support for the troops. Whilst maintaining that support, unfortunately he ran into difficulty because he was asked the question: does he support the mission of the individual service men and women in place in Iraq? He was also asked if he wanted to see them be successful in their tasks. He would not answer those questions, and that sends a very confused and mixed message to our service men and women. 
It is difficult for the opposition. It is incongruous in many respects for the opposition to say they support our service men and women and then not be categorical about their mission and whether they wish them success. The problem lies, as I have said before in this place, with the division within the ALP on issues of national security. As I mentioned in my speech this morning, the purple ribbons of peace, which were worn predominantly by Labor senators in this place on Tuesday, were very significant by virtue of the fact that a number of senators opposite did not wear them. In broad terms, those senators who did not wear them spoke in very interesting and double-edged terms in the debate we have undertaken with respect to this very vexed question of Iraq—and it is a complex question. The fact is that there is a great deal of underlying division and a very confused mixed message coming from the Labor Party on this question of national security. On the one hand they want to acknowledge that Saddam Hussein and Iraq must be disarmed and, on the other, they want to say that we are hostage to the French right of veto in the UN before we can do it. That is a very confused, mixed, illogical, difficult position for the Labor Party to maintain.
One of the learned senators opposite said that he found it offensive that France is one of the five permanent members of the Security Council. That is a slight window into the difficulty of the position that the Labor Party occupies on this. I come back to the point that it is all very well to send a superficial message of support to our service men and women, but you have to back it up with a proper, logical, sound, rational position. The difficulty that Labor confront is that they do not do that. They also want to say that they want to be part of the alliance, yet they have to acknowledge that we are dependent upon our US alliance. You cannot have it both ways. When the ANZUS alliance treaty has been activated on the war on terror, when it is clear that Saddam Hussein must be disarmed after 17 resolutions, you cannot dodge it and yet say to the United States: `We still want to be your friend.' You have to shoulder some of the burden at some time, and this is one of those times.
—They are fair-weather friends.
—You cannot be fair-weather friends. You cannot be a user. You cannot have all the benefit with no responsibility. You have to participate. And the most important thing is to do the right thing.

"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,2003-03-20,"—I want to comment on some of the remarks made by Senator Johnston because, unlike him, I was actually at the Press Club today and heard the speech by the Leader of the Opposition, the Hon. Simon Crean. It is true that some journalists, who had been primed by the Prime Minister's department to ask the questions that the Prime Minister now wants to try to wedge the Labor Party with, did ask those questions. Senator Johnston accurately set out what those questions were. What he got wrong was that the spin doctors in the Prime Minister's office, who had primed him to say what he has said, persuaded him that there were no answers given to those questions. I was an eye and ear witness to what happened, and the questions were answered. The answer to the question of what Labor would do was that Labor would bring back the troops. That is what we would do, and there is no doubt about that. Labor would not expose Australian soldiers to the situation in the Gulf. 
Fifteen minutes before question time today, the first shots were fired in anger at Iraq, heralding the opening of hostilities. Just over an hour and a half ago, Gulf War II commenced. Australian troops, men and women, are participating in this armed conflict alongside of British and US troops. I want to comment on some of the answers given by the Minister for Defence, the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Hill, in question time about this. This is the first time in the history of this country when there has not been bipartisan support when war has been declared. Labor does not support this war—that is very clear—but Labor does support our fighting men and women. Our beef is not with them; our beef is with their political masters—this government, this Prime Minister and this defence minister— who have put them in harm's way. That is who we oppose, not our fighting men and women. And we will not be wedged—no matter how prettified the speech is—in derogating from that point. We will support our armed forces now and when they return, but we want them back as quickly as possible. If we were in government, they would not even be there, and that is the best support that we can give them.
This conflict occurs without United Nations sanctions. Resolution 1441 explicitly does not authorise the participation of armed forces in the Gulf, nor do the earlier resolutions of the United Nations. The United Nations weapons inspectors have not completed their task—Hans Blix and his colleagues have not finished. Progress has been made in destroying weapons of mass destruction because of the efforts made through the UN and the inspectorate. The effect of this unilateral action is to make Australia a terrorist target or to raise the prominence of Australia for being such a target beyond what it was previously as, unquestionably, some of those who will make an alliance with Iraq will target members of the coalition of the willing, and that will include Australia. This government has periodically over the last week denied that our internal security has been damaged by virtue of our participation in this episode.
We got to this position despite global and Australian support for disarming Saddam Hussein through the processes of the United Nations, which have not been completed. Unanimity exists in the Security Council of the United Nations that Saddam Hussein must be disarmed. The process by which that is done is the point of difference. The point of difference is that we support a UN system that might have been slower than some would want but was, nonetheless, proving effective in achieving that goal, without jumping straight into war. We are in this position not because of a failure of diplomacy but because of a failure of approach. The doctrine of pre-emption that is governing US actions is a doctrine which precipitates nuclear weapons being proliferated around the globe, particularly by terrorist states, and which increases, not decreases, the possibility of conflict through weapons of mass destruction. This government is negligent in not pursuing the outcomes of the Canberra Commission and the Australian group within the UN aimed at reducing nuclear proliferation—(Time expired)

Government response to the interim report of the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislative Committee's inquiry into the Proposed Importation of Fresh Apple Fruit from New Zealand
Recommendation 1
The Committee recommends that Biosecurity Australia, as part of its current review into the future conduct of the IRA process, develop procedures to allow a decision to adopt a routine IRA to be appealed to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.
The revision of the import risk analysis (IRA) process has overtaken this recommendation. The revised process proposes to make no distinction between routine and non-routine, but to follow a single approach, with all IRAs using an IRA team. The Executive Manager of Biosecurity Australia will determine IRA team membership after consulting stakeholders. Membership will be expertise based, and may be appealed. It will also be governed by whether Biosecurity Australia has the required technical expertise and the extent outside expertise may be required. A deputy secretary within the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry—Australia (AFFA) will consider appeals relating to panel membership. The Government's legal advice on the recommendation that such matters be appealable to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT), indicates that for decisions to be appealable to the AAT they must have a statutory base. The conduct of IRAs is not at present part of a statutory process, and the Government considers that a change to make it so is not warranted.
Recommendation 2
The Committee recommends that Biosecurity Australia, as part of its current review into the future conduct of the IRA process, develop procedures to allow for consideration of the likely consequences of the incursion of a particular pest when deciding whether to use a routine or non-routine IRA.
The revision of the IRA process has also overtaken this recommendation. It proposes that Biosecurity Australia will determine when deciding whether an IRA is necessary whether the likely consequences differ significantly from those previously assessed. Biosecurity Australia advised stakeholders in late 2001 that a working draft of the Guidelines for Import Risk Analysis had been completed. These guidelines draw together AFFA's corporate experience in conducting IRAs, and input from risk analysts in State agriculture departments, the private sector and overseas government agencies. The guidelines describe a structured approach to the methodology used in IRAs, for use by an ira team and contain a detailed description of consequence assessment. This is to ensure that the IRA addresses the likely consequences of incursions appropriately.
The guidelines are based on the relevant international standards for IRAs (the Office International des Epizooties (OIE) International Animal Health Code and Aquatic Code, and International Plant Protection Convention (IPPC) International Standards for Phytosanitary Measures (ISPM) Pest Risk Analysis for Quarantine Pests), and provide terms and methods that can be applied consistently to meet Australia's obligations under the World Trade Organization (WTO) Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (SPS Agreement). The document will be of interest and value to stakeholders reviewing new Biosecurity Australia IRAs, and has been placed on the AFFA internet site. Copies are also available (in paper or electronic form) from AFFA at bde@affa.gov.au, telephone 02 6272 4914 and fax 02 6272 4568. 
Recommendation 3
The Committee recommends that Biosecurity Australia, as part of its current review into the future conduct of the IRA process, develop and publish widely guidelines on the purpose and the method of consultation in the IRA process.
The Biosecurity Australia Import Risk Analysis Handbook is due to be finalised in early 2003, following the review of the IRA process. It will include details relating to the purpose and method of consultation for IRAs. 
Recommendation 4
The Committee recommends that Biosecurity Australia, as part of its current review into the future conduct of the IRA process, establish a Risk Assessment Committee to allow for the direct involvement of domestic stakeholders during the conduct of IRAs.
The Government recognises the need for an enhanced consultation process to improve stakeholders' ability to raise relevant concerns. While this recommendation is not specifically accepted, the Government intends to strengthen public involvement and consultative procedures in the IRA process, and this will be reflected in the Import Risk Analysis Handbook. Stronger public involvement does not need to impose further bureaucratic layers in the IRA process. An additional committee for each IRA would make the consulting and reporting mechanisms more complex and the process even longer. Some may also see it as compromising the independence of the analysis.
The new process will give all stakeholders more scope to contribute to the technical aspects of each IRA, either directly or through scientific experts. Areas of particular relevance in this context are those which may influence disease spread, likely consequences and subsequent risk management. This would include providing and examining information on industry structure, distribution networks and common industry practices.
Recommendation 5
The Committee recommends that Biosecurity Australia, as part of its current review into the future conduct of the IRA process, clarify with Environment Australia the definition of pathogens which pose a significant risk of harm to the natural environment. Such pathogens must be referred to the Minister for the Environment for advice under the terms of the Quarantine Amendment Act 1999.
AFFA's Biosecurity Australia and Environment Australia (EA) concluded a memorandum of understanding (MOU) on import risk analyses on 11 October 2002.
Biosecurity Australia is also developing guidelines in consultation with EA that will help AFFA officers with environmental aspects of import risk analyses.
The concept of `referring a pathogen' is problematic and is not required under current legislation. Under the Quarantine Act 1908, decisions which may result in a significant risk of harm to the environment must be referred. In addition, Environment Australia will be formally consulted on the scope, technical issues for consideration, timetable and composition of the team to conduct an IRA, to ensure that environmental considerations are appropriately taken into account. This will be formalised through revised arrangements established under the MOU and draft guidelines mentioned above.
Recommendation 6
The Committee recommends that Biosecurity Australia incorporate a full quantitative risk evaluation in the final IRA on the possible importation of New Zealand apples, in preference to the current unsatisfactory qualitative risk evaluation used in the draft IRA.
International consensus is that both quantitative and qualitative approaches to quarantine risk analysis are valid, with the circumstances of the individual analysis determining the appropriate approach in each case. Quarantine risk analyses are commonly qualitative and have traditionally been presented in a narrative form. Analyses presented in such a way have been criticised for a lack of objectivity. 
To improve the transparency and objectivity, Biosecurity Australia adopted a structured approach to the qualitative risk analysis of New Zealand apples in the original draft IRA. This methodology was developed by the same process as the IRA guidelines (see recommendation 2).
This approach was also in line with that described in the Australian/New Zealand Standard for Risk Management (AS/NZS 4360:1999), for qualitative analyses. Australia is a leader in risk analysis, and AS/NZS 4360 is the first national standard of its type in the world. AS/NZS 4360 also provides for a semi-quantitative method of risk analysis. This approach uses the rigour of the fully quantitative method where feasible, but deals with data deficits by accepting semi-quantitative assessments as inputs.
The Government acknowledges that an accurate and robust model is essential to produce an accurate risk analysis. The risk analysis panel (RAP) will need to consider how best to deal with this issue in light of the guidance provided in the IRA guidelines, which encompass qualitative, semi-quantitative and quantitative methods. The RAP will also consult AS/NZS 4360.
The Government recognises that the discipline of applying quantitative risk assessment to quarantine is evolving and notes that international risk analysts understand these methodologies better than they did several years ago. However, the use of quantitative risk assessment in certain situations does not necessarily have a significant advantage over qualitative or semi-quantitative techniques. Quantitative risk assessment requires more resources and is problematic when the data are of poor quality. Therefore, judgements on the efficient and effective use of resources, and the applicability of the various methodologies, need to be made case by case. 
In all analyses, the outcomes, whether expressed in words or numbers, guide decision-making in the broader context set by the importing country's appropriate level of protection (ALOP). It is important to note that in all known cases, WTO members express ALOP in general, qualitative terms.
Biosecurity Australia will continue to use quantitative risk assessment methodology when feasible and appropriate. The RAP is investigating options for doing a more quantitative analysis of Erwinia amylovora than for the original draft IRA.
Recommendation 7
The Committee recommends that Biosecurity Australia revise the combined events in the entry, establishment and spread pathways in the final IRA on the possible importation of New Zealand apples. This is to measure more accurately and transparently the unrestricted risk associated with Erwinia amylovora and other pests.
It is vital in developing a thorough risk analysis to identify and fully assess the various combinations of independent events in all pathways through which a potential quarantine pest could enter Australia. The RAP is considering this area in detail.
Recommendation 8
The Committee recommends that Biosecurity Australia develop a quantitative measure of what constitutes a `very low' risk in the final IRA on the possible importation of New Zealand apples, based on a full quantitative risk assessment.
In the draft IRA, Biosecurity Australia provided a qualitative description of `very low' and equates this with Australia's ALOP.
In all analyses, the outcomes, whether expressed in words or numbers, need to be applied in the context of the importing country's ALOP. For the NZ apple IRA, a `very low' risk has been described as a band of cells running through the risk assessment matrixa. This concept is included in the Guidelines for IRA and the Australian/New Zealand Standard for Risk Management (AS/NZS 4360:1999). Six separate definitions for a `very low risk' context can be derived from this matrix and the associated definitions of likelihoodb and consequencec.
Australia has looked at other ways of expressing its ALOP but as with all other WTO members, recognises that the difficulty of providing a more precise definition that can be applied to all cases. Like other WTO members, Australia relies for an indication of its ALOP on community preferences as expressed in Government policy. Quarantine decision makers obtain additional guidance from current quarantine policies and practices. Because the ALOP is a central tenet of the SPS Agreement, it is important to ensure that any statement is robust and can encompass all situations.
Recommendation 9
The Committee recommends that Biosecurity Australia immediately commission research by the CSIRO, the NZ Horticulture and Food Research Institute or independent authorities into whether export-ready apples from New Zealand can carry viable colonies of Erwinia amylovora in their core, calyx or flesh.
There is evidence that mature apple fruit, even from apparently healthy orchards, can carry viable bacteria. However, there is conjecture about the presence of bacteria on the skin, or in the core, calyx or flesh. The RAP is considering the feasibility of additional research and which, if any, areas of uncertainty can and should be further clarified using the research techniques available.
Recommendation 10
The Committee recommends that Biosecurity Australia incorporate in the final IRA further research into the role of other pests in the possible broadcast of Erwinia amylovora in Australia, notably the apple leaf-curling midge.
The RAP will consider research needs regarding Erwinia amylovora vectors, and incorporate all relevant aspects into the revised draft IRA. Reports in the literature indicate that such research is continuing on apple leaf-curling midge.
Recommendation 11
The Committee recommends that Biosecurity Australia adopt as a better alternative to the protocols outlined in the draft IRA the following measures:
(i)	the use of random drop sampling at certified New Zealand packing houses for sampling of New Zealand apple lots earmarked for possible export to Australia
(ii)	the DNA testing of apples taken during random drop sampling for the presence of Erwinia amylovora
(iii)	the acceptance or rejection of apple lots from New Zealand earmarked for export to the Australian market based on the results of the above DNA testing and other relevant testing.
The RAP will consider these measures, when examining risk mitigation options in the context of the revised draft IRA.
Recommendation 12
The Committee recommends that Biosecurity Australia themselves conduct tests with at least two major New Zealand export packing houses on the appropriate apple processing speed and staffing levels required to guarantee that apples destined for possible export to Australia would be completely trash free.
The RAP will consider trash-related issues in more detail.
Recommendation 13
The Committee recommends that Biosecurity Australia incorporate in the final IRA advice from the NRA as to the circumstances under which the NRA would permit the spraying of streptomycin or terramycin in Australia in response to an outbreak of Erwinia amylovora. This advice should be based on research by Biosecurity Australia on the number of applications of streptomycin or terramycin which would be required each season to contain an outbreak of Erwinia amylovora in the various apple growing regions of Australia.
The Government recognises the increasing public concern about the health threat of antibiotic-resistant bacteria as a consequence of the selective effect of agricultural use and medical over-use of antibiotics. The Joint Expert Technical Advisory Committee on Antibiotic Resistance (JETACAR)d was established in response to these concerns. The Government is systematically implementing its recommendations through the Commonwealth Inter-departmental JETACAR Implementation Group. The Government also recognises the potential impact on the profitability of the pome fruit industry from the direct and indirect costs of using antibiotic sprays. In addition, the use of chemical treatments to control an incursion of Erwinia amylovora into Australia could present risks to the environment. The RAP will consider relevant ecological and environmental impacts of control measures when assessing the likely consequences of any incursion.
The Expert Advisory Group on Antimicrobial Resistance (EAGAR) has recommended that any permits issued for the use of streptomycin should be valid for no longer than three months. The National Health and Medical Research Council recently established EAGAR, in response to the JETACAR report. The National Registration Authority for Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals (NRA) considers EAGAR's advice when taking decisions in relation to registration of antimicrobial chemicals.
The NRA advises that it could issue an emergency use permit for streptomycin for period of 3 months in the event of an Erwinia amylovora incursion. The major concern is the potential for the development of resistance, which is likely to become a problem with sustained use. Any period greater than 3 months would need re-consideration by EAGAR. EAGAR has not considered the emergency use of terramycin (oxytetracycline) against Erwinia amylovora, and would need to do so before a permit for this use could be issued. While terramycin (oxytetracycline) is not used as a human therapeutic in Australia, many other members of the tetracycline family are. However, in comparison with streptomycin, horticultural use of terramycin (oxytetracycline) is less likely to lead to the development of resistance problems. Antibiotics to control fire blight are usually only applied to pome fruit crops during flowering, which is a high risk period for infection and long distance dispersal of Erwinia amylovora. A fire blight eradication campaign would depend on a combination of measures, including the use of copper and antibiotic sprays, control of vectors, and hygiene practices (e.g. removal of affected plants). The key role of antibiotic sprays would be as a risk minimisation strategy at flowering. Copper-based compounds can protect against bacterial diseases but can have limited effectiveness because new growth is not protected. Although the phytotoxic effects of copper compounds on growing shoots in spring and early summer are a major production concern, they are less of a concern in an eradication campaign. Copper sprays may therefore be a feasible substitute for antibiotics in some stages of an eradication campaign.
The number of antibiotic sprays that may be required would be determined by the context of an incursion. The RAP will have additional information on this issue to include in the revised draft IRA.
Recommendation 14
The Committee recommends the independent scientific review conducted as part of the revised public consultation process announced on 6 March 2000 by the Director of Quarantine, Mr Taylor, should be similar to that used in non-routine IRAs.
AFFA responded to the committee's recommendation by announcing the establishment of a RAP on 13 August 2001. The panel brings together a range of expertise, including plant pathology, environmental science and industry practice, and is drawn from various sources, including Biosecurity Australia, CSIRO and State Governments. The RAP was finalised on 10 January 2002, and comprised the following people: 
§	Dr Bill Roberts (Chairman), Australia's Chief Plant Protection Officer
§	Mr Bill Hatton, a fruit producer with expertise in growing, packing and shipping various fruits, and experience in pest and disease incursion planning for the stone fruit industry
§	Mr David Cartwright, a plant pathologist and Manager, Plant Health, Department of Primary Industries and Resources South Australia
§	Dr Kent Williams, Principal Research Scientist, CSIRO Sustainable Ecosystems
§	Mr Mike Kinsellae, a horticulturalist and consultant, and a former Chief Quarantine Officer and Director of Quarantine and Inspection Services, Victoria
§	Mr Ian Armour, owner/manager of an apple orcharding business east of Melbourne
§	Dr Brian Stynes, a plant pathologist and General Manager, Plant Biosecurity, Biosecurity Australia.
Establishing a RAP is consistent with the proposed revisions to the IRA process regarding IRA teams.
The RAP intends to consult widely with stakeholders, and has begun its work by considering the matters that were raised in the public submissions responding to the original draft IRA. The RAP has prepared a scientific review paper and has held an initial consultative workshop to address the scientific, operational and technical issues at the heart of the risk analysis.
Recommendation 15
The Committee recommends that Biosecurity Australia contact countries to which Australia exports apples to clarify their position should Australia allow importation of apples from New Zealand. This is to avoid Australian apples being assessed as posing a risk by other countries should Australia accept apples from New Zealand.
WTO members are required to base import measures on international standards or a valid risk assessment. As there are no standards specific to apple pests or diseases at present, import measures must be based on a risk assessment of the pests and diseases that actually occur in the country of potential export. If Australia were to allow entry for New Zealand apples, then requesting countries to which we export apples to clarify their position, is likely to be interpreted as asking if they would act contrary to the SPS agreement.
Such a request could affront some key trading partners, and therefore affect our trading interests. The Government notes that most of the major export destinations for Australian apples and pears either do not have an apple or pear industry (and are therefore not concerned about the disease) or have wide spread fire blight (and therefore cannot justify restrictive import measuresf). Australia's remaining trading partners, have so far not indicated any concerns arising from the draft IRA. Japan, as an importer of apples from Tasmania, and a country that does not have fire blight, has been monitoring this issue and has sought answers to a small number of technical questions, unrelated to this recommendation.

Estimation of consequencesi
The classifications outlined below were used to estimate the combined extent of direct and indirect consequences. These classifications may be interpreted in dollar terms, in terms of particular societal values or social wellbeing, or as a combination of both.
negligible:	The impact is unlikely to be recognised by directly affected parties.9
very low:	The impact on a given criterion is likely to be minor to directly affected parties. The impact is unlikely to be discernible at any other level.
low: 	The impact is likely to be recognised within an affected geographic region, and significant to directly affected parties. It is not likely that the impact will be recognised at the national level.
moderate: 	The impact is likely to be recognised at a national level, and significant within affected geographic regions. The impact is likely to be highly significant to directly affected parties.
high: 	The impact is likely to be significant at a national level, and highly significant within the affected a geographic regions. This classification implies that the impact would be of national concern. However, the serious effect on economic stability, societal values or social wellbeing would be limited to a given geographic region.
extreme: 	The impact is likely to be highly significant at the national level. This classification implies that the impact would be of significant national concern. Economic stability, societal values or social wellbeing would be seriously affected in more than one geographic region.

Senate Select Committee on Superannuation and Financial Services
Third report on inquiry into Prudential Supervision and Consumer Protection for Superannuation, Banking and Financial Services—AUDITING OF SUPERANNUATION FUNDS
RECOMMENDATION
GOVERNMENT RESPONSE
Recommendation 1The Committee recommends that Part 16 of the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 (the SIS Act) be amended to require auditors to report to the regulator any breach of compliance with the Act or suspicion of a fund's unsatisfactory financial position, at the same time as they report such issues to the trustee.
The Government supports this recommendation.The Superannuation Working Group (SWG) also examined the issues related to the disclosure of information to both the regulator and members of the public. Part 16 of the SIS Act sets out special rules for actuaries and auditors of superannuation entities. It currently provides that the actuary or auditor must tell the trustee and may tell the regulator if he/she is of the opinion that it is likely that a contravention of this Act or the regulations may have occurred, may be occurring, or may occur, in relation to the entity.The Government will pursue legislative amendments so that the regulator must be told of the auditors concerns at the same time that the trustee is notified.
Recommendation 2	The Committee recommends that the SIS Act be amended to require that auditors of superannuation funds be independent and that the auditor of a company is not also the auditor of the superannuation fund.
The Government does not support this recommendation.The issues regarding auditor independence are covered under professional requirements for auditors.Separate auditors for a company and its superannuation fund may be appropriate, however, it would be difficult to implement due to the limited range of auditors in some locations. Further, there seems to be no compelling reason why, if an auditor is independent, that auditor cannot fulfil his or her professional obligations to audit both a company and its superannuation fund in accordance with appropriate legislative requirements. To ensure independence, audit firms may choose to have a different audit partner for the company and the fund.
Recommendation 3The Committee recommends that APRA prepare a set of guidelines outlining the specific areas which should be addressed in the audit report on assessments of risk management systems and investment strategies for superannuation funds.
Noted.In response to the recommendations of the SWG, the Government has announced that it will amend the SIS Act to require superannuation fund trustees to prepare a Risk Management Plan (RMP) for each fund under their trusteeship. An RMP would describe the structures, systems and processes the trustee has in place to address the risks facing the superannuation fund. 
Recommendation 4The Committee recommends that where a qualified audit report has been issued (other that merely on a technical ground such as a late return), there should be a formal requirement for a follow-up audit to be conducted within a specified time.
The Government does not support this recommendation.Implementation of recommendation 1 will ensure that APRA is notified of any qualifications in an auditor's report in a timely manner. Further, the SWG examined a number of matters relating to disclosure of audit report qualifications. APRA has a number of tools available to pursue issues that might arise as a result of an audit report qualification. These include requiring the trustee to appoint someone to investigate the financial position of the entity (Part 25 of the SIS Act). 
Recommendation 5The Committee recommends that the auditor's report on superannuation fund be sent, as a matter of routine, to all fund members, in order to improve accountability and ensure transparency of the trustee's actions and communication about the fund's financial state.
Noted.The SIS Act currently provides for an audit report to be sent to members on request. In response to the recommendations of the SWG, the Government has announced that trustees will be required to notify members of qualified audit reports. Sending audit reports to members more generally will pose an additional financial burden on superannuation funds. The Government considers the existing access arrangements and revised notification procedures sufficient to ensure that trustees are accountable and that members are able to access adequate information. 
Recommendation 6	The Committee recommends that the larger superannuation funds regulated by APRA be required to carry out a prudential review, at a minimum of once every five years.
The Government does not support this recommendation.The Government considers that reforms to be introduced in the SWG context, existing provisions in the SIS Act, and APRA's supervision practices are sufficient to ensure appropriate prudential practices.In response to the recommendations of the SWG, the Government has announced that superannuation fund trustees will be required to be licensed. One of the licensing conditions will be a requirement to maintain an RMP. An RMP is a document that sets out the measures an entity will apply to ensure that it is complying with the relevant governing rules. In addition, the SIS Act requires the trustee of a defined benefit fund to ensure an actuarial investigation is undertaken in relation to the fund, and must obtain an actuarial report in respect of that investigation (SISR 9.29 and 9.30). These requirements must be satisfied: on the establishment of the fund or on conversion from an accumulation fund to a DB fund; and in every three-year period after the last investigation.
Recommendation 7The Committee recommends that APRA consult with the relevant professional and regulatory bodies with a view to developing a requirement for trustees to provide a statement to the auditor prior to the audit of a superannuation entity. The statement would clarify that the accounts were believed to be in good order and to comply with the SIS Act, and would note any areas of weakness or concern in the fund's financial and management strategies.
Noted.Under the current arrangements a majority of the medium and large audit firms require such an attestation prior to completion for their annual audits.
Recommendation 8The Committee recommends that the current move within the accounting and auditing profession to require the formal assessment of competency in auditing superannuation funds as a matter of some urgency.
This is a matter for the industry.The Government supports proposals designed to improve the quality and skills within the auditing profession.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reports: Government Responses</title>,Committees,23,1

That the Senate take note of the government response to the report of the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation and Financial Services.
I welcome the government response to the report of the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation and Financial Services titled Prudential supervision and consumer protection for superannuation, banking and financial services—third report: auditing of superannuation funds. The committee's report highlights a number of issues which were subsequently examined further by a working group which was set up by the government to examine options for the safety of superannuation. The working group, headed by Don Mercer, acknowledged that much of its work was built on the foundations laid at the Senate committee hearings. The government has agreed with or has noted most of the committee's key recommendations, and implementations of these reforms will go a long way towards improving the role of auditing in protecting the superannuation savings of fund members. However, I note that some significant recommendations, such as those relating to audit independence, follow-up of qualified audit reports and prudential reviews were not supported. In view of the time constraints, I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2003-03-20,"—by leave—I move:
That the Senate take note of the government response to the report of the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee.
I have had a brief opportunity to look at the government response to the report of the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee on the proposed importation of fresh apple fruit from New Zealand and there is one glaring matter which I think the Senate ought to take note of today. In relation to the committee's recommendation 6, the report says on page 3:
The Committee recommends that Biosecurity Australia incorporate a full quantitative risk evaluation in the final IRA on the possible importation of New Zealand apples, in preference to the current unsatisfactory qualitative risk evaluation used in the draft IRA.
The key comment that the government makes in relation to that recommendation is this:
The Government recognises that the discipline of applying quantitative risk assessment to quarantine is evolving and notes that international risk analysts understand these methodologies better than they did several years ago. However, the use of quantitative risk assessment in certain situations does not necessarily have a significant advantage over qualitative or semi-quantitative techniques. Quantitative risk assessment requires more resources and is problematic when the data are of poor quality. Therefore, judgements on the efficient and effective use of resources, and the applicability of the various methodologies, need to be made case by case.
In relation to the important area of import risk assessment, the government is clearly saying that it is not prepared to apply the necessary resources to be able to ascertain the risk profile of the importation of New Zealand apples and also that the data available is poor. It seems to me that, given the importance of the apple industry to parts of regional Australia, the risks involved are such that the government must be prepared—and it appears that it is not—to provide the resources that are necessary to conduct the risk assessment on a quantitative basis and to make sure that the data that is available is collected so that it is not of a poor quality, which seems to be the basis of the government's objection to this recommendation. If the resources are poor, the government has a responsibility to provide them to Biosecurity Australia and to any other body that is involved in the assessment of risk. If the data that is available is not sufficient, the government has to make the means available to accumulate the appropriate data so that the unanimous recommendation of the Senate committee can be adopted.
It is quite scandalous that the government is prepared to reject this recommendation on this basis. It is saying to regional Australia and those communities involved in the growing of apples, `If it is going to cost to provide those resources, and if we haven't got the data and we're not prepared to get it, then you can bear the burden of the risk.' That seems to me to be a scandalous position that the government and the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Mr Truss, are putting to the Australian horticultural community. If this principle applies to the apple industry, the question is: what other areas of horticulture, agriculture or animal production will be the subject of the same diminution of the tests which should be applied to properly assess the risk of imports? I suggest that this is a scandalous position that the government takes. We will be pursuing this to make sure that the grower community is fully aware of the risks that this government is prepared to expose them to. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2003-03-20,"—by leave—I have statements to make in response to two returns to order. The first statement is on behalf of Senator Hill, the Minister for Defence. The order arises from a motion moved by Senator Allison, which was agreed to by the Senate on 19 March this year. It requested all documents commissioned by the Australian government, its agencies and the United Nations that advise on the legality of involvement in a war in Iraq. During his statement to the Senate on 18 March this year, the minister tabled the relevant legal advice provided to the Australian government by the Attorney-General's Department and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. The order also requested documents commissioned by the United Nations. Our government does not have authority in relation to any documents belonging to the United Nations. Such a request should be directed instead to the United Nations.
The second statement is on behalf of the Minister for Health and Ageing, Senator Patterson. The order arises from a motion moved by Senator Allison, which was agreed by the Senate on 19 March this year. It requests the tabling of a letter dated 2 December 2002 from the minister to the European Commission on the matter of the European Union's decision to phase out tobacco sponsorship of Formula One races.

"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,2003-03-20,"—This Saturday, the New South Wales election will be held, and I am quite confident that on Saturday night Bob Carr will be returned as Premier of the great state of New South Wales, leading another successful Labor government. He will be returned because he has the confidence of the people of New South Wales. Indeed, they have such confidence in Bob Carr, his team and his government that it is likely that the coalition, already reduced to a rump in New South Wales, could be in even a worse state politically and electorally after Saturday night.
The record of the New South Wales Labor government since it came to office in 1995 has been outstanding. That is why it was returned with such a large majority at the last election in 1999. In case some members of the Senate have forgotten, that was the election in which the coalition dumped its leader, Mr Peter Collins, just beforehand and put Mrs Kerry Chikarovski into the leadership of the Liberal Party. Mrs Chikarovski, as we know, did not last, and she has decided she cannot cut the mustard or stand the heat in the kitchen in the New South Wales parliament and is getting out.
The Carr Labor government will continue the historic situation whereby every state and territory in this country is currently governed by a Labor government. That is because the people of New South Wales, and indeed the people of all those other states, recognise that when it comes to the issues of health, education, looking after the state's finances and providing important services such as transport and infrastructure Labor governments listen to the people and deliver.
The coalition parties have become so desperate to claw back from their terrible position in the polls and rescue some credibility in this election that they have resorted to some of the worst political advertising I have ever seen in my political life. I have been involved in election campaigns for probably 40 years, having started like many a young person in a politically active family by putting pamphlets in letterboxes at a young age. I cannot recall a time when I have seen the coalition stoop as low as they have in the last couple of weeks in this campaign. I refer particularly to an advertisement that appeared—
—I am glad you interjected, Senator Abetz, because that is precisely what I am going to talk about. I hope you will sit there and listen and learn. Let me draw the attention of the Senate to an advertisement that has appeared in the Daily Examiner, which is the newspaper in Grafton. Grafton is in the seat of Clarence, held by the Hon. Harry Woods, who served with distinction in this parliament and then won that seat at a by-election. It is a heritage seat for the National Party—like Page, the federal electorate. Harry Woods, a Labor member in that heartland of the National Party, won the federal seat of Page and then later won the state seat of Clarence from the National Party. Harry is retiring at this election having given great distinction and service to the people of his electorate and New South Wales. The candidate who is running for the Labor Party, I am proud to say, is a great friend of mine, Terry Flanagan. Terry Flanagan is a great friend of the people of Clarence. He has done a lot of work for them in the years he has lived in that electorate, both in the community and as an adviser to Mr Woods.
The National Party and their candidate Steve Cansdell, the ex-boxer—but I will not go into that at the moment—are so desperate to attack the Labor Party's credibility in this campaign that they have put an ad in the Daily Examiner which states: 
Drugs: a vote for Labor is a vote for drugs.
Don't destroy your children's lives.
The Greens want to legalise Marijuana, Ecstasy, Heroin, Amphetamines, Crack and Labor has done a deal with the Greens on DRUGS.
How low do these despicable people have to go!
—Reject Green preferences.
—Senator Abetz interjects and says that the Labor Party will take their preferences. Senator Abetz should understand that the reason that Michael Organ, the Green member for Cunningham, sits in the House of Representatives is a direct result of the activities of the Liberal Party of New South Wales. They supported him indirectly by not running a candidate in that campaign—they supported the Greens in that campaign. In that safe Labor seat, the Liberal Party squibbed it. They wimped out. They would not run a candidate and therefore ensured that people who ordinarily would have voted for the conservative parties in large numbers instead voted for the Green candidate. So do not lecture to us on preference deals or any of that.
I return to what I was saying a moment ago. The allegation that is contained in Mr Cansdell's ad is beneath contempt. Not only is it untrue; it marks a new low in political advertising in this country. To suggest that a candidate or a party would do a deal in order to support the increased use of illicit drugs by kids in this country is frankly so low it is beneath contempt. I have known some National Party and Liberal Party candidates; I have seen them work over the years. I can say that, by and large, they conduct their campaigns fairly within the cut and thrust of politics. But what has been happening up in Clarence is just a disgrace.
Hypocrisy has reached new heights in this country with this sort of advertising. It reached these heights today in this parliament when the Minister for Family and Community Services, Senator Vanstone, in answer to a question about the plight of women in Iraq, sought to portray her concern for those women. I do not doubt that she is concerned, but we all have concern for the terrible plight that women, children and many other people have suffered in Iraq. It was a cheap political stunt. It was not deserving, really. It was demeaning of this minister. We checked the Hansard record. It is interesting to note that, up until the last couple of days, this minister had never, ever—not once—raised a concern in this parliament about the plight of the women of Iraq, notwithstanding that they have been repressed, persecuted and, even worse, killed over 12 years or more under Saddam Hussein's rule. But Senator Vanstone waxed lyrical about her concern for what had been done to those poor women and children. This same minister represented the government only a year and a half ago when it said to those poor Iraqi refugees on that sinking boat out in the middle of the Indian Ocean, `You don't deserve to come into this country. We don't want the likes of you people in this country,' and accused the refugees of throwing their children overboard.
As I said, hypocrisy has reached a new height under this government with those sorts of shallow, dishonest expressions of concern today, and political advertising has reached a new low, given what the National Party is engaging in in Clarence. How much further does the coalition have to go to demonstrate their inadequacies? (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>New South Wales: Election</title>,Adjournment,33,1
