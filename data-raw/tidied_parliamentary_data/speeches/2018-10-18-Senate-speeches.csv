Senator PATRICK
 (South Australia) (10:36):  I move amendment (1) on sheet 8521:


(1) Clause 2, page 2 (cell at table item 1, column 2), omit the cell, substitute:






 






At the same time as Schedule 1 to the Customs Amendment (Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans‑Pacific Partnership Implementation) Act 2018 commences.


However, the provisions do not commence at all if that Schedule does not commence.






 















[commencement]





I've

got some questions for the minister in relation to the Government Procurement (Judicial Review) Bill 2017. The judicial review bill brings about a right for companies to seek a review of a decision, or perhaps seek an injunction or compensation in respect of a procurement. I've got some questions in relation to the transitional arrangements from when the bill is passed, particularly in circumstances where there are procurements underway. I want to know whether or not the bill will cause an effect on current tenders that are in play—noting that there are requirements, for example, when deciding on whether a procurement ought to be a limited tender, an open tender or a sole source. Those sorts of decisions now have to be documented. If we now kick off with new laws, assuming they end up being passed, what does that do to the current tenders on foot?

"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2018-10-18,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for International Development and the Pacific) (10:38):  My advice is that there are six months before this particular process starts, which we believe will give ample time for those matters on foot to be dealt with.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Government Procurement (Judicial Review) Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,3,1
"Patrick, Sen Rex",CA,2018-10-18,"



Senator PATRICK
 (South Australia) (10:38):  A company might be aggrieved by a tender process. One of the potential causes of an action may, in fact, be that first decision to go to a limited tender, to an open tender or to a sole source tender of some sort. The potentially aggrieved party may not have access to the decision reasoning and so may be blind as to whether or not they have a case. When the departments are making these decisions and writing their reasons, can you confirm whether those reasons will be made public? Alternatively, will they be accessible under FOI? Alternatively, does it require some sort of prediscovery in a court action to be able to get access to work out whether or not you have a bona fide case to bring in terms of a complaint?

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Government Procurement (Judicial Review) Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,3,1
"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2018-10-18,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for International Development and the Pacific) (10:39):  My advice is that the conditions of a limited tender must be made public.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Government Procurement (Judicial Review) Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,3,1
"Patrick, Sen Rex",CA,2018-10-18,"



Senator PATRICK
 (South Australia) (10:39):  In the past what has happened is that, typically, tenders are made public. It is not always the case with limited tenders, but certainly it is the case with sole tenders because the way in which that is typically done is through AusTender. For example, in relation to the submarine project, the government made a decision to go to DCNS, the Japanese government and, indeed, to the Germans, the French and the Japanese. None of the tendering details appeared on AusTender. You might recall that, for example, I had to extract details of Future Frigate from the government like a dental surgeon by way of FOI. So when you say the documentation is available, I'm not exactly sure whether in fact it is. I'll just ask you to check.

"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2018-10-18,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for International Development and the Pacific) (10:41):  I'm advised that, under item 2.6 of the tender rules, matters of national security are exempt from the requirement for disclosure.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Government Procurement (Judicial Review) Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,3,1
"Patrick, Sen Rex",CA,2018-10-18,"



Senator PATRICK
 (South Australia) (10:41):  Clearly, some of those tenders are really big tenders. They're for significant value contracts, often ranging into the billions. In fact, one would imagine that the companies that are tendering for those sorts of contracts would have capabilities to bring quite serious actions. What happens in that instance, noting that there is, in some sense, a carve-out here? I'm thinking of circumstances where an Australian company is tendering for a job and an overseas company is tendering for a job. The overseas company wins. The Australian company suspects there's a problem but doesn't have access to this information. How would the Australian company get around that, or would they simply be disadvantaged in those circumstances?

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Government Procurement (Judicial Review) Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,3,1
"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2018-10-18,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for International Development and the Pacific) (10:42):  Obviously, we're talking about a specific area of carve-out for a specific reason in terms of national security, and often those carve-outs are part of international agreements. However, voluntarily, the Australian government will provide information where they don't believe that it is contrary to the national interest or national security.

"Patrick, Sen Rex",CA,2018-10-18,"



Senator PATRICK
 (South Australia) (10:42):  Defence has a whole range of contracts. They might have contracts for fighter jets, but, equally, they have contracts for cleaning services and so forth. Do you say that you distinguish those contracts?

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Government Procurement (Judicial Review) Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,3,1
"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2018-10-18,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for International Development and the Pacific) (10:43):  The international rules will distinguish between which types of contracts would sit underneath the exclusions or the carve-out on the basis of national security and those that wouldn't.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Government Procurement (Judicial Review) Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,3,1
"Patrick, Sen Rex",CA,2018-10-18,"



Senator PATRICK
 (South Australia) (10:43):  I understand that, whilst this legislation is an enabling piece of legislation for the TPP, it is Australian legislation in its own right. So, for an Australian company, there are no impacts from an international treaty perspective. It is simply Australian law. In that context, I don't understand why you mention international treaties. This is Australian legislation litigated in Australian courts with no connection to the TPP, other than it enables that agreement to enter into force.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Government Procurement (Judicial Review) Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,3,1
"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2018-10-18,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for International Development and the Pacific) (10:44):  My apologies. I thought I was responding to your question in relation to the Defence examples that you were raising. If that's not what you were talking about, perhaps you might be a little clearer about what the actual question is, because we were talking about Defence carve-out.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Government Procurement (Judicial Review) Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,3,1
"Patrick, Sen Rex",CA,2018-10-18,"



Senator PATRICK
 (South Australia) (10:44):  Okay; I'll move on. Currently this bill deals with covered procurements, and those procurements are typically procurements above $80,000. At this point in time it is possible for someone to be given a contract by way of sole source under $80,000. It's not a covered procurement in the context of this bill. But then what happens is, if I get into contract for $79,999 with the Department of Defence—and they can do that quite lawfully just by way of sole source—they can then give me another $200,000 contract on the basis that I am already in contract with them. I'm just wondering how that is handled in the context of someone who perhaps wanted to provide those services and now sees a contract that's got a value of $279,000, which would normally give cause for invoking this legislation. Does it allow them to invoke the legislation or is that a loophole in the arrangements?

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Government Procurement (Judicial Review) Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,3,1
"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2018-10-18,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for International Development and the Pacific) (10:46):  I'm advised that you couldn't use this mechanism to bring the matter before the court. You cannot use the mechanism contained in this legislation to bring a matter in relation to something over the amount of $80,000 to court.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Government Procurement (Judicial Review) Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,3,1
"Patrick, Sen Rex",CA,2018-10-18,"



Senator PATRICK
 (South Australia) (10:47):  Some time ago, by way of a question on notice—I think it might have actually been former Senator Xenophon who asked the question—the department was asked to give examples of where there had been a contract let for under $80,000 and then a subsequent contract awarded to the same company using the fact that the procurement rules allow that to occur without tender. The response from the department was that it would take up so much time. That indicates to me that there are lots and lots of businesses that are working with Defence in those circumstances—that is, a small contract followed by a larger contract—and this is mostly in the small-business space. You're saying that this legislation does not give them a remedy in circumstances where they feel that the procurement decision is flawed?

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Government Procurement (Judicial Review) Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,3,1
"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2018-10-18,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for International Development and the Pacific) (10:48):  I'm advised that the circumstance you described is one the agency believes is highly unlikely to exist. There is absolutely no incentive in public sector procurement for the public sector to be breaking down contracts into small amounts to try to avoid a level of scrutiny or legislative assessment. So the advice is that that situation is highly unlikely to ever occur.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Government Procurement (Judicial Review) Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,3,1
"Patrick, Sen Rex",CA,2018-10-18,"



Senator PATRICK
 (South Australia) (10:49):  Again, I will state that I have an answer from the department that says that it occurs so often that they are unable to provide the answer to the FADT committee. I, in a previous life, worked in this space, and it was very common that you would bring someone on. Whether properly or improperly, you would bring them on as a specialist service under $80,000, and once you were initially employed, quite lawfully, without tender, they simply extended the contract. That is common practice, I put to you.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Government Procurement (Judicial Review) Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,3,1
"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2018-10-18,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for International Development and the Pacific) (10:49):  Certainly there are circumstances where it obviously makes good economic and business sense for contracts to be handed out in a certain and particular way, but the suggestion that this is a mechanism that is used to evade scrutiny, I think, is contested.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Government Procurement (Judicial Review) Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,3,1
"Patrick, Sen Rex",CA,2018-10-18,"



Senator PATRICK
 (South Australia) (10:50):  Nonetheless—and I understand where you're coming from, Minister—you would appreciate that another company, sitting beside watching and thinking that they have an opportunity to provide the services perhaps at a better price or perhaps with greater knowledge or some quite genuine reason, may disagree with your characterisation and would normally have the choice to seek a remedy and even to test the proposition that you say is not the case. The whole point of this legislation is to give those small companies the right to say, 'I don't think that was done correctly, and I want it examined.'

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Government Procurement (Judicial Review) Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,3,1
"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2018-10-18,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for International Development and the Pacific) (10:50):  The rules that the public sector has to operate under for these particular types of contracts are very overt in their statement that they are not allowed to use this rule in order to be able to do anything apart from something that would be in the benefit of the contract on the basis that it's a small-sized tender. So I think we may be arguing at cross purposes to some degree here. Your suggestion, we're saying, is that there is a balance being determined here, on the basis of good business sense, speed and efficiency but with a set of rules around it that overtly say you cannot do this in order to evade any level of scrutiny. So I suppose we can discuss this for some time, but I think we may have to agree to disagree, on the basis that we believe that the rules put in place the kinds of protections that we think are appropriate and relevant for the type of contract that we're talking about. I suppose that's the position of the government in relation to this particular matter.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Government Procurement (Judicial Review) Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,3,1
"Patrick, Sen Rex",CA,2018-10-18,"



Senator PATRICK
 (South Australia) (10:52):  I'm in agreement. I understand the government takes a strong position that that is not what happens. But I'd ask you to respect the view that other companies who are generally competing with entities where they see this occurring may be concerned about it. It causes a controversy, and this bill is designed to solve those controversies. As you would be well aware, when you have a department that is subject to judicial review, in some sense it tightens it down further and gives much more rigour to the processes. So my concern is that you're carving these out. I'm just wondering—because this does occur commonly—if there's any way in which we could have a situation where this bill could cover those circumstances in some way.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Government Procurement (Judicial Review) Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,3,1
"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2018-10-18,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for International Development and the Pacific) (10:53):  Thank you, Senator. I accept your comments, but we believe this is the appropriate way to do it. The vast bulk of procurement operates under this particular mechanism, and I draw your attention—without belabouring a point—to paragraph 9.5 of the Procurement Rules:


A procurementmust not be divided into separate parts solely for the purpose of avoiding a relevant procurement threshold. 

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Government Procurement (Judicial Review) Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,3,1
"Patrick, Sen Rex",CA,2018-10-18,"



Senator PATRICK
 (South Australia) (10:53):  Again I suspect someone may challenge that and claim that they have done that, but I'll leave it at that. The next question I have is: how do these rules interact with services panels? Once again, there's a requirement in here to allow review of contracts that may be awarded by our services panels. Indeed, there might be a circumstance where you have a company that is a participant in a panel and a company that's not a participant—an international company, even—which may cause rise to a controversy in that a company may say that they were not given a fair opportunity. So my first question is: does this bill apply to service panels as they are currently constructed? Indeed, can the fact that someone is not on a service panel give rise to an action under this bill?

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Government Procurement (Judicial Review) Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,3,1
"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2018-10-18,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for International Development and the Pacific) (10:55):  Yes, it does apply to the panel. Action can be taken by someone in the process of trying to get onto the panel until the panel is operational. However, once the process of the establishment of the panel has been concluded and the panel is operational, at that point a non-panel member's opportunity to take action ceases.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Government Procurement (Judicial Review) Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,3,1
"Patrick, Sen Rex",CA,2018-10-18,"



Senator PATRICK
 (South Australia) (10:55):  I'm just trying to work out the mechanism, how this works, because there are many instances where someone becomes aware of a contract being awarded post facto—because it might not be the case that the tender is on AusTender. I'm wondering what the process is for a company that believes there's an action to be taken.


You've said clearly to me that tender documents are available on AusTender, except for the circumstances that you've mentioned, and I accept that. But there is a requirement now to document the actual decision to pick a particular type of procurement. You might say, 'I want to have a limited tender because I believe there are only three companies in the world that provide encryption and are trusted by our security agencies,' for example. How does someone who's outside of that—once again, it could be an international company—get access to the decision-making around that call for a limited tender that the department made? Can they do it via FOI, or is it simply made available as part of the tender package? Encryption might be a bad example, because that could be affected by security concerns. Maybe it's a company that has three specialised widgets. There are only three companies that can do that, and a limited tender goes out. But actually there's a fourth company, and they want to see how that decision-making was done.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Government Procurement (Judicial Review) Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,3,1
"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2018-10-18,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for International Development and the Pacific) (10:57):  My understanding is that any company, even if they're outside a limited tender, does have the opportunity to appeal to the department, to put forward their case that they should have been included in that tender. So they do have a remedy with the actual procuring department.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Government Procurement (Judicial Review) Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,3,1
"Patrick, Sen Rex",CA,2018-10-18,"



Senator PATRICK
 (South Australia) (10:58):  I apologise for not articulating this well. The burden of my question is that, in order to be able to appreciate that they can take an action under these provisions, they may need access to documentation to work that out: 'Actually, we have a bona fide case.' That's typically what happens in such a matter. You FOI a bunch of documents so that you can see what the department has done. Alternatively, you can go to a lawyer and seek prediscovery. Now, in those circumstances, obviously, you're dealing with a court order, and the department may have to capitulate. But is it likely that those sorts of decision documents would fall under one of the exemptions in the FOI Act?

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Government Procurement (Judicial Review) Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,3,1
"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2018-10-18,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for International Development and the Pacific) (10:59):  Senator Patrick, without wanting to get into a very long debate with you about the operation of the judicial system and access to various sorts of documentation and the like, obviously, what we have here are rules and boundaries by which one can operate. If we remove all those boundaries and say it's a free-for-all—I'm not quite sure what you're trying to get to here, talking about a potential example or a hypothetical example of something happening. Do you have a specific example you wish to draw attention to, or is this just a legal argument for legal argument's sake?

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Government Procurement (Judicial Review) Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,3,1
"Patrick, Sen Rex",CA,2018-10-18,"



Senator PATRICK
 (South Australia) (10:59):  It's a genuine question. I'm the director of company A; Senator Storer is the director of company B. I am awarded a limited tender contract. Senator Storer feels aggrieved by that because he thought there was something to offer. In order to bring an action, he has to show that the department has in some way breached the Commonwealth procurement rules. He can't do that by simply saying, 'I feel this is unfair.' He needs access to documents that might show that they didn't consider something relevant or they've not properly gone to market to find companies that provide the sorts of services that both my company and Senator Storer's company provide. The point is that you can't actually commence an action unless you've got access to the decision-making and the process by which the department made the decision. Is it wholly and solely that Senator Storer has to guess and pay lawyers to get discovery? Will he be able to get access to that freely because it's on the web somewhere or, alternatively, via FOI?

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Government Procurement (Judicial Review) Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,3,1
"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2018-10-18,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for International Development and the Pacific) (11:01):  You have probably a greater understanding of the FOI Act than many of us in here, but there is obviously a balance between the procurement rules that exist around how we operate with procurement and making sure that the rules are applied in such a way that would mitigate against this kind of thing happening in the first place. Obviously, if a government agency decides to go for a limited tender, they would do so in the belief that they have been able to clearly define who was available or who within that marketplace it was appropriate to seek that tender from. The rules state that there must never be any intention to exclude somebody who otherwise might have been an appropriate source for that particular procurement.


In terms of FOI and the access to particular pieces of information and the like, there are obviously rules around commercial in confidence and the commercial documentation. To go back to your previous discussions in relation to Defence et cetera, there will be a series of other things that sit around decisions about what information might or might not be available in a particular process. I think, if you put those two side by side, there is a level of safety mechanism in place that would suggest that, first of all, it's highly unlikely that this situation would occur in the first place, and, if it did, it would have to be determined on the merit of the particular action on the basis of whether the information being sought was something that was actually going to prejudice another party to this particular contract because of the commercial nature of the information that was being sought.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Government Procurement (Judicial Review) Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,3,1
"Patrick, Sen Rex",CA,2018-10-18,"



Senator PATRICK
 (South Australia) (11:03):  I'll move on now to a slightly different topic. One of the remedies a company can seek is an injunction on the Commonwealth to pause the activity. For example, when a preferred tenderer has been selected and the government is negotiating a contract with that preferred tenderer, if a second or a third party perhaps comes along and says, 'I wish to seek an injunction,' that could create all sorts of problems for the Commonwealth in its procurement process. The government department may actually be slowed down by injunctions from the courts. The act actually allows for a public interest certificate to be issued—in some sense, trying to make sure that that doesn't happen. I'm just trying to understand how that mechanism would work. What is considered to be in the public interest? Who determines that? How does that certificate process work?

Senator PATRICK
 (South Australia) (11:05):  To close off on this line of questioning—I do have some more questions—I'm wondering about circumstances where you have a project that a department is running that may involve multiple different contract streams because each contributor to the project has different skills and different services they can provide. Let's say you have five elements of a project. On element No. 5 an action is invoked and an injunction is placed on that contract, on that particular procurement. The other four are underway and may be reliant on No. 5 in some way. Is it the intention that, in those circumstances, the Commonwealth will compensate the other four companies, who will end up being delayed in the execution of their contracted obligations and, in fact, in some sense would end up being penalised for something completely outside of their control? How does the Commonwealth intend to handle that?

Senator STORER
 (South Australia) (11:07):  I want to reflect on this bill in terms of the amendments that are being put regarding the TPP-11 and in terms of the process of the passing of notice of motion this morning. In terms of that process, I think it's disappointing that there will be a cut-off of debate of this bill, and of the following bill, at 11.45. This does not accord with the discussion that happened regarding the personal income tax legislation in May. There was a lot of grievance held by the Labor Party with regard to that gag motion on that day, and I didn't get to speak on my amendment on that day as well.


I am a supporter of measures that increase opportunities for trade and commerce between Australia and the rest of the world, but I have significant concerns regarding the economic benefit of the legislation that was passed yesterday in terms of the lack of independent modelling of it and the likelihood of an overall positive outcome of Australia's involvement in that agreement. There are significant concerns regarding the ISDS and I see that they're reflected in the amendments that certainly will be put at 11.45 in regard to this bill itself.


The ISDS has significant issues that have been eloquently discussed by speakers here yesterday and the previous days. I am very concerned about the lack of independent analysis of the potential impacts on the Australian labour market of the removal of labour market testing for temporary migrant workers from those TPP-11 countries. I will certainly be looking very carefully at the amendments to be made regarding this bill and then the overall economic situation that Australia is in. That's important in terms of other legislation that will be looked at in this place.


As I mentioned yesterday, even former Treasurer Peter Costello has noted the concern regarding the government debt. He noted that overall net debt was so high that he thought he would be dead before it was paid off. Yet with regard to the intention to bring forward the company tax cuts for companies with a turnover of $50 million, the Treasurer has revealed that there will be no savings to match the estimated cost of $3.2 billion over the forward estimates. At least the Labor Party have announced that it would help meet this cost by delaying the implementation of its Australian investment guarantee legislation.


The last time this discussion of company tax was before the Senate, I opposed it based on the best evidence to date, which found that the corporate tax cuts already in place have had little impact on wages and a small effect on jobs and investment. I found this out from the AlphaBeta Advisors review of the 2014 tax cuts for companies of under $2 million. They found that there was a marginal increase in employment versus the increase for firms above that threshold, where there was a limited increase in wages and there was a slight increase in investment. It seems to me, in regard to Australia's desire for economic growth, jobs and wages, that there would alternative, wiser initiatives that could be done—for example, an instant access tax write-off, an expansion of R&D concessions that were limited in the last budget or spending more on infrastructure, which the ministers have indicated creates a significant increase in GDP and a longstanding benefit.


There are also issues, in terms of analysis by Deloitte Access Economics, regarding a significant increase to Newstart and related payments that would deliver a prosperity dividend of $4 billion to the Australian economy, as well as having a very tightly targeted fairness impact, with the overwhelming bulk of the relevant increase in disposable incomes going to Australia's lowest-income families. I think that legislation, such as that which will be dealt with, is piecemeal and narrow. We should be looking at a more broad-based tax reform. We had the Henry review with its seven principal feature reforms pass 10 years ago, yet we're only dealing with one of those principal features and we have the architecture in place for it.


With regard to this bill, I will certainly be looking very carefully at the amendments and also the other bills in terms of what is in the best interests of Australia's overall economic situation and for the people and the taxpayers who we serve.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Government Procurement (Judicial Review) Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,3,1
"Hanson, Sen Pauline",PHON,2018-10-18,"



Senator HANSON
 (Queensland) (11:13):  Yes, just one or two questions—that's all. I just want clarification on it. The law at the moment is that multinationals who don't get the tender cannot challenge it in the court system—is that correct?

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Government Procurement (Judicial Review) Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,3,1
"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2018-10-18,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for International Development and the Pacific) (11:14):  I am advised that, like any other business, they can challenge that through the courts.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Government Procurement (Judicial Review) Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,3,1
"Hanson, Sen Pauline",PHON,2018-10-18,"



Senator HANSON
 (Queensland) (11:14):  If that is the case, then why this bill? You need to actually explain to me, because my understanding is that, at the moment, multinationals who don't get a tender cannot actually go for a review in the judicial system.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Government Procurement (Judicial Review) Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,3,1
"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2018-10-18,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for International Development and the Pacific) (11:14):  The primary legislation gives Australian businesses access to trade agreements overseas and, similarly, international companies will have reciprocal access to trade agreements into Australia. 

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Government Procurement (Judicial Review) Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,3,1
"Hanson, Sen Pauline",PHON,2018-10-18,"



Senator HANSON
 (Queensland) (11:15):  Minister, you know that is not the question I have asked. I have asked you directly: if multinationals do not get a tender, can they challenge that in our court system at the moment?

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Government Procurement (Judicial Review) Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,3,1
"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2018-10-18,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for International Development and the Pacific) (11:15):  My understanding is that, under the current system, any company has recourse to challenge under the Australian court system. However, what this bill seeks to do is provide greater protections and greater assistance to small businesses to make sure that they have the kind of access and remedy that would be appropriate. 

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Government Procurement (Judicial Review) Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,3,1
"Hanson, Sen Pauline",PHON,2018-10-18,"



Senator HANSON
 (Queensland) (11:16):  Then I'd like you to answer the question. If you have a local government, a state government or even a federal government that offers a tender in which only Australian companies or Australian workers are wanted to fill those jobs, can a multinational company challenge that tender under your new bill, which you want to pass here? Can they challenge that in the court system, because they are not an Australian company? 

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Government Procurement (Judicial Review) Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,3,1
"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2018-10-18,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for International Development and the Pacific) (11:16):  I'm advised that under these rules you cannot overturn a contract once it has been let. So the answer is no. 

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Government Procurement (Judicial Review) Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,3,1
"Hanson, Sen Pauline",PHON,2018-10-18,"



Senator HANSON
 (Queensland) (11:16):  So you're saying that a contract can't be overturned. What I'm saying is: if a local, state or federal government says, 'We want only Australian companies to provide the services to us; we want to do those jobs with Australian workers,' can multinationals challenge that? If they put in a tender, can they then challenge governments by saying: 'We have been discriminated against. We have been unfairly treated. We are now going to challenge you under this new legislation in the judicial court system'? At the moment, I understand they can't. 

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Government Procurement (Judicial Review) Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,3,1
"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2018-10-18,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for International Development and the Pacific) (11:17):  Senator, my understanding is that, as it currently stands, any company can challenge that decision. What this legislation seeks to do is change the process by which that can occur to provide greater protections for small businesses. So the answer to your question is, yes, it can occur. It currently can occur. 

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Government Procurement (Judicial Review) Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,3,1
"Hanson, Sen Pauline",PHON,2018-10-18,"



Senator HANSON
 (Queensland) (11:18):  In other words, under the process whereby they're protected at the moment, you're going to allow them an avenue to take it to the judicial system and so the judicial system can actually override it. If they override it, can the judicial system then require compensation to be paid? 

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Government Procurement (Judicial Review) Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,3,1
"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2018-10-18,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for International Development and the Pacific) (11:18):  I'll try and see if I can be clear in my answer, because I think maybe we're a bit at cross-purposes. There is a system in place which allows a certain recourse from any company, no matter who they are, within our court system in relation to a pre-contract letting situation. Nothing changes in terms of once a contract has been let; it is not able to be challenged. What we're seeking to do by this legislation is increase the level of protection, particularly around small businesses, so that in the situation where they may be seeking remedy because they believe that they've been wronged or where they're challenging the decision pre the letting of the contract, they will have access to do that in such a way that probably gives greater advantage to them. This bill does not seek to actually change what you're talking about. You're talking about the legal rights of businesses within the contractual system that operates within Australia and around the world. That is not what this bill is seeking to change. 

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Government Procurement (Judicial Review) Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,3,1
"Hanson, Sen Pauline",PHON,2018-10-18,"



Senator HANSON
 (Queensland) (11:19):  But what you're saying is that this will open it up under the TPP, because this is enabling legislation for the TPP. Therefore, it is going to allow multinationals to challenge it in the court system. You're going to open up the court system now to multinationals to challenge it and, possibly, even challenge for compensation to be paid for by the taxpayers.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Government Procurement (Judicial Review) Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,3,1
"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2018-10-18,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for International Development and the Pacific) (11:20):  The very basis of a trade arrangement that you enter into with another country is to enhance the economic benefit to both of the countries by allowing freer access to the other country's economy to trade with it. Equally, Australian companies will be afforded the same access and the same privilege in the countries that we are seeking to trade with. Overall, obviously, the Australian government is of the view that we've seen such extraordinary success for the farmers, whom I know you're very much supporting, as am I, from the trading agreements that we've put in place and the benefits that are delivered from that. The government has made a clear assessment, through a series of appropriate tools and modelling, that the benefit to Australia of these free trade agreements and everything that goes with them is in the national interest. So, in anything that you're prosecuting, if you suggest that there is any change on this side of the equation within Australia, the benefits are delivered to our businesses who are seeking to trade and send our goods to their countries.


Australia is an exporting nation. We're not ever going to get rich selling to ourselves. It is tremendously important that governments put in place the market mechanisms by which we can enable our farmers and our businesses to trade with the rest of the world. Part of that arrangement is allowing our friendly partners to have access to our marketplace to provide the goods and services that the Australian public often demands. I don't mean to sit here giving you a lecture on free trade. Obviously, you've got your opinion, but the fact of the matter is that the Australian government believes that these free trade arrangements are in the best interests of Australian producers, Australian businesses and the Australian public.

"Hanson-Young, Sen Sarah",AG,2018-10-18,"



Senator HANSON-YOUNG
 (South Australia) (11:22):  I've just got a couple of questions to the minister. I've just heard the minister speak about the need for these trade arrangements because they are in the best interests of Australian business. I'd just like to ask, while we've got the minister and some advisers here, whether it is in the best interests of Australia's trade for Australia to be moving our embassy in Israel to Jerusalem and whether there have been any concerns raised directly with the government, as reported, from countries in our region, like Indonesia and Malaysia, in relation to the impact on our trading arrangements because of this decision to move Australia's embassy to Jerusalem. I've asked the question of the minister and I would like an answer.




The TEMPORARY CHAIR 

(

"Patrick, Sen Rex",CA,2018-10-18,"



Senator PATRICK
 (South Australia) (11:23):  Just directly in relation to the bill that we're dealing with, the jurisdiction in which you would raise an application in this instance would be the Federal Circuit Court. The Federal Circuit Court is, in actual fact, having some difficulties, certainly in terms of family law matters and migration matters in the general division. Has the government looked at the resourcing that might be required in respect of this legislation? Are you anticipating that additional resources will be required in the Federal Circuit Court?

Senator HANSON-YOUNG
 (South Australia) (11:24):  Chair, I just want to go back to my line of questioning. I'd like to know whether the minister is refusing to answer the question or whether she just does not know. I've asked a question about whether trading concerns have been raised with Australia, with the government or with any officials from Indonesia or Malaysia, as reported.



The TEMPORARY CHAIR:  Minister?

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Government Procurement (Judicial Review) Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,3,1
"Hanson-Young, Sen Sarah",AG,2018-10-18,"



Senator HANSON-YOUNG
 (South Australia) (11:24):  It's obvious that the minister is refusing to answer the question. We have the ambassador for Israel in Barnaby Joyce's office right now. That's what's been reported. The ambassador for Israel is in Barnaby Joyce's office. Is that because there are concerns about the impact of our trading relationships with countries that are opposed to moving our embassy to Jerusalem, or is it that Mr Joyce is actually getting the support outside this parliament—




Senator Hanson:
  A point of order: the question from Senator Hanson-Young has got nothing to do with the amendment before this chamber. It's got nothing to do with whether the embassy is going to Jerusalem or not. That is not what is before this chamber. With limited time, I suggest we go back to the bill before us and ask questions on that.



The TEMPORARY CHAIR:  There is no point of order. 




Senator HANSON-YOUNG:
  Could the minister please explain what the ambassador for Israel is doing in Mr Joyce's office? Is it because he's soon to become the Deputy PM?



The TEMPORARY CHAIR:  Senator Hanson-Young, I will make a ruling there: that is not relevant to the amendment in front of the Senate at the moment. I give the call to Senator Patrick.

 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for International Development and the Pacific) (11:26):  I'm advised that $2.9 million has been made available in additional funding.

"Patrick, Sen Rex",CA,2018-10-18,"



Senator PATRICK
 (South Australia) (11:26):  I will point out that I'm disturbed about the previous answer, where you talked about the five companies, with one company being dragged into the courts and the other four ending up being affected. I think that's something the government ought to consider very carefully, because a lot of those companies will be small businesses unable to bear the cost of simply running project teams on for lengthy periods while a court matter is dealt with. 


I want to go to the intersection between the judicial review of a procurement and its interaction with ISDS. I note that ISDS provisions are only available to foreign companies here in Australia, as Assistant Minister Reynolds told me yesterday. If an international company makes an application under this bill and it is litigated, and they are unsuccessful, does that waive their right to then raise an ISDS claim against the government that might be closely related to the matter that has been determined in the court? 

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Government Procurement (Judicial Review) Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,3,1
"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2018-10-18,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for International Development and the Pacific) (11:29):  I've been advised that, for the ISDS provisions to be invoked, the procurement needs to be considered to be an investment, and the majority of procurements would not be seen to be an investment. And the investments are those investments that are covered and specified within the treaty. So your issue in terms of the waiving of the right to access ISDS is perhaps not relevant in this case. 

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Government Procurement (Judicial Review) Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,3,1
"Patrick, Sen Rex",CA,2018-10-18,"



Senator PATRICK
 (South Australia) (11:29):  In legalese: it's not so much a waiving but it might not give rise to an action in ISDS as opposed to waiving any particular right. It's unlikely that there would be circumstances that would give rise to an application.

Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for International Development and the Pacific) (11:30):  Senator, unless I'm misunderstanding your question, I think we might be talking about two different things. The action we're talking about in terms of a procurement damage could probably not occur under the investment. A capital procurement has a different set of remedies than an investment under the ISDS provisions. Am I misunderstanding what you're asking me?

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Government Procurement (Judicial Review) Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,3,1
"Patrick, Sen Rex",CA,2018-10-18,"



Senator PATRICK
 (South Australia) (11:31):  I think you might have actually answered my question. If I understand you correctly, they can perhaps litigate a procurement matter under this bill. It's unlikely that they would be able to litigate a similar action under ISDS because the ISDS doesn't generally cover procurements. Is that correct?

Senator FARRELL
 (South Australia—Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (11:31):  I wish to put the Labor Party's position in respect of this amendment on the record. As the Customs Amendment (Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership Implementation) Bill has passed, the amendment outlined on sheet 8521, which is an attempt to delay the implementation of this bill, is mostly redundant. Changing the date from the proclamation to the same time as the other bill receives royal assent will create uncertainty for businesses. Labor will not support this.

"Di Natale, Sen Richard",AG,2018-10-18,"



Senator DI NATALE
 (Victoria—Leader of the Australian Greens) (11:32):  I would like to put on the record the Australian Greens position on this amendment. We will support the amendment. However, our position on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Lower Taxes for Small and Medium Businesses) Bill, which has been made clear by my colleague Senator Sarah Hanson-Young, is that is we won't support this legislation because it is, again, a further measure to implement an unfair trade deal that hands over far too much power to large corporations and removes power from governments to protect the environment and public health.


I also want to take this opportunity to put on the record that we are now 10 minutes away from the guillotine being adopted without any opportunity to debate a further bill that would rip $3 billion out of essential public services and give a huge tax cut to business. We didn't have the opportunity to even give a second reading speech to put our objections formally on the record because the Liberal Party, with the support of the Labor Party, have prevented us from doing that in a remarkable act, an attack on democracy in this chamber. You do not have the guts or the decency to allow the crossbench to articulate our opposition and, indeed, to interrogate a bill that would hand over $3 billion to businesses.


Let's keep this very, very simple. We talk about the opportunity cost of a spending decision, which is the lost opportunity to do something with the money you're spending and how much that's worth. Let's actually talk about the opportunity cost of the legislation that we're being prevented from debating. Here's what this bill, which you won't allow us to debate in this chamber and are seeking to ram through without any scrutiny, does. It brings forward a tax cut worth $3 billion over the forward estimates. But here's what it doesn't do. Earlier this month, we got news from the IPCC that we're on track to lose 90 per cent of all coral reefs on the planet in the next 20 years. People come from all around the world to see the Great Barrier Reef, because you can't see anything like it anywhere else. It's worth billions to the economy. It's worth over 60,000 jobs a year, and it could be dead, could be gone, in 20 years.


What does the Great Barrier Reef get out of a tax cut? Absolutely nothing. Nine in 10 public schools are on track to never get the funding they need in order to educate students from right across the country, many of them from disadvantaged backgrounds, living with a disability or living in remote and regional communities. Those students won't get the bare minimum of funding they need; nine out of 10 of them will not get the minimum standard that we've agreed. No school ever got funded out of a tax cut. We've got 100,000 people in Australia, including 18,000 kids, who are homeless. No homeless shelter was ever built out of a tax cut. At least five women have been killed by their current or former partners since the beginning of the month. According to White Ribbon, one woman is killed by her current or former partner on average every week in Australia. Let's not beat around the bush. This is as much an economic issue as it is one of justice. Women, particularly younger women with kids, who don't have anything in savings, who aren't working or who are relying on income from an abusive partner, are being let down by economic inequality. They're crying out for our support, they're being killed every week, they're asking for help, and what are we doing? We're giving $3 billion in tax cuts. You don't open family crisis shelters with a tax cut.


Indigenous children today are twice as likely to die before their fourth birthday than non-Indigenous children. Indigenous men make up less than two per cent of the overall population and 25 per cent of the prison population. It's a national disgrace. It's an indictment on this place. It should embarrass everybody. It should shake us into action. Yet we're missing four out of our seven Closing the Gap targets. Do we think they're going to be met with this tax cut? Or do we think it's going to be harder to close the gap because of this tax cut? Well, we know the answer to that question. That's just a fraction of the opportunity cost involved in handing over this tax cut. It's not just the budget cost of bringing forward a tax reduction. It's the human cost of what we're forced to do and the things we can't afford to pay for, to invest in, because of the decision of this chamber, and you don't have the guts to ensure that it gets the scrutiny it deserves.


We are one of the wealthiest countries in the world. We are at the wealthiest point in human history. We've got the resources and the means to guarantee that all Australians get an opportunity to lead a rich and fulfilling life. Instead of doing that, you're here facilitating the passage of legislation to hand over more power to corporations—to take the power from governments to ensure that they can protect their citizens and protect their environment. And you're now, without debate, about to give $3 billion to companies who don't need it. A company with a turnover of $50 million is not a small business.


This is a massive transfer of wealth. At a time when economic inequality in this country is getting worse, at a time when our environment has never been more precarious, here we are with the Liberal Party and the Labor Party joining together to continue with this crap that we've been fed for more than three decades. Trickle-down economics doesn't work. Invest in people. What's good for big business isn't automatically good for people. You've presided over an economic system where big companies write their own policies. We've got the business industry writing this tax policy for you. We've got the coal industry writing energy policy. We've got media companies writing our media laws. And here we are with the duopoly, Liberal and Labor, joining together to prevent any debate so that the Australian community can understand what is being done in their name. The foundations of a decent society are not built through this war, this escalation, this auction on tax cuts—my tax cut is bigger than your tax cut; billions of dollars handed over to companies that don't need it.


There are so many other things that we can do for small business. There's the instant asset write-off. Again, the Greens led the charge on that, but we don't believe that taking revenue away from Newstart, from our schools and from our hospitals is the pathway to a more decent or, indeed, a more prosperous society. We're a party that believes in the public good. We believe in public ownership. We believe in investing in our essential services which are the foundations of a decent society. We believe in protecting the environment—clean air, clean water, clean energy and clean politics. And, today, what we're seeing is dirty politics, with the duopoly ganging up again, preventing meaningful debate on an issue that the Australian community have a right to hear about.


So let me just say in closing that we oppose the Trans-Pacific Partnership and we're appalled that the Labor Party would back in a Liberal Party that wants to do the bidding of its big corporate mates. We oppose these huge tax cuts that are going to businesses that don't need them, that are going to big businesses with a turnover of $50 million. What we support is investing that money in our schools, in our hospitals, in ensuring that people don't need to live beneath the poverty line, in supporting women who are living through domestic violence at the hands of an abusive partner and in ensuring that people who are sleeping rough can get a roof over their heads. It's not the government or the budget that are paying for this tax cut; it's those people who are being left behind who are paying for this tax cut.

Senator HANSON
 (Queensland) (11:41):  I just want to put on the record that One Nation will not be supporting the Government Procurement (Judicial Review) Bill 2017. The fact is that it is enabling the TPP-11 trade agreement, which we do oppose. The fact is that I have grave concerns that, with this change, it can be challenged in the court system by multinationals. I don't believe it's in the best interest of Australian businesses. There is talk about trade deals and that we've got the same arrangement overseas. I then challenge them to answer why the New Zealand Prime Minister had a side letter to omit the ISDS clause with some countries. 


There's nothing here with the other bill. I'm sorry to say that it didn't happen in this chamber that we had the opportunity to talk on the taxation bill, the Treasury Laws Amendment (Lower Taxes for Small and Medium Businesses) Bill. It was One Nation that negotiated with the government and the crossbenchers to get it up from a $10 million turnover to a $50 million turnover, which we supported. The Labor Party have backflipped on this and this is why they don't want the debate in the chamber. It's because the Labor Party only wanted it at a $2 million turnover. They were not supporting small or medium-sized businesses at all. So it is a flip-flop. It is a backflip by the Labor Party. They accuse me of flip-flopping. I'll tell you what—this is the biggest flip-flop from the Labor Party on taxation.


As I said at the time when we supported it, I question why it was so far down the track. If it's such a good deal for small and medium-sized businesses, why is it taking so long to actually introduce the bill? So I'm pleased to see that it is being introduced. I would personally have liked to see some help in the payroll tax of all the states to increase the threshold. I believe that would have created more employment than the corporate tax cuts. I had a meeting and a discussion with international CEOs of big companies, huge companies, from around the world. They said they weren't interested in corporate tax cuts. They were more interested in dealing with industrial relations, plus also payroll tax, which is more important to them and would have created more employment than this corporate tax cut. So it's a shame that it couldn't be debated at all.


Also, under this bill, I don't believe that you, the government, are addressing the multinationals that are not paying their taxes in this country. We have over 700 companies in Australia that are not paying their taxes here. You've opened up the TPP agreement now, so we're going to see more companies here in Australia. You're encouraging them to come and invest here, but you are not fighting for them to pay their taxes in Australia. I believe that is a crying shame.

[commencement]





I've

got some questions for the minister in relation to the Government Procurement (Judicial Review) Bill 2017. The judicial review bill brings about a right for companies to seek a review of a decision, or perhaps seek an injunction or compensation in respect of a procurement. I've got some questions in relation to the transitional arrangements from when the bill is passed, particularly in circumstances where there are procurements underway. I want to know whether or not the bill will cause an effect on current tenders that are in play—noting that there are requirements, for example, when deciding on whether a procurement ought to be a limited tender, an open tender or a sole source. Those sorts of decisions now have to be documented. If we now kick off with new laws, assuming they end up being passed, what does that do to the current tenders on foot?

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,3,2
"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2018-10-18,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for International Development and the Pacific) (10:38):  My advice is that there are six months before this particular process starts, which we believe will give ample time for those matters on foot to be dealt with.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,3,2
"Patrick, Sen Rex",CA,2018-10-18,"



Senator PATRICK
 (South Australia) (10:38):  A company might be aggrieved by a tender process. One of the potential causes of an action may, in fact, be that first decision to go to a limited tender, to an open tender or to a sole source tender of some sort. The potentially aggrieved party may not have access to the decision reasoning and so may be blind as to whether or not they have a case. When the departments are making these decisions and writing their reasons, can you confirm whether those reasons will be made public? Alternatively, will they be accessible under FOI? Alternatively, does it require some sort of prediscovery in a court action to be able to get access to work out whether or not you have a bona fide case to bring in terms of a complaint?

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,3,2
"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2018-10-18,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for International Development and the Pacific) (10:39):  My advice is that the conditions of a limited tender must be made public.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,3,2
"Patrick, Sen Rex",CA,2018-10-18,"



Senator PATRICK
 (South Australia) (10:39):  In the past what has happened is that, typically, tenders are made public. It is not always the case with limited tenders, but certainly it is the case with sole tenders because the way in which that is typically done is through AusTender. For example, in relation to the submarine project, the government made a decision to go to DCNS, the Japanese government and, indeed, to the Germans, the French and the Japanese. None of the tendering details appeared on AusTender. You might recall that, for example, I had to extract details of Future Frigate from the government like a dental surgeon by way of FOI. So when you say the documentation is available, I'm not exactly sure whether in fact it is. I'll just ask you to check.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,3,2
"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2018-10-18,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for International Development and the Pacific) (10:41):  I'm advised that, under item 2.6 of the tender rules, matters of national security are exempt from the requirement for disclosure.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,3,2
"Patrick, Sen Rex",CA,2018-10-18,"



Senator PATRICK
 (South Australia) (10:41):  Clearly, some of those tenders are really big tenders. They're for significant value contracts, often ranging into the billions. In fact, one would imagine that the companies that are tendering for those sorts of contracts would have capabilities to bring quite serious actions. What happens in that instance, noting that there is, in some sense, a carve-out here? I'm thinking of circumstances where an Australian company is tendering for a job and an overseas company is tendering for a job. The overseas company wins. The Australian company suspects there's a problem but doesn't have access to this information. How would the Australian company get around that, or would they simply be disadvantaged in those circumstances?

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,3,2
"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2018-10-18,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for International Development and the Pacific) (10:42):  Obviously, we're talking about a specific area of carve-out for a specific reason in terms of national security, and often those carve-outs are part of international agreements. However, voluntarily, the Australian government will provide information where they don't believe that it is contrary to the national interest or national security.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,3,2
"Patrick, Sen Rex",CA,2018-10-18,"



Senator PATRICK
 (South Australia) (10:42):  Defence has a whole range of contracts. They might have contracts for fighter jets, but, equally, they have contracts for cleaning services and so forth. Do you say that you distinguish those contracts?

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,3,2
"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2018-10-18,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for International Development and the Pacific) (10:43):  The international rules will distinguish between which types of contracts would sit underneath the exclusions or the carve-out on the basis of national security and those that wouldn't.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,3,2
"Patrick, Sen Rex",CA,2018-10-18,"



Senator PATRICK
 (South Australia) (10:43):  I understand that, whilst this legislation is an enabling piece of legislation for the TPP, it is Australian legislation in its own right. So, for an Australian company, there are no impacts from an international treaty perspective. It is simply Australian law. In that context, I don't understand why you mention international treaties. This is Australian legislation litigated in Australian courts with no connection to the TPP, other than it enables that agreement to enter into force.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,3,2
"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2018-10-18,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for International Development and the Pacific) (10:44):  My apologies. I thought I was responding to your question in relation to the Defence examples that you were raising. If that's not what you were talking about, perhaps you might be a little clearer about what the actual question is, because we were talking about Defence carve-out.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,3,2
"Patrick, Sen Rex",CA,2018-10-18,"



Senator PATRICK
 (South Australia) (10:44):  Okay; I'll move on. Currently this bill deals with covered procurements, and those procurements are typically procurements above $80,000. At this point in time it is possible for someone to be given a contract by way of sole source under $80,000. It's not a covered procurement in the context of this bill. But then what happens is, if I get into contract for $79,999 with the Department of Defence—and they can do that quite lawfully just by way of sole source—they can then give me another $200,000 contract on the basis that I am already in contract with them. I'm just wondering how that is handled in the context of someone who perhaps wanted to provide those services and now sees a contract that's got a value of $279,000, which would normally give cause for invoking this legislation. Does it allow them to invoke the legislation or is that a loophole in the arrangements?

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,3,2
"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2018-10-18,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for International Development and the Pacific) (10:46):  I'm advised that you couldn't use this mechanism to bring the matter before the court. You cannot use the mechanism contained in this legislation to bring a matter in relation to something over the amount of $80,000 to court.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,3,2
"Patrick, Sen Rex",CA,2018-10-18,"



Senator PATRICK
 (South Australia) (10:47):  Some time ago, by way of a question on notice—I think it might have actually been former Senator Xenophon who asked the question—the department was asked to give examples of where there had been a contract let for under $80,000 and then a subsequent contract awarded to the same company using the fact that the procurement rules allow that to occur without tender. The response from the department was that it would take up so much time. That indicates to me that there are lots and lots of businesses that are working with Defence in those circumstances—that is, a small contract followed by a larger contract—and this is mostly in the small-business space. You're saying that this legislation does not give them a remedy in circumstances where they feel that the procurement decision is flawed?

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,3,2
"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2018-10-18,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for International Development and the Pacific) (10:48):  I'm advised that the circumstance you described is one the agency believes is highly unlikely to exist. There is absolutely no incentive in public sector procurement for the public sector to be breaking down contracts into small amounts to try to avoid a level of scrutiny or legislative assessment. So the advice is that that situation is highly unlikely to ever occur.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,3,2
"Patrick, Sen Rex",CA,2018-10-18,"



Senator PATRICK
 (South Australia) (10:49):  Again, I will state that I have an answer from the department that says that it occurs so often that they are unable to provide the answer to the FADT committee. I, in a previous life, worked in this space, and it was very common that you would bring someone on. Whether properly or improperly, you would bring them on as a specialist service under $80,000, and once you were initially employed, quite lawfully, without tender, they simply extended the contract. That is common practice, I put to you.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,3,2
"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2018-10-18,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for International Development and the Pacific) (10:49):  Certainly there are circumstances where it obviously makes good economic and business sense for contracts to be handed out in a certain and particular way, but the suggestion that this is a mechanism that is used to evade scrutiny, I think, is contested.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,3,2
"Patrick, Sen Rex",CA,2018-10-18,"



Senator PATRICK
 (South Australia) (10:50):  Nonetheless—and I understand where you're coming from, Minister—you would appreciate that another company, sitting beside watching and thinking that they have an opportunity to provide the services perhaps at a better price or perhaps with greater knowledge or some quite genuine reason, may disagree with your characterisation and would normally have the choice to seek a remedy and even to test the proposition that you say is not the case. The whole point of this legislation is to give those small companies the right to say, 'I don't think that was done correctly, and I want it examined.'

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,3,2
"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2018-10-18,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for International Development and the Pacific) (10:50):  The rules that the public sector has to operate under for these particular types of contracts are very overt in their statement that they are not allowed to use this rule in order to be able to do anything apart from something that would be in the benefit of the contract on the basis that it's a small-sized tender. So I think we may be arguing at cross purposes to some degree here. Your suggestion, we're saying, is that there is a balance being determined here, on the basis of good business sense, speed and efficiency but with a set of rules around it that overtly say you cannot do this in order to evade any level of scrutiny. So I suppose we can discuss this for some time, but I think we may have to agree to disagree, on the basis that we believe that the rules put in place the kinds of protections that we think are appropriate and relevant for the type of contract that we're talking about. I suppose that's the position of the government in relation to this particular matter.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,3,2
"Patrick, Sen Rex",CA,2018-10-18,"



Senator PATRICK
 (South Australia) (10:52):  I'm in agreement. I understand the government takes a strong position that that is not what happens. But I'd ask you to respect the view that other companies who are generally competing with entities where they see this occurring may be concerned about it. It causes a controversy, and this bill is designed to solve those controversies. As you would be well aware, when you have a department that is subject to judicial review, in some sense it tightens it down further and gives much more rigour to the processes. So my concern is that you're carving these out. I'm just wondering—because this does occur commonly—if there's any way in which we could have a situation where this bill could cover those circumstances in some way.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,3,2
"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2018-10-18,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for International Development and the Pacific) (10:53):  Thank you, Senator. I accept your comments, but we believe this is the appropriate way to do it. The vast bulk of procurement operates under this particular mechanism, and I draw your attention—without belabouring a point—to paragraph 9.5 of the Procurement Rules:


A procurementmust not be divided into separate parts solely for the purpose of avoiding a relevant procurement threshold. 

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,3,2
"Patrick, Sen Rex",CA,2018-10-18,"



Senator PATRICK
 (South Australia) (10:53):  Again I suspect someone may challenge that and claim that they have done that, but I'll leave it at that. The next question I have is: how do these rules interact with services panels? Once again, there's a requirement in here to allow review of contracts that may be awarded by our services panels. Indeed, there might be a circumstance where you have a company that is a participant in a panel and a company that's not a participant—an international company, even—which may cause rise to a controversy in that a company may say that they were not given a fair opportunity. So my first question is: does this bill apply to service panels as they are currently constructed? Indeed, can the fact that someone is not on a service panel give rise to an action under this bill?

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,3,2
"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2018-10-18,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for International Development and the Pacific) (10:55):  Yes, it does apply to the panel. Action can be taken by someone in the process of trying to get onto the panel until the panel is operational. However, once the process of the establishment of the panel has been concluded and the panel is operational, at that point a non-panel member's opportunity to take action ceases.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,3,2
"Patrick, Sen Rex",CA,2018-10-18,"



Senator PATRICK
 (South Australia) (10:55):  I'm just trying to work out the mechanism, how this works, because there are many instances where someone becomes aware of a contract being awarded post facto—because it might not be the case that the tender is on AusTender. I'm wondering what the process is for a company that believes there's an action to be taken.


You've said clearly to me that tender documents are available on AusTender, except for the circumstances that you've mentioned, and I accept that. But there is a requirement now to document the actual decision to pick a particular type of procurement. You might say, 'I want to have a limited tender because I believe there are only three companies in the world that provide encryption and are trusted by our security agencies,' for example. How does someone who's outside of that—once again, it could be an international company—get access to the decision-making around that call for a limited tender that the department made? Can they do it via FOI, or is it simply made available as part of the tender package? Encryption might be a bad example, because that could be affected by security concerns. Maybe it's a company that has three specialised widgets. There are only three companies that can do that, and a limited tender goes out. But actually there's a fourth company, and they want to see how that decision-making was done.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,3,2
"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2018-10-18,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for International Development and the Pacific) (10:57):  My understanding is that any company, even if they're outside a limited tender, does have the opportunity to appeal to the department, to put forward their case that they should have been included in that tender. So they do have a remedy with the actual procuring department.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,3,2
"Patrick, Sen Rex",CA,2018-10-18,"



Senator PATRICK
 (South Australia) (10:58):  I apologise for not articulating this well. The burden of my question is that, in order to be able to appreciate that they can take an action under these provisions, they may need access to documentation to work that out: 'Actually, we have a bona fide case.' That's typically what happens in such a matter. You FOI a bunch of documents so that you can see what the department has done. Alternatively, you can go to a lawyer and seek prediscovery. Now, in those circumstances, obviously, you're dealing with a court order, and the department may have to capitulate. But is it likely that those sorts of decision documents would fall under one of the exemptions in the FOI Act?

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,3,2
"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2018-10-18,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for International Development and the Pacific) (10:59):  Senator Patrick, without wanting to get into a very long debate with you about the operation of the judicial system and access to various sorts of documentation and the like, obviously, what we have here are rules and boundaries by which one can operate. If we remove all those boundaries and say it's a free-for-all—I'm not quite sure what you're trying to get to here, talking about a potential example or a hypothetical example of something happening. Do you have a specific example you wish to draw attention to, or is this just a legal argument for legal argument's sake?

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,3,2
"Patrick, Sen Rex",CA,2018-10-18,"



Senator PATRICK
 (South Australia) (10:59):  It's a genuine question. I'm the director of company A; Senator Storer is the director of company B. I am awarded a limited tender contract. Senator Storer feels aggrieved by that because he thought there was something to offer. In order to bring an action, he has to show that the department has in some way breached the Commonwealth procurement rules. He can't do that by simply saying, 'I feel this is unfair.' He needs access to documents that might show that they didn't consider something relevant or they've not properly gone to market to find companies that provide the sorts of services that both my company and Senator Storer's company provide. The point is that you can't actually commence an action unless you've got access to the decision-making and the process by which the department made the decision. Is it wholly and solely that Senator Storer has to guess and pay lawyers to get discovery? Will he be able to get access to that freely because it's on the web somewhere or, alternatively, via FOI?

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,3,2
"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2018-10-18,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for International Development and the Pacific) (11:01):  You have probably a greater understanding of the FOI Act than many of us in here, but there is obviously a balance between the procurement rules that exist around how we operate with procurement and making sure that the rules are applied in such a way that would mitigate against this kind of thing happening in the first place. Obviously, if a government agency decides to go for a limited tender, they would do so in the belief that they have been able to clearly define who was available or who within that marketplace it was appropriate to seek that tender from. The rules state that there must never be any intention to exclude somebody who otherwise might have been an appropriate source for that particular procurement.


In terms of FOI and the access to particular pieces of information and the like, there are obviously rules around commercial in confidence and the commercial documentation. To go back to your previous discussions in relation to Defence et cetera, there will be a series of other things that sit around decisions about what information might or might not be available in a particular process. I think, if you put those two side by side, there is a level of safety mechanism in place that would suggest that, first of all, it's highly unlikely that this situation would occur in the first place, and, if it did, it would have to be determined on the merit of the particular action on the basis of whether the information being sought was something that was actually going to prejudice another party to this particular contract because of the commercial nature of the information that was being sought.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,3,2
"Patrick, Sen Rex",CA,2018-10-18,"



Senator PATRICK
 (South Australia) (11:03):  I'll move on now to a slightly different topic. One of the remedies a company can seek is an injunction on the Commonwealth to pause the activity. For example, when a preferred tenderer has been selected and the government is negotiating a contract with that preferred tenderer, if a second or a third party perhaps comes along and says, 'I wish to seek an injunction,' that could create all sorts of problems for the Commonwealth in its procurement process. The government department may actually be slowed down by injunctions from the courts. The act actually allows for a public interest certificate to be issued—in some sense, trying to make sure that that doesn't happen. I'm just trying to understand how that mechanism would work. What is considered to be in the public interest? Who determines that? How does that certificate process work?

 (South Australia) (11:05):  To close off on this line of questioning—I do have some more questions—I'm wondering about circumstances where you have a project that a department is running that may involve multiple different contract streams because each contributor to the project has different skills and different services they can provide. Let's say you have five elements of a project. On element No. 5 an action is invoked and an injunction is placed on that contract, on that particular procurement. The other four are underway and may be reliant on No. 5 in some way. Is it the intention that, in those circumstances, the Commonwealth will compensate the other four companies, who will end up being delayed in the execution of their contracted obligations and, in fact, in some sense would end up being penalised for something completely outside of their control? How does the Commonwealth intend to handle that?

Senator STORER
 (South Australia) (11:07):  I want to reflect on this bill in terms of the amendments that are being put regarding the TPP-11 and in terms of the process of the passing of notice of motion this morning. In terms of that process, I think it's disappointing that there will be a cut-off of debate of this bill, and of the following bill, at 11.45. This does not accord with the discussion that happened regarding the personal income tax legislation in May. There was a lot of grievance held by the Labor Party with regard to that gag motion on that day, and I didn't get to speak on my amendment on that day as well.


I am a supporter of measures that increase opportunities for trade and commerce between Australia and the rest of the world, but I have significant concerns regarding the economic benefit of the legislation that was passed yesterday in terms of the lack of independent modelling of it and the likelihood of an overall positive outcome of Australia's involvement in that agreement. There are significant concerns regarding the ISDS and I see that they're reflected in the amendments that certainly will be put at 11.45 in regard to this bill itself.


The ISDS has significant issues that have been eloquently discussed by speakers here yesterday and the previous days. I am very concerned about the lack of independent analysis of the potential impacts on the Australian labour market of the removal of labour market testing for temporary migrant workers from those TPP-11 countries. I will certainly be looking very carefully at the amendments to be made regarding this bill and then the overall economic situation that Australia is in. That's important in terms of other legislation that will be looked at in this place.


As I mentioned yesterday, even former Treasurer Peter Costello has noted the concern regarding the government debt. He noted that overall net debt was so high that he thought he would be dead before it was paid off. Yet with regard to the intention to bring forward the company tax cuts for companies with a turnover of $50 million, the Treasurer has revealed that there will be no savings to match the estimated cost of $3.2 billion over the forward estimates. At least the Labor Party have announced that it would help meet this cost by delaying the implementation of its Australian investment guarantee legislation.


The last time this discussion of company tax was before the Senate, I opposed it based on the best evidence to date, which found that the corporate tax cuts already in place have had little impact on wages and a small effect on jobs and investment. I found this out from the AlphaBeta Advisors review of the 2014 tax cuts for companies of under $2 million. They found that there was a marginal increase in employment versus the increase for firms above that threshold, where there was a limited increase in wages and there was a slight increase in investment. It seems to me, in regard to Australia's desire for economic growth, jobs and wages, that there would alternative, wiser initiatives that could be done—for example, an instant access tax write-off, an expansion of R&D concessions that were limited in the last budget or spending more on infrastructure, which the ministers have indicated creates a significant increase in GDP and a longstanding benefit.


There are also issues, in terms of analysis by Deloitte Access Economics, regarding a significant increase to Newstart and related payments that would deliver a prosperity dividend of $4 billion to the Australian economy, as well as having a very tightly targeted fairness impact, with the overwhelming bulk of the relevant increase in disposable incomes going to Australia's lowest-income families. I think that legislation, such as that which will be dealt with, is piecemeal and narrow. We should be looking at a more broad-based tax reform. We had the Henry review with its seven principal feature reforms pass 10 years ago, yet we're only dealing with one of those principal features and we have the architecture in place for it.


With regard to this bill, I will certainly be looking very carefully at the amendments and also the other bills in terms of what is in the best interests of Australia's overall economic situation and for the people and the taxpayers who we serve.




The TEMPORARY CHAIR 

(
Senator Sterle
):  Just before I do pass on the call, I wish to deal with Senator Patrick's amendment that is in front of us. Hence, that's why I call Senator Hanson. Senator Hanson, did you wish to ask questions around this amendment?

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,3,2
"Hanson, Sen Pauline",PHON,2018-10-18,"



Senator HANSON
 (Queensland) (11:13):  Yes, just one or two questions—that's all. I just want clarification on it. The law at the moment is that multinationals who don't get the tender cannot challenge it in the court system—is that correct?

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,3,2
"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2018-10-18,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for International Development and the Pacific) (11:14):  I am advised that, like any other business, they can challenge that through the courts.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,3,2
"Hanson, Sen Pauline",PHON,2018-10-18,"



Senator HANSON
 (Queensland) (11:14):  If that is the case, then why this bill? You need to actually explain to me, because my understanding is that, at the moment, multinationals who don't get a tender cannot actually go for a review in the judicial system.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,3,2
"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2018-10-18,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for International Development and the Pacific) (11:14):  The primary legislation gives Australian businesses access to trade agreements overseas and, similarly, international companies will have reciprocal access to trade agreements into Australia. 

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,3,2
"Hanson, Sen Pauline",PHON,2018-10-18,"



Senator HANSON
 (Queensland) (11:15):  Minister, you know that is not the question I have asked. I have asked you directly: if multinationals do not get a tender, can they challenge that in our court system at the moment?

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,3,2
"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2018-10-18,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for International Development and the Pacific) (11:15):  My understanding is that, under the current system, any company has recourse to challenge under the Australian court system. However, what this bill seeks to do is provide greater protections and greater assistance to small businesses to make sure that they have the kind of access and remedy that would be appropriate. 

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,3,2
"Hanson, Sen Pauline",PHON,2018-10-18,"



Senator HANSON
 (Queensland) (11:16):  Then I'd like you to answer the question. If you have a local government, a state government or even a federal government that offers a tender in which only Australian companies or Australian workers are wanted to fill those jobs, can a multinational company challenge that tender under your new bill, which you want to pass here? Can they challenge that in the court system, because they are not an Australian company? 

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,3,2
"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2018-10-18,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for International Development and the Pacific) (11:16):  I'm advised that under these rules you cannot overturn a contract once it has been let. So the answer is no. 

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,3,2
"Hanson, Sen Pauline",PHON,2018-10-18,"



Senator HANSON
 (Queensland) (11:16):  So you're saying that a contract can't be overturned. What I'm saying is: if a local, state or federal government says, 'We want only Australian companies to provide the services to us; we want to do those jobs with Australian workers,' can multinationals challenge that? If they put in a tender, can they then challenge governments by saying: 'We have been discriminated against. We have been unfairly treated. We are now going to challenge you under this new legislation in the judicial court system'? At the moment, I understand they can't. 

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,3,2
"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2018-10-18,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for International Development and the Pacific) (11:17):  Senator, my understanding is that, as it currently stands, any company can challenge that decision. What this legislation seeks to do is change the process by which that can occur to provide greater protections for small businesses. So the answer to your question is, yes, it can occur. It currently can occur. 

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,3,2
"Hanson, Sen Pauline",PHON,2018-10-18,"



Senator HANSON
 (Queensland) (11:18):  In other words, under the process whereby they're protected at the moment, you're going to allow them an avenue to take it to the judicial system and so the judicial system can actually override it. If they override it, can the judicial system then require compensation to be paid? 

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,3,2
"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2018-10-18,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for International Development and the Pacific) (11:18):  I'll try and see if I can be clear in my answer, because I think maybe we're a bit at cross-purposes. There is a system in place which allows a certain recourse from any company, no matter who they are, within our court system in relation to a pre-contract letting situation. Nothing changes in terms of once a contract has been let; it is not able to be challenged. What we're seeking to do by this legislation is increase the level of protection, particularly around small businesses, so that in the situation where they may be seeking remedy because they believe that they've been wronged or where they're challenging the decision pre the letting of the contract, they will have access to do that in such a way that probably gives greater advantage to them. This bill does not seek to actually change what you're talking about. You're talking about the legal rights of businesses within the contractual system that operates within Australia and around the world. That is not what this bill is seeking to change. 

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,3,2
"Hanson, Sen Pauline",PHON,2018-10-18,"



Senator HANSON
 (Queensland) (11:19):  But what you're saying is that this will open it up under the TPP, because this is enabling legislation for the TPP. Therefore, it is going to allow multinationals to challenge it in the court system. You're going to open up the court system now to multinationals to challenge it and, possibly, even challenge for compensation to be paid for by the taxpayers.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,3,2
"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2018-10-18,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for International Development and the Pacific) (11:20):  The very basis of a trade arrangement that you enter into with another country is to enhance the economic benefit to both of the countries by allowing freer access to the other country's economy to trade with it. Equally, Australian companies will be afforded the same access and the same privilege in the countries that we are seeking to trade with. Overall, obviously, the Australian government is of the view that we've seen such extraordinary success for the farmers, whom I know you're very much supporting, as am I, from the trading agreements that we've put in place and the benefits that are delivered from that. The government has made a clear assessment, through a series of appropriate tools and modelling, that the benefit to Australia of these free trade agreements and everything that goes with them is in the national interest. So, in anything that you're prosecuting, if you suggest that there is any change on this side of the equation within Australia, the benefits are delivered to our businesses who are seeking to trade and send our goods to their countries.


Australia is an exporting nation. We're not ever going to get rich selling to ourselves. It is tremendously important that governments put in place the market mechanisms by which we can enable our farmers and our businesses to trade with the rest of the world. Part of that arrangement is allowing our friendly partners to have access to our marketplace to provide the goods and services that the Australian public often demands. I don't mean to sit here giving you a lecture on free trade. Obviously, you've got your opinion, but the fact of the matter is that the Australian government believes that these free trade arrangements are in the best interests of Australian producers, Australian businesses and the Australian public.

"Hanson-Young, Sen Sarah",AG,2018-10-18,"



Senator HANSON-YOUNG
 (South Australia) (11:22):  I've just got a couple of questions to the minister. I've just heard the minister speak about the need for these trade arrangements because they are in the best interests of Australian business. I'd just like to ask, while we've got the minister and some advisers here, whether it is in the best interests of Australia's trade for Australia to be moving our embassy in Israel to Jerusalem and whether there have been any concerns raised directly with the government, as reported, from countries in our region, like Indonesia and Malaysia, in relation to the impact on our trading arrangements because of this decision to move Australia's embassy to Jerusalem. I've asked the question of the minister and I would like an answer.




The TEMPORARY CHAIR 

(
Senator Sterle
):  I will give the minister an opportunity. Minister? Are there any further questions?

"Patrick, Sen Rex",CA,2018-10-18,"



Senator PATRICK
 (South Australia) (11:23):  Just directly in relation to the bill that we're dealing with, the jurisdiction in which you would raise an application in this instance would be the Federal Circuit Court. The Federal Circuit Court is, in actual fact, having some difficulties, certainly in terms of family law matters and migration matters in the general division. Has the government looked at the resourcing that might be required in respect of this legislation? Are you anticipating that additional resources will be required in the Federal Circuit Court?

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,3,2
"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2018-10-18,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for International Development and the Pacific) (11:24):  I'm advised that the Federal Circuit Court has been given additional resources specifically for this. 

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,3,2
"Hanson-Young, Sen Sarah",AG,2018-10-18,"



Senator HANSON-YOUNG
 (South Australia) (11:24):  Chair, I just want to go back to my line of questioning. I'd like to know whether the minister is refusing to answer the question or whether she just does not know. I've asked a question about whether trading concerns have been raised with Australia, with the government or with any officials from Indonesia or Malaysia, as reported.



The TEMPORARY CHAIR:  Minister?

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,3,2
"Hanson-Young, Sen Sarah",AG,2018-10-18,"



Senator HANSON-YOUNG
 (South Australia) (11:24):  It's obvious that the minister is refusing to answer the question. We have the ambassador for Israel in Barnaby Joyce's office right now. That's what's been reported. The ambassador for Israel is in Barnaby Joyce's office. Is that because there are concerns about the impact of our trading relationships with countries that are opposed to moving our embassy to Jerusalem, or is it that Mr Joyce is actually getting the support outside this parliament—




Senator Hanson:
  A point of order: the question from Senator Hanson-Young has got nothing to do with the amendment before this chamber. It's got nothing to do with whether the embassy is going to Jerusalem or not. That is not what is before this chamber. With limited time, I suggest we go back to the bill before us and ask questions on that.



The TEMPORARY CHAIR:  There is no point of order. 




Senator HANSON-YOUNG:
  Could the minister please explain what the ambassador for Israel is doing in Mr Joyce's office? Is it because he's soon to become the Deputy PM?



The TEMPORARY CHAIR:  Senator Hanson-Young, I will make a ruling there: that is not relevant to the amendment in front of the Senate at the moment. I give the call to Senator Patrick.

 (South Australia) (11:26):  Minister, thank you for your last answer in relation to the courts. Could you provide, perhaps on notice, details of the additional resources that have been allocated?

Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for International Development and the Pacific) (11:26):  I'm advised that $2.9 million has been made available in additional funding.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,3,2
"Patrick, Sen Rex",CA,2018-10-18,"



Senator PATRICK
 (South Australia) (11:26):  I will point out that I'm disturbed about the previous answer, where you talked about the five companies, with one company being dragged into the courts and the other four ending up being affected. I think that's something the government ought to consider very carefully, because a lot of those companies will be small businesses unable to bear the cost of simply running project teams on for lengthy periods while a court matter is dealt with. 


I want to go to the intersection between the judicial review of a procurement and its interaction with ISDS. I note that ISDS provisions are only available to foreign companies here in Australia, as Assistant Minister Reynolds told me yesterday. If an international company makes an application under this bill and it is litigated, and they are unsuccessful, does that waive their right to then raise an ISDS claim against the government that might be closely related to the matter that has been determined in the court? 

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,3,2
"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2018-10-18,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for International Development and the Pacific) (11:29):  I've been advised that, for the ISDS provisions to be invoked, the procurement needs to be considered to be an investment, and the majority of procurements would not be seen to be an investment. And the investments are those investments that are covered and specified within the treaty. So your issue in terms of the waiving of the right to access ISDS is perhaps not relevant in this case. 

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,3,2
"Patrick, Sen Rex",CA,2018-10-18,"



Senator PATRICK
 (South Australia) (11:29):  In legalese: it's not so much a waiving but it might not give rise to an action in ISDS as opposed to waiving any particular right. It's unlikely that there would be circumstances that would give rise to an application.

"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2018-10-18,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for International Development and the Pacific) (11:30):  Senator, unless I'm misunderstanding your question, I think we might be talking about two different things. The action we're talking about in terms of a procurement damage could probably not occur under the investment. A capital procurement has a different set of remedies than an investment under the ISDS provisions. Am I misunderstanding what you're asking me?

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,3,2
"Patrick, Sen Rex",CA,2018-10-18,"



Senator PATRICK
 (South Australia) (11:31):  I think you might have actually answered my question. If I understand you correctly, they can perhaps litigate a procurement matter under this bill. It's unlikely that they would be able to litigate a similar action under ISDS because the ISDS doesn't generally cover procurements. Is that correct?

Senator FARRELL
 (South Australia—Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (11:31):  I wish to put the Labor Party's position in respect of this amendment on the record. As the Customs Amendment (Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership Implementation) Bill has passed, the amendment outlined on sheet 8521, which is an attempt to delay the implementation of this bill, is mostly redundant. Changing the date from the proclamation to the same time as the other bill receives royal assent will create uncertainty for businesses. Labor will not support this.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,3,2
"Di Natale, Sen Richard",AG,2018-10-18,"



Senator DI NATALE
 (Victoria—Leader of the Australian Greens) (11:32):  I would like to put on the record the Australian Greens position on this amendment. We will support the amendment. However, our position on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Lower Taxes for Small and Medium Businesses) Bill, which has been made clear by my colleague Senator Sarah Hanson-Young, is that is we won't support this legislation because it is, again, a further measure to implement an unfair trade deal that hands over far too much power to large corporations and removes power from governments to protect the environment and public health.


I also want to take this opportunity to put on the record that we are now 10 minutes away from the guillotine being adopted without any opportunity to debate a further bill that would rip $3 billion out of essential public services and give a huge tax cut to business. We didn't have the opportunity to even give a second reading speech to put our objections formally on the record because the Liberal Party, with the support of the Labor Party, have prevented us from doing that in a remarkable act, an attack on democracy in this chamber. You do not have the guts or the decency to allow the crossbench to articulate our opposition and, indeed, to interrogate a bill that would hand over $3 billion to businesses.


Let's keep this very, very simple. We talk about the opportunity cost of a spending decision, which is the lost opportunity to do something with the money you're spending and how much that's worth. Let's actually talk about the opportunity cost of the legislation that we're being prevented from debating. Here's what this bill, which you won't allow us to debate in this chamber and are seeking to ram through without any scrutiny, does. It brings forward a tax cut worth $3 billion over the forward estimates. But here's what it doesn't do. Earlier this month, we got news from the IPCC that we're on track to lose 90 per cent of all coral reefs on the planet in the next 20 years. People come from all around the world to see the Great Barrier Reef, because you can't see anything like it anywhere else. It's worth billions to the economy. It's worth over 60,000 jobs a year, and it could be dead, could be gone, in 20 years.


What does the Great Barrier Reef get out of a tax cut? Absolutely nothing. Nine in 10 public schools are on track to never get the funding they need in order to educate students from right across the country, many of them from disadvantaged backgrounds, living with a disability or living in remote and regional communities. Those students won't get the bare minimum of funding they need; nine out of 10 of them will not get the minimum standard that we've agreed. No school ever got funded out of a tax cut. We've got 100,000 people in Australia, including 18,000 kids, who are homeless. No homeless shelter was ever built out of a tax cut. At least five women have been killed by their current or former partners since the beginning of the month. According to White Ribbon, one woman is killed by her current or former partner on average every week in Australia. Let's not beat around the bush. This is as much an economic issue as it is one of justice. Women, particularly younger women with kids, who don't have anything in savings, who aren't working or who are relying on income from an abusive partner, are being let down by economic inequality. They're crying out for our support, they're being killed every week, they're asking for help, and what are we doing? We're giving $3 billion in tax cuts. You don't open family crisis shelters with a tax cut.


Indigenous children today are twice as likely to die before their fourth birthday than non-Indigenous children. Indigenous men make up less than two per cent of the overall population and 25 per cent of the prison population. It's a national disgrace. It's an indictment on this place. It should embarrass everybody. It should shake us into action. Yet we're missing four out of our seven Closing the Gap targets. Do we think they're going to be met with this tax cut? Or do we think it's going to be harder to close the gap because of this tax cut? Well, we know the answer to that question. That's just a fraction of the opportunity cost involved in handing over this tax cut. It's not just the budget cost of bringing forward a tax reduction. It's the human cost of what we're forced to do and the things we can't afford to pay for, to invest in, because of the decision of this chamber, and you don't have the guts to ensure that it gets the scrutiny it deserves.


We are one of the wealthiest countries in the world. We are at the wealthiest point in human history. We've got the resources and the means to guarantee that all Australians get an opportunity to lead a rich and fulfilling life. Instead of doing that, you're here facilitating the passage of legislation to hand over more power to corporations—to take the power from governments to ensure that they can protect their citizens and protect their environment. And you're now, without debate, about to give $3 billion to companies who don't need it. A company with a turnover of $50 million is not a small business.


This is a massive transfer of wealth. At a time when economic inequality in this country is getting worse, at a time when our environment has never been more precarious, here we are with the Liberal Party and the Labor Party joining together to continue with this crap that we've been fed for more than three decades. Trickle-down economics doesn't work. Invest in people. What's good for big business isn't automatically good for people. You've presided over an economic system where big companies write their own policies. We've got the business industry writing this tax policy for you. We've got the coal industry writing energy policy. We've got media companies writing our media laws. And here we are with the duopoly, Liberal and Labor, joining together to prevent any debate so that the Australian community can understand what is being done in their name. The foundations of a decent society are not built through this war, this escalation, this auction on tax cuts—my tax cut is bigger than your tax cut; billions of dollars handed over to companies that don't need it.


There are so many other things that we can do for small business. There's the instant asset write-off. Again, the Greens led the charge on that, but we don't believe that taking revenue away from Newstart, from our schools and from our hospitals is the pathway to a more decent or, indeed, a more prosperous society. We're a party that believes in the public good. We believe in public ownership. We believe in investing in our essential services which are the foundations of a decent society. We believe in protecting the environment—clean air, clean water, clean energy and clean politics. And, today, what we're seeing is dirty politics, with the duopoly ganging up again, preventing meaningful debate on an issue that the Australian community have a right to hear about.


So let me just say in closing that we oppose the Trans-Pacific Partnership and we're appalled that the Labor Party would back in a Liberal Party that wants to do the bidding of its big corporate mates. We oppose these huge tax cuts that are going to businesses that don't need them, that are going to big businesses with a turnover of $50 million. What we support is investing that money in our schools, in our hospitals, in ensuring that people don't need to live beneath the poverty line, in supporting women who are living through domestic violence at the hands of an abusive partner and in ensuring that people who are sleeping rough can get a roof over their heads. It's not the government or the budget that are paying for this tax cut; it's those people who are being left behind who are paying for this tax cut.

Senator HANSON
 (Queensland) (11:41):  I just want to put on the record that One Nation will not be supporting the Government Procurement (Judicial Review) Bill 2017. The fact is that it is enabling the TPP-11 trade agreement, which we do oppose. The fact is that I have grave concerns that, with this change, it can be challenged in the court system by multinationals. I don't believe it's in the best interest of Australian businesses. There is talk about trade deals and that we've got the same arrangement overseas. I then challenge them to answer why the New Zealand Prime Minister had a side letter to omit the ISDS clause with some countries. 


There's nothing here with the other bill. I'm sorry to say that it didn't happen in this chamber that we had the opportunity to talk on the taxation bill, the Treasury Laws Amendment (Lower Taxes for Small and Medium Businesses) Bill. It was One Nation that negotiated with the government and the crossbenchers to get it up from a $10 million turnover to a $50 million turnover, which we supported. The Labor Party have backflipped on this and this is why they don't want the debate in the chamber. It's because the Labor Party only wanted it at a $2 million turnover. They were not supporting small or medium-sized businesses at all. So it is a flip-flop. It is a backflip by the Labor Party. They accuse me of flip-flopping. I'll tell you what—this is the biggest flip-flop from the Labor Party on taxation.


As I said at the time when we supported it, I question why it was so far down the track. If it's such a good deal for small and medium-sized businesses, why is it taking so long to actually introduce the bill? So I'm pleased to see that it is being introduced. I would personally have liked to see some help in the payroll tax of all the states to increase the threshold. I believe that would have created more employment than the corporate tax cuts. I had a meeting and a discussion with international CEOs of big companies, huge companies, from around the world. They said they weren't interested in corporate tax cuts. They were more interested in dealing with industrial relations, plus also payroll tax, which is more important to them and would have created more employment than this corporate tax cut. So it's a shame that it couldn't be debated at all.


Also, under this bill, I don't believe that you, the government, are addressing the multinationals that are not paying their taxes in this country. We have over 700 companies in Australia that are not paying their taxes here. You've opened up the TPP agreement now, so we're going to see more companies here in Australia. You're encouraging them to come and invest here, but you are not fighting for them to pay their taxes in Australia. I believe that is a crying shame.

(1) Clause 4, page 3 (after line 14), after the definition of accountable authority, insert:



Agreement means the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans‑Pacific Partnership, done at Santiago, Chile on 8 March 2018, as amended and in force for Australia from time to time.


Note 1: The Agreement could in 2018 be viewed in the Australian Treaties Library on the AustLII website (http://www.austlii.edu.au).


Note 2: Under Article 1 of the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans‑Pacific Partnership (the Santiago Agreement), most of the provisions of the Trans‑Pacific Partnership Agreement (the Auckland Agreement), done at Auckland on 4 February 2016, are incorporated, by reference, into and made part of the Santiago Agreement. This means, for example, that Chapters 1 and 3 of the Auckland Agreement are, because of that Article, Chapters 1 and 3 of the Santiago Agreement.

"Urquhart, Sen Anne",ALP,2018-10-18,"



Senator URQUHART
 (Tasmania—Opposition Whip in the Senate) (11:58):  The opposition has asked that several of these bills be referred to a committee for inquiry. I want to outline to the Senate some of the reasons behind these referrals.


The first bills that the Labor Party has asked to be referred to the committee for inquiry are the Higher Education Support (Charges) Bill 2018 and the Higher Education Support Amendment (Cost Recovery) Bill 2018. Since the Liberals have come to office they've only had one plan for higher education: cuts and making students pay more, sooner. While Labor is cautiously supportive of this legislation, we want to refer it to an inquiry to make sure the policy settings are right and fair for universities as well as for students. This bill would charge higher education providers, including Australia's 39 public universities, to access Australia's world-class student loan scheme—HELP, the Higher Education Loan Program. This was never the intention of the original income-contingent loan scheme, HECS, and appears to be part of the government's attempts to find savings in the higher education portfolio. The related bill, the Higher Education Support Amendment (Cost Recovery) Bill 2018, introduces a small charge to higher education providers who apply to access the FEE HELP scheme for their students. 


While the changes in both bills look relatively benign, Labor have some concerns that we want the Senate Education and Employment Legislation Committee to examine. Importantly, we don't want new charges to become excessive; nor do we want to see charges flow on to students. Australian students already pay the sixth-highest university fees in the OECD, and in the last year the government introduced more punitive changes to the repayment threshold of HELP, forcing students to pay back loans when they're earning $45,000—only $9,000 more than the minimum wage. Because of the Liberals' cuts, universities are under huge pressure. The 2017 MYEFO decision to re-cap undergraduate places is going to hit universities particularly hard in 2019, and we'll see thousands of Australians miss out on a university place. As many as 235,000 could miss out by 2031, according to the Mitchell Institute. I move the amendment, as circulated in the chamber, in the name of Senator Collins:


At the end of the motion, add


""but, in respect of the provisions of the Treasury Laws Amendment (Making Sure Multinationals Pay Their Fair Share of Tax in Australia and Other Measures) Bill 2018, the Economics Legislation Committee report by 3 December 2018"".

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2018-10-18,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (12:01):  I move an amendment to the amendment moved by Senator Collins, as circulated in my name in the chamber, which relates to the referral of the Copyright Amendment (Online Infringement) Bill 2018 to the Senate Environment and Communications Legislation Committee for report by 7 November 2018. 


At the end of the amendment add 


""and, in respect of the provisions of the Copyright Amendment (Online Infringement) Bill 2018, the Environment and Communications Legislation Committee report by 7 November 2018"".


To be clear, we are happy for this to be done on the papers. We know it's a tight turnaround. The next chance to consider the bill is the week beginning 12 November, so it won't delay the passage of the bill—and, if the committee is so minded, we're prepared for it to be done on the pages.

Senator CHISHOLM:
  Fifty years ago, Australian Peter Norman won silver in the 200 metres at the 1968 Olympics in Mexico City. In the half-century since, no Australian has run faster. His time of 20.06 seconds is still our national record. At the medal ceremony, African American runners Tommie Smith, gold, and John Carlos, bronze, told Norman they planned to bow their heads and put their fists in the air in support of human rights. He stood with them in a moment that was to become iconic in the human rights movement and in sporting history. Peter Norman died in 2006. Today his actions symbolise the opportunities we have for a Peter Norman moment in our lives and still set a great example to those of us who can take a stand against racism and inequality.

Senator McALLISTER
 (New South Wales—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (12:51):  Labor will support the Treasury Laws Amendment (Gift Cards) Bill 2018. This bill seeks to enfranchise gift card recipients who have been adversely affected by a previously disjointed, state-by-state approach to Australian gift card regulation. In Australia, 34 million gift cards are estimated to be sold each year by national retailers and small businesses, with an estimated value of $2.5 billion. One of the commonly used terms and conditions of gift cards are expiry dates. Many consumers' gift cards expire before they get the chance to use them, resulting in financial loss and disappointment for gift card recipients. Currently, the length of an expiry date on a gift card may vary considerably depending on the preferences of the trader. Losses from Australian gift card expiry are estimated to be $70 million annually.


This bill implements a minimum three-year expiry period for Australian gift cards, improving fairness for consumers and ensuring that they have an appropriate period of time to redeem the balance of a gift card, leading to a reduction in breakage. There is no prohibition on providing a longer expiry period. In addition, this bill includes increased disclosure requirements, including expiry information being prominently displayed on the card to ensure that consumers are aware of the expiry date of the card. This is largely consistent with industry practice and a majority of gift cards already display this information.


This bill will prohibit gift card suppliers from charging certain post-supply fees which can erode the balance on a gift card over time and operate as a de facto expiry date. This bill also voids existing terms and conditions on cards already in supply if they breach the above changes. The proposed three-year minimum expiry period does not change consumers' rights in the event that the supplier of the gift card becomes insolvent or bankrupt. They will continue to be treated as unsecured creditors.


Labor is pleased that the government has finally brought forward new legislation in the consumer affairs space. This government, with its sixth minister responsible for consumer affairs in five years, has let consumers down by deferring the Legislative and Governance Forum on Consumer Affairs, which was scheduled for August, due to leadership woes. Though Labor is pleased with the introduction of this bill, it is mind-boggling that it had to be approved by a circular resolution instead of at the cancelled national COAG consumer affairs forum. This is a government that is far more interested in its own party than in Australian consumers.

Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for International Development and the Pacific) (12:54):  Firstly, I would like to thank those senators who have contributed to this debate. The Treasury Laws Amendment (Gift Cards) Bill 2018 introduces reforms to ensure a nationally consistent and uniform regime for gift cards in Australia. It introduces a minimum three-year expiry period, requires expiry date information to be disclosed prominently on the card and bans the charging of post-supply fees.


The reforms put to the parliament will provide consumers with greater confidence and make gift cards fairer for all consumers. Well-informed and confident consumers are essential to the functioning of an efficient economy. However, many consumers experience loss and disappointment from expired gift cards due to the wideranging variations in terms and conditions. This makes it difficult for consumers to understand their rights and obligations. It's equally important that businesses are supported in meeting their obligations and do not face an unnecessary compliance burden in complying with differing laws. The implementation of nationally consistent gift card reforms will provide greater clarity for Australian businesses. New South Wales and South Australia have moved to address the detriment consumers experience from expired gift cards with reforms to introduce a minimum three-year expiry period for gift cards sold in the respective states. Still, there is currently no uniform regulation for minimum expiry periods and post-supply fees, with different rules applying across jurisdictions. The inconsistencies have created uncertainty for consumers and a regulatory burden for businesses.


This bill proposes a three-year minimum expiry period nationally, balancing consumer rights and business compliance. The reforms will also require the expiry date information to be prominently displayed on the card. Enhanced disclosure of the expiry date on gift cards will ensure consumers are able to make informed purchasing decisions by having clear access to expiry date information at the time it is needed and on the card itself. The disclosure requirements in this bill provide clarity for consumers while providing businesses the needed flexibility in the way the date is displayed. Further, under the national regime, the charging of post-supply fees, such as inactivity and balance checking fees, will be prohibited. Consumers will have the full benefit of the gift cards they receive.


To ensure flexibility and provide support to industry, a regulation-making power is contained in the bill, allowing for certain gift cards, persons and gift cards supplied in particular circumstances to be exempt from all or some of the requirements imposed by this reform. This will allow the law to adapt to changes in technology and business activities to ensure that essential activities involving gift cards are not unnecessarily curtailed to the detriment of businesses and consumers. The government is comprehensively considering feedback from stakeholders on the nature and scope of the exemptions and post-supply fees to ensure that the business's gift card activities are not curtailed.


It is an offence to contravene the reforms contained in the bill. This will act as a strong deterrent against misconduct that can have serious detriment for consumers, thereby enhancing the integrity of the regulatory regime. The penalties that can be imposed for contravening the reforms are consistent with similar consumer protections in the Australian Consumer Law. Compliance with these reforms will be monitored and enforced by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. The government has consulted widely on the reforms. Consumers and businesses support this reform as it improves consumer outcomes, provides consistency and is workable for businesses.


The states and territories have also shown their support for a national regime. In August this year, Commonwealth, state and territory consumer affairs ministers formally agreed to amend the Australian Consumer Law as required under the Intergovernmental Agreement for the Australian Consumer Law. The reforms will take effect on 1 November 2019, after providing industry around a 12-month transitional period to adapt to the new regime. This will ensure that these important protections for consumers are in place for the 2019 Christmas period. I commend the bill to the Senate.

Senator McALLISTER
 (New South Wales—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (15:00):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Finance and the Public Service (Senator Cormann) to a question without notice asked by Senator McAllister today relating to the Morrison Government.


As a longstanding friend of the creative industries, I'm quite worried. I think we may need to offer some sort of industry support package to the political satirists, because this government seems determined to drive them out of business by satirising itself. Prime Minister Morrison has come out and said that a vote for the Liberals is a vote for stability. He said this at the very same time—I kid you not—as his junior coalition partners, The Nationals, are plotting another leadership coup about three weeks after their last one. You can't make this stuff up. It's putting a lot of pressure on The Chaser, let me tell you. 'A vote for stability' is a pretty bold claim for a Prime Minister to make. We recall the last Prime Minister who promised stability. I don't know if you remember, but that other fellow, Mr Turnbull, the last Prime Minister, stood under a huge sign the size of a cinema screen before the last election with a big quote that said 'stable government' and he held his hands up like so. What did we get? It wasn't stable and it wasn't government. It turned out that their only plan for jobs and growth was a corporate tax cut, and they dumped that earlier this month. What about energy? We went through five separate energy policies before they settled on their current energy policy, which is basically absolutely nothing. To top it off, they changed Prime Minister after months of instability and a botched leadership coup by the Minister for Home Affairs, aided and abetted by Senator Cormann.


Given that history it is outrageously audacious for Prime Minister Morrison to claim a vote for the Liberals is a vote for stability. He is very new. We could give him the benefit of the doubt. Perhaps government under Prime Minister Morrison has been more stable. Let's have a look at what they've achieved this week: they've backflipped on their GST policy; they've upended 70 years of bipartisan foreign policy and risked one of Australia's key strategic economic relationships, our trade relationship with Indonesia; and they've supported a white supremacist slogan in the parliament. That was a mistake, if you believe Minister Cormann, but then they embarrassingly had to back down—and that backdown was a mistake, if you believe Mr Luke Howarth. Apparently that is what stability looks like under this government. Is it stability to appoint your scandal-prone numbers man as Assistant Treasurer, who then, surprisingly—who knew?—is embroiled within an expenses scandal? Is it stability for your environment minister pick a fight with a Nobel Peace Prize nominee in a crowded restaurant? I don't know. Maybe it's stability to spend weeks talking about bullying and harassment of women in your own party ranks—something of an achievement, because women in your organisation are fairly thin on the ground.


Where are we now? At the same time as the Prime Minister is promising a vote for stability, the National Party are plotting to install as Deputy Prime Minister a man whose most recent contribution was to resign after a very public drawn-out scandal. What do all of these things—the vote for a white supremacist slogan, the scandals, the 'maybe it's a decision; maybe it's not' half-decision to move the embassy—have in common?


They all derive from a government that is completely absorbed in itself and in its own internal divisions. They stem from a party room that is utterly unable to agree on the most basic of questions about the desired national direction for our country. They stem from a group of people who, intellectually, can't come to terms with Australia as it is now, let alone the Australia of the future. They're unable to put a plan together to respond to what's coming. They're unable to respond to the science of climate change. They're unable to respond to a changing global economy. They're unable to respond to the demand for greater equality for women and more women in public life. They are unable to respond to change.


This is a government that is completely absorbed in its own conflict, because, between them, they cannot agree on how to deal with the world as it is. It is not leading to stability; it is leading to chaos. It is leading to a paralysed government making ad hoc decisions that, in fact, endanger our national interest. There is no positive vision. They are extremely divided. Wentworth deserves better and so does Australia.

"Williams, Sen John",Nats,2018-10-18,"



Senator WILLIAMS
 (New South Wales—Nationals Whip in the Senate) (15:05):  I think this is just a great topic to discuss. Let's talk about stability. Now, Senator McAllister is a fine young lady and I'm sure her memory is very good, but I need to refresh her memory. In 2007 we had a Prime Minister called Kevin Rudd, as Senator McAllister might remember. Do you remember Prime Minister Rudd, Senator McAllister? Sorry, I'll direct my remarks through the chair. He was done over ruthlessly by a lady called Julia Gillard. Remember former Senator Mark Arbib? He was involved in a stoush. Senator Farrell? He was involved in a stoush as they went through the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd fiasco days of trying to save the furniture et cetera. And here, those opposite lecture us on stability. I find it quite amazing.


We know there are a lot of ambitions in this place—people with big egos, people who want to be on the front bench. I've said before that Senator Keneally is not used to sitting up the back of the bus. She was the Premier of New South Wales and she wants to be at the front of the bus. In fact, she wants to drive the bus—no doubt about that. And now we've got Senator Watt starting to flex his muscles because he's been promoted from the back bench to the whip after a very successful political career in state politics where he lost his seat, a safe seat! What a great legacy that is!


Stability? Let's talk about stability. How stable was the Labor Party just this week when we discussed the TPP legislation? Was that stability? No, they were divided. They were forced to support it by the hierarchy, no doubt, and many opposed it. But, of course, in the typical dictatorship of the Labor Party, you do as you are told. You're not free to cross the floor like we in the National Party and the Liberal Party are, where we actually have democracy. When there's something that we're passionate about, we can express that passion on this floor, as I did with the banking royal commission. At the time when the Greens moved a motion calling for a banking royal commission, I crossed the floor and voted with the Greens. Where was Labor? You were over there opposing the royal commission, just like when we brought down a report from the Economics Committee recommending a royal commission under that very good former Labor senator from Western Australia, Mark Bishop. Where was Labor? It was opposing the royal commission. Finally you came round. I appreciate that very much and I thank you, and what is coming out of the royal commission is quite amazing.


But, of course, we're talking about leadership. There's a bloke called Mr Anthony Albanese. He wants to drive the bus as well, I can tell you. Even the Labor Party members who voted said, 'We want Albo driving the bus.' That is the message they sent. Mr Albanese is sitting there waiting to pounce. You can see that the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd thing will happen again, as sure as I speak here now.


Now, I want to talk about the National Party leadership. I find all this talk in the media about a challenge to the Nationals leader, Mr Michael McCormack, the Deputy Prime Minister, quite amazing. As I said to John Stanley on Sydney radio today, I have not had one call or one visit from a colleague in the National Party saying to me, 'There's going to be a spill. Who are you going to vote for?'—not one.




Senator O'Neill:
  Yet.




Senator WILLIAMS:
  Senator O'Neill says 'yet'. But hang on, the spill's coming next week, according to some—next Tuesday or something. That's amazing—we're learning all the time—when we in the National Party have heard nothing, nothing at all. In fact, I've just heard that the member for New England, Barnaby Joyce, has publicly indicated he will not challenge for the leadership of the Nationals. That defuses it straightaway. 




Senator O'Neill:
  Like Mr Morrison the day before he became PM.




Senator WILLIAMS:
  When you lot got together to dispose of Kevin Rudd to put in Julia Gillard, you'd have been getting calls—




Senator O'Neill:
  He put his arm around him one day and knifed him the next day.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order!




Senator WILLIAMS:
  Have you finished, Senator O'Neill?



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order! Please continue, Senator Williams.




Senator WILLIAMS:
  I would like to, if I could, without these terrible, rude interjections from Senator O'Neill, Madam Deputy President.




Senator O'Neill:
  I just want to know: have you finished changing leaders yet?




Senator WILLIAMS:
  There's no leadership challenge. I would be game enough to say I'll bet you there'll be no leadership challenge next week. 




Senator Jacinta Collins:
  How much?




Senator WILLIAMS:
  I'll bet you.

Senator O'NEILL
 (New South Wales) (15:11):  During the speech that I want to make in taking note of answers given by the government today, you need to be playing, in your head, the soundtrack for The Muppet Show—the one with the little brass band sounding away, where it ends on a discordant note. Well, that's the soundtrack for this government. I used to watch The Muppet Show,and you'd only get one instalment a week. But this government is overdelivering; we're getting episodes every single day! So have the Muppet Show track playing in your head while this government is wreaking havoc, is causing chaos and is absolutely not being at all stable. We've got Prime Minister Morrison out there saying: 'Vote for Dave Sharma. Send another Liberal down here so we can continue stable government.' Let's have a look at what 'stable government' actually looked like this week. 


On Tuesday, just five days before the by-election in the seat of Wentworth, which has a very large Jewish population, we had the Prime Minister say that he is going to consider up-ending 70 years of bipartisan agreement about Jerusalem. Would you believe that that is a stable government in action? It certainly didn't look really stable when we started hearing about the flurry of calls, particularly from our nearest neighbour, with a huge population, expressing considerable concern about this—the government's latest play for a few votes in Wentworth, which is supposed to be one of its safest seats. And why is it not one of their safest seats anymore? It's because they have abused the opportunity of government; they have played games with the Australian people, with our economy and our foreign policy; and they sacrificed their own Prime Minister, who was the member for that seat of Wentworth. They've caused the chaos. In the midst of that chaos, the report at the moment is that the government has spent $1.2 million stuffing the letterboxes of Wentworth with a whole lot of information, because this stable government, as it tells us it is, is fighting for its life in Wentworth. Electing Dave Sharma to send him to Canberra is not going to fix what's wrong with this government—anyone but Dave Sharma, and, preferably, our great Labor candidate, Tim Murray. He'd make a much better contribution, and I know that he'd be bringing stability in foreign policy as part of the Labor Party's conversation. 


In addition to the chaos that we've seen this week, where the government have decided to play out whether they'll support foreign policy in the national interest or act in their own personal interest, we've seen that battle land on the side of the Liberal Party, against Australia's national interest. 


We've also had the backflip on the GST. The GST is a pretty important policy for Australia. We've had a series of declarations from this government in the negotiations with the states—so the scale of this is quite significant—saying there would be no top-ups. Labor said that Western Australia needed its fair share of funding. We had Minister Morrison, now PM, say, 'Top-ups should not be a thing,' and suddenly this week he decided to change his mind. This is the kind of instability and uncertainty that our nation is faced with.


They've changed leaders. We had Abbott. We had Turnbull. We've got Morrison. With Morrison we are seeing this massive shift and uncertainty every single day. This is not a stable government. We made a commitment. When Labor said that the commitment to ensure that no state is worse off should be enshrined in law, around our GST, the Liberal Party just laughed at it. They said that there was no way that that should be agreed to and that they wouldn't even consider it until 2026.



What has happened this week is a situation that Labor welcomes, because we have had five years of stable leadership under Bill Shorten. We've been working hard on policies for the benefit of this nation. We remain committed to the international rule of law and stable foreign policy that is in our national interest and upholds our responsibility as a good international citizen. We would never play with the Jewish vote in Wentworth, as this Prime Minister and his team have currently undertaken in the seat of Wentworth for Saturday. The people of Wentworth should not reward this unstable government. Sending Dave Sharma will not fix it— (Time expired)

"Gichuhi, Sen Lucy",LP,2018-10-18,"



Senator GICHUHI
 (South Australia) (15:16):  Thank you, Senator O'Neill, for reminding us about all the things that can go wrong with a government. I wonder when we are going to come to this Senate and listen to policy and policy matters and for once hear, whether Labor or Liberal, government telling us what is good in this country. When I hear words like 'instability', all I know is that, clearly, in Australia we have never seen an unstable government. This happens in other parts of the world and we know that. We should stop for a moment and consider what good is happening with this government, our government. The Morrison government is on your side—you the Australian—because of the values and the beliefs we share with Australians.


Today in question time we heard all these questions about the Middle East and about the National Party leadership. Clearly, every mum and dad out there on the streets isn't interested in those kinds of things. What they want to know is that the Morrison government, our government, is focused on making the economy stronger. Whether they're in New South Wales, where Wentworth is, whether they're in Tasmania or whether they're in my home state of South Australia, what every Australian wants to know is: 'Am I safe? Do I have a job if I need one? Is my business going to pay more or less tax?'


I look forward to the time that we make good use of our question time and talk about what the government, our government, is doing. This week we have seen the legislation of the small and family business tax cut. That has come forward five years early. This is what we need to be talking about. Nobody needs to be scared. We don't need to scare Australians. We don't need to instil fear that doesn't exist. Everybody wants to wake up and enjoy the good this country has to offer and let the leaders govern. Spills or no spills, they are part of the democracy and we have to let them happen and stop consuming our every day.


This government has started the royal commission into aged care. These are the things we need focus on: how this government, our government, is taking care of our seniors. The government is committed to our older Australians with access to care that supports their dignity and recognises the contribution that they have made to their society. These are the kinds of questions and policies that we need to be deliberating on during question time, not shouting at each other as though we have nothing else to do. Total aged-care funding is growing from $8.16 billion to $8.68 billion over the forward estimates. This is the kind of thing—the good news story—that every Australian walking on the streets needs to know.


On the GST, every state is going to be better off than before. The government's fairer GST deal leaves no state worse off and delivers real change to the system. Our government has taken the bull by the horns to address the issues that no other government has had the courage to deal with. So these are the kinds of things that, in question time, we need to spend time talking about. The economy has grown stronger. There are more jobs. Our economy is growing stronger, and every Australian in every part of this country needs to know that the economy will grow stronger and stronger, one year after the other. That is what our government is promising to do.

"Chisholm, Sen Anthony",ALP,2018-10-18,"



Senator CHISHOLM
 (Queensland) (15:21):  You don't grow an economy stronger by changing Prime Minister every couple of years, and that's exactly what we've done. What the question from Senator McAllister did was highlight a horror week for this government. We got an unbelievable response from Senator Cormann, the government's Senate leader. This was his quote. He said that Australians 'know what they are getting under us'. That just inspires me to look at their record. When we look at their record, we know they have had three prime ministers. We know they are onto their third Treasurer. We know they've already had two deputy prime ministers, and there will possibly be a third by the end of next week. This is their record when it comes to who has been their leaders—Prime Minister, Treasurer and Deputy Prime Minister. You can't possibly provide the leadership that this country is looking for when you keep changing leader so regularly and keep changing the key personnel so regularly. We've suffered from that. We understand. That is why last weekend, under the Labor leadership of Bill Shorten and Tanya Plibersek, we clocked up five years of stable leadership. That is the real contrast between what Labor are providing and what we've seen from this rabble on the other side.


The consequences of having such instability in the government are actually ones that go to policy dysfunction. Let's have a look at the list of policy dysfunctions that this government have been responsible for. We know that, after being in government for five years, they still don't have an energy policy. They worked on a national energy guarantee for almost 12 months and they still couldn't settle that in the party room. They even promoted the person responsible for it, Josh Frydenberg, to Treasurer as a result, even though he couldn't get a policy on energy through the party room. We know that they couldn't settle on an education policy. They were at war with the Catholic sector for so long because they were short-changing them. It took, again, a change in personnel, a change in the ministry, before they could attempt to resolve that.


We also know about their issues with accountability and decision making. They decided to hand out almost half a billion dollars to a private foundation—the Great Barrier Reef Foundation—with no due process, no tender process. It was decided in a matter of days after a meeting between then Prime Minister Turnbull and now Treasurer Frydenberg. This is the type of government that they have been running. We also know that they have no climate change policy and no credibility when it comes to climate change. So, on key policy areas, there is just a level of dysfunction around this government because they change leaders so often. Because they change the key personnel so often, this is the result that you get.


Now let's look at what they've achieved this week. They obviously said to themselves on the weekend: 'We've got the Wentworth by-election on Saturday. We need a big effort in parliament. We've got to do really well and give our candidate there a platform.' What did they do on the first day? They came in here and voted for a white supremacist slogan. That was on day one. We know that they subsequently backtracked on that. We also know that they ended 70 years of bipartisanship over an important foreign policy matter. These are the types of decisions that they are willing to make because they are so desperate in Wentworth. They're willing to trash what has been a combined effort between both parties of government to ensure that we do our best in terms of foreign policy. They were prepared to trash that overnight, with very little consultation.


As a result of that, they put an important—probably Australia's most important—economic relationship at risk. They are so desperate in Wentworth that this is the type of behaviour we are seeing. We also know that they backflipped on the GST policy, and we know that they offended Australia's Pacific neighbours, with the Minister for the Environment, at the same time. You've got to say to yourself that it is only Thursday; there is still more time before the Wentworth by-election for them to make more decisions that are going to cost them votes in that by-election.


We know that part of the reason they were so desperate on Monday in terms of voting for that white supremacist slogan is that they still don't know how to handle Senator Hanson—whether to fight her or whether to coddle her. They came in on Monday and decided to coddle her on that motion. Then they turned up on Tuesday and said, 'No, we regret that; we're going to vote against it.' We also know that they're in such conflict over trying to get the result they need in Wentworth that they're willing to trash so many policy credentials that Australia has built over time. So, it is very evident that the chaos and dysfunction, the continuing change in leaders on the other side, is leading to a chaotic government, and the Australian people deserve so much better.

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (15:54):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the documents tabled.


It's very disappointing to see the government's response to this. I put the motion for the order of the production of documents to the chamber, which the chamber supported, because it's about the evaluation of the Community Development Program. Senators in this chamber will be aware—and I am sure members of the community who are playing very close attention to this issue will be aware—that we started debate on the bill to change the Community Development Program, which is highly controversial, this afternoon.


We had an inquiry into the provisions in the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Community Development Program) Bill to change the Community Development Program, where we heard that an evaluation had been carried out on the program, but we were being asked to consider the amendments in the bill without the benefit of seeing that evaluation. You have to ask: why? Why were we being asked to consider the bill when we had not seen the evaluation? It gets worse. During the inquiry into the amendments to the bill that is currently before the chamber, we asked the department: 'Has the evaluation of the CDP been finalised? When will the evaluation be completed? Will the evaluation be made public?' The answer that we got was: 'Yes, the evaluation has been completed. Yes, it has been completed.' They went on to say: 'The decision will be made about the appropriate release of the final evaluation report once the government has considered the report's findings.' Is it any wonder that I moved an order for the production of documents when we know that that evaluation has been completed? That is why I subsequently moved to get it tabled, knowing full well that the government would not want to release it when it would enable us to be fully informed when making decisions in this place on the Community Development Program. 


So, what did this minister table today? The minister tabled a copy of the Australian National Audit Office report into the design and implementation of a community development program, which we have all seen and which has been public for quite some time. Then the government had the audacity to table the report of the Senate inquiry into the appropriateness and effectiveness of the objectives, design, implementation and evaluation of the Community Development Program. Now, of course, senators in this place participated in that inquiry and know full well what was in that inquiry. The minister then went on to note, 'There is a further evaluation report that my department is currently in the process of finalising,' when we have been told full well by the department that the report has been finalised. They went on to say, 'Prior to finalisation of this evaluation, the department is engaging with the communities involved in the fieldwork component of the evaluation'—when the department has said that it has already been finalised; bear that in mind—'and a key part of the department's evaluation principles under the evaluation framework is to work with Indigenous Australians in a respectful and culturally appropriate way.' What a joke that answer is! 


If you read the committee's report and the submissions to the inquiry into the bill, you will see that witness after witness said they had not been properly consulted about the government's bill and the changes it wants to make to the Community Development Program. In fact, every witness basically rejected the changes to the CDP. Here is the government, once again, hiding behind the need to consult when the department has already said that they have finalised the evaluation and when the community have said that they had not been consulted on the CDP changes. Yet the government hides behind consultation on the finalisation of the report—a report that is deliberately not being released publicly in terms of timing so that we don't have it when we are debating this bill. It is simply outrageous that the government spends Australian taxpayers' dollars on an evaluation that won't be released in time for us to have a properly informed debate on the CDP bill. It is treating the Senate with contempt and it is treating the community with contempt that they will not release this document and will not let us see what the community said about the CDP. You can only speculate that there are things in that report which they don't want made public before we have that debate on the CDP. 


Well, I am not going to give up trying to get hold of that report before we, once again, debate the CDP in this place. The debate on this bill has started—a bill which is purported to help the community but which the community does not support. Very clearly they have rejected the proposed changes by this government, which will make people's lives worse. I listened to the things that the government senators were saying, in the short debate that we had earlier today, when they were making claims about how it will mean fewer penalties. Well, it simply will not! Aboriginal people will intersect with the new process, the so-called TCF, much more frequently, leading to much higher demerit points, so they will get to the point where they are getting penalties much more quickly.


The whole thing with the current CDP process, with the huge amount of penalties that have been applied, is that the government says, 'We waive them.' Despite that, the program is still having a significant impact. The big thing they say is, 'We waive them.' They can't waive them under the new process. It is an absolute fallacy to say this will make people's lives better. It simply will not and it is an attempt to stop us, the Senate, and the broader community having access to that report when we are debating this bill. What have they got to hide? Why not release it now?

I seek leave to have the second reading speeches incorporated in Hansard.


Leave granted.




The speeches read as follows—





Treasury Laws Amendment (Black Economy Taskforce Measures No. 2) Bill 2018



This Bill enhances the integrity of Australia's tax system through implementing the Government's response to the Black Economy Taskforce's final report. 


The Black Economy Taskforce was established in December 2016 to develop a whole-of‑government response to tackling the black economy. 


The black economy includes businesses and individuals who operate outside the tax and regulatory system and avoid their withholding and reporting obligations or deliberately under‑report income. 


Participation in the black economy undermines community trust in the tax system, gives some businesses an unfair competitive advantage and puts pressure on the margins of honest businesses. 


Failing to report income or the under-reporting of income, are black economy activities targeted in this Bill. 


The Government is committed to a fair tax system which supports honest businesses and ensures that black economy participants cannot escape paying their fair share.


Schedule 1 to this Bill introduces changes to tax deductibility rules, denying a tax deduction for certain payments where an entity such as an employer, fails to comply with their withholding and reporting obligations, encouraging non-reporting or under reporting of incomes by their employees and contractors. 


Some businesses can currently claim deductions for expenses even where the business does not comply with withholding obligations in respect of the expense, such as paying undeclared cash-in-hand wages to employees or paying contractors without withholding tax where an ABN is not provided. This sends a conflicting message about the legitimacy of these actions.


Denying deductions in cases where these obligations are completely disregarded provides a strong financial disadvantage to this behaviour and will send a message that black economy behaviours are not legitimate activities.


Schedule 2 to this Bill extends the taxable payment reporting system to the road freight, security and IT industries. Contractors in these industries are considered by the Black Economy Taskforce and the ATO to be at higher risk of not reporting their income. 


From 1 July 2019, entities that provide a road freight, security or IT service will be required to report to the ATO payments made to other entities that they engage to undertake that service on their behalf. Reporting these payments will improve transparency and bring reporting obligations for payments to contractors more into line with the Pay As You Go reporting obligations on employers for payments to their employees. 


The taxable payment reporting system already operates in the building and construction industry, where it has resulted in improved contractor compliance. In the 2017-18 Budget, the taxable payment reporting system was also extended to the cleaning and courier industries. 


The information reported to the ATO will be used for pre-filling purposes to make it easier for contractors to lodge their income tax returns; and data-matching purposes to ensure contractors comply with their tax obligations such as correctly lodging their income tax returns and meeting Business Activity Statement obligations.


The Bill also targets the illegal tobacco trade and complements legislation introduced by the Assistant Minister for Home Affairs, which is designed to combat imported, illicit tobacco. Through effective tobacco control policy, Australia has become a world leader in reducing smoking rates. This has improved the health and well-being of Australians and reduced the social costs associated with smoking. 


It is important to support Australia's tobacco control policies with effective measures to combat illicit tobacco, which is a major source of funding for criminal organisations, and ensure tobacco products are taxed effectively to continue reducing the prevalence of smoking.


Schedule 3 is part of a suite of measures the Government announced in the 2018-19 Budget to combat illicit tobacco. It moves the taxing point of domestically manufactured tobacco to the point of manufacture rather than when the tobacco enters home consumption. 


This schedule in conjunction with the Bill introduced by the Assistant Minister for Home Affairs creates a comprehensive approach to stop tobacco leakage from warehouses, which is the primary cause of the illicit tobacco trade. Stopping warehouse leakage will withdraw a major source of funding for organised crime and remove the supply of illicit tobacco to the market. 


Full details of these measures are contained in the Explanatory Memorandum. 




Excise Tariff Amendment (Collecting Tobacco Duties at Manufacture) Bill 2018



This Bill and schedule 3 to the Treasury Laws Amendment (Black Economy Taskforce Measures No. 2) Bill 2018 are part of a package of measures announced in the 2018-19 Budget implementing recommendations of the Black Economy Taskforce to disrupt and deter the illicit tobacco market.


This Bill alters the Excise Tariff Act 1901 to enable the calculation of duty payable once the taxing point is moved under the Treasury Laws Amendment (Black Economy Taskforce Measures No. 2) Bill 2018. 


While there is currently no domestic tobacco manufacturing, this Bill complements legislation introduced by the Assistant Minister for Home Affairs, which is designed to combat the evasion of duty in respect of illegally imported tobacco.


As well as continuing to reduce the prevalence of smoking and ensuring tobacco products are taxed correctly, it is also important to stop the illicit tobacco trade. This Bill, in conjunction with the Black Economy package and the Bill introduced by the Assistant Minister for Home Affairs, creates a comprehensive approach to stop tobacco leakage from warehouses, which is the primary cause of the illicit tobacco trade.


Full details of the measures are contained in the Explanatory Memorandum.

Senator WONG
 (South Australia—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (17:01):  I rise to speak on the Discrimination Free Schools Bill 2018. Last year the Australian parliament finally moved to catch up with views that the people we were representing had held for well over a decade—that no two people should be denied, purely on the basis of their sexuality, the right to marry the person they love. Today this legislation challenges senators in this place to not repeat that mistake of delaying action and baulking at legislative change that reflects the expectations and hopes of the Australian community. This parliament again has the chance to walk with the Australian people on their march towards equality instead of racing to catch up a decade later as the parliament did with marriage equality. In doing so, we would take the next step in the legislative journey that I'm proud to say began in my home state in 1975 when South Australia became the first state to decriminalise homosexuality. It is sobering to think it was another two decades before Tasmania became the last state to remove this blight from our laws. Thankfully, criminalising the love of two consenting adults is unthinkable in any state or territory.


Over that same period we have seen governments, both state and federal, slowly and piece by piece strip away the laws which kept in place the more covert discrimination against gay and lesbian Australians. In 1984 the Hawke government introduced laws to prevent discrimination on the basis of sexuality. Many years later, in 2008, the Rudd Labor government amended over 80 pieces of legislation to remove discrimination against LGBTIQ couples. State and territory parliaments have continued to remove discrimination from their laws in order to ensure the equal treatment of LGBTIQ couples, to ensure equality in parenting laws and to remove criminal convictions resulting from unjust laws which criminalised homosexuality. It has not been a smooth path, and there have been setbacks along the way. As I noted last year during the marriage equality debate, in 2004—almost four decades after the US Supreme Court struck down laws which, on the basis of race, outlawed certain marriages—our Australian parliament was legislating to discriminate against loving couples on the basis of sexuality. It was a sad moment in the history of this parliament.


For me, Labor's support for the Howard government's amendment to the Marriage Act meant I was required to vote for discrimination against myself and the people whom I love. The reason I joined the Labor Party is that it is the party of equality and that it has such a proud history of removing discrimination and of extending equality. I knew then that, whilst the party may have disappointed many in 2004, eventually justice and equality would prevail, and so it did when in 2011 we achieved a change in the Labor Party's platform to support legislating for marriage equality. Just as it seems unthinkable that we would ever again criminalise homosexuality, it is now untenable that we would ever again prevent people, on the basis of their sexuality, from marrying each other.


So too are the Australian people now declaring it untenable that discrimination against students and teachers continues to be legal even if it can be justified on religious grounds. It is time to remove this remaining piece of legislative discrimination. Labor approaches this debate knowing that Australia is a tolerant nation and an accepting nation. Discrimination against LGBTIQ Australians has no place in our national laws. We approach this debate knowing that same tolerance and acceptance includes recognising the right of those of faith to live by their traditions and their beliefs.


Unfortunately, for purely political purposes, this government has decided to deny Australians the right to a mature debate on how best to balance freedom of religion with the right of all Australians to live free from discrimination. The government continues to refuse to share the report of the Religious Freedom Review expert panel with Australians and with its representatives. The report, promised by former Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull during the parliamentary debate on the bill to legislate marriage equality, was actually delivered to this government in May. It appears to have sat on Mr Turnbull's desk for months. We're not sure on who else's desk it sat. It has now sat on Mr Morrison's desk for months. To sit on this report and deny Australians a mature and informed debate really does show contempt for the people we are supposed to be representing.


This government is seeking to hide this report solely because it is so divided that it fears the impact this report will have on the voters of Wentworth. And for what purpose? Many religious education institutions have made it clear that they do not and will not use the exemptions which are removed by this bill. They have made clear their abhorrence at the idea that they would ever seek to shame or punish a precious child in their care at a most vulnerable point in their lives. Yet when leaks to the media prompted reports that the government wished to extend the right of religious organisations to discriminate against students and teachers, the Prime Minister's numbers man, Mr Alex Hawke, couldn't wait to jump on Sky News and declare his joy at such recommendations. At the suggestion that his government would legislate to enable a 14-year-old child to be kicked out of school just at the point in their life when they would be crying out for support, when asked whether religious schools should be able to discriminate against LGBTIQ students and teachers, Mr Hawke said: 'Absolutely. I don't think it's controversial.' Well, I invite senators to pause and think about that for one moment. Fortunately for LGBTIQ Australians, and for all Australians who believe Australia to be a nation that values fairness and equality, the overwhelming majority of Australians disagree with Mr Hawke.


The Prime Minister and the Leader of the Government in this place insist the report was unfair and this was never their intention. To that I say two things. Tell that to Mr Alex Hawke, who delighted in the prospect of laws that would enable a child to be kicked out of school for being gay. If what Mr Morrison and Mr Cormann are saying is true, they really only have themselves to blame, because it is this government that buried the report for five months, it is this government that is not allowing the Australian people to know what it is in it and it is this government that is not allowing the community to have a mature and balanced debate on this important issue.


Labor does respect the Australian people. We will treat this legislation in the mature way it deserves. We will treat this legislation in the mature way the Australian community deserves. Regrettably, they have been denied such an approach by the government. We respect the right of parents to send children to the school of their choice and to have their children educated in accordance with their religious convictions. We respect that many parents choose religious schools because they want their children to be grounded in the identity and mission of a particular faith. We also respect that religious schools, and parents of students, are entitled to require employees to act in their roles in ways that uphold the ethos and values of that faith, and that this requirement may be taken into account when a person is first employed and in the course of their employment.


But we also respect that, in 2018, the overwhelming majority of Australians believe that exemptions from discrimination for gender identity, sexual orientation and relationship status are no longer acceptable. We therefore approach this legislation on the following basis: that discrimination on the basis of someone's attributes—whether that be gender, gender identity or sexuality—is categorically unacceptable, and what freedom of religion means is that teachers in religious schools should carry out their duties in the way that upholds the ethos and values of the faith.


As we did on marriage equality and as we have sought to achieve with this legislation, we call on the government to work with Labor and with all senators in this place to achieve a just and fair outcome, one that unites this parliament and unites the nation. A good start would be to release the Religious Freedom Review: report of the Expert Panel. This government commissioned the report and it should be willing to allow a mature, informed and balanced discussion. Labor firmly believes it is possible to protect religious freedom and to protect people from discrimination and to do this in a way that respects the rights of students, teachers, parents and the long tradition in this country of devoted and dedicated religious educators. As the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Shorten, said earlier this week: 


These laws are no longer appropriate, if indeed they ever were appropriate. It's time our laws reflected the values we teach our children.

"Faruqi, Sen Mehreen",AG,2018-10-18,"



Senator FARUQI
 (New South Wales) (17:10):  I rise to speak on the Greens sex discrimination amendment bill, the Discrimination Free Schools Bill 2018, and I do so very proudly. This is the reason I joined the Greens. We do not accept discriminating against people on any basis. We will not accept and allow discrimination on the grounds of sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, intersex status, marital or relationship status, pregnancy or breastfeeding. The current act eliminates these discriminations as far as possible in areas of work, accommodation, education, the provision of goods and services, facilities, the disposal of land, the activities of clubs and the administration of Commonwealth laws and programs. But when it comes to religious education institutions, the law exempts them so they can discriminate against teachers, staff, students and their families. How is this even acceptable in 2018? That's why our bill removes these unfair and highly discriminatory exemptions that allow religious educational institutions to discriminate based on sexual orientation, gender identification, marital status or pregnancy for both staff and students. I have to say a heartfelt thankyou to my colleague Senator Rice and her staff for the work they have done to bring this bill to debate in the Senate. 


After the leaking of parts of the Ruddock review into religious freedoms, we found out the review will recommend that religious schools' ability to legally discriminate against LGBTIQ students and teachers in federal law will be reaffirmed and entrenched. Liberal Prime Minister Scott Morrison then promised to ensure protections for students against discrimination, but we have not yet seen hide nor hair of that bill. The cynic in me thinks that, yet again, this is a political ploy to try and hold on to Wentworth. As soon as the election is done and dusted, we won't hear much from them on this issue. Even in this political move, principle played very little part. If it had, we would have heard something from them on removing discrimination against teachers and staff in religious schools as well. It seems also that even the Labor Party can't fully make up their minds on whether religious schools should continue to discriminate against LGBTIQ teachers. They started off saying no. Then they said they want to have conversations. Then they said they want to see the submissions made to the review to understand why some schools want discrimination against LGBTIQ teachers to continue. Now it seems that they have joined us here in the real world. 


Discrimination in schools is just plain wrong. It is bigotry, plain and simple. The idea that religious schools can do this, with billions of dollars in public money, is even more utterly offensive. We are a society committed to equality and acceptance. No school should be allowed to discriminate. Any school or organisation that chooses to accept public funding must also accept the secular values that come with it, or not a cent of public money should go to them. These views are horrifically out of step with community values, let alone basic decency. So don't tell us that this is complicated. This is pretty straightforward. It's an issue of justice, it's an issue of fairness, it's an issue of equality and it's an issue of respect. That is why it is so important that we are debating this bill today. The community needs to know that we stand with them, that we will stand up for basic rights of human dignity and respect and that all people are equal, no matter their sexual orientation or gender identity.


Let me be absolutely clear about another thing: no religious school, whether they're Christian, Muslim, Jewish, Hindu or any other religion, should be allowed to discriminate. The laws that allowed them to do this—brought in by the Labor Party, with the support of the Liberals—need to be consigned to the history books. Australians are asking for this. The people are speaking with one voice on this. Nearly 80 per cent of respondents to a Galaxy poll are against exemptions for religious schools in LGBTIQ antidiscrimination law. For too long religious schools have been allowed exemptions from the rules that the rest of society actually follows. The Greens' bill would answer the overwhelming demand for this.


The government has indicated that it will bring a bill to remove the exemptions for students only. Of course, if it ever happens, it will be a huge thing for our LGBTIQ young people and their families, who at the moment receive the very public message that they are not accepted. Many will feel that they have to live their teenage years in silence and hide their identity for fear of being expelled. But what about the teachers? On what possible basis could we agree that it is okay to be fired or to be refused a job simply for who you are? The very existence of the right to discriminate is certainly enough to harm the students' mental health and sense of belonging in a society that is already hostile for young LGBTIQ people.


Laws that allow discrimination against teachers mean they're forced to live double lives and constantly worry about the risk of losing their job if they are outed. Look no further than the story of the Western Australian relief teacher, Craig Campbell, who was fired last year after the Baptist school he was teaching at found out he was gay. State laws made that perfectly legal. Around the world, the picture is pretty horrifying. Earlier this year, a primary school teacher in the US was fired after daring to post wedding pictures with her wife online. Time and time again, the government has capitulated to the interests of private and religious schools, handing them enormous amounts of public funding and entertaining their wish to discriminate. Let's show some leadership for once. Our schools should be places where social inequality and social injustice is actually undone, where all students are accepted and where staff are able to teach as themselves and instil in their students an appreciation for all people.


It is incredibly saddening that in 2018 we're still defending the most basic rights to nondiscrimination instead of putting our focus on how we include desperately needed acceptance and celebration of diversity in the curriculum of all schools in Australia. We must fight this backwards push with all our might and stand with students and teachers to remove all existing exemptions that allow religious schools to discriminate. I commend the bill to the house.

"Keneally, Sen Kristina",ALP,2018-10-18,"



Senator KENEALLY
 (New South Wales) (17:18):  I rise to take part in the debate on the Discrimination Free Schools Bill 2018 that is before the Senate. I do so being mindful that this is an issue that goes to some very basic questions about who we are as human beings and how we understand, recognise, respect and accord human dignity to one another. I also do so while acknowledging that we are at this point and in this debate in the Senate and, indeed, in Australia as a result of a review into religious freedom instituted by the former Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull. While I may have a cynical view about why that review was instituted—in regard to the political debate at the time in relation to marriage equality and a desire for the then Prime Minister, Mr Turnbull, to placate concerns raised by some in his party room regarding religious freedom—I do acknowledge that the question of religious freedom in a secular, liberal democracy is one that is fundamental to our body politic. We need to consistently balance the rights of people to freedom of religion and freedom of association alongside the rights of people to be treated equally and without discrimination.


I will get to the intent of the legislation, but I'd like to spend a few minutes reflecting on how we got to this point. As I mentioned, this debate has arisen as a result of the religious freedom review instituted by Malcolm Turnbull in November 2017. Mr Turnbull appointed an expert panel, chaired by the Hon. Philip Ruddock, a former minister in the Howard government, that included some eminent Australians: Emeritus Professor Rosalind Croucher AM, President of the Australian Human Rights Commission; the Hon. Dr Annabelle Bennett AO SC, President of the Anti-Discrimination Board; Father Frank Brennan SJ AO, CEO of Catholic Social Services Australia; and Dr Nicholas Aroney, professor of constitutional law at the University of Queensland. This panel conducted public consultation over a seven-week period during February and March of 2018. These consultations were held in Canberra, Perth, Sydney, Western Sydney, Hobart, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide and Darwin, and the panel received more than 15,500 submissions in that period. That would suggest to me that questions about religious freedom are ones that are important to Australians and ones that many Australians choose to engage with. The panel announced they'd completed the report, and delivered it to Mr Turnbull, in his capacity as Prime Minister, on 18 May 2018.


It has been some 153 days—five months—that the government has had this report and, unfortunately, they have not released it for public consideration. Given the considerable public interest and involvement in it, given the time and intellectual capacity contributed to it by the eminent Australians on the panel, it is disappointing to say the least that we have not yet been able to see the report. In fact, we heard this week in the House of Representatives from the current Prime Minister, Scott Morrison, who served as Treasurer in the Turnbull government, that he first saw the report not long after he became Prime Minister. This is a man who was the Treasurer of the government. He is a person who has a professed and publicly stated interest in religion and religious freedom, and he had not even seen the report, according to his own advice to the parliament.


The Turnbull government had sat on this report since May. They clearly hadn't shown it to the cabinet; cabinet has not been deliberating on this report since May. Quite frankly, the government has been hiding it from its own ministers and from public consultation and consideration. I do think this is disrespectful. That the panel itself is not able to comment on the report until it is released continues the disrespect, and, according to the panel's website, that release is a matter for the Prime Minister.


Nonetheless, someone has selectively released portions of this report. Someone has put portions of this report into the public realm, through the media, and, as a result of that, that's where we are today. We now have portions of this report, and those portions that we have for public consumption make clear that the report highlighted to Australians that within our antidiscrimination legislation we still have these exemptions not just for staff and teachers but for students. I would say that many Australians and many legislators would have been aware of the exemptions as they relate to staff. I'm not sure that many Australians would have been aware of the exemptions as they relate to students.


Here we have, though, the government playing politics in the lead-up to the Wentworth by-election. They have their political reasons for keeping this report secret. However, as a result of the report, there are policy discussions that are now happening in good faith in the community and, putting all of this politicking aside, we may yet get a good policy outcome, at least on this portion of the report.


The legislation that has been introduced in the Senate, the Discrimination Free Schools Bill, is, I acknowledge, a good first step. It is a good first step in achieving an end that Labor, the Greens, some of the crossbench and Liberal senators who have participated in this debate have made clear they all want to accomplish—that is, the removal of an exemption in our antidiscrimination law as it applies to students in religiously affiliated schools. As I said, this legislation is a good first step. However, I believe the legislation can be improved in certain ways. It is not just about making clear that discrimination against students and staff because of who they are or who they love is no longer lawful. I would also like to see this legislation assert an affirmative position in law relating to the ability of religious schools to exercise freedom of religion and freedom of association.


The Discrimination Free Schools Bill would amend the Sex Discrimination Act and the Fair Work Act. The effect of these amendments would be to remove these exemptions in antidiscrimination laws for both students and staff that have applied to religiously affiliated schools. The intent of these exemptions when they were introduced was to uphold the ability of faith based schools to maintain the ethos and the mission of that faith and that school. In 2018, it is clear that these exemptions from discrimination for both students and staff on the basis of gender identity, sexual orientation and relationship status are out of step with community expectations and are no longer the best way to safeguard the mission and identity of religious schools. Even without the release in full of the Ruddock report, the selected portions that have been leaked have prompted a public reaction and a policy response from various political parties.


Labor has made clear that it supports removing the exemptions to antidiscrimination legislation both for students and in the hiring of staff and teachers at religious schools. As I said, the government has made clear that it supports removing such exemptions for students. However, government senators who have spoken in this debate confirm that they do not support the exemption relating to staff and teachers, and that does, at this time, make it very difficult for such legislation to pass the parliament.


Labor supports the intent of the Discrimination Free Schools Bill insofar as it supports the removal of such exemptions that allow schools to discriminate against children and staff on the basis of sexuality, gender identity, marital status or pregnancy. But Labor is currently reviewing the specifics of the particular amendments as they are drafted in the Discrimination Free Schools Bill for unintended consequences and sufficiency, and I do flag that we may yet have more to say in the course of this debate, in any future committee stage or in the face of future government legislation in the Senate. However, as I said in my opening remarks, I believe, and Labor believes, that this legislation can be improved. It can be improved by providing for a positive, affirmative position that recognises the ability of religiously affiliated schools to uphold the value and ethos of those schools and to set rules within the school that require staff to act in ways in their roles that uphold the value and the ethos and to not undermine the mission and the identity of those schools and that faith. I'd like to speak to this in a bit more detail in the time remaining.


I acknowledge the contribution of Senator Wong as well as that of Senator Pratt, both of whom have spoken before me. I agree quite strongly with the descriptions they have given of the need to remove discrimination for LGBTIQ people and to ensure that in Australia we no longer have in law the ability to discriminate against people on the basis of their identity. We are tolerant. We are accepting. We are able to recognise that all of our citizens, regardless of their sexual orientation or relationship status, are fellow human beings, and accord them the dignity and rights that entails. However, we also recognise that our community, country, people and nation—some of us with faith; some without—are and always have been multicultural and multireligious. The right of our churches and churchgoers to live by their traditions and beliefs is also part of our national identity. Balancing these two things is fundamentally important in a democracy. We know that many people have strong views in this debate about how we should balance freedom of religion and the right of all Australians to live free of discrimination. In that regard it would be incredibly helpful if the government released the Ruddock review.


As someone who has been educated in the Catholic education system from year 1 all the way through to a master's degree, as the daughter of a Catholic schoolteacher and as someone who worked as a Catholic primary schoolteacher myself, I understand very well the role of religious education and why families choose it for their children, but, as a legislator for nearly ten years in the New South Wales state parliament and as a former Premier of that state, I also understand our responsibility as legislators to get the balance right, upholding religious freedom while ensuring we are not enacting discriminatory practices within our legislation. We on this side of the Senate very much respect the right of parents to send children to the school of their choice. I understand that firmly. It is a choice my husband and I have made for our own children. Like many parents who have chosen religious education, I have done it because I want my children to be grounded in their Catholic faith. I want them educated in the ethos and the social justice traditions of my church.


I know that my children and other children who are in religiously affiliated schools do not just receive that ethos, mission and identity in a religious or a scripture class; they receive it from the moment they step on the school grounds through to the moment that they leave, whether it be in student leadership, extracurricular activities, sporting activities, other parts of the curriculum, the library, the cafeteria, the gymnasium or the interactions they have with the staff and teachers. The mission and identity of a religious school is not just in the classroom; it is part of the culture, behaviours and activities that take place within that institution. When it comes to employment, we know that the parents who send their children to those schools expect the teachers and staff to support that ethos, to live out that mission and identity and to not act in ways that undermine that mission. The reality is that staff who work in those schools understand this too, and that's why there are very few examples where faith based schools making employment decisions have needed to rely on the identity based exemptions in discrimination law. While every employer is entitled to require employees act and perform their duties in accordance with the stated mission and practices of the organisation, in the absence of such exemptions in our antidiscrimination law it is necessary to ensure religious schools are positively entitled to teach and operate in accordance with their faith and mission.


Labor proposes that we have an affirmative position for religious schools that upholds their exercise of religious freedom and freedom of association. Our approach to legislation on this issue would remove exemptions on the basis of sexuality, gender identity or relationship status. But we would also like to see in legislation a recognition that religious schools are entitled to require their employees to act in their roles in ways that uphold the ethos and values of that faith and that that requirement may be taken into account when a person is first employed and in the course of their employment.


As we have done previously, we do call on the government to come to the table and work with us and with the crossbench to find a suitable way forward. It's disappointing to hear the Liberal senators who have participated in this debate so far reject that call when it comes to the employment of staff and teachers. It is also disappointing that the review into religious freedom has not been released by the government. In many ways, we are left without the guidance that that review might provide to inform this debate. But the public reaction to the parts that have been selectively leaked to the media makes it clear that the public is impatient. They expect us to deliver on removing discrimination. While the government, unfortunately, may choose to play a waiting game until they can get past Saturday's by-election in Wentworth, the public does not have the patience for such political trickery. Religious freedom is not something that should be played with as a political game. Unfortunately—cynically, I would have to say—the government has chosen to do so.


This does go to the heart of who we are as human beings and the heart of who we are as a nation. We are people who come into this place bringing all of our experiences, and I believe we're also people with a spiritual dimension. I acknowledge that our first people, our first Australians, have a deeply spiritual connection to our land. While I do not believe everyone needs to have a faith in order to practise that spiritual dimension, many people choose to do so. Our challenge as legislators is to work out how to balance their rights and abilities to exercise that faith, and to raise and to educate their children in that faith, with ensuring that we are removing discriminatory practices in laws and discriminatory practices against our citizens that are no longer in keeping with community expectations.


I'm pleased that this legislation and this move are taking place in the Senate and that we are having this debate. I would like to think it can continue to be considered in these respectful terms. I look forward to a point in time when we are able to say to all Australians that there is no discrimination in law and to all our Australians of faith that we recognise their right to a freedom of religion.

"Hinch, Sen Derryn",DHJP,2018-10-18,"



Senator HINCH
 (Victoria) (17:38):  I will be brief, because I expressed my view on this appalling situation earlier in the week. I want to go on record in support of the Discrimination Free Schools Bill 2018, which is a bill to ban discrimination by independent schools against any pupil on the grounds of their sexual orientation. Back on Monday, my motion to strip discriminatory schools of any government funding or charity tax concessions was, sadly, voted down in this very chamber. I suspect that the government and the opposition feared a Catholic school backlash, even though the Catholic Church has not threatened, so far as I know, to expel any child or sack any teacher solely because of their sexual orientation.


I said back then that the very worst part of this whole debacle was that some kids all over this country had to sit nervously over last weekend, considering the prospect that they would be thrown out of their school for simply being who they are. This was after parts of the Ruddock report were selectively leaked to The Sydney Morning Herald. A week later, I can sadly say, their fears have not come close to being allayed by this government. It is hard enough being a kid these days. There is bullying on the internet, bullying and teasing at school and the pressures of growing up, et cetera. There is all of that, without having politicians in this place debating whether or not they are deserving of an education at an institution of their choosing and/or their parents' choosing.


When I tried to get the Senate to acknowledge that it's not just gay kids, but also kids who are struggling with their gender identity, who face discrimination under the existing law, Senator Leyonhjelm would not even let me amend my motion or put it to a vote. To make it worse, he sarcastically quoted back at me, 'Shame, shame, shame'. Well, in my view, the only people who should be ashamed of themselves are those senators and members who virtually told Australian kids this week: 'We might not think you're normal enough to continue attending your own school. First, we'll have a think about it, and we'll debate it. We'll take weeks to do it, maybe even months. In the meantime, keep doing your best to learn, keep going to class, but maybe you have to hide who you are while you are at it.' 


We had almost three months of this same sort of thing during the same-sex marriage debate and the so-called plebiscite. But, sadly, it doesn't seem that the government has learned very much along the way. On Senator Leyonhjelm, he wouldn't even let me put the question of whether kids who are gay or transgender deserve to be educated at the institution where they may have attended for years, where they have made friends and maybe where their siblings attend. He gagged me on even putting that question to the Senate. Personally—a little side note—it is good news to me that Senator Leyonhjelm has decided that he wants to be a big frog in a small puddle and plans to leave in February to contest the New South Wales state election, but that's a different story. 


Another glaring aspect of this debate—if you can call it that—is the right of religious schools to discriminate against teachers, as Senator Keneally raised, on the basis of their sexual orientation. I reiterate what I said earlier in the week: I believe that schools should not receive one cent of taxpayers' money if they commit themselves to such archaic, disgusting criteria when choosing the people whose only qualifications should be the knowledge that they will impart to their students. Religious schools receive charity tax status because they provide 'a public benefit'. You wonder what public benefit the society reaps from excluding kids or qualified teachers. As someone succinctly pointed out: they are there to teach maths, not gay maths. I do accept—and also following up on Senator Keneally—that an independent school, a faith-based school, is entitled to expect that its teachers will follow the church's ethos, to use the Labor Party's current buzzword. A teacher proselytising against school standards or church beliefs could be terminated, but that would not be because they were heterosexual or homosexual but because they were not following the dictum or ethos of the organisation. 


Finally, going back to a hypothetical that I raised here on Monday and raised again in encouraging talks with the Prime Minister today: if I were a person of faith—and I'm not—and I had three teenage kids, two straight and one possibly gay or unsure of their sexuality, could two of my kids go to the school of our choice and the third one not? How the hell do you explain to a possibly troubled and insecure child that that is the law? That is why I say this bill must pass.

Senator McALLISTER
 (New South Wales—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (17:43):  I am glad that we are debating the Discrimination Free Schools Bill 2018. The path to this debate here in the Senate has been less than ideal. Mr Morrison's government seems determined to continue to treat the LGBTIQ community with tremendous disrespect. They have jumped first one way and then the other on questions of basic human rights for this community. The LGBTIQ community deserves more than merely to be an object in this government's culture wars and to have material concealed from them and, indeed, the broader community, in the pursuit of a by-election outcome in Wentworth. 


The marriage survey proved that Australians are significantly more tolerant and accepting than this government and the coalition party room: 61.6 per cent of the community voted yes to allow people to marry the people that they love. I'd observe that that signals more than tolerance, more than acceptance. It signals an embrace of this community and its choices and unqualified support for equality. Still, every day, thanks to this government, Australians had to live through a nationwide survey on their right to marry who they love.


Now those same Australians have to sit through another conversation about whether people like them ought to be kicked out of schools, because the government have dragged their heels on releasing the Ruddock review and refuse to do so even now to enable an informed and reasoned debate. Just like the marriage equality debate, this is an argument being pushed by the conservative fringes of politics despite the overwhelming public opinion which does not support these old-fashioned views. Turning children away from schools because of their sexual orientation or gender identity is inconsistent with our values as a nation in 2018. Polling shows that 82 per cent opposed the discrimination law exemptions that allow schools to expel gay and lesbian students. There is a reason why the public view of these exemptions is so overwhelmingly in opposition. Parents and, indeed, all decent people baulk at the prospect of hurting a child. They baulk at the prospect of exiling them for being just who they are. Schools are supposed to be safe, nurturing places where our kids can grow and thrive, and it is unthinkable that they would be allowed to treat a child in this way.


We need to do more than deal with issues associated with children; we need to support the right of teachers to do the job that they love without being discriminated against on the basis of who they love. Teachers have the right to be safe and supported just like any Australian in the workplace. Again, in the public polling there is an indication that 79 per cent of Australians oppose schools' ability to sack teachers if they marry a person of the same sex. I don't believe that schools are considering using this power. Indeed, I have not heard of any schools that have asserted that they wish to do so. But the existence of that threat must weigh heavily on the minds of decent and dedicated teachers. I actually think Australians were shocked to find out that schools even had this power to begin with. Continuing to uphold this historic and outdated exemption only maintains a gap between what the public believe and our present laws.


I recognise how important, strong and genuinely held religious convictions are to the lives of millions of Australians. These Australians should have the freedom to worship and practise their faith without unreasonable impositions or burdens—and they do. It's one of the great success stories in Australia. People of all faiths practise their religion side by side without conflict and without penalty. But, like all rights and freedoms in our society, freedom of religion is not absolute. It must be balanced when it comes into tension with the rights and freedoms held by others, and this includes in our schools.


I am confident in our ability as a society to find this balance. We can do this. We've done it before. Like many nations, Australians suffered from sectarian tensions in our earlier history and it is to the great credit of those before us that we have largely put those sectarian tensions behind us. We navigated the social adjustments that came from the changing status of women and, as our population has changed, we have accommodated different faiths from all around the world. Our society is capable of balancing the rights and wishes of different groups with compassion, understanding and generosity. The debate about this bill and our progress towards reform is the next chapter in that tradition. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.


Leave granted; debate adjourned.

"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2018-10-18,"



Senator WONG
 (South Australia—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (17:01):  I rise to speak on the Discrimination Free Schools Bill 2018. Last year the Australian parliament finally moved to catch up with views that the people we were representing had held for well over a decade—that no two people should be denied, purely on the basis of their sexuality, the right to marry the person they love. Today this legislation challenges senators in this place to not repeat that mistake of delaying action and baulking at legislative change that reflects the expectations and hopes of the Australian community. This parliament again has the chance to walk with the Australian people on their march towards equality instead of racing to catch up a decade later as the parliament did with marriage equality. In doing so, we would take the next step in the legislative journey that I'm proud to say began in my home state in 1975 when South Australia became the first state to decriminalise homosexuality. It is sobering to think it was another two decades before Tasmania became the last state to remove this blight from our laws. Thankfully, criminalising the love of two consenting adults is unthinkable in any state or territory.


Over that same period we have seen governments, both state and federal, slowly and piece by piece strip away the laws which kept in place the more covert discrimination against gay and lesbian Australians. In 1984 the Hawke government introduced laws to prevent discrimination on the basis of sexuality. Many years later, in 2008, the Rudd Labor government amended over 80 pieces of legislation to remove discrimination against LGBTIQ couples. State and territory parliaments have continued to remove discrimination from their laws in order to ensure the equal treatment of LGBTIQ couples, to ensure equality in parenting laws and to remove criminal convictions resulting from unjust laws which criminalised homosexuality. It has not been a smooth path, and there have been setbacks along the way. As I noted last year during the marriage equality debate, in 2004—almost four decades after the US Supreme Court struck down laws which, on the basis of race, outlawed certain marriages—our Australian parliament was legislating to discriminate against loving couples on the basis of sexuality. It was a sad moment in the history of this parliament.


For me, Labor's support for the Howard government's amendment to the Marriage Act meant I was required to vote for discrimination against myself and the people whom I love. The reason I joined the Labor Party is that it is the party of equality and that it has such a proud history of removing discrimination and of extending equality. I knew then that, whilst the party may have disappointed many in 2004, eventually justice and equality would prevail, and so it did when in 2011 we achieved a change in the Labor Party's platform to support legislating for marriage equality. Just as it seems unthinkable that we would ever again criminalise homosexuality, it is now untenable that we would ever again prevent people, on the basis of their sexuality, from marrying each other.


So too are the Australian people now declaring it untenable that discrimination against students and teachers continues to be legal even if it can be justified on religious grounds. It is time to remove this remaining piece of legislative discrimination. Labor approaches this debate knowing that Australia is a tolerant nation and an accepting nation. Discrimination against LGBTIQ Australians has no place in our national laws. We approach this debate knowing that same tolerance and acceptance includes recognising the right of those of faith to live by their traditions and their beliefs.


Unfortunately, for purely political purposes, this government has decided to deny Australians the right to a mature debate on how best to balance freedom of religion with the right of all Australians to live free from discrimination. The government continues to refuse to share the report of the Religious Freedom Review expert panel with Australians and with its representatives. The report, promised by former Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull during the parliamentary debate on the bill to legislate marriage equality, was actually delivered to this government in May. It appears to have sat on Mr Turnbull's desk for months. We're not sure on who else's desk it sat. It has now sat on Mr Morrison's desk for months. To sit on this report and deny Australians a mature and informed debate really does show contempt for the people we are supposed to be representing.


This government is seeking to hide this report solely because it is so divided that it fears the impact this report will have on the voters of Wentworth. And for what purpose? Many religious education institutions have made it clear that they do not and will not use the exemptions which are removed by this bill. They have made clear their abhorrence at the idea that they would ever seek to shame or punish a precious child in their care at a most vulnerable point in their lives. Yet when leaks to the media prompted reports that the government wished to extend the right of religious organisations to discriminate against students and teachers, the Prime Minister's numbers man, Mr Alex Hawke, couldn't wait to jump on Sky News and declare his joy at such recommendations. At the suggestion that his government would legislate to enable a 14-year-old child to be kicked out of school just at the point in their life when they would be crying out for support, when asked whether religious schools should be able to discriminate against LGBTIQ students and teachers, Mr Hawke said: 'Absolutely. I don't think it's controversial.' Well, I invite senators to pause and think about that for one moment. Fortunately for LGBTIQ Australians, and for all Australians who believe Australia to be a nation that values fairness and equality, the overwhelming majority of Australians disagree with Mr Hawke.


The Prime Minister and the Leader of the Government in this place insist the report was unfair and this was never their intention. To that I say two things. Tell that to Mr Alex Hawke, who delighted in the prospect of laws that would enable a child to be kicked out of school for being gay. If what Mr Morrison and Mr Cormann are saying is true, they really only have themselves to blame, because it is this government that buried the report for five months, it is this government that is not allowing the Australian people to know what it is in it and it is this government that is not allowing the community to have a mature and balanced debate on this important issue.


Labor does respect the Australian people. We will treat this legislation in the mature way it deserves. We will treat this legislation in the mature way the Australian community deserves. Regrettably, they have been denied such an approach by the government. We respect the right of parents to send children to the school of their choice and to have their children educated in accordance with their religious convictions. We respect that many parents choose religious schools because they want their children to be grounded in the identity and mission of a particular faith. We also respect that religious schools, and parents of students, are entitled to require employees to act in their roles in ways that uphold the ethos and values of that faith, and that this requirement may be taken into account when a person is first employed and in the course of their employment.


But we also respect that, in 2018, the overwhelming majority of Australians believe that exemptions from discrimination for gender identity, sexual orientation and relationship status are no longer acceptable. We therefore approach this legislation on the following basis: that discrimination on the basis of someone's attributes—whether that be gender, gender identity or sexuality—is categorically unacceptable, and what freedom of religion means is that teachers in religious schools should carry out their duties in the way that upholds the ethos and values of the faith.


As we did on marriage equality and as we have sought to achieve with this legislation, we call on the government to work with Labor and with all senators in this place to achieve a just and fair outcome, one that unites this parliament and unites the nation. A good start would be to release the Religious Freedom Review: report of the Expert Panel. This government commissioned the report and it should be willing to allow a mature, informed and balanced discussion. Labor firmly believes it is possible to protect religious freedom and to protect people from discrimination and to do this in a way that respects the rights of students, teachers, parents and the long tradition in this country of devoted and dedicated religious educators. As the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Shorten, said earlier this week: 


These laws are no longer appropriate, if indeed they ever were appropriate. It's time our laws reflected the values we teach our children.

"Faruqi, Sen Mehreen",AG,2018-10-18,"



Senator FARUQI
 (New South Wales) (17:10):  I rise to speak on the Greens sex discrimination amendment bill, the Discrimination Free Schools Bill 2018, and I do so very proudly. This is the reason I joined the Greens. We do not accept discriminating against people on any basis. We will not accept and allow discrimination on the grounds of sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, intersex status, marital or relationship status, pregnancy or breastfeeding. The current act eliminates these discriminations as far as possible in areas of work, accommodation, education, the provision of goods and services, facilities, the disposal of land, the activities of clubs and the administration of Commonwealth laws and programs. But when it comes to religious education institutions, the law exempts them so they can discriminate against teachers, staff, students and their families. How is this even acceptable in 2018? That's why our bill removes these unfair and highly discriminatory exemptions that allow religious educational institutions to discriminate based on sexual orientation, gender identification, marital status or pregnancy for both staff and students. I have to say a heartfelt thankyou to my colleague Senator Rice and her staff for the work they have done to bring this bill to debate in the Senate. 


After the leaking of parts of the Ruddock review into religious freedoms, we found out the review will recommend that religious schools' ability to legally discriminate against LGBTIQ students and teachers in federal law will be reaffirmed and entrenched. Liberal Prime Minister Scott Morrison then promised to ensure protections for students against discrimination, but we have not yet seen hide nor hair of that bill. The cynic in me thinks that, yet again, this is a political ploy to try and hold on to Wentworth. As soon as the election is done and dusted, we won't hear much from them on this issue. Even in this political move, principle played very little part. If it had, we would have heard something from them on removing discrimination against teachers and staff in religious schools as well. It seems also that even the Labor Party can't fully make up their minds on whether religious schools should continue to discriminate against LGBTIQ teachers. They started off saying no. Then they said they want to have conversations. Then they said they want to see the submissions made to the review to understand why some schools want discrimination against LGBTIQ teachers to continue. Now it seems that they have joined us here in the real world. 


Discrimination in schools is just plain wrong. It is bigotry, plain and simple. The idea that religious schools can do this, with billions of dollars in public money, is even more utterly offensive. We are a society committed to equality and acceptance. No school should be allowed to discriminate. Any school or organisation that chooses to accept public funding must also accept the secular values that come with it, or not a cent of public money should go to them. These views are horrifically out of step with community values, let alone basic decency. So don't tell us that this is complicated. This is pretty straightforward. It's an issue of justice, it's an issue of fairness, it's an issue of equality and it's an issue of respect. That is why it is so important that we are debating this bill today. The community needs to know that we stand with them, that we will stand up for basic rights of human dignity and respect and that all people are equal, no matter their sexual orientation or gender identity.


Let me be absolutely clear about another thing: no religious school, whether they're Christian, Muslim, Jewish, Hindu or any other religion, should be allowed to discriminate. The laws that allowed them to do this—brought in by the Labor Party, with the support of the Liberals—need to be consigned to the history books. Australians are asking for this. The people are speaking with one voice on this. Nearly 80 per cent of respondents to a Galaxy poll are against exemptions for religious schools in LGBTIQ antidiscrimination law. For too long religious schools have been allowed exemptions from the rules that the rest of society actually follows. The Greens' bill would answer the overwhelming demand for this.


The government has indicated that it will bring a bill to remove the exemptions for students only. Of course, if it ever happens, it will be a huge thing for our LGBTIQ young people and their families, who at the moment receive the very public message that they are not accepted. Many will feel that they have to live their teenage years in silence and hide their identity for fear of being expelled. But what about the teachers? On what possible basis could we agree that it is okay to be fired or to be refused a job simply for who you are? The very existence of the right to discriminate is certainly enough to harm the students' mental health and sense of belonging in a society that is already hostile for young LGBTIQ people.


Laws that allow discrimination against teachers mean they're forced to live double lives and constantly worry about the risk of losing their job if they are outed. Look no further than the story of the Western Australian relief teacher, Craig Campbell, who was fired last year after the Baptist school he was teaching at found out he was gay. State laws made that perfectly legal. Around the world, the picture is pretty horrifying. Earlier this year, a primary school teacher in the US was fired after daring to post wedding pictures with her wife online. Time and time again, the government has capitulated to the interests of private and religious schools, handing them enormous amounts of public funding and entertaining their wish to discriminate. Let's show some leadership for once. Our schools should be places where social inequality and social injustice is actually undone, where all students are accepted and where staff are able to teach as themselves and instil in their students an appreciation for all people.


It is incredibly saddening that in 2018 we're still defending the most basic rights to nondiscrimination instead of putting our focus on how we include desperately needed acceptance and celebration of diversity in the curriculum of all schools in Australia. We must fight this backwards push with all our might and stand with students and teachers to remove all existing exemptions that allow religious schools to discriminate. I commend the bill to the house.

"Keneally, Sen Kristina",ALP,2018-10-18,"



Senator KENEALLY
 (New South Wales) (17:18):  I rise to take part in the debate on the Discrimination Free Schools Bill 2018 that is before the Senate. I do so being mindful that this is an issue that goes to some very basic questions about who we are as human beings and how we understand, recognise, respect and accord human dignity to one another. I also do so while acknowledging that we are at this point and in this debate in the Senate and, indeed, in Australia as a result of a review into religious freedom instituted by the former Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull. While I may have a cynical view about why that review was instituted—in regard to the political debate at the time in relation to marriage equality and a desire for the then Prime Minister, Mr Turnbull, to placate concerns raised by some in his party room regarding religious freedom—I do acknowledge that the question of religious freedom in a secular, liberal democracy is one that is fundamental to our body politic. We need to consistently balance the rights of people to freedom of religion and freedom of association alongside the rights of people to be treated equally and without discrimination.


I will get to the intent of the legislation, but I'd like to spend a few minutes reflecting on how we got to this point. As I mentioned, this debate has arisen as a result of the religious freedom review instituted by Malcolm Turnbull in November 2017. Mr Turnbull appointed an expert panel, chaired by the Hon. Philip Ruddock, a former minister in the Howard government, that included some eminent Australians: Emeritus Professor Rosalind Croucher AM, President of the Australian Human Rights Commission; the Hon. Dr Annabelle Bennett AO SC, President of the Anti-Discrimination Board; Father Frank Brennan SJ AO, CEO of Catholic Social Services Australia; and Dr Nicholas Aroney, professor of constitutional law at the University of Queensland. This panel conducted public consultation over a seven-week period during February and March of 2018. These consultations were held in Canberra, Perth, Sydney, Western Sydney, Hobart, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide and Darwin, and the panel received more than 15,500 submissions in that period. That would suggest to me that questions about religious freedom are ones that are important to Australians and ones that many Australians choose to engage with. The panel announced they'd completed the report, and delivered it to Mr Turnbull, in his capacity as Prime Minister, on 18 May 2018.


It has been some 153 days—five months—that the government has had this report and, unfortunately, they have not released it for public consideration. Given the considerable public interest and involvement in it, given the time and intellectual capacity contributed to it by the eminent Australians on the panel, it is disappointing to say the least that we have not yet been able to see the report. In fact, we heard this week in the House of Representatives from the current Prime Minister, Scott Morrison, who served as Treasurer in the Turnbull government, that he first saw the report not long after he became Prime Minister. This is a man who was the Treasurer of the government. He is a person who has a professed and publicly stated interest in religion and religious freedom, and he had not even seen the report, according to his own advice to the parliament.


The Turnbull government had sat on this report since May. They clearly hadn't shown it to the cabinet; cabinet has not been deliberating on this report since May. Quite frankly, the government has been hiding it from its own ministers and from public consultation and consideration. I do think this is disrespectful. That the panel itself is not able to comment on the report until it is released continues the disrespect, and, according to the panel's website, that release is a matter for the Prime Minister.


Nonetheless, someone has selectively released portions of this report. Someone has put portions of this report into the public realm, through the media, and, as a result of that, that's where we are today. We now have portions of this report, and those portions that we have for public consumption make clear that the report highlighted to Australians that within our antidiscrimination legislation we still have these exemptions not just for staff and teachers but for students. I would say that many Australians and many legislators would have been aware of the exemptions as they relate to staff. I'm not sure that many Australians would have been aware of the exemptions as they relate to students.


Here we have, though, the government playing politics in the lead-up to the Wentworth by-election. They have their political reasons for keeping this report secret. However, as a result of the report, there are policy discussions that are now happening in good faith in the community and, putting all of this politicking aside, we may yet get a good policy outcome, at least on this portion of the report.


The legislation that has been introduced in the Senate, the Discrimination Free Schools Bill, is, I acknowledge, a good first step. It is a good first step in achieving an end that Labor, the Greens, some of the crossbench and Liberal senators who have participated in this debate have made clear they all want to accomplish—that is, the removal of an exemption in our antidiscrimination law as it applies to students in religiously affiliated schools. As I said, this legislation is a good first step. However, I believe the legislation can be improved in certain ways. It is not just about making clear that discrimination against students and staff because of who they are or who they love is no longer lawful. I would also like to see this legislation assert an affirmative position in law relating to the ability of religious schools to exercise freedom of religion and freedom of association.


The Discrimination Free Schools Bill would amend the Sex Discrimination Act and the Fair Work Act. The effect of these amendments would be to remove these exemptions in antidiscrimination laws for both students and staff that have applied to religiously affiliated schools. The intent of these exemptions when they were introduced was to uphold the ability of faith based schools to maintain the ethos and the mission of that faith and that school. In 2018, it is clear that these exemptions from discrimination for both students and staff on the basis of gender identity, sexual orientation and relationship status are out of step with community expectations and are no longer the best way to safeguard the mission and identity of religious schools. Even without the release in full of the Ruddock report, the selected portions that have been leaked have prompted a public reaction and a policy response from various political parties.


Labor has made clear that it supports removing the exemptions to antidiscrimination legislation both for students and in the hiring of staff and teachers at religious schools. As I said, the government has made clear that it supports removing such exemptions for students. However, government senators who have spoken in this debate confirm that they do not support the exemption relating to staff and teachers, and that does, at this time, make it very difficult for such legislation to pass the parliament.


Labor supports the intent of the Discrimination Free Schools Bill insofar as it supports the removal of such exemptions that allow schools to discriminate against children and staff on the basis of sexuality, gender identity, marital status or pregnancy. But Labor is currently reviewing the specifics of the particular amendments as they are drafted in the Discrimination Free Schools Bill for unintended consequences and sufficiency, and I do flag that we may yet have more to say in the course of this debate, in any future committee stage or in the face of future government legislation in the Senate. However, as I said in my opening remarks, I believe, and Labor believes, that this legislation can be improved. It can be improved by providing for a positive, affirmative position that recognises the ability of religiously affiliated schools to uphold the value and ethos of those schools and to set rules within the school that require staff to act in ways in their roles that uphold the value and the ethos and to not undermine the mission and the identity of those schools and that faith. I'd like to speak to this in a bit more detail in the time remaining.


I acknowledge the contribution of Senator Wong as well as that of Senator Pratt, both of whom have spoken before me. I agree quite strongly with the descriptions they have given of the need to remove discrimination for LGBTIQ people and to ensure that in Australia we no longer have in law the ability to discriminate against people on the basis of their identity. We are tolerant. We are accepting. We are able to recognise that all of our citizens, regardless of their sexual orientation or relationship status, are fellow human beings, and accord them the dignity and rights that entails. However, we also recognise that our community, country, people and nation—some of us with faith; some without—are and always have been multicultural and multireligious. The right of our churches and churchgoers to live by their traditions and beliefs is also part of our national identity. Balancing these two things is fundamentally important in a democracy. We know that many people have strong views in this debate about how we should balance freedom of religion and the right of all Australians to live free of discrimination. In that regard it would be incredibly helpful if the government released the Ruddock review.


As someone who has been educated in the Catholic education system from year 1 all the way through to a master's degree, as the daughter of a Catholic schoolteacher and as someone who worked as a Catholic primary schoolteacher myself, I understand very well the role of religious education and why families choose it for their children, but, as a legislator for nearly ten years in the New South Wales state parliament and as a former Premier of that state, I also understand our responsibility as legislators to get the balance right, upholding religious freedom while ensuring we are not enacting discriminatory practices within our legislation. We on this side of the Senate very much respect the right of parents to send children to the school of their choice. I understand that firmly. It is a choice my husband and I have made for our own children. Like many parents who have chosen religious education, I have done it because I want my children to be grounded in their Catholic faith. I want them educated in the ethos and the social justice traditions of my church.


I know that my children and other children who are in religiously affiliated schools do not just receive that ethos, mission and identity in a religious or a scripture class; they receive it from the moment they step on the school grounds through to the moment that they leave, whether it be in student leadership, extracurricular activities, sporting activities, other parts of the curriculum, the library, the cafeteria, the gymnasium or the interactions they have with the staff and teachers. The mission and identity of a religious school is not just in the classroom; it is part of the culture, behaviours and activities that take place within that institution. When it comes to employment, we know that the parents who send their children to those schools expect the teachers and staff to support that ethos, to live out that mission and identity and to not act in ways that undermine that mission. The reality is that staff who work in those schools understand this too, and that's why there are very few examples where faith based schools making employment decisions have needed to rely on the identity based exemptions in discrimination law. While every employer is entitled to require employees act and perform their duties in accordance with the stated mission and practices of the organisation, in the absence of such exemptions in our antidiscrimination law it is necessary to ensure religious schools are positively entitled to teach and operate in accordance with their faith and mission.


Labor proposes that we have an affirmative position for religious schools that upholds their exercise of religious freedom and freedom of association. Our approach to legislation on this issue would remove exemptions on the basis of sexuality, gender identity or relationship status. But we would also like to see in legislation a recognition that religious schools are entitled to require their employees to act in their roles in ways that uphold the ethos and values of that faith and that that requirement may be taken into account when a person is first employed and in the course of their employment.


As we have done previously, we do call on the government to come to the table and work with us and with the crossbench to find a suitable way forward. It's disappointing to hear the Liberal senators who have participated in this debate so far reject that call when it comes to the employment of staff and teachers. It is also disappointing that the review into religious freedom has not been released by the government. In many ways, we are left without the guidance that that review might provide to inform this debate. But the public reaction to the parts that have been selectively leaked to the media makes it clear that the public is impatient. They expect us to deliver on removing discrimination. While the government, unfortunately, may choose to play a waiting game until they can get past Saturday's by-election in Wentworth, the public does not have the patience for such political trickery. Religious freedom is not something that should be played with as a political game. Unfortunately—cynically, I would have to say—the government has chosen to do so.


This does go to the heart of who we are as human beings and the heart of who we are as a nation. We are people who come into this place bringing all of our experiences, and I believe we're also people with a spiritual dimension. I acknowledge that our first people, our first Australians, have a deeply spiritual connection to our land. While I do not believe everyone needs to have a faith in order to practise that spiritual dimension, many people choose to do so. Our challenge as legislators is to work out how to balance their rights and abilities to exercise that faith, and to raise and to educate their children in that faith, with ensuring that we are removing discriminatory practices in laws and discriminatory practices against our citizens that are no longer in keeping with community expectations.


I'm pleased that this legislation and this move are taking place in the Senate and that we are having this debate. I would like to think it can continue to be considered in these respectful terms. I look forward to a point in time when we are able to say to all Australians that there is no discrimination in law and to all our Australians of faith that we recognise their right to a freedom of religion.

"Hinch, Sen Derryn",DHJP,2018-10-18,"



Senator HINCH
 (Victoria) (17:38):  I will be brief, because I expressed my view on this appalling situation earlier in the week. I want to go on record in support of the Discrimination Free Schools Bill 2018, which is a bill to ban discrimination by independent schools against any pupil on the grounds of their sexual orientation. Back on Monday, my motion to strip discriminatory schools of any government funding or charity tax concessions was, sadly, voted down in this very chamber. I suspect that the government and the opposition feared a Catholic school backlash, even though the Catholic Church has not threatened, so far as I know, to expel any child or sack any teacher solely because of their sexual orientation.


I said back then that the very worst part of this whole debacle was that some kids all over this country had to sit nervously over last weekend, considering the prospect that they would be thrown out of their school for simply being who they are. This was after parts of the Ruddock report were selectively leaked to The Sydney Morning Herald. A week later, I can sadly say, their fears have not come close to being allayed by this government. It is hard enough being a kid these days. There is bullying on the internet, bullying and teasing at school and the pressures of growing up, et cetera. There is all of that, without having politicians in this place debating whether or not they are deserving of an education at an institution of their choosing and/or their parents' choosing.


When I tried to get the Senate to acknowledge that it's not just gay kids, but also kids who are struggling with their gender identity, who face discrimination under the existing law, Senator Leyonhjelm would not even let me amend my motion or put it to a vote. To make it worse, he sarcastically quoted back at me, 'Shame, shame, shame'. Well, in my view, the only people who should be ashamed of themselves are those senators and members who virtually told Australian kids this week: 'We might not think you're normal enough to continue attending your own school. First, we'll have a think about it, and we'll debate it. We'll take weeks to do it, maybe even months. In the meantime, keep doing your best to learn, keep going to class, but maybe you have to hide who you are while you are at it.' 


We had almost three months of this same sort of thing during the same-sex marriage debate and the so-called plebiscite. But, sadly, it doesn't seem that the government has learned very much along the way. On Senator Leyonhjelm, he wouldn't even let me put the question of whether kids who are gay or transgender deserve to be educated at the institution where they may have attended for years, where they have made friends and maybe where their siblings attend. He gagged me on even putting that question to the Senate. Personally—a little side note—it is good news to me that Senator Leyonhjelm has decided that he wants to be a big frog in a small puddle and plans to leave in February to contest the New South Wales state election, but that's a different story. 


Another glaring aspect of this debate—if you can call it that—is the right of religious schools to discriminate against teachers, as Senator Keneally raised, on the basis of their sexual orientation. I reiterate what I said earlier in the week: I believe that schools should not receive one cent of taxpayers' money if they commit themselves to such archaic, disgusting criteria when choosing the people whose only qualifications should be the knowledge that they will impart to their students. Religious schools receive charity tax status because they provide 'a public benefit'. You wonder what public benefit the society reaps from excluding kids or qualified teachers. As someone succinctly pointed out: they are there to teach maths, not gay maths. I do accept—and also following up on Senator Keneally—that an independent school, a faith-based school, is entitled to expect that its teachers will follow the church's ethos, to use the Labor Party's current buzzword. A teacher proselytising against school standards or church beliefs could be terminated, but that would not be because they were heterosexual or homosexual but because they were not following the dictum or ethos of the organisation. 


Finally, going back to a hypothetical that I raised here on Monday and raised again in encouraging talks with the Prime Minister today: if I were a person of faith—and I'm not—and I had three teenage kids, two straight and one possibly gay or unsure of their sexuality, could two of my kids go to the school of our choice and the third one not? How the hell do you explain to a possibly troubled and insecure child that that is the law? That is why I say this bill must pass.

Senator McALLISTER
 (New South Wales—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (17:43):  I am glad that we are debating the Discrimination Free Schools Bill 2018. The path to this debate here in the Senate has been less than ideal. Mr Morrison's government seems determined to continue to treat the LGBTIQ community with tremendous disrespect. They have jumped first one way and then the other on questions of basic human rights for this community. The LGBTIQ community deserves more than merely to be an object in this government's culture wars and to have material concealed from them and, indeed, the broader community, in the pursuit of a by-election outcome in Wentworth. 


The marriage survey proved that Australians are significantly more tolerant and accepting than this government and the coalition party room: 61.6 per cent of the community voted yes to allow people to marry the people that they love. I'd observe that that signals more than tolerance, more than acceptance. It signals an embrace of this community and its choices and unqualified support for equality. Still, every day, thanks to this government, Australians had to live through a nationwide survey on their right to marry who they love.


Now those same Australians have to sit through another conversation about whether people like them ought to be kicked out of schools, because the government have dragged their heels on releasing the Ruddock review and refuse to do so even now to enable an informed and reasoned debate. Just like the marriage equality debate, this is an argument being pushed by the conservative fringes of politics despite the overwhelming public opinion which does not support these old-fashioned views. Turning children away from schools because of their sexual orientation or gender identity is inconsistent with our values as a nation in 2018. Polling shows that 82 per cent opposed the discrimination law exemptions that allow schools to expel gay and lesbian students. There is a reason why the public view of these exemptions is so overwhelmingly in opposition. Parents and, indeed, all decent people baulk at the prospect of hurting a child. They baulk at the prospect of exiling them for being just who they are. Schools are supposed to be safe, nurturing places where our kids can grow and thrive, and it is unthinkable that they would be allowed to treat a child in this way.


We need to do more than deal with issues associated with children; we need to support the right of teachers to do the job that they love without being discriminated against on the basis of who they love. Teachers have the right to be safe and supported just like any Australian in the workplace. Again, in the public polling there is an indication that 79 per cent of Australians oppose schools' ability to sack teachers if they marry a person of the same sex. I don't believe that schools are considering using this power. Indeed, I have not heard of any schools that have asserted that they wish to do so. But the existence of that threat must weigh heavily on the minds of decent and dedicated teachers. I actually think Australians were shocked to find out that schools even had this power to begin with. Continuing to uphold this historic and outdated exemption only maintains a gap between what the public believe and our present laws.


I recognise how important, strong and genuinely held religious convictions are to the lives of millions of Australians. These Australians should have the freedom to worship and practise their faith without unreasonable impositions or burdens—and they do. It's one of the great success stories in Australia. People of all faiths practise their religion side by side without conflict and without penalty. But, like all rights and freedoms in our society, freedom of religion is not absolute. It must be balanced when it comes into tension with the rights and freedoms held by others, and this includes in our schools.


I am confident in our ability as a society to find this balance. We can do this. We've done it before. Like many nations, Australians suffered from sectarian tensions in our earlier history and it is to the great credit of those before us that we have largely put those sectarian tensions behind us. We navigated the social adjustments that came from the changing status of women and, as our population has changed, we have accommodated different faiths from all around the world. Our society is capable of balancing the rights and wishes of different groups with compassion, understanding and generosity. The debate about this bill and our progress towards reform is the next chapter in that tradition. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.


Leave granted; debate adjourned.

Senator URQUHART
 (Tasmania—Opposition Whip in the Senate) (17:53):  by leave—I rise to make a brief contribution to alert the Senate to a minister misleading the Senate earlier today. I wrote to Minister McKenzie seeking clarification and my office hand-delivered a letter to her just before 5.00 pm today. Today, when reading a prewritten response to a question from Senator O'Sullivan, the Deputy Leader of the Nationals, Minister McKenzie, said that the coalition government has committed to spend '$400 million for the Bass Highway in Tasmania' as a part of the 10-year Roads of Strategic Importance package. This is simply incorrect and repeats the misleading messaging used during the recent Braddon by-election by the failed Liberal candidate Mr Brett Whiteley, both in press conferences and on his Facebook. As Minister McKenzie should be aware, the commitment at the by-election, from the coalition government, was for $60 million for upgrades to the Bass Highway. The coalition government also committed $10 million for upgrades to the Murchison Highway during the by-election.


To correct the record, during the by-election the Deputy Prime Minister said, on 29 May 2018:


…there is $400 million under the roads of strategic importance, a Tasmanian roads package that is going to make such a difference to Midland Highway, Bass Highway and all the highways and byways in the Apple Isle.


Nevertheless, Mr Whiteley continued to mislead the people of Braddon for a number of weeks with the false figure of $400 million for the Bass Highway. Of course, Mr Whiteley's deceitfulness was wasted. He lost the by-election and was unable to record a swing to the government. I have noticed his face around Parliament House this week and one wonders in what capacity he is back.


After the by-election, the hardworking member for Braddon, Ms Justine Keay MP, lodged a pile of questions on notice to the coalition government seeking information on their plans for their promises made during the by-election—promises that the then Prime Minister, Mr Turnbull, said were not dependent on the Liberals' success in the by-election. In his response to Ms Keay on the Murchison Highway, Deputy Prime Minister Mr McCormack notes that funding for the upgrades will come from the $400 million Roads of Strategic Importance package. This is the same pool of funds that Minister McKenzie asserted today in question time will be spent solely on the Bass Highway. The people of Braddon are sick and tired of this government's repeated brazen mistruths.


Neglecting the Murchison Highway in the minister's prewritten response today demonstrated a lack of understanding of Tasmania from the Nationals, a party whose new Tasmanian representative relentlessly claims to be putting Tassie back on the map and a party who claims to care about the regions but either can't get the basic facts right or is telling mistruths.


While there is an intersection of the Bass and Murchison highways, the two serve very different communities and should not be confused as one road. The Murchison Highway runs from Somerset on the north-west coast past Hampshire, Tullah and Rosebery, ending near Zeehan, where it joins the Zeehan Highway to either Zeehan to the west or Queenstown to the south. It is a vital link for Tasmania's forestry, mining, tourism and agriculture industries as well as residents and small businesses alike.


In comparison, the Bass Highway runs from Marrawah in the far north-west through Smithton, Wynyard, Burnie, Alveston, Latrobe and Deloraine before terminating in Launceston. The highway has recorded some of the highest freight volumes of any road in Tasmania and connects more than 200,000 Tasmanians.


Minister McKenzie's prewritten response to the question on notice from her Nationals colleague Senator O'Sullivan demonstrates that the falsehood lives on. In the letter to Minister McKenzie, I requested that at her earliest convenience today she clarify to the Senate that the Roads of Strategic Importance package for Tasmania is $400 million over 10 years for upgrades to roads throughout Tasmania. I also requested that, as per the response from Deputy Prime Minister McCormack to the member for Braddon, Ms Keay, she clarify to the Senate that the upgrades to both the Murchison and Bass highways are yet to be finalised by the Australian and Tasmanian governments, that no project construction time lines exist and that no funding has been delivered.


Making an error during a response to a question from a non-government senator or member is one thing, but the error was in a prewritten response to a question from a fellow Nationals senator. It is not just disappointing that the minister failed to attend the chamber; it is a clear abrogation of her duties and a slap in the face to all Tasmanians.

"Moore, Sen Claire",ALP,2018-10-18,"



Senator MOORE
 (Queensland) (17:58):  As many people in this chamber know, every year since 2007 Plan International has published a State of the World's Girls report. I think every year I have commented on their reports in this place and it has covered a wide range of issues, including domestic violence, education and access to services.


This year it is in a new format. The format of the Plan report this year is Unsafe in the city: aresearch report on girls' safety across five cities in the world. The cities are Madrid, Delhi, Kampala, Sydney and Lima. They are vastly different cities. This project engaged with young women living in these cities about their personal safety and how they think that their city should be safer for them. The purpose of the report is quite clear. It is to shine a light on the relentless sexual harassment and abuse that is a daily norm for so many young women and girls on our city streets. We made this statement, but more importantly this is a statement that young women have made to us. They believe there is a relentless process in their cities, in their homes, that causes them to be unsafe, that causes them to make decisions that are not those which they want to make, but they feel that they are not safe. 



Unsafe in the city is the first in a new series of State of the World's Girls reports from Plan International, and it shines a light for all of us. It presents a worrying rise in intimidation and insecurity, which is stopping girls from realising their true potential in our urban spaces. This is particularly important, because we look at this issue as we're considering SDG5 across the world, looking at safety, the importance of women and achieving gender equality. If young women—women of all ages, but particularly at this time young women—do not feel safe, they will not be able to feel equal. I so often talk about that major SDG theme of making sure that no-one is left behind. When young women are unsafe, they will be left behind and we will have no way of making sure that we have genuine equality. 


We heard similar stories in these five cities—as I said, different places. Young women are frightened for their very physical safety, and they are angry and frustrated because their voices have not been heard or taken seriously. Harassment should never be seen as part of a normal life for girls and young women. It is not harmless fun. It is frightening, it's disempowering and it's completely unacceptable, and we can make a change. 


The way the program was introduced was through working on a Free To Be online map-based social survey tool which was developed and piloted in Melbourne. The findings in the 2016 pilot in Melbourne highlighted blatant inequalities in that city, which caused many to sit up and take notice. As a result of these studies, Plan International commissioned a further study, extended to the five cities which we have now, using the methodology and using the partners CrowdSpot, a digital company specialising in map based data collection, and XYX Lab, based at Monash University in Melbourne. Digitally mapping the process of letting the young women involved make indications of where they feel safe and what's causing their issues, and being able to record this digitally so that the results can be counted, gives people the chance to be involved and to reinforce the point that all girls have the right to feel safe in their city. The Free To Be methodology provides the evidence to present to city bosses and planners to encourage them to work with girls and young women to bring about genuine change in the cities. 


This aspect around sexual harassment fits in with a number of studies which have been conducted in Australia. Only earlier this year, our 2018 sexual harassment survey, which was conducted with the Sex Discrimination Commissioner, indicated there was a range of fear and concern about sexual harassment across Australia. In September this year, Kate Jenkins, the Sex Discrimination Commissioner, presented a paper called 'Everyone's business'. This particular paper reinforced what happened in the sexual harassment survey and talked about exactly the same issues that were raised in the Plan survey across the five cities internationally—exactly the same indications of feeling unsafe, exactly the same frustration and exactly the feeling that their voices were not being heard and that people were just not understanding the issues of harassment and, even more importantly, the fact that this is everyone's business and that together, as a community, we can put an end to this scourge, which has clearly affected so many lives. When the Sex Discrimination Commissioner presented the paper to the National Press Club, she said: 


The most common reasons people said they didn't report their experiences were:


that they thought others would think they were overreacting;


that the incident wasn't serious enough; or


that they thought nothing would change.


If that is the reaction that young girls have when they are feeling afraid and isolated—that the reason they won't tell someone about it, the reason they won't go to people in authority, is that they just don't think anything will change—indicates that we have a significant problem in our community. There was also a deep concern that there wasn't an understanding about the impact of harassment. There needed to be a genuine acceptance that there is something seriously wrong and that, together, we could make a difference.


Out of both the Plan International paper and the Sex Discrimination Commissioner's paper, there are a number of things we see that, together, we could do. One of them, and this is one of the clear recommendations of the Plan paper, is that we must institute behavioural change. We have to challenge the sense of blame in our culture, and listen to and act upon the stories of women and girls. And sometimes this means challenging the definition of masculinity. This leads to another aspect of the whole discussion. This is an issue that affects women and girls, but it must engage men and boys, and it must engage our whole community. The intent of these surveys is to shine a light on this behaviour, and, if we are going to change the culture, it must be done together. We also need to ensure that the voices of young women, and of the young men who support them—because there must be a desire for change among young men as much as young women—must be involved in the decisions that are made. You identify the issue. You identify the areas where people feel most vulnerable. 


One of the ones that come up consistently is public transport. Women feel that on public transport they are not safe. They will be harassed. They will be touched inappropriately. Comments will be made which will be inappropriate. They are fearful about using a public service, something which governments provide to help communities. Public transport is one of the most dangerous areas that have been indicated in five cities across different continents, and also in Sydney. One of the areas that came up was Sydney public transport. 


We can make a difference. These surveys have not been done necessarily to cause us to be frustrated or cause us not to take action. The rationale behind them is to make us take action and to indicate to each other that we can make a difference. And we can. Following the Sexual Harassment Survey, there has now been instituted a national inquiry through the Human Rights Commission to look at issues of sexual harassment in the workplace in Australia. The first round of those hearings has already begun, and the Human Rights Commission are calling upon people across Australia to submit their own views, their own concerns and their own experiences to this exercise, and also to take part in the community hearings. We know a large number of people have already done that. 


I am really hopeful that the work that Plan International has done, particularly in Australia, in Sydney, will stimulate more young women and girls to get involved in the public hearing process that's now being done by the Human Rights Commission, because if we can continue to gather the evidence, if we can break that element where people don't report because they don't think anything will change and no-one's listening, and get involved, then we can make plans into the future to make our communities safer. If our young women feel as though they will not be harassed in public, that will make a stronger community for all of us. I am hopeful that the work that has been done will have that result.
