Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (09:31):  Here we are with a bill brought on in a rush, in a hurry, by a government that is an absolute rabble. The Treasury Laws Amendment (Working Holiday Maker Employer Register) Bill 2017 is part of a deal between this rabble of a government and Senator Leyonhjelm to take away some protection for migrant workers in this country. What an absolute joke! We know this government is scraping the bottom of the barrel to try and get legislation before this place. We know it doesn't have an agenda. We know it has a Prime Minister who doesn't know what he's got to do, a Prime Minister with the L-plates up, a Prime Minister who is just in this job because another Liberal Prime Minister has been knifed in the back. We have ended up with this legislation as part of a deal with Senator Leyonhjelm to take away some protection for migrant workers in this country.


This bill removes the requirement for the public listing on the Australian Business Register of businesses that employ working holiday-makers, winding back a transparency measure in the original package. As part of worker protection that was included in the package passed by parliament in 2016, there was a requirement that a legislative framework be set up allowing the Commissioner of Taxation to establish a mandatory registration process for employers of working holiday-makers. This allowed the date of effect of an employer's registration to be made publicly available on the Australian Business Register. Effectively this was to allow visa holders to check the public register to see if a business is registered for employing working holiday-makers, to allow them to make sure a potential employer is in fact a legitimate business. It provided a public register of the companies that were employing the 200,000 visa holders, where there was no public register previously. The register addressed concerns about the exploitation of working holiday-makers and would provide valuable data on working holiday-makers. 


It's similarly reprehensible that the Morrison government—and when you talk about a Morrison government, it's really an inverted commas 'government'; it's not much of a government; it's got no agenda; it's got no capacity to focus on the issues that are important for Australians—this rabble of a government, wants to down a measure that helps ensure employers remit the right amount of tax to the tax office on behalf of those workers. The government, with this bill, is actively and willingly increasing the risk of tax non-compliance. What a joke! What an absolute joke! The bill will rip up the ability of a working holiday-maker to look up the details of an employer on the register for employing working holiday-makers, affecting their ability to choose an employer who will comply with tax laws. Both of these provisions in the original bill meant that there was some possibility of greater protection from exploitation for working holiday-makers. Given the significant cases of worker exploitation in this area, we strongly recommend that this tawdry bill be rejected. Labor has consistently stated our commitment to transparency, particularly in areas that can help reduce exploitation of vulnerable workers.


So this is where we are. Instead of fixing aged care or restoring penalty rates, the government is asking us to debate the merits of whether or not working holiday-makers will have access to information about potential employers. Instead of fighting fraudulent phoenix activity or tackling tax havens, the Morrison government would rather have us debate the merits of whether or not working holiday-makers should face an increased risk of exploitation. Well, they shouldn't face an increased risk of exploitation. It's an absolute nonsense that we've got a mob sitting across the chamber, calling themselves a government, that would support further exploitation of vulnerable workers in this country. But it doesn't surprise me. Anything that supports workers would not be supported by this government. Remember Work Choices? Remember the ABCC? Remember the ROC? Remember that minister, Senator Cash, who misled parliament on five occasions, who's the subject of a Federal Police investigation, who refuses to work effectively with the Federal Police to get to the bottom of what's going on? Is it any surprise that migrant workers are at the bottom of the list for this mob? Is it any surprise that they would rather have farmers in this country exploit workers? Is it any surprise they would have criminal gangs, as exposed on Four Corners, exploit migrant workers, having them live in terrible conditions and now not having a support mechanism available to them so that they can test whether theirs is a reasonable employer and an employer that meets their legal obligations?


It's not just Labor that's concerned about this. The Salvation Army, the Uniting Church, and the Tax Justice Network oppose this bill. For the benefit of the Senate, let's briefly look at where the government has come from. Former Treasurer Morrison, in a media release around the time of the original legislation, stated that backpackers could look up employers via ABN Lookup, making the register publicly accessible. Not long after that, the government introduced this bill to the House, and Fairfax reported, in early 2017:


A spokesman for the Treasurer Scott Morrison said the bill was proposed by Senator Leyonhjelm.


""The government agreed to introduce the amendment after reaching an agreement with the senator to pass the original WYHM legislation. The government will honour its commitment,"" the spokesman said.


""This commitment did not extend to the successful passage of the amendment. 


""The government is committed to protecting the rights of backpackers and protecting them from exploitation. …""


We really are at the bottom of the barrel. The spokesperson for the Prime Minister, who was the Treasurer at the time, indicated that this was simply about doing a deal with Senator Leyonhjelm. You should not be using vulnerable workers as part of a deal with the extremists in the Senate. Senator Leyonhjelm has got some of the most extreme views in the Senate.


Senator Leyonhjelm is always interested in small government, except when it comes to paying his wages. There's no small government when he's picking up his pay cheque every month. There's no small government when it comes to the perks of being a senator. There's no small government when it comes to making sure that his nose is in the trough. There's no small government when it comes to making sure that Senator Leyonhjelm's looked after. But when it comes to looking after vulnerable workers, vulnerable people, then government has to be small. When it comes to making sure that we've got a decent health system, government's got to be small. When it comes to a decent education system, according to Senator Leyonhjelm, government's got to be small. So it's big government when it's looking after his mates in the tobacco industry and it's big government when it comes to looking after Senator Leyonhjelm, but it's small government when it comes to looking after vulnerable workers.


This bill is an absolute nonsense. I would invite anyone who wants to deal with this bill, who's thinking about supporting this bill, to go back to the Four Corners transcript of Monday, 4 May 2015, where it outlined the slave labour that was going on in the Queensland rural sector. A Queensland grower said that there is slave labour in this country. So what Senator Leyonhjelm is proposing is that you hide the slave labour so that you don't get a union knocking on your door to try and make sure that decent wages and conditions are being paid. What an absolute joke! What an absolute pathetic position to be putting to this Senate.


Any time you see Senator Leyonhjelm standing up with his grandiose ideas, with all the nonsense he goes on about, then look at what he is prepared to do to vulnerable workers in this country. He is prepared to have them ripped off. It's an absolute joke. We've got nearly mafia-life exploitation of some of these workers. And then when a modest position comes in place to support those workers, we'll get Senator Leyonhjelm supporting it. We've got the government actually providing a process to bring this to the Senate. What an absolute joke this is. You should be ashamed of yourself, Senator Leyonhjelm, for bringing this to this place. You should be absolutely ashamed of yourself.


It's no use having a bit of a laugh with Senator Hanson. This is a serious issue. This is about looking after exploited workers. This is about making sure that they've got a decent right in this country and know who employers are employing. It's about making sure that these companies are paying proper taxation. So we take the view that this should be rejected. We are determined to oppose this bill, and anyone of any decency in this chamber would be opposing this bill.


I am disgusted that the coalition has allowed this to come forward to exploit workers just because they've done another grubby deal to try and save their own necks—a dying government, a decaying government, a government that their own Prime Minister describes as muppets. If there ever were a muppet show, look at what's going on here. The muppets have allowed this to be brought to the Senate to exploit ordinary working people. This is a disgraceful government. This is a chaotic government. This is a government on its last legs. This is a government that should actually go to the people and let the people make a decision whether they want decency in government and whether they want a government that will look after the exploited in this country.


This is another demonstration that workers' rights in this country mean nothing under this coalition. They mean nothing. When Senator Leyonhjelm is leading the government by the nose to exploit workers, then that is the bottom of the barrel. This government is at the bottom of the barrel. It is a government that doesn't care about workers' rights. It is a government that attacks workers' rights. It is a government that does dirty deals to ensure that ordinary workers can get ripped off and migrant workers can get ripped off. This bill is a disgrace and should be opposed.

"Leyonhjelm, Sen David",LDP,2018-09-19,"



Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (09:45):  I rise to support the Treasury Laws Amendment (Working Holiday Maker Employer Register) Bill 2017. I see this bill as a finalisation of the government's backpacker tax package of 2016. The government's backpacker tax package passed in late 2016, albeit with a hiccup on 30 November 2016. By November 2016, the government had the support of the then Xenophon Team of three senators provided that a program to encourage unemployed youth to do seasonal work was subsequently implemented. That program has since been implemented. By 30 November 2016, the government had the support of Pauline Hanson's One Nation provided that the tax rate on working holiday-makers was reduced from 19 per cent to 15 per cent. And by 30 November 2016 the government believed it had Senator Hinch's support, too. The government knew it did not have my support at that time because the backpacker tax package included some violations of taxpayer privacy and because I considered that even a 15 per cent tax rate was excessive. That's still my view, incidentally, and I think Labor's agriculture shadow minister would agree with me.


Then, on 30 November 2016, Senator Hinch joined Senator Culleton and others to vote for a 10.5 per cent tax rate, instead of a 15 per cent tax rate. So it was a 10.5 per cent tax rate that passed the Senate, much to the dismay of the government. Treasurer Morrison came to my office asking if there was any way I could support the backpacker tax package at 15 per cent. I reluctantly agreed to support the package if the violations of taxpayer privacy were removed. Having secured this deal, the government brought that part of the backpacker tax package dealing with the tax rate back to the Senate on 1 December 2016, and a 15 per cent tax rate was finally passed.


The part of the backpacker tax package that included the violations of taxpayer privacy had already passed both houses, so it was not returned to the Senate on 1 December 2016. Instead, to fix the violations of taxpayer privacy we needed new legislation, hence the bill we are debating today, the Treasury Laws Amendment (Working Holiday Maker Employer Register) Bill 2017. I thank the government for bringing this bill to the Senate.


This bill removes a provision allowing the Australian Taxation Office to publicise on the Australian Business Register an individual employer's intention to hire working holiday-makers. The ATO has not used this power to date, given that the bill has been on the Notice Paper. Forcing the publication on the Australian Business Register of an individual employer's intention to hire working holiday-makers is a recipe for the Australian Workers' Union to harass that individual employer. Farmers are mostly small businesses—individual family businesses. They have enough problems with droughts, floods and even needles in strawberries without Senator Cameron's bovver-boy mates knocking on the door. Employers will be free to continue to publicise their intentions to hire working holiday-makers through sites frequented by prospective working holiday-makers. It will come as no surprise that working holiday-makers tend not to peruse the Australian Business Register. General reporting about working holiday-makers and employers who hire them is unaffected by this bill.


This bill also reverts to the previous rule protecting personal financial information provided by a taxpayer to the ATO, so that the ATO can provide this information to the employment department without breaching secrecy provisions only if the taxpayer is actually or reasonably suspected of noncompliance with a taxation law. Because this bill has been on the Notice Paper, the ATO is currently divulging information consistent with the previous rule, rather than divulging information more broadly. This is a protection of the personal financial information of law-abiding taxpayers and it should continue.


I expect Labor and the Greens will make outlandish claims about this bill, but this is a simple and modest bill. It ensures that the protection on taxpayer privacy in place on 30 November 2016 remains. It represents the finalisation of a backpacker tax package that the Senate agreed to on 1 December 2016. I commend the bill to the Senate.

"Whish-Wilson, Sen Peter",AG,2018-09-19,"



Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (09:50):  This Treasury Laws Amendment (Working Holiday Maker Employer Register) Bill 2017 is bizarre; it's completely bizarre and completely reflective of a government that doesn't know what it's doing. We thought the backpacker tax fiasco was dead, buried and cremated, but here we have it rising from the ashes again today in the form of a most unusual backflip by the government, seemingly for Senator Leyonhjelm's benefit, and we can only wonder at what kind of deals have been done behind closed doors.


Through this bill, the government is bringing forward legislation to repeal its own legislation, which is less than two years old, to honour a deal that they didn't end up doing. I will repeat that again: through this bill, this government is bringing forward legislation to repeal its own legislation, which is less than two years old, to honour a deal they didn't do.




Senator Cameron:
  Because they're a rabble!




Senator WHISH-WILSON:
  Well, they are a rabble. I can't say it with quite the intonation that Senator Cameron can, but absolutely they are a rabble. Senators, let's reflect on what happened around the backpacker fiasco. It was leading into the Christmas holidays. We were all looking forward to it—talk about a rabble—after an absolutely shambolic double-dissolution, going into Christmas of 2016. What did we have? We had a seemingly obscure piece of legislation around changing the tax rate for backpackers. It nearly brought the government down and it nearly brought down the Prime Minister at the time. That's how serious this was. That's how it snowballed into an absolute fiasco for the government.


We had a situation where, in a tax grab, a revenue grab—and it wasn't very much revenue either, by the way; we're talking about only a very small amount of money—the government decided in their budget to go after foreign workers. They decided to go after foreign workers, who, for all intents and purposes, were working on short-term visas—holiday visas—in Australia, helping Australian businesses pick their fruit, which is very important in my home state of Tasmania. The government basically said, 'You're not paying any tax while you're here. We're going to levy a 32.5 per cent tax rate on the money you're going to earn.' There were existing exemptions and loopholes and all sorts of accusations of rorting of the system, but the employers, the National Farmers' Federation, clearly told us senators—and as a Tasmanian senator I had discussions with all the stakeholders—that the system was working. They were able to source the labour they needed to pick their fruit and stay in business. The system was working because Australia was an attractive destination. They not only came here for a holiday but for a working holiday, and there was work available. They were able, effectively, to get more money in their pocket, because of the way the tax laws were, and therefore we were very competitive compared to our friends across the ditch in New Zealand, and to other places. So, the government set a 32.5 per cent tax rate and there were going to be no negotiations on that.


When it was clear that they didn't have the support in the Senate the government decide to bring in a tax rate of 19 per cent. They weren't going to budge, and they weren't going to negotiate. They'd already compromised, so that's what it was going to be. Of course, senators in this place got together, and they talked to employers again, and a new proposition was put up on multiple fronts—I think One Nation put up a proposition; the previous Senator Lambie certainly put up a proposition—and the Senate passed a 10.5 per cent tax rate for foreign workers. The Greens, at that point, had a really clear position. We wanted the system to stay the way it was. We didn't want foreign workers to pay any tax while they were here, because they were benefiting our economy, they were benefiting our community and they were spending most of their money here anyway. They were earning on their working holiday money that they were spending in this country. We were pretty happy with the way it was, so we didn't support changing the tax rate at all. We had a very clear position all the way through.


The government weren't going to come at 10.5 per cent, so what did they do? They dropped their required tax rate to 15 per cent. So it was 15 per cent, and that was it. Just as they'd said the other two times, they were not going to negotiate on 15 per cent. That was the base rate. I can understand, if you're the government and you're in charge of a country, why you wouldn't want to negotiate legislation by auction, and not just by auction but by very public auction. If it wasn't clear to Australians after the double dissolution that the government had lost control it certainly was going into Christmas 2016, because legislation was up for a very public auction.


As a Tasmanian senator, I could see my state of Tasmania on its knees—and ultimately we're here as senators for our states. It was desperation stakes. Where I come from, in the Tamar Valley in Tasmania, it's all fruit growing operations. As some of you may be aware, I planted a small vineyard of three hectares many years before I came into the Senate. I relied on fruit pickers. Everybody in my state in the agricultural industry relies on foreign workers, mostly on working holiday visas. As I've said in the Senate, I had a fantastic pair of rock climbers, two fantastic guys from Patagonia, who were staying on our farm and picking fruit. They were working in all sorts of different businesses. We've been lifelong friends ever since. This is absolutely critical to Tasmania.


I felt very strongly, and I know Senator Rice and others in the party room who come from states that have large agricultural industries felt very strongly, that we couldn't let this go on over Christmas. We were getting the very clear signal that businesses weren't able to employ people because people weren't coming. The numbers were down significantly because of the uncertainty that had been introduced for what was essentially, in the beginning, a small tax grab. It snowballed, and there was a stampede away from Australia on the back of this stupidity. That's what it was. At the end of the day, the Greens were the adult in the room. We sat down with Senator Cormann, and we negotiated what we thought was a way forward for everybody. We got the best possible deal we could for foreign workers, although they paid a 15 per cent headline rate, which the government at that stage refused to negotiate on. They were paying 95 per cent of their superannuation when they left this country into a fund that went back to the government. Foreign workers were only getting five per cent of their super back. So we proposed to the government that they change that 95 per cent rate to a rate that gave an equivalent effective tax rate of 10½ per cent. At that point it worked out to be that 65 per cent of their super would be paid to the government, so foreign workers got over a third of their super back in their pockets when they left. So workers got the 10½ per cent rate, the government got to save face and keep its 15 per cent headline rate and the Greens also negotiated a desperately needed $100 million for Landcare. We need a lot more than that, but we negotiated that deal. It was a good deal for foreign workers. It was universally applauded by employer groups, by the National Farmers' Federation and by many businesses, including in my home state of Tasmania. Although we'd have liked to have seen no tax at all paid by foreign workers while they were here, it has turned out to still be an effective, competitive tax rate for backpackers.


Let's get back to this totally bizarre piece of legislation. How did we get here today? Part of the backpacker tax package passed by this parliament involved establishing a public register of employers. The explanatory memorandum of the original bill, the Treasury Laws Amendment (Working Holiday Maker Reform) Bill 2016 states:


The ATO will develop a simple registration process for employers who need to withhold tax from WHMs.


WHMs are working holiday-makers. The explanatory memorandum continues:


Information as to who is a registered employer for this purpose will be publicly available. This will incentivise employers to register in order to attract WHMs, since unregistered employers will be required to withhold at the 32.5 per cent rate from the first dollar of income.


Keep in mind that that 32½ per cent rate is not competitive. That will not bring in foreign workers to work in the businesses where we need them. We were absolutely confident about that. It would be a total disincentive to potential employees. So this was to be avoided. The explanatory memorandum continues:


The register will assist with enforcing compliance and will provide data that can be used to help inform future policy related to WHMs.


The then Treasurer, now Prime Minister, in his second reading speech, stated:


The register will be made public, with a list of registered employers published on the ABN Lookup, making it easy for working holiday-makers and others to check the registration status of a potential employer.


But, in the process of trying to get the bill through parliament, it would appear that Senator Leyonhjelm extracted a commitment from the government not to make the register public. Presumably he got this concession when the government thought they needed his vote. In the end, they didn't need his vote, and legislation was passed that would allow for the register to be made public. But, not three months later, government introduced this bill to repeal their own legislation, on a deal that they didn't even do. Of course—I don't know—there may have been other deals done around this. That's very possible.


This bill has been sitting in the parliament ever since then. This bill has, it would appear, been cause for the ATO not to act to make the register public. The answer to question on notice No. 196 from the Senate Economics Legislation Committee at supplementary budget estimates 2017-18 says:


As Registrar of the Australian Business Register, the Commissioner has the discretion to make certain information publicly available.


The Registrar has chosen not to make an employer's working holiday maker registration publicly available.


In other words, even though this legislation passed this place and there was a very good reason for this register—the register was there to protect working holiday-makers in this country—it wasn't made public. The answer to another question on notice to the Senate Economics Legislation Committee, No. 68 at budget estimates 2018-19, says:


The Commissioner, in his role as Registrar of the ABR, received discretion to make details of employers of working holiday makers publicly available on 2 December 2016 via an amendment to the ABN Act Schedule 2 of Treasury Laws Amendment (Working Holiday Maker Reform) Act 2016.


The Registrar has chosen not to make these details publicly available to address concerns raised in the community about the privacy of this information.


Really? Who in the community has raised these concerns about the privacy of information, apart from Senator Leyonhjelm?


Senator Leyonhjelm is, out and proud, a libertarian, and this is important to him and the people he represents. I don't know how many of them there are. But who else? Who else is the proxy for concerns raised in the community about privacy of this information? Was it the businesses themselves who didn't want to disclose the effective tax rates that they were levying off foreign workers? That's something we can ask in committee, because I'm interested to know who else has raised these issues with the minister and the minister's office apart from Senator Leyonhjelm.


The last thing I'd like to address is why the government hasn't brought this bill forward before now, especially considering the fact that they haven't disclosed this register anyway. They haven't protected foreign workers. They haven't made it easy for foreign workers to detect and determine which employers would be the best employers to work for in terms of how they're going to be paid. Why would I want to go and work for a business that's going to charge me 32.5 per cent when I could get 15 per cent from a business on a register and I can make that decision? If I'm on a working holiday, obviously these decisions are going to be very important. I'm going to be looking at where I'm going to work geographically. I'm going to be determining my choice of employment not just on things like tax rates but on where I want to go for my holiday and what I want to do around my holiday. My two friends from Patagonia, who started on our farm in Tasmania, chose Tasmania because they were rock climbers and there was plenty of work. We were desperately seeking workers in the summer of 2016. Our registrations—I checked this with working holiday businesses who matched the demand and supply—were down more than a third that summer because of this backpacker fiasco. It was a totally unnecessary fiasco, based on a quick tax grab by a government without giving any thought to the uncertainty this would cause to the agricultural industry in Australia. It was an absolute fiasco.


I say this personally: I, as a Tasmanian senator, felt that it was very important to get a deal done and certainty for Tasmanian businesses, and for the workers. If we had let it go to Christmas they would have been slugged 32½ per cent. And Tasmanian pickers and businesses weren't able to find workers. I got a lot of attacks. That's probably a good way to describe it. I would like to use an expletive, but I know the Acting Deputy President would pull me up on that. I got a lot of attacks that Christmas because we did a deal with the government and people felt like we'd let Mr Malcolm Turnbull and Mr Scott Morrison off the hook. This could have brought the Prime Minister down. It was that bad. It was that much of a fiasco. They had totally lost control of government over this bill. But it was absolutely critical, and my party room all supported this because we wanted to see the agricultural businesses get the employment they needed to keep going, and we wanted to see workers and foreign workers get the best possible deal and get certainty on this issue. That's why we came up with what was a very good compromise in the end for all parties involved.


We won't be supporting this bill. We want to see this register. It's absolutely critical that it's out in public and that workers get to choose and get the best information possible for their working holidays. When we go in committee, unless the minister deals with this in her second reader amendment, I'll be very interested to know who these other parties are that have complained about the privacy issues surrounding this public register.

"Hanson, Sen Pauline",PHON,2018-09-19,"



Senator HANSON
 (Queensland) (10:09):  One Nation will be supporting the Treasury Laws Amendment (Working Holiday Maker Employer Register) Bill 2017. I'm well aware of the Labor Party's position on this bill. They won't be supporting it because they're intent on harassing and victimising businesses who register as working holiday-makers' employers, particularly in the farming sector, which utilises backpackers for seasonal work.


Once upon a time Aussies would flock to picking jobs throughout the country. They would work in the strawberry fields on the Sunshine Coast for four months, or a bit longer if they were there for the planting of runners. Once that season had ended, they'd head off in different directions for other crops across the country. Some would head off to Darwin and pick mangoes. Others would go and do watermelons or pick tomatoes in Bundaberg. Some would go and pick blueberries in Coffs Harbour. But the Australian workforce that once travelled the country fruit picking have inevitably grown a bit older, and they're more focused on the grey nomad lifestyle. They haven't given up the travel, just the need to work.


Unfortunately, the generations of Aussies haven't kept up those traditions of fruit picking, and it's left growers in all fruit and vegetable industries short on farmhands. Call it generational change or call it a change in work ethic, but the reality is that Aussies are less interested in farm work, leaving farmers short on staff. That's why this government, and previous Labor governments, have allowed seasonal fruit picking to be done by backpackers.


I just ask why Labor would want to leave a loophole in our system for these farmers or seasonal work providers to be named and shamed. I find it ironic that the Labor Party are quite supportive of the Pacific Labour Scheme, which allows 2,000 workers from Pacific island nations like Nauru and Tuvalu to fill labour gaps in rural and regional Australia. The Pacific Labour Scheme isn't a short employment period either; it's for up to three years. So what's the difference between supporting the Pacific Labour Scheme, where employers' details aren't plastered online for Labor and their goons to name and shame, versus working holiday-makers?


Let's also point out a few other facts with these backpackers and the short stints they do to make sure our farming sector doesn't collapse. They pay tax from the very first dollar earned. We passed the backpacker tax in 2016, where backpackers pay 15 per cent on every dollar paid to them. As part of that legislative change, employers of working holiday-makers were required to be registered with the Commissioner of Taxation, which allowed employers to withhold the applicable tax. But it's in this very change that we find ourselves fixing up the problem.


Aussies won't do this sort of work, because it has unpredictable hours and the farmer doesn't know how long his season will last. The strawberry industry is a classic example of the uncertainty that farming work offers. It takes a few criminals to sabotage perfectly good fruit and scare the hell out of consumers, and, before you know it, their season has ended prematurely. Almost every single worker in the strawberry industry in Queensland has lost their job today. I think everyone in this country knows my stance on jobs for Australians, but work in certain industries like farming just doesn't appeal to Australians anymore.


You're lucky I'm not the Prime Minister, because I'd be a hard taskmaster. I'd force some of these dole bludgers, who haven't worked a day in their lives, to go out and pick fruit or cut their Centrelink payments. Could you imagine it if I managed to pull that off? I'd have the Greens all over me like a filthy rash because I dared make some of these bludgers work. Let's be honest, though. If you put some of these people on a farm, it would be a punishment to our farmers and an embarrassment to humanity. So in these circumstances I don't mind supporting backpackers working on farms, if Australians don't want to take up the jobs.


I can't let this time go by without responding to Senator Cameron, with his comments about the workers and the ABCC bill, the ROC bill and what's happened with workers in this country. What an absolutely hypocritical comment that was, because the ABCC bill was actually looking after those employers, who employ people. They were actually controlled by thuggery, mainly by the CFMEU and the unions, to shut them down. These building sites were costing the taxpayer an estimated 30 per cent more because of the thuggery from the unions, who would just go in there and shut them down and destroy small businesses. Or—the fact is—they'd say to the businesses, 'If you want the job, we want a cheque from you,' so they could be handing over a cheque for $5,000 or more to the unions to get the jobs. Sabotage was happening on these sites. It was about control and bullying, and that's all they're used to.


On jobs: he talks about the penalty rates. What about the unions and their EBA agreements? What about those? Your agreements were paying a lot of these workers in the smaller hotel and motel chains $10 less an hour. What about those in the supermarkets—again, $8 to $10 less an hour, and you talk about your enterprise agreement bargaining and what you've done. What about the 457 workers? You're actually talking about jobs here in Australia. Under Labor, wasn't it the highest 457 number—130,000, plus the families? What about all that? And you talk about workers!


What happened to the TAFE colleges when Labor were in? Labor are in Queensland as well and across the country. Where are all the TAFE colleges? You've shut them down. Now, as rhetoric, the same old rhetoric, you'll drag it out: 'Labor are going to open up the TAFE colleges, and we're going to do all this.' It's all lip-service again, as usual, from the Labor Party. Your words are a pittance to me because I don't believe a word that you say about looking after the workers in this country, which you haven't done.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Bernardi
):  You should address your comments to the chair, Senator Hanson.




Senator HANSON:
  I do apologise—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Thank you.




Senator HANSON:
  to the chair. There's a lot more here that we need to address.


When Senator Cameron stands up and makes these comments, Mr Acting Deputy President, I just shudder. I remember that in 1996, the first time I stood for an election, I went to a meeting. It was then Terry Mackenroth—yes, a Labor minister. They were determined to destroy the nursing industry, cut the numbers down. This was Labor's intent. They were not interested in supporting our nurses or apprenticeships. They've done nothing to encourage it, and that's why we've had such a fall.


I've been able to manage to get an increase, an apprenticeships pilot scheme that will be up and running in Australia. And yet they still criticise me over it because I've been able to get it: 'We can't allow One Nation to get ahead of us with this one.' They're starting to realise what the Australian public want.


You'll only get good government when you've got good opposition, and I don't see that on the other side of this chamber from the Labor Party, ever. Whenever they've been in government in this country, all they've done is destroy this country with their economic madness, and they cannot manage anything.


With this bill today, I will support a correction in the legislation that protects the identity of those employers who hire them.

"Hinch, Sen Derryn",DHJP,2018-09-19,"



Senator HINCH
 (Victoria) (10:18):  I cannot support the Treasury Laws Amendment (Working Holiday Maker Employer Register) Bill 2017, which has Senator Leyonhjelm's fingerprints all over it. I sat in my office with the mother of a backpacker murdered in Queensland who had been exploited and treated very shabbily by unscrupulous farm and orchard employers. Her story, her plight, does not directly connect to this bill, but her mother recounted stories to me from other backpackers who desperately need the physical and financial protections that this public register partially provides. Taking it private, making it confidential, would be, in my mind, a travesty.


Earlier this year, I met up with Englishwoman Rosie Ayliffe, the heartbroken mother of Mia Ayliffe. In August 2016, while working her required 88 days on a farm in North Queensland, Mia was stabbed to death while sleeping in her bed, murdered by another worker with a history of mental instability. The employer had locked the gates of the compound where she was staying, meaning that, even if she'd tried to escape, she would not have been able to. I know that this bill would not have prevented Mia's death, but it would have enabled her to know that she was going to a registered and reputable employer.


Then there's the case of Natalie. In 2013, after completing her time as an au pair, she decided to stay a little longer in Australia. That was when 'au pair' wasn't a dirty word. In order to qualify for her second visa, she had to complete those 88 days of farm work. She went on Gumtree and found a sheep farmer advertising a role for his farm on Kangaroo Island. She contacted him directly, searched him on Facebook, searched the company on Facebook and found nothing suspicious. He told her he had other people working there, including other backpackers, and that he had a partner.


Natalie flew in to Tasmania late at night from Adelaide and he picked her up. He was drunk. After swerving all the way home they arrived at the farm, 20 kilometres away from the nearest town, only for Natalie to find out there was nobody else there, not a single other soul except the drunk employer and her. She was isolated with no phone service and no wi-fi. He had a code on his landline so she couldn't dial out. For the next 15 days she was subjected to verbal abuse and the farmer slaughtered lambs in front of her because 'That's what I do when I'm angry.' Luckily, Natalie has an IT background. She was eventually able to hack into his wi-fi, call the police and get off the island. Not remarkably, this farmer was already known to police.


I know that vulnerable employees are having their 88 days drawn out. They are sent to work and stay in hostels, which they have to pay for, often owned by the employer. They are told that work will be coming up very soon. Sometimes those 88 days have been drawn out for as long as six months. And they are paying for it. I have heard how female backpackers have got suspicious because the pretty ones were getting work and the less attractive ones were not. I have heard of girls being told they must have sexual relations with the employer if they want him to sign off on, to verify, the 88 days. That is disgusting.


That's why I cannot support this attempt to lessen protections for workers and not enhance them. The public register gives some protection—not a lot, but some—to workers. This retrograde bill will certainly not.

Senator SESELJA
 (Australian Capital Territory—Assistant Minister for Treasury and Finance) (10:21):  I'd like to thank those senators who have contributed to this debate on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Working Holiday Maker Employer Register) Bill 2017. The government recognises that working holiday-makers are an important part of Australia's tourism industry and a key source of labour, particularly in the agriculture, horticulture, tourism and hospitality sectors.


This bill ensures the details of the working holiday-maker employer register are not made public, and it restores provisions regarding information sharing between the ATO and the Fair Work Ombudsman to what they were prior to the changes made by the Treasury Laws Amendment (Working Holiday Maker Reform) Act 2016. All employers of working holiday-makers will still be required to register with the Australian Taxation Office. Registered employers will be able to withhold tax at the new working holiday-maker tax rate of 15 per cent from the first dollar of income up to $37,000. Once registered, employers can advise current and prospective working holiday-maker employees that they are registered and are able to withhold tax at the new working holiday-maker tax rate of 15 per cent from the first dollar of income up to $37,000.


The register addresses concerns about the exploitation of working holiday-makers and will provide valuable data on who employs working holiday-makers, what sectors they are engaged in and where employers are located. This amendment does not affect the requirement for the Australian Taxation Office to report this information annually to the Treasurer for presentation to the parliament. This reporting process involves aggregate employer information and will not identify any working holiday-maker employers.


This bill also restores provisions regarding information sharing between the ATO and the Fair Work Ombudsman to what they were prior to the changes made by the Treasury Laws Amendment (Working Holiday Maker Reform) Act 2016. Information sharing between the ATO and the Fair Work Ombudsman will be limited to situations where an entity is actually or reasonably suspected of noncompliance with the tax law. This bill is part of a broader package of reforms to ensure that Australia remains an attractive and safe destination for working holiday-makers, and I commend the bill to the Senate.



The PRESIDENT:  The question is that the bill be read a second time.

"Whish-Wilson, Sen Peter",AG,2018-09-19,"



Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (10:31):  I have a couple of questions I wanted to put to the government, but could I just start by saying Centre Alliance didn't give a second reading speech in this place. They didn't give a second reading speech. Have no doubt: this is the government reneging on the backpacker deal that we did in the Senate in the summer of 2016, which ex-Senator Xenophon and his team signed off on. Where is Centre Alliance? Why did they support the government in a retrograde step to reduce worker protections? Why did they support a deal that the government did with Senator Leyonhjelm? What did they get out of it? If you ever need evidence that Centre Alliance aren't all they make themselves out to be—some kind of progressive influence in the Australian Senate—just look what they've done today. I'd also like you to look at what they did by supporting the government on gutting marine protections just a month ago with no real reason. Nevertheless, they should come into this place during this Committee of the Whole stage and explain why they have supported removing an integral part of the deal that was done on the backpacker tax in 2016. I will get back to that a little bit later.


Minister, I have got a couple of questions for you. Actually, Minister, you weren't in here during my speech on the second reading, but I'll go through a little bit more detail for you. Firstly, we've seen two questions on notice—No. 196 from the Senate Economics Legislation Committee supplementary budgets estimates 2017-18 and No. 68 from the Senate Economics Legislation Committee budget estimates 2018-19—where the Registrar of the Australian Business Register and ATO commissioner have the discretion to make certain information publicly available, and the registrar had chosen not to make an employer's working holiday-maker registration publicly available on two occasions. Basically, the then Treasurer, Scott Morrison, said in his second reading speech that he would make the register public, so can you explain why the ATO has chosen not to make these registers publicly available since the legislation passed? And did you, Minister, or your government instruct the ATO not to make these registers public?

Senator SESELJA
 (Australian Capital Territory—Assistant Minister for Treasury and Finance) (10:33):  The answer to the second question is no. The ATO commissioner exercised his discretion not to make an employer's working holiday-maker registration publicly available on the register. In addition, whilst information on individual working holiday-maker employers is not publicly available, the ATO is required to prepare an annual report about the employment of working holiday-makers, and the ATO's first report was tabled in parliament on 22 August 2018.

"Cameron, Sen Doug",ALP,2018-09-19,"



Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (10:34):  I think we have to consider what has just happened here. We now have an absolute disgrace of a government—a government that their own Prime Minister describes as muppets—coming together with One Nation and with Senator Hanson, whose speech was incomprehensible. It was absolutely incomprehensible. I just don't get it. Why would One Nation and this decaying government attack defenceless workers in this country? Even worse, there is the involvement of the so-called Centre Alliance, the former Xenophon party. One thing you can say about former Senator Xenophon is that at least he treated issues seriously. The Centre Alliance senators don't seem to have any rhyme or reason about them at all. Why would Centre Alliance attack backpackers? Backpackers are defenceless when they come to this country and they have been exploited continually by farmers, by contract companies and by gangs in this country. As you heard in Senator Hinch's speech, some of them are being sexually abused and sexually harassed. It is a nonsense. I think that, as a nation, we owe it to the young people who are coming here on a working visa to protect them.


Yet, this government, because it has done some dirty deal with Senator Leyonhjelm, is prepared to throw the protections for young backpackers out of the window. The sooner we get to an election and the sooner the Australian people can have a say on getting a decent government in this country the better, because this government is now scraping the bottom of the barrel. To try to keep itself alive, to try and keep itself afloat, it's doing deals with Senator Leyonhjelm, with some of the most extreme views in this place. I just think the time for an election has come. We have a government that is described by its own leader as a bunch of muppets. What have we come to in this place? What is the problem with this rabble of a government that just can't seem to get an agenda together, that continually stabs its leader and that is always fighting? The Nationals don't like the Libs. The Libs don't like the Nationals. And the Libs don't like each other. That's what we've got now. That's the situation we have in this country.


We don't have any substantive legislation before this parliament. It's clear that they don't have an agenda. This new Prime Minister has no idea what he wants to do in terms of improving this nation. We've had the COAG meeting cancelled, a meeting that looks at trying to make things better for Australians across the country. Because this Prime Minister and this rabble of a government don't have an agenda, don't have a strategy and don't have a plan for the future, what they are doing is simply cancelling a meeting. It's an absolute disgrace.


And they have to cuddle up to One Nation to get legislation through. They have to make concessions to a party that espouses racism, a party that would come in here and simply attack other nationalities in this country, a party whose leader can't put two words together without reading them—and even then can't read them effectively or properly. That's what we've come to under this government—relying on a senator who is incomprehensible; a senator who attacks other nationalities; a senator who has become rich off the back of the electoral system in this country; a senator who can't even keep her own team together; and a senator who simply looks after No.1. That's what we've come to—and the government depend on One Nation.


One Nation and this government are well matched. You know, Senator Hanson was a Liberal. Senator Hanson was a Liberal who was thrown out of the Liberal Party because of her so-called extreme views. Well, Senator Hanson hasn't moved. She's still got the extreme views. It's just that nobody on the other side has got the backbone, nobody has got the bottle and nobody has got the principles to actually stand up to her and her racist positions that her party adopts. It's an absolute disgrace.


This is a government that just don't get it. This country is crying out for leadership. This country is crying out to get a decent health system and a decent education system, and to get rid of an industrial system that has seen wage stagnation and families battling to put food on their table. Are we debating any of those issues in this place? No, we are not. What we are debating now is how you make it harder for young people coming to this country who are in a vulnerable situation. The Nationals, the Liberal Party, One Nation and Centre Alliance have banded together to make it harder for working people in this country. It's just about time that they conceded that they can't govern, they won't govern.


All the three-word slogans that you can think up and all the evangelistic speeches that you can make just won't cut it, because this government are in complete chaos. This government have got no agenda. The reason this bill is on is that they've run out of bills that would make this country a better place. They can't think about it, because they're too busy carving each other up. They are too busy stabbing each other in the back. They are too busy bullying women in their own party. Is it any wonder that women won't join the party? 


And, imagine, Senator Reynolds stood up here and made this great speech about bullying. Senator Reynolds gets a promotion, and that's her. She becomes mute—becomes absolutely mute on the issues that she claimed that she was standing up for. They have got no principles. They have got no capacity. They are an absolute disgrace of a government.


We know what's going to happen after the next election—we've seen it: there'll be fewer women in that party. We've had senators, we've had MPs, stand up and talk about bullying, and yet when they've got a chance to do something about it, what do they do? They take a promotion, and they go quietly. What a joke. That shows you how decaying the government are. That shows you how bad the government are. It just shows you that they have got no agenda. They've got no respect for each other—absolutely no respect for each other, never mind having any respect for the population of this country. 


All they want to do is crawl over each other to try to get on the front bench, backstab each other, destroy their own Prime Minister because their extremist views on climate change have to be the dominant position. They don't care about young people in this country. They don't care about climate change. They don't care about decent industrial rights. They don't care about a decent health system. They don't care about a decent education system. All they want to do is kowtow to the big end of town and stab each other in the back; that's the basis of this government. They are absolutely pathetic. And when your own Prime Minister describes you as 'muppets', it doesn't leave much room for a defence, does it? Because Prime Minister Morrison actually got it right—they are a bunch of muppets.


If you look back at what this government was about, in 2014 it brought a budget down that attacked pensioners. It brought a budget down that attacked families and family benefits, and it brought a budget down that would increase retirement to 70. It's okay, if you're sitting here on these comfortable benches at 70 years old getting a $200,000-a-year base wage, to say to somebody who's on a building site or to a fitter or a rigger that they should work until they're 70. But these people don't have a clue what it's like for ordinary working people. They just don't get it. They are so divorced from reality that all they want to do is carve each other up. I mean, the muppets look sensible compared to this lot. At least you can get a laugh at the muppets. You can laugh at this lot, but I tell you, while you're laughing, this country's going down the tube because they have got no capacity to deliver for Australian people.


This is a government that is decaying. It's a government that is absolutely on its last legs. It's a government that doesn't have an agenda. All those opposite do is sit over there and, with the extremists in One Nation and the Liberal Democrats, attack working people. That's what they do. This is not what Australians want from a government. They want a government that can actually make things better and build a decent society in this country.


We've got a Prime Minister who has got there by default. We know the extremists wanted a different Prime Minister. We know the leaks are still coming from the cabinet in this government. We know that those people who have been denied the opportunity to get on the front bench are going to do everything to continue to destabilise this government. We know that this government is just hopeless. Those opposite are absolutely hopeless. They don't have a legislative agenda to come here, so what do they do? They attack the rights of backpackers—young, vulnerable backpackers—to get protection. What a pathetic mob. What a pathetic rabble of a government. No wonder people just shake their heads when they talk about this so-called government. These were the people that were going to be the grown-ups. Well, have you seen any grown-up behaviour? I know what grown-ups do—they protect young people. These so-called grown-ups have just attacked young people who are vulnerable, young people who depend on decent laws in this country to give them a fair go. But you won't get a fair go from the muppets across here. You won't get a fair go from this decaying government. Those opposite are just pathetic, and this bill shows it in stark reasoning. They are pathetic.

Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (10:49):  Could I go back to the discretion that the ATO commissioner has around the release of the Australian Business Register? I understand that discretion, to make details of employers of working holiday-makers available or not, came via an amendment to the ABN act, in schedule 2 of Treasury Laws Amendment (Working Holiday Maker Reform) Act 2016. Minister, could you just refresh my memory as to when that amendment went through parliament?


Also the ATO made a comment that the register has chosen, in other words it has used its discretion, not to make these details publicly available because of 'concerns raised in the community about the privacy of this information'. Can the minister now outline to the chamber whose concerns and the details of that?

Now, I don't know: has Senator Leyonhjelm had a discussion, a personal conversation, with the ATO commissioner? He's not in here. Has he written to the ATO commissioner requesting that this not be released?

 (Tasmania) (10:56):  I'll read it again for the chamber. The minister wasn't here during my second reading speech. Let me read you an extract from the now Prime Minister's—Mr Scott Morrison—second reading speech. He stated:


The register will be made public, with a list of registered employers published on the ABN Lookup, making it easy for working holiday-makers and others to check the registration status of a potential employer.


Just to refresh the memory of the chamber—and you weren't here, Minister Seselja—the critical reason for this is: if you don't register, then the businesses that aren't registered have to extract 32½c in a dollar from their foreign workers. The registered businesses are 15 per cent, plus they're registered to give more of the superannuation of these foreign workers back to them to go in their pocket when they continue their holiday or when they leave this country and continue their holiday.


Minister Seselja, did the now Prime Minister mislead parliament when he said this was going to be made public, knowing that it would never be made public, or is there another reason this register hasn't been made public, as was set out in the legislation that the Senate voted on? Let's not underestimate how important this vote was at the end of the day for your government to get this deal done, let alone the importance for foreign workers to give them any protections we could and, of course, to give the certainty that we needed for agricultural employers in this country to get on with business and support agriculture and exports.

"Cameron, Sen Doug",ALP,2018-09-19,"



Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (09:31):  Here we are with a bill brought on in a rush, in a hurry, by a government that is an absolute rabble. The Treasury Laws Amendment (Working Holiday Maker Employer Register) Bill 2017 is part of a deal between this rabble of a government and Senator Leyonhjelm to take away some protection for migrant workers in this country. What an absolute joke! We know this government is scraping the bottom of the barrel to try and get legislation before this place. We know it doesn't have an agenda. We know it has a Prime Minister who doesn't know what he's got to do, a Prime Minister with the L-plates up, a Prime Minister who is just in this job because another Liberal Prime Minister has been knifed in the back. We have ended up with this legislation as part of a deal with Senator Leyonhjelm to take away some protection for migrant workers in this country.


This bill removes the requirement for the public listing on the Australian Business Register of businesses that employ working holiday-makers, winding back a transparency measure in the original package. As part of worker protection that was included in the package passed by parliament in 2016, there was a requirement that a legislative framework be set up allowing the Commissioner of Taxation to establish a mandatory registration process for employers of working holiday-makers. This allowed the date of effect of an employer's registration to be made publicly available on the Australian Business Register. Effectively this was to allow visa holders to check the public register to see if a business is registered for employing working holiday-makers, to allow them to make sure a potential employer is in fact a legitimate business. It provided a public register of the companies that were employing the 200,000 visa holders, where there was no public register previously. The register addressed concerns about the exploitation of working holiday-makers and would provide valuable data on working holiday-makers. 


It's similarly reprehensible that the Morrison government—and when you talk about a Morrison government, it's really an inverted commas 'government'; it's not much of a government; it's got no agenda; it's got no capacity to focus on the issues that are important for Australians—this rabble of a government, wants to down a measure that helps ensure employers remit the right amount of tax to the tax office on behalf of those workers. The government, with this bill, is actively and willingly increasing the risk of tax non-compliance. What a joke! What an absolute joke! The bill will rip up the ability of a working holiday-maker to look up the details of an employer on the register for employing working holiday-makers, affecting their ability to choose an employer who will comply with tax laws. Both of these provisions in the original bill meant that there was some possibility of greater protection from exploitation for working holiday-makers. Given the significant cases of worker exploitation in this area, we strongly recommend that this tawdry bill be rejected. Labor has consistently stated our commitment to transparency, particularly in areas that can help reduce exploitation of vulnerable workers.


So this is where we are. Instead of fixing aged care or restoring penalty rates, the government is asking us to debate the merits of whether or not working holiday-makers will have access to information about potential employers. Instead of fighting fraudulent phoenix activity or tackling tax havens, the Morrison government would rather have us debate the merits of whether or not working holiday-makers should face an increased risk of exploitation. Well, they shouldn't face an increased risk of exploitation. It's an absolute nonsense that we've got a mob sitting across the chamber, calling themselves a government, that would support further exploitation of vulnerable workers in this country. But it doesn't surprise me. Anything that supports workers would not be supported by this government. Remember Work Choices? Remember the ABCC? Remember the ROC? Remember that minister, Senator Cash, who misled parliament on five occasions, who's the subject of a Federal Police investigation, who refuses to work effectively with the Federal Police to get to the bottom of what's going on? Is it any surprise that migrant workers are at the bottom of the list for this mob? Is it any surprise that they would rather have farmers in this country exploit workers? Is it any surprise they would have criminal gangs, as exposed on Four Corners, exploit migrant workers, having them live in terrible conditions and now not having a support mechanism available to them so that they can test whether theirs is a reasonable employer and an employer that meets their legal obligations?


It's not just Labor that's concerned about this. The Salvation Army, the Uniting Church, and the Tax Justice Network oppose this bill. For the benefit of the Senate, let's briefly look at where the government has come from. Former Treasurer Morrison, in a media release around the time of the original legislation, stated that backpackers could look up employers via ABN Lookup, making the register publicly accessible. Not long after that, the government introduced this bill to the House, and Fairfax reported, in early 2017:


A spokesman for the Treasurer Scott Morrison said the bill was proposed by Senator Leyonhjelm.


""The government agreed to introduce the amendment after reaching an agreement with the senator to pass the original WYHM legislation. The government will honour its commitment,"" the spokesman said.


""This commitment did not extend to the successful passage of the amendment. 


""The government is committed to protecting the rights of backpackers and protecting them from exploitation. …""


We really are at the bottom of the barrel. The spokesperson for the Prime Minister, who was the Treasurer at the time, indicated that this was simply about doing a deal with Senator Leyonhjelm. You should not be using vulnerable workers as part of a deal with the extremists in the Senate. Senator Leyonhjelm has got some of the most extreme views in the Senate.


Senator Leyonhjelm is always interested in small government, except when it comes to paying his wages. There's no small government when he's picking up his pay cheque every month. There's no small government when it comes to the perks of being a senator. There's no small government when it comes to making sure that his nose is in the trough. There's no small government when it comes to making sure that Senator Leyonhjelm's looked after. But when it comes to looking after vulnerable workers, vulnerable people, then government has to be small. When it comes to making sure that we've got a decent health system, government's got to be small. When it comes to a decent education system, according to Senator Leyonhjelm, government's got to be small. So it's big government when it's looking after his mates in the tobacco industry and it's big government when it comes to looking after Senator Leyonhjelm, but it's small government when it comes to looking after vulnerable workers.


This bill is an absolute nonsense. I would invite anyone who wants to deal with this bill, who's thinking about supporting this bill, to go back to the Four Corners transcript of Monday, 4 May 2015, where it outlined the slave labour that was going on in the Queensland rural sector. A Queensland grower said that there is slave labour in this country. So what Senator Leyonhjelm is proposing is that you hide the slave labour so that you don't get a union knocking on your door to try and make sure that decent wages and conditions are being paid. What an absolute joke! What an absolute pathetic position to be putting to this Senate.


Any time you see Senator Leyonhjelm standing up with his grandiose ideas, with all the nonsense he goes on about, then look at what he is prepared to do to vulnerable workers in this country. He is prepared to have them ripped off. It's an absolute joke. We've got nearly mafia-life exploitation of some of these workers. And then when a modest position comes in place to support those workers, we'll get Senator Leyonhjelm supporting it. We've got the government actually providing a process to bring this to the Senate. What an absolute joke this is. You should be ashamed of yourself, Senator Leyonhjelm, for bringing this to this place. You should be absolutely ashamed of yourself.


It's no use having a bit of a laugh with Senator Hanson. This is a serious issue. This is about looking after exploited workers. This is about making sure that they've got a decent right in this country and know who employers are employing. It's about making sure that these companies are paying proper taxation. So we take the view that this should be rejected. We are determined to oppose this bill, and anyone of any decency in this chamber would be opposing this bill.


I am disgusted that the coalition has allowed this to come forward to exploit workers just because they've done another grubby deal to try and save their own necks—a dying government, a decaying government, a government that their own Prime Minister describes as muppets. If there ever were a muppet show, look at what's going on here. The muppets have allowed this to be brought to the Senate to exploit ordinary working people. This is a disgraceful government. This is a chaotic government. This is a government on its last legs. This is a government that should actually go to the people and let the people make a decision whether they want decency in government and whether they want a government that will look after the exploited in this country.


This is another demonstration that workers' rights in this country mean nothing under this coalition. They mean nothing. When Senator Leyonhjelm is leading the government by the nose to exploit workers, then that is the bottom of the barrel. This government is at the bottom of the barrel. It is a government that doesn't care about workers' rights. It is a government that attacks workers' rights. It is a government that does dirty deals to ensure that ordinary workers can get ripped off and migrant workers can get ripped off. This bill is a disgrace and should be opposed.

"Leyonhjelm, Sen David",LDP,2018-09-19,"



Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (09:45):  I rise to support the Treasury Laws Amendment (Working Holiday Maker Employer Register) Bill 2017. I see this bill as a finalisation of the government's backpacker tax package of 2016. The government's backpacker tax package passed in late 2016, albeit with a hiccup on 30 November 2016. By November 2016, the government had the support of the then Xenophon Team of three senators provided that a program to encourage unemployed youth to do seasonal work was subsequently implemented. That program has since been implemented. By 30 November 2016, the government had the support of Pauline Hanson's One Nation provided that the tax rate on working holiday-makers was reduced from 19 per cent to 15 per cent. And by 30 November 2016 the government believed it had Senator Hinch's support, too. The government knew it did not have my support at that time because the backpacker tax package included some violations of taxpayer privacy and because I considered that even a 15 per cent tax rate was excessive. That's still my view, incidentally, and I think Labor's agriculture shadow minister would agree with me.


Then, on 30 November 2016, Senator Hinch joined Senator Culleton and others to vote for a 10.5 per cent tax rate, instead of a 15 per cent tax rate. So it was a 10.5 per cent tax rate that passed the Senate, much to the dismay of the government. Treasurer Morrison came to my office asking if there was any way I could support the backpacker tax package at 15 per cent. I reluctantly agreed to support the package if the violations of taxpayer privacy were removed. Having secured this deal, the government brought that part of the backpacker tax package dealing with the tax rate back to the Senate on 1 December 2016, and a 15 per cent tax rate was finally passed.


The part of the backpacker tax package that included the violations of taxpayer privacy had already passed both houses, so it was not returned to the Senate on 1 December 2016. Instead, to fix the violations of taxpayer privacy we needed new legislation, hence the bill we are debating today, the Treasury Laws Amendment (Working Holiday Maker Employer Register) Bill 2017. I thank the government for bringing this bill to the Senate.


This bill removes a provision allowing the Australian Taxation Office to publicise on the Australian Business Register an individual employer's intention to hire working holiday-makers. The ATO has not used this power to date, given that the bill has been on the Notice Paper. Forcing the publication on the Australian Business Register of an individual employer's intention to hire working holiday-makers is a recipe for the Australian Workers' Union to harass that individual employer. Farmers are mostly small businesses—individual family businesses. They have enough problems with droughts, floods and even needles in strawberries without Senator Cameron's bovver-boy mates knocking on the door. Employers will be free to continue to publicise their intentions to hire working holiday-makers through sites frequented by prospective working holiday-makers. It will come as no surprise that working holiday-makers tend not to peruse the Australian Business Register. General reporting about working holiday-makers and employers who hire them is unaffected by this bill.


This bill also reverts to the previous rule protecting personal financial information provided by a taxpayer to the ATO, so that the ATO can provide this information to the employment department without breaching secrecy provisions only if the taxpayer is actually or reasonably suspected of noncompliance with a taxation law. Because this bill has been on the Notice Paper, the ATO is currently divulging information consistent with the previous rule, rather than divulging information more broadly. This is a protection of the personal financial information of law-abiding taxpayers and it should continue.


I expect Labor and the Greens will make outlandish claims about this bill, but this is a simple and modest bill. It ensures that the protection on taxpayer privacy in place on 30 November 2016 remains. It represents the finalisation of a backpacker tax package that the Senate agreed to on 1 December 2016. I commend the bill to the Senate.

"Whish-Wilson, Sen Peter",AG,2018-09-19,"



Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (09:50):  This Treasury Laws Amendment (Working Holiday Maker Employer Register) Bill 2017 is bizarre; it's completely bizarre and completely reflective of a government that doesn't know what it's doing. We thought the backpacker tax fiasco was dead, buried and cremated, but here we have it rising from the ashes again today in the form of a most unusual backflip by the government, seemingly for Senator Leyonhjelm's benefit, and we can only wonder at what kind of deals have been done behind closed doors.


Through this bill, the government is bringing forward legislation to repeal its own legislation, which is less than two years old, to honour a deal that they didn't end up doing. I will repeat that again: through this bill, this government is bringing forward legislation to repeal its own legislation, which is less than two years old, to honour a deal they didn't do.




Senator Cameron:
  Because they're a rabble!




Senator WHISH-WILSON:
  Well, they are a rabble. I can't say it with quite the intonation that Senator Cameron can, but absolutely they are a rabble. Senators, let's reflect on what happened around the backpacker fiasco. It was leading into the Christmas holidays. We were all looking forward to it—talk about a rabble—after an absolutely shambolic double-dissolution, going into Christmas of 2016. What did we have? We had a seemingly obscure piece of legislation around changing the tax rate for backpackers. It nearly brought the government down and it nearly brought down the Prime Minister at the time. That's how serious this was. That's how it snowballed into an absolute fiasco for the government.


We had a situation where, in a tax grab, a revenue grab—and it wasn't very much revenue either, by the way; we're talking about only a very small amount of money—the government decided in their budget to go after foreign workers. They decided to go after foreign workers, who, for all intents and purposes, were working on short-term visas—holiday visas—in Australia, helping Australian businesses pick their fruit, which is very important in my home state of Tasmania. The government basically said, 'You're not paying any tax while you're here. We're going to levy a 32.5 per cent tax rate on the money you're going to earn.' There were existing exemptions and loopholes and all sorts of accusations of rorting of the system, but the employers, the National Farmers' Federation, clearly told us senators—and as a Tasmanian senator I had discussions with all the stakeholders—that the system was working. They were able to source the labour they needed to pick their fruit and stay in business. The system was working because Australia was an attractive destination. They not only came here for a holiday but for a working holiday, and there was work available. They were able, effectively, to get more money in their pocket, because of the way the tax laws were, and therefore we were very competitive compared to our friends across the ditch in New Zealand, and to other places. So, the government set a 32.5 per cent tax rate and there were going to be no negotiations on that.


When it was clear that they didn't have the support in the Senate the government decide to bring in a tax rate of 19 per cent. They weren't going to budge, and they weren't going to negotiate. They'd already compromised, so that's what it was going to be. Of course, senators in this place got together, and they talked to employers again, and a new proposition was put up on multiple fronts—I think One Nation put up a proposition; the previous Senator Lambie certainly put up a proposition—and the Senate passed a 10.5 per cent tax rate for foreign workers. The Greens, at that point, had a really clear position. We wanted the system to stay the way it was. We didn't want foreign workers to pay any tax while they were here, because they were benefiting our economy, they were benefiting our community and they were spending most of their money here anyway. They were earning on their working holiday money that they were spending in this country. We were pretty happy with the way it was, so we didn't support changing the tax rate at all. We had a very clear position all the way through.


The government weren't going to come at 10.5 per cent, so what did they do? They dropped their required tax rate to 15 per cent. So it was 15 per cent, and that was it. Just as they'd said the other two times, they were not going to negotiate on 15 per cent. That was the base rate. I can understand, if you're the government and you're in charge of a country, why you wouldn't want to negotiate legislation by auction, and not just by auction but by very public auction. If it wasn't clear to Australians after the double dissolution that the government had lost control it certainly was going into Christmas 2016, because legislation was up for a very public auction.


As a Tasmanian senator, I could see my state of Tasmania on its knees—and ultimately we're here as senators for our states. It was desperation stakes. Where I come from, in the Tamar Valley in Tasmania, it's all fruit growing operations. As some of you may be aware, I planted a small vineyard of three hectares many years before I came into the Senate. I relied on fruit pickers. Everybody in my state in the agricultural industry relies on foreign workers, mostly on working holiday visas. As I've said in the Senate, I had a fantastic pair of rock climbers, two fantastic guys from Patagonia, who were staying on our farm and picking fruit. They were working in all sorts of different businesses. We've been lifelong friends ever since. This is absolutely critical to Tasmania.


I felt very strongly, and I know Senator Rice and others in the party room who come from states that have large agricultural industries felt very strongly, that we couldn't let this go on over Christmas. We were getting the very clear signal that businesses weren't able to employ people because people weren't coming. The numbers were down significantly because of the uncertainty that had been introduced for what was essentially, in the beginning, a small tax grab. It snowballed, and there was a stampede away from Australia on the back of this stupidity. That's what it was. At the end of the day, the Greens were the adult in the room. We sat down with Senator Cormann, and we negotiated what we thought was a way forward for everybody. We got the best possible deal we could for foreign workers, although they paid a 15 per cent headline rate, which the government at that stage refused to negotiate on. They were paying 95 per cent of their superannuation when they left this country into a fund that went back to the government. Foreign workers were only getting five per cent of their super back. So we proposed to the government that they change that 95 per cent rate to a rate that gave an equivalent effective tax rate of 10½ per cent. At that point it worked out to be that 65 per cent of their super would be paid to the government, so foreign workers got over a third of their super back in their pockets when they left. So workers got the 10½ per cent rate, the government got to save face and keep its 15 per cent headline rate and the Greens also negotiated a desperately needed $100 million for Landcare. We need a lot more than that, but we negotiated that deal. It was a good deal for foreign workers. It was universally applauded by employer groups, by the National Farmers' Federation and by many businesses, including in my home state of Tasmania. Although we'd have liked to have seen no tax at all paid by foreign workers while they were here, it has turned out to still be an effective, competitive tax rate for backpackers.


Let's get back to this totally bizarre piece of legislation. How did we get here today? Part of the backpacker tax package passed by this parliament involved establishing a public register of employers. The explanatory memorandum of the original bill, the Treasury Laws Amendment (Working Holiday Maker Reform) Bill 2016 states:


The ATO will develop a simple registration process for employers who need to withhold tax from WHMs.


WHMs are working holiday-makers. The explanatory memorandum continues:


Information as to who is a registered employer for this purpose will be publicly available. This will incentivise employers to register in order to attract WHMs, since unregistered employers will be required to withhold at the 32.5 per cent rate from the first dollar of income.


Keep in mind that that 32½ per cent rate is not competitive. That will not bring in foreign workers to work in the businesses where we need them. We were absolutely confident about that. It would be a total disincentive to potential employees. So this was to be avoided. The explanatory memorandum continues:


The register will assist with enforcing compliance and will provide data that can be used to help inform future policy related to WHMs.


The then Treasurer, now Prime Minister, in his second reading speech, stated:


The register will be made public, with a list of registered employers published on the ABN Lookup, making it easy for working holiday-makers and others to check the registration status of a potential employer.


But, in the process of trying to get the bill through parliament, it would appear that Senator Leyonhjelm extracted a commitment from the government not to make the register public. Presumably he got this concession when the government thought they needed his vote. In the end, they didn't need his vote, and legislation was passed that would allow for the register to be made public. But, not three months later, government introduced this bill to repeal their own legislation, on a deal that they didn't even do. Of course—I don't know—there may have been other deals done around this. That's very possible.


This bill has been sitting in the parliament ever since then. This bill has, it would appear, been cause for the ATO not to act to make the register public. The answer to question on notice No. 196 from the Senate Economics Legislation Committee at supplementary budget estimates 2017-18 says:


As Registrar of the Australian Business Register, the Commissioner has the discretion to make certain information publicly available.


The Registrar has chosen not to make an employer's working holiday maker registration publicly available.


In other words, even though this legislation passed this place and there was a very good reason for this register—the register was there to protect working holiday-makers in this country—it wasn't made public. The answer to another question on notice to the Senate Economics Legislation Committee, No. 68 at budget estimates 2018-19, says:


The Commissioner, in his role as Registrar of the ABR, received discretion to make details of employers of working holiday makers publicly available on 2 December 2016 via an amendment to the ABN Act Schedule 2 of Treasury Laws Amendment (Working Holiday Maker Reform) Act 2016.


The Registrar has chosen not to make these details publicly available to address concerns raised in the community about the privacy of this information.


Really? Who in the community has raised these concerns about the privacy of information, apart from Senator Leyonhjelm?


Senator Leyonhjelm is, out and proud, a libertarian, and this is important to him and the people he represents. I don't know how many of them there are. But who else? Who else is the proxy for concerns raised in the community about privacy of this information? Was it the businesses themselves who didn't want to disclose the effective tax rates that they were levying off foreign workers? That's something we can ask in committee, because I'm interested to know who else has raised these issues with the minister and the minister's office apart from Senator Leyonhjelm.


The last thing I'd like to address is why the government hasn't brought this bill forward before now, especially considering the fact that they haven't disclosed this register anyway. They haven't protected foreign workers. They haven't made it easy for foreign workers to detect and determine which employers would be the best employers to work for in terms of how they're going to be paid. Why would I want to go and work for a business that's going to charge me 32.5 per cent when I could get 15 per cent from a business on a register and I can make that decision? If I'm on a working holiday, obviously these decisions are going to be very important. I'm going to be looking at where I'm going to work geographically. I'm going to be determining my choice of employment not just on things like tax rates but on where I want to go for my holiday and what I want to do around my holiday. My two friends from Patagonia, who started on our farm in Tasmania, chose Tasmania because they were rock climbers and there was plenty of work. We were desperately seeking workers in the summer of 2016. Our registrations—I checked this with working holiday businesses who matched the demand and supply—were down more than a third that summer because of this backpacker fiasco. It was a totally unnecessary fiasco, based on a quick tax grab by a government without giving any thought to the uncertainty this would cause to the agricultural industry in Australia. It was an absolute fiasco.


I say this personally: I, as a Tasmanian senator, felt that it was very important to get a deal done and certainty for Tasmanian businesses, and for the workers. If we had let it go to Christmas they would have been slugged 32½ per cent. And Tasmanian pickers and businesses weren't able to find workers. I got a lot of attacks. That's probably a good way to describe it. I would like to use an expletive, but I know the Acting Deputy President would pull me up on that. I got a lot of attacks that Christmas because we did a deal with the government and people felt like we'd let Mr Malcolm Turnbull and Mr Scott Morrison off the hook. This could have brought the Prime Minister down. It was that bad. It was that much of a fiasco. They had totally lost control of government over this bill. But it was absolutely critical, and my party room all supported this because we wanted to see the agricultural businesses get the employment they needed to keep going, and we wanted to see workers and foreign workers get the best possible deal and get certainty on this issue. That's why we came up with what was a very good compromise in the end for all parties involved.


We won't be supporting this bill. We want to see this register. It's absolutely critical that it's out in public and that workers get to choose and get the best information possible for their working holidays. When we go in committee, unless the minister deals with this in her second reader amendment, I'll be very interested to know who these other parties are that have complained about the privacy issues surrounding this public register.

"Hanson, Sen Pauline",PHON,2018-09-19,"



Senator HANSON
 (Queensland) (10:09):  One Nation will be supporting the Treasury Laws Amendment (Working Holiday Maker Employer Register) Bill 2017. I'm well aware of the Labor Party's position on this bill. They won't be supporting it because they're intent on harassing and victimising businesses who register as working holiday-makers' employers, particularly in the farming sector, which utilises backpackers for seasonal work.


Once upon a time Aussies would flock to picking jobs throughout the country. They would work in the strawberry fields on the Sunshine Coast for four months, or a bit longer if they were there for the planting of runners. Once that season had ended, they'd head off in different directions for other crops across the country. Some would head off to Darwin and pick mangoes. Others would go and do watermelons or pick tomatoes in Bundaberg. Some would go and pick blueberries in Coffs Harbour. But the Australian workforce that once travelled the country fruit picking have inevitably grown a bit older, and they're more focused on the grey nomad lifestyle. They haven't given up the travel, just the need to work.


Unfortunately, the generations of Aussies haven't kept up those traditions of fruit picking, and it's left growers in all fruit and vegetable industries short on farmhands. Call it generational change or call it a change in work ethic, but the reality is that Aussies are less interested in farm work, leaving farmers short on staff. That's why this government, and previous Labor governments, have allowed seasonal fruit picking to be done by backpackers.


I just ask why Labor would want to leave a loophole in our system for these farmers or seasonal work providers to be named and shamed. I find it ironic that the Labor Party are quite supportive of the Pacific Labour Scheme, which allows 2,000 workers from Pacific island nations like Nauru and Tuvalu to fill labour gaps in rural and regional Australia. The Pacific Labour Scheme isn't a short employment period either; it's for up to three years. So what's the difference between supporting the Pacific Labour Scheme, where employers' details aren't plastered online for Labor and their goons to name and shame, versus working holiday-makers?


Let's also point out a few other facts with these backpackers and the short stints they do to make sure our farming sector doesn't collapse. They pay tax from the very first dollar earned. We passed the backpacker tax in 2016, where backpackers pay 15 per cent on every dollar paid to them. As part of that legislative change, employers of working holiday-makers were required to be registered with the Commissioner of Taxation, which allowed employers to withhold the applicable tax. But it's in this very change that we find ourselves fixing up the problem.


Aussies won't do this sort of work, because it has unpredictable hours and the farmer doesn't know how long his season will last. The strawberry industry is a classic example of the uncertainty that farming work offers. It takes a few criminals to sabotage perfectly good fruit and scare the hell out of consumers, and, before you know it, their season has ended prematurely. Almost every single worker in the strawberry industry in Queensland has lost their job today. I think everyone in this country knows my stance on jobs for Australians, but work in certain industries like farming just doesn't appeal to Australians anymore.


You're lucky I'm not the Prime Minister, because I'd be a hard taskmaster. I'd force some of these dole bludgers, who haven't worked a day in their lives, to go out and pick fruit or cut their Centrelink payments. Could you imagine it if I managed to pull that off? I'd have the Greens all over me like a filthy rash because I dared make some of these bludgers work. Let's be honest, though. If you put some of these people on a farm, it would be a punishment to our farmers and an embarrassment to humanity. So in these circumstances I don't mind supporting backpackers working on farms, if Australians don't want to take up the jobs.


I can't let this time go by without responding to Senator Cameron, with his comments about the workers and the ABCC bill, the ROC bill and what's happened with workers in this country. What an absolutely hypocritical comment that was, because the ABCC bill was actually looking after those employers, who employ people. They were actually controlled by thuggery, mainly by the CFMEU and the unions, to shut them down. These building sites were costing the taxpayer an estimated 30 per cent more because of the thuggery from the unions, who would just go in there and shut them down and destroy small businesses. Or—the fact is—they'd say to the businesses, 'If you want the job, we want a cheque from you,' so they could be handing over a cheque for $5,000 or more to the unions to get the jobs. Sabotage was happening on these sites. It was about control and bullying, and that's all they're used to.


On jobs: he talks about the penalty rates. What about the unions and their EBA agreements? What about those? Your agreements were paying a lot of these workers in the smaller hotel and motel chains $10 less an hour. What about those in the supermarkets—again, $8 to $10 less an hour, and you talk about your enterprise agreement bargaining and what you've done. What about the 457 workers? You're actually talking about jobs here in Australia. Under Labor, wasn't it the highest 457 number—130,000, plus the families? What about all that? And you talk about workers!


What happened to the TAFE colleges when Labor were in? Labor are in Queensland as well and across the country. Where are all the TAFE colleges? You've shut them down. Now, as rhetoric, the same old rhetoric, you'll drag it out: 'Labor are going to open up the TAFE colleges, and we're going to do all this.' It's all lip-service again, as usual, from the Labor Party. Your words are a pittance to me because I don't believe a word that you say about looking after the workers in this country, which you haven't done.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Bernardi
):  You should address your comments to the chair, Senator Hanson.




Senator HANSON:
  I do apologise—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Thank you.




Senator HANSON:
  to the chair. There's a lot more here that we need to address.


When Senator Cameron stands up and makes these comments, Mr Acting Deputy President, I just shudder. I remember that in 1996, the first time I stood for an election, I went to a meeting. It was then Terry Mackenroth—yes, a Labor minister. They were determined to destroy the nursing industry, cut the numbers down. This was Labor's intent. They were not interested in supporting our nurses or apprenticeships. They've done nothing to encourage it, and that's why we've had such a fall.


I've been able to manage to get an increase, an apprenticeships pilot scheme that will be up and running in Australia. And yet they still criticise me over it because I've been able to get it: 'We can't allow One Nation to get ahead of us with this one.' They're starting to realise what the Australian public want.


You'll only get good government when you've got good opposition, and I don't see that on the other side of this chamber from the Labor Party, ever. Whenever they've been in government in this country, all they've done is destroy this country with their economic madness, and they cannot manage anything.


With this bill today, I will support a correction in the legislation that protects the identity of those employers who hire them.

Senator HINCH
 (Victoria) (10:18):  I cannot support the Treasury Laws Amendment (Working Holiday Maker Employer Register) Bill 2017, which has Senator Leyonhjelm's fingerprints all over it. I sat in my office with the mother of a backpacker murdered in Queensland who had been exploited and treated very shabbily by unscrupulous farm and orchard employers. Her story, her plight, does not directly connect to this bill, but her mother recounted stories to me from other backpackers who desperately need the physical and financial protections that this public register partially provides. Taking it private, making it confidential, would be, in my mind, a travesty.


Earlier this year, I met up with Englishwoman Rosie Ayliffe, the heartbroken mother of Mia Ayliffe. In August 2016, while working her required 88 days on a farm in North Queensland, Mia was stabbed to death while sleeping in her bed, murdered by another worker with a history of mental instability. The employer had locked the gates of the compound where she was staying, meaning that, even if she'd tried to escape, she would not have been able to. I know that this bill would not have prevented Mia's death, but it would have enabled her to know that she was going to a registered and reputable employer.


Then there's the case of Natalie. In 2013, after completing her time as an au pair, she decided to stay a little longer in Australia. That was when 'au pair' wasn't a dirty word. In order to qualify for her second visa, she had to complete those 88 days of farm work. She went on Gumtree and found a sheep farmer advertising a role for his farm on Kangaroo Island. She contacted him directly, searched him on Facebook, searched the company on Facebook and found nothing suspicious. He told her he had other people working there, including other backpackers, and that he had a partner.


Natalie flew in to Tasmania late at night from Adelaide and he picked her up. He was drunk. After swerving all the way home they arrived at the farm, 20 kilometres away from the nearest town, only for Natalie to find out there was nobody else there, not a single other soul except the drunk employer and her. She was isolated with no phone service and no wi-fi. He had a code on his landline so she couldn't dial out. For the next 15 days she was subjected to verbal abuse and the farmer slaughtered lambs in front of her because 'That's what I do when I'm angry.' Luckily, Natalie has an IT background. She was eventually able to hack into his wi-fi, call the police and get off the island. Not remarkably, this farmer was already known to police.


I know that vulnerable employees are having their 88 days drawn out. They are sent to work and stay in hostels, which they have to pay for, often owned by the employer. They are told that work will be coming up very soon. Sometimes those 88 days have been drawn out for as long as six months. And they are paying for it. I have heard how female backpackers have got suspicious because the pretty ones were getting work and the less attractive ones were not. I have heard of girls being told they must have sexual relations with the employer if they want him to sign off on, to verify, the 88 days. That is disgusting.


That's why I cannot support this attempt to lessen protections for workers and not enhance them. The public register gives some protection—not a lot, but some—to workers. This retrograde bill will certainly not.

Senator SESELJA
 (Australian Capital Territory—Assistant Minister for Treasury and Finance) (10:21):  I'd like to thank those senators who have contributed to this debate on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Working Holiday Maker Employer Register) Bill 2017. The government recognises that working holiday-makers are an important part of Australia's tourism industry and a key source of labour, particularly in the agriculture, horticulture, tourism and hospitality sectors.


This bill ensures the details of the working holiday-maker employer register are not made public, and it restores provisions regarding information sharing between the ATO and the Fair Work Ombudsman to what they were prior to the changes made by the Treasury Laws Amendment (Working Holiday Maker Reform) Act 2016. All employers of working holiday-makers will still be required to register with the Australian Taxation Office. Registered employers will be able to withhold tax at the new working holiday-maker tax rate of 15 per cent from the first dollar of income up to $37,000. Once registered, employers can advise current and prospective working holiday-maker employees that they are registered and are able to withhold tax at the new working holiday-maker tax rate of 15 per cent from the first dollar of income up to $37,000.


The register addresses concerns about the exploitation of working holiday-makers and will provide valuable data on who employs working holiday-makers, what sectors they are engaged in and where employers are located. This amendment does not affect the requirement for the Australian Taxation Office to report this information annually to the Treasurer for presentation to the parliament. This reporting process involves aggregate employer information and will not identify any working holiday-maker employers.


This bill also restores provisions regarding information sharing between the ATO and the Fair Work Ombudsman to what they were prior to the changes made by the Treasury Laws Amendment (Working Holiday Maker Reform) Act 2016. Information sharing between the ATO and the Fair Work Ombudsman will be limited to situations where an entity is actually or reasonably suspected of noncompliance with the tax law. This bill is part of a broader package of reforms to ensure that Australia remains an attractive and safe destination for working holiday-makers, and I commend the bill to the Senate.



The PRESIDENT:  The question is that the bill be read a second time.

Senator SESELJA
 (Australian Capital Territory—Assistant Minister for Treasury and Finance) (12:45):  As disappointed as I am to interrupt Senator Collins, I'm very pleased to highlight for the Senate today that last month I was very proud to attend the launch of the Parliamentary Friends of Adoption group. Unfortunately, my co-chair, Senator Kitching—your good self, Acting Deputy President—was unable to attend the launch. But I would like to thank you for your support of the group in setting it up—a very, very worthy cause.


As of 30 June 2017, 47,915 children were in out-of-home care in Australia. In 2016-17, 32,600 of those children had been in out-of-home care for two or more years, and yet there were only 204 known adoptions in the same year—204 known adoptions with 32,500 kids having been in care for two or more years and 47,900 children in out-of-home care in this country.


Adoption in Australia is in a critical state. We have tens of thousands of children in out-of-home care without, in many cases, the stability of a family to call their own. This is an issue I first became aware of as part of an inquiry into the matter as a senator and also as the Assistant Minister for Social Services. Work has been done and is being done, but it must be said that there is a long, long way to go for us as a nation.


Groups such as Adopt Change, who were kind enough to host our launch, do vital work in this area and should be absolutely praised for their efforts. I want to thank Adopt Change founder Deborra-lee Furness for attending as well as CEO Renee Carter. I want to thank them for their passion and dedication to improving the lot of so many of our most vulnerable Australian children. In doing so, I'd also like to pay tribute to the board of Adopt Change, who do an outstanding job: Catherine McDonnell, the chair; Victoria Buchan; Kerry Chikarovski; John O'Neill; and Helen Baker.


There is absolutely still vital work to be done in this area, and I hope that the establishment of the parliamentary friends group and the current local adoption inquiry will bring this issue into the spotlight so we can see real and meaningful change in this area.


Last week—last Wednesday—I attended the R U OK? Day breakfast here in Canberra hosted by R U OK? Day CEO and my good friend Brendan Maher. I'd like to congratulate him on a job well done for an invaluable cause. Brendan doesn't like the spotlight, but I understand this will be his last R U OK? Day so it's worth reflecting on the work that he has done. Brendan is a significant Australian and a great Canberran. He's been in the not-for-profit sector for over 12 years, spending seven years with Lifeline Australia and now over five years with R U OK?. He brought significant corporate experience, and of course he could have made a lot more money in the corporate sector but he's one of these servants of the people who has chosen to use his great skills and expertise for what is a very worthy cause. I think Brendan and his team have done a great job in spreading the vital message around R U OK? Day, and it's great to be a parliamentary ambassador, along with Ed Husic, for R U OK? Day.


Brendan currently spends his time managing stakeholder relationships, working on campaigns and visiting schools and offices around Australia to build on R U OK?'s mission. Since July, the R U OK? team's Conservation Convoy have tirelessly trekked all over Australia, making 28 stops from Geelong to Darwin and from Alice Springs to Rockhampton, just to name a few, to remind us all that every day is the day to ask: R U OK? I did want to very much thank Brendon and wish him well in his future endeavours. I'm sure he'll continue to make a great contribution.


This year marks the 10th year of this great initiative of R U OK? Day. Anyone who has ever gone through a tough patch knows the very real difference a listening ear makes. While R U OK? Day is advertised most widely on its flagship day, the movement exists to remind each of us that, in fact, every day is a day to support those in our lives who are struggling in their lives. Staying connected and having meaningful conversations is something we can all do. I'd encourage everyone to jump on the R U OK? website and learn their four simple steps to having a conversation that could change and even save a life.


Another issue that is of great importance is the issue of juvenile diabetes. Earlier this week it was my great privilege to meet with some kids and their parents from the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation. I want to thank the following people from JDRF for visiting me at parliament: Amy, Mia and Ethan Jeffress and their mum, Kathryn; Sophie Coulter and her mum, Katie; Lawrence Jovanovic and his mum, Melanie; and Grace Eveille and her mum, Mel. I'd like to particularly thank Mel Eveille for helping organise the visit and for the amazing work that she has been doing for a long time for JDRF in the ACT.


JDRF, as many of you would know, is a non-profit organisation that funds type 1 diabetes research and advocates for regulation favourable to medical research, making it easier to market new medical devices. Those of us who don't have or don't know anyone with type 1 diabetes can have no idea just how much of a challenge it poses to those who have it, and I take my hat off to these kids and their parents who are facing that challenge head-on every day. It's always a bit heartbreaking when the kids share their stories. They are amazing, inspiring kids who sometimes do it tough, but there's a lot of work being done, kids, to make your lives better. We're going to keep working harder to make sure that we get to a cure and that this is something that in a few years time, hopefully, kids will no longer have to grow up with.


Unfortunately, at the moment, there is nothing that can be done to prevent type 1 diabetes, which is most common in children, and its exact cause is unknown. Sadly, type 1 diabetes is also often wrongly assumed to be lifestyle related, which adds to the stigma suffered by those with the disease. That's why JDRF's research is so important to help these young people who are dealing with a disease that is, of course, not of their own making. I'm proud to be part of a government providing access to fully subsided continuous-glucose-monitoring products through the National Diabetes Services Scheme. I'm told that these are an absolute game changer in the lives of those with type 1 diabetes, assisting children, young people and their families to better manage their blood glucose levels, and that they may reduce stress, anxiety and emergency visits to the hospital. It was heartwarming to hear firsthand what a difference these devices are making. Earlier this year, I was also honoured to participate in JDRF One Ride and actively support this worthwhile cause committed to caring for families impacted by the disease whilst conducting research to find a cure.


Today I'd like to also pay tribute to a really significant Canberran, Pastor Sean Stanton, who gave me a tour of his extensive campus of Life Unlimited Church and Canberra City Care last week. He and I were trying to remember how long it's been since my last visit, and, given the number of changes that have taken place, it must have been a while. Canberra City Care is a great story, and the Life Unlimited Church there on the campus in Charnwood has just done an extraordinary job. This was a dilapidated school building that was no longer being used as a high school. It was then sold to the church community a number of years ago—I think more than 15 years ago now—and what they were asked to do as part of that was to not only have the church there but also take on some community contributions. Can I say that Pastor Sean Stanton and his church community have gone above and beyond what anyone could have expected.


Canberra City Care has grown from small beginnings to a busy community hub that offers low-cost food, clothing, IT equipment and debt management to around 300 families doing it tough every week. They operate with the assistance of around 50 amazing volunteers, a number of whom I met, and work in close relationship with a variety of community organisations within the ACT. Their five main services are HandUp Food Care, which is a store stocking a range of affordable food and everyday essentials; the Harvest Garden, which grows fresh fruit and vegetables for the local community; ReRuns Op Shop, which sells a range of preloved clothing and other goods at very low prices; the Tech Shed, which provides affordable computers and technical support; and Christians Against Poverty, which assists people to become free of debt and poverty.


To Pastor Sean Stanton: I can't get through all of the things you do, but they're an extraordinary contribution to our community. The volunteers and the people who come along are helping some of our most vulnerable people. I just wanted to congratulate you for your amazing contribution to the ACT community.

 (Northern Territory—Minister for Indigenous Affairs and Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (15:03):  I took on notice today part of a question that related to some timing around the minister I represent and his views. Minister Wyatt has said that, after he was interviewed by a Four Corners team, additional facts came to his attention, including the increase—which I noted in my answer—in the number of serious incidents reported in aged care, and, as a result, has amended his views. The royal commission was announced on 16 September.

"McAllister, Sen Jenny",ALP,2018-09-19,"



Senator McALLISTER
 (New South Wales—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (15:04):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Finance and the Public Service (Senator Cormann) to a question without notice asked by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate (Senator Wong) today relating to the Council of Australian Governments.


From that answer it is entirely obvious that the government has run out of ideas. That is also obvious in this chamber because it has run out of legislation to debate. It's obvious in its handling of COAG, and that was the subject of the question to Minister Cormann. Minister Cormann tried to defend the cancellation of COAG by saying that the government doesn't need to hold meetings in order to get things done. In some ways he's right. Holding a meeting does not impact the coalition government's ability to get things done, because this government cannot get anything done. It cannot get anything at all done.


Let's examine the public record to see what happens when the government does take a policy through an extensive process of meetings and consultations. Let's have a look at the NEG. The Prime Minister met with the rogue MPs. The NEG was amended in response to feedback—



Senator Gallacher interjecting—




Senator McALLISTER:
  That's right, Senator Gallacher. It went back to the coalition party room. It was subject to extensive debate, much of which was leaked publicly. It was approved. They got it through the party room—good on them—and now it has been dumped. They had many meetings inside the parliament and outside the parliament, but they still don't have a policy and a plan for energy.


What about COAG is different? Maybe it's a little bit different. What is on the record when the government takes one of its policy proposals to COAG? It was a while ago—and obviously we have had a lot of political turmoil—but do people remember former Prime Minister Turnbull's proposal to reform state and federal fiscal relations? I think that was the one that they came up with in the car park. That was presumably done with the support of former Treasurer and current Prime Minister, Scott Morrison, the person now leading the government. This reform effort was announced with great fanfare. Where is it now? What has happened to the proposal that they sought to take to COAG? Are we debating legislation? No, we're not; we're actually having the Governor-General's address-in-reply debate two years after he gave his speech here. This idea has entirely disappeared from view because, like the coalition party room, when the coalition take things into COAG they can't make any progress there either.


Are there meetings that do help the coalition get things done? Here's one—a Liberal Party meeting on the South Coast chaired by Minister Payne. They got a lot done there because, as Ann Sudmalis has detailed, all the member for Gilmore's friends and allies were rolled out of the FEC and replaced with people hostile to her that made, as she said, her position 'untenable'. It led to her resignation. There were vivid stories of bullying, backstabbing and betrayal.


Are there any other meetings where the coalition gets things done? We've heard this week about a 40-minute meeting—for which there was no agenda—with a not-for-profit headed up by their mates in the Great Barrier Reef Foundation.




Senator Gallacher:
  No minutes.




Senator McALLISTER:
  Senator Gallacher is correct again—there were no minutes. Close to half a billion dollars was handed out at that meeting. It was a very effective meeting. There was no oversight or accountability. It was handed out to a group of people with close links to fossil fuel companies and even closer links to the Liberal Party. This is unbelievable.


Is this ransacking the china cabinet on your way out? But this is the thing: there is a bit of a theme here. This is a government that has run out of serious things to do. It has run out of serious policy proposals, so we now find ourselves without a proposal for education. Some have suggested that that's why the COAG meeting wasn't able to go ahead. We find ourselves without an energy policy, even though the coalition for a year has been talking about the significance of energy prices and the industry has been warning the coalition that, without a policy, energy prices will continue to go up.


We find ourselves without any legislation before this chamber. We find ourselves preparing again to debate the address-in-reply to the Governor-General's speech. There is a key to all of this. If you're trying to get a policy up on their side of politics then meetings are no use. This is a group of people who cannot agree on the future direction of this country. It doesn't matter how many meetings they hold, nothing happens. But it is useful for something. If you want to fight a Liberal Party vendetta and if you want to get rid of one of the few women in the lower house, it is useful. If you want to get $½ billion for your mates, as it turned out for this government, a meeting can be very useful. But that's about it.

"Molan, Sen Jim",LP,2018-09-19,"



Senator MOLAN
 (New South Wales) (15:09):  Our government gets things done. The allegation that is being made, initially in broadcasts made from the ABC, is that the COAG meeting which was scheduled to meet on 4 October was somehow related to a vast range of reasons that, in essence, the ABC made up.


The negotiations by the education ministers on bilateral school funding agreements are occurring and they're still underway. The National Health Reform Agreement and the Closing the Gap Refresh would benefit, certainly, as anyone would agree, from further discussion between portfolio ministers before they are brought to the COAG. These and the other issues that were to be discussed at the COAG meeting on 4 October will now be discussed at the 12 December COAG meeting in Adelaide.


On 12 December, there will be a full day's worth of COAG meetings. The morning session will provide an opportunity for all governments to consider progress on a new National Health Reform Agreement, the Closing the Gap Refresh and actions arising from the Reducing Violence against Women Summit. The afternoon session will be focused on national security.


We are getting things done. We are doing things. One of the greatest examples of us doing things mentioned by Senator McAllister is energy policy. We have a very good energy policy, based on AEMO comments and ACCC reports. We have the ability to set the default price, we have the ability to put a cop on the beat and we have the ability to increase generation of electricity, of energy. We are doing things. In particular, we don't need meetings to do things. We are doing things on aged-care refunding reform. And, despite the number of questions which have come from the opposition claiming that there has been some form of cut to aged care, the government is not planning any changes that would reduce funding to aged care. So we are doing things on aged care. Annual funding will increase to record levels by $5 billion over the forward estimates, from $18.6 billion in 2017-18 to $23.6 billion in 2021-22. This is doing things, and it is not a cut.


The Morrison government, our government, is providing record aged-care funding of $19.8 billion this year. That is not a cut. Aged-care spending has increased by an average of more than six per cent each and every year. We are doing things, and that is not a cut. Looking at the six per cent each year, that is, on average, $1 billion of extra support for older Australians each year. We're adding an additional 13,500 residential aged-care places and 775 short-term restorative places. This is doing things, and this is not a cut.


From the last budget, we are delivering 20,000 new high-level home care packages to support senior Australians to remain at home longer. That is critically important, and it is doing things. By 2021-22, over 74,000 high-level home care places will be available. That is an increase of 86 per cent on 2017-18. How could that be a cut? That is no cut; that is doing things. There is over $100 million in investment in mental health services for ageing Australians in the community and in residential aged care. This consists of a $20-million trial to improve mental health services for Australians over 75 years of age. We are doing things, and that is no cut. There is also $82.5 million of that $100 million in new mental health services for people with a diagnosed mental disorder living in residential aged-care facilities. Again, we are doing this and there is no cut.


Last week we announced an additional $16 million to police quality in aged care. This is doing things. Any allegation or any view that we are not doing things is fundamentally wrong. We don't need meetings to do things. We just do them.

"Gallacher, Sen Alex",ALP,2018-09-19,"



Senator GALLACHER
 (South Australia) (15:14):  I suppose we'd have to throw a shout-out there to Senator Molan for soldiering on in the face of the overwhelming evidence to the contrary. But I suppose he's well experienced in soldiering on in the face of adversity. The simple facts do not sustain his contribution, and, in taking note of Senator Wong's question to and the answer from Senator Cormann, I'd like to point out a couple of really interesting facts. We have headlines which say that the Hon. Scott Morrison has cancelled the Council of Australian Governments meeting in order to address his bullying policy. It's a headline which we all know will be contested, but it just goes to show the state of dysfunction and disunity that is apparent on the other side.


I want to go, more particularly, to the real business of government. Have the charter letters been issued to every minister that was sworn in in the short period of time since that happened? I can point you to one explicit area of policy that I'm very familiar with, which is the National Disability Insurance Scheme. In the oversight committee that looks after that—having been a member of it since 2013—there have been about five responsible ministers in that space. There have been four assistant ministers in that space. There have been three coalition chairs in that space. There have been two CEOs and two new chairs of the board. So how is it possible that you can be prepared for a COAG meeting if you have a continual stream of musical chairs? When the music stops, you sit down, find a seat and find a ministry.


I have nothing but cordial relationships with the Hon. Dan Tehan. I've had very good experiences working with him in the area of veterans affairs. The Hon. Dan Tehan has had seven ministerial appointments in two years and seven months. He has had three portfolios in the last nine months. People could go their entire career of two or three terms as a senator in this place and not have as many portfolios. How is it possible that you can govern coherently and effectively deal with the states and territories when you hardly have your ministers in place in a portfolio for three months? The Hon. Simon Birmingham, an adversary across the chamber but a good elected South Australian, has picked up trade. Now he's got to learn the trade portfolio and contribute. The Hon. Dan Tehan's got to pick up education. Put out the myriad of fights, get concise policy in place and then deal with COAG.


Is it any wonder why this new Prime Minister has cancelled COAG? He hasn't even got his ministers briefed about their portfolios. I would hazard a guess that some on that side have not even received their charter letters. We know, through the estimates process, that the charter letters between the Hon. Marise Payne and the Hon. Christopher Pyne took a very, very long time to work out. So how can you program meetings with the states and territories and the premiers and chief ministers of those states and territories if you haven't got your act together as a government? Clearly there is underlying turmoil which is not apparent to the general electorate. They see a Prime Minister go and they think, 'That's it; Prime Minister Turnbull's gone and the Hon. Scott Morrison is in.' But what lies underneath that is an enormous amount of change. It slows down process; it slows down government. It means they cannot effectively govern. When I looked at the proposed legislative schedule for the Senate last week, I saw an interesting item on there: the Governor-General's address-in-reply. That normally only comes up when you're a little bit thin on legislation.


Clearly Senator Molan, soldiering on in the face of adversity and soldiering on in the face of the overwhelming evidence to the contrary, did a reasonably good job of reading out things that they do and the fact they don't need meetings to do stuff. But you do need charter letters. You do need ministers who have coverage of their area of responsibility and an understanding of their area of responsibility—the briefings from the department and the view forward—otherwise what is the point of meeting with COAG? That's because, with COAG, the work is done incrementally, and on the day that they meet they will probably announce some reasonably effective stuff. I will leave you with this: young people left stranded in aged care. COAG was to address that.

"Hume, Sen Jane",LP,2018-09-19,"



Senator HUME
 (Victoria—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (15:19):  I thank the opposition for an opportunity to speak today about exactly what it is that the coalition has been doing. They use COAG as a cover. COAG, as they well know, was scheduled to meet on 4 October. Negotiations by education ministers on bilateral school funding agreements are still underway. The health reform agreements and the Closing the Gap Refresh will benefit from further discussion between the portfolio ministers before they are brought to COAG. As those in opposition all know, these and other issues will be discussed at COAG on 12 December. That meeting in Adelaide on 12 December will continue to go ahead. It is a full-day meeting. The morning session provides an opportunity for all governments to consider the progress on a new national health reform agreement and the Closing the Gap Refresh as well as the National Summit on Reducing Violence against Women, and the afternoon session will be focused on national security. It's a rather disingenuous cover story for the opposition to try and give the coalition a bit of a bash but it is so unsuccessful.


Essentially we're seeing the opposition clutching at straws and saying, 'Don't look over here; look over there.' They want to cover up the fact that this government, in its five years in government, has been more successful than any Labor government ever. We announced 3.4 per cent growth last week. Those are the best growth figures we've had since the mining boom of 2012. In the life of this government, 1.1 million jobs have been created by the private sector. Of those 1.1 million jobs, the vast majority went to women. The vast majority were full-time. More than 100,000 jobs in the last 12 months alone went to the regions, and 44,000 jobs were created just in the last month. Female participation rates are at record levels. Youth employment is at its highest level since I was at school—and, I assure you, that was a considerable period of time ago.



Senator Wong interjecting—




Senator HUME:
  I promise you, Senator Wong, it was not yesterday; it was a considerable period of time ago. Why have we got such good economic growth? Why has there been such good job creation in the last five years? I will tell you. It doesn't come by accident. This government has worked tirelessly to ensure that the policy settings are right to encourage investment, to encourage employment and to encourage higher wages. We have five free trade agreements with China, with South Korea, with Japan, the TPP and now with Indonesia. These free trade agreements give Australian businesses the opportunity to invest, to employ and to grow.


What about company tax cuts for small to medium enterprises? That is a fundamentally important incentive. And please don't forget for a second that we've provided tax cuts to individuals as well. The coalition is committed to ensuring that people keep more of their own money in their own pockets. The instant asset write-off is, again, another policy that encourages businesses to invest. In my state of Victoria alone, for instance, small businesses and farmers are benefitting from the coalition's instant asset write-off. It was used by almost 350,000 small businesses in 2016-17 alone, and is a policy that would not be possible without the coalition in office.


We've given tax cuts to 3.3 million businesses, and further tax relief has been legislated to reduce the tax rate from 27½ per cent to 25 per cent for businesses with an annual turnover of less than $50 million. That would have been extended to all businesses in Australia if it wasn't for those opposite, who do not want to see the economy grow, don't want to see companies expand, don't want to see further investment and don't want to see further employment.


In fact, this is the most anti-business, anti-investment, anti-employment, anti-jobs opposition we have seen since Whitlam. But don't let me disparage Whitlam. He at least was a man of principles, which is very different from the opposition leader, Mr Shorten, who is a man without principles. He is a man that stands for nothing. All he wants to do is sling mud. Well, dare I say, those opposite should know that, if they're going to sling mud, they should learn how to use a slingshot. Right now they are all over the place. Why don't we ask the opposition about their position on the TPP? If you want to see dysfunction, just look over there. (Time expired)

Senator KETTER
 (Queensland—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (15:24):  Today Senator Cormann was given an opportunity to explain why the government has cancelled the October COAG meeting. If you listen to Senator Cormann's response, you could be forgiven for thinking that a COAG meeting is just like any other meeting—it can be cancelled and there are no repercussions in relation to that. But, of course, we know that COAG is actually 'the peak intergovernmental forum in Australia'—and I'm quoting from the COAG website:


COAG was established in 1992 … to manage matters of national significance or matters that need co-ordinated action by all Australian governments.


Senator Cormann was correct when he said that, in his response, it was a non-response to the question as to why COAG was cancelled. He indicated COAG normally meets twice a year, and that will happen. In fact, yes, that's true; COAG does usually meet twice a year. However, according to the website:




… it will meet when needed and at times it has met up to four times in a year. COAG may also settle issues out-of-session by correspondence.



…   …   …



COAG's agenda is broad-ranging and focusses on improving the current and future wellbeing of all Australians.



The website goes on to say:




COAG has a strong record of driving reforms that have improved the lives of all Australians. For example, micro-economic reform linked to national competition policy in the mid-1990s …



and:



COAG will continue to drive reforms that are vital to Australia’s future.



This is not just any meeting; this is a peak intergovernmental meeting across Australia. At the last minute, the Prime Minister started ringing around various premiers and chief ministers to advise them of the cancellation of COAG. So, when given an opportunity to explain why, the government today has squibbed that opportunity to explain why this peak intergovernmental forum has been cancelled.


This is not the first time that the government has failed to give an answer to the 'why' question. We know that, when persistently asked about why Prime Minister Turnbull had to go, the government is completely at their wit's end to explain why. We have essentially seen a rearrangement of the deck chairs on the Titanic here. A Prime Minister is knifed. We have a new Prime Minister. The Australian people want to know what happened, and we don't get an answer.


The cancellation of COAG is from the same government that one Prime Minister ago decided to cancel parliament. All Australians will remember 23 August—that amazing day when the House of Representatives was shut down, apparently at the request of Minister Dutton, in relation to the turmoil that was engulfing the government at that time in the lead-up to the leadership spill. That was a most extraordinary step by this government to basically abandon some key democratic principles of allowing the parliament to continue to debate the top issues of our country, and what arrogance and absolute disregard for the Australian people we saw in that step to cancel the sitting of the House of Representatives. I'm sure all Australians are disgusted by that event. 


Of course, this government is at war with itself. It is hopelessly divided, and a government that is divided and warring with itself cannot be focused on the issues that are important to the Australian people. We, on this side, are focused on the key issues. Health, education and energy policy were some of the things that were going to be discussed at the COAG meeting—we want the chance to talk about those things. We want to talk about the cruel funding cuts that have been inflicted on Queensland hospitals and Queensland schools. Our candidate for Petrie, Corinne Mulholland, is so fed up with cuts to schools in the electorate of Petrie that she's brought the message down to Canberra this week. I know Corinne has met with Ms Plibersek, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, to talk about the impact of these Liberal cuts on her local schools. A couple of those that are most eye-watering are the North Lakes State College, at $2½ million, and the Redcliffe State High School, at $1.13 million. We need a government that will get on with the job. (Time expired)

Senator GEORGIOU:
  I, and also on behalf of Senator Storer, move:


That the Senate:


(a) notes that a 2018 Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) report found family and domestic violence affected one in five Australian women and one in nine Australian men;


(b) notes that the AIHW report states that, since age 15, one in six women and one in 16 men have experienced physical or sexual violence by a current or previous partner;


(c) acknowledges that the number of Western Australians who have died from family violence related incidents has sky-rocketed to 23 this year, more than double that of last year's number (11);


(d) acknowledges that family violence leads to a higher rate of homelessness for victims, especially women and children;


(e) urges the Federal Government to provide more relief housing for victims of domestic violence; and


(f) calls on the Federal Government to fill the data-sharing gaps as outlined in the AIHW report to better understand people at risk and identify the services they need.


I seek leave to make a short statement.



The PRESIDENT:  Leave is granted for one minute.




Senator GEORGIOU:
  Last week five people were killed in an incident of family violence in the Perth suburb of Bedford. This incident brings the total number of family-violence-related deaths to 23, which is double that of last year. One in six women and one in 16 men are victims of family violence. These victims are often driven out of their homes and need to find a safe place to stay. A recent survey found that 74 per cent of crisis accommodation providers were unable to provide accommodation to those who need it. Some crisis care organisations had to turn away one person for every person they accommodate. Today I call on the federal government to commit more funds to address the critical shortage of crisis care.

"Gallacher, Sen Alex",ALP,2018-09-19,"



Senator GALLACHER
 (South Australia) (16:06):  I am pleased to be able to make a contribution in this Matters of Public Importance debate on the inability of a divided, unstable and illegitimate Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison government to govern for all Australians. If we were to start with the first—divided—the evidence is reasonably clear. If you move from the Hon. Tony Abbott to the Hon. Malcolm Turnbull to the Hon. Scott Morrison in a reasonably short space of time, then you very clearly have a lack of majority support for the elected Prime Minister throughout the term of their government. I think it is very clear that the Hon. Tony Abbott has been the best opposition leader in the country—and he didn't refute that claim; he merely acknowledged it with a wry smile. Since being deposed, there has been clear unequivocal division right throughout the Turnbull prime ministership.


And there has been abundantly clear instability. Take one brief example of that. The minister says he has a deal on the NEG. The Prime Minister says, 'I have the support of my party room; no problem.' Questions across the chamber here in question time allude to those detractors from the policy, who say, 'Don't worry about that. It's been through the party room.' Not only was it not unequivocally supported, despite the claims to the contrary, it was dumped. I think that happened on Tuesday in the party room and, by Friday, it was dead and buried. They probably threw out the minister at the same time because he was still arguing that it was a good policy after it was dumped—quite an incongruous position.


It is exceedingly clear that the evidence about division is uncontested. You cannot contest that this period of coalition government has been divided. 'Unstable' is a very kind word for what's been happening. They've white-anted, they've undermined and they have detracted from ordinary delivery of government services with their bitter, ceaseless infighting in this period of government. It would all be quite entertaining if it weren't actually so serious and if the consequences for the average Australian were not so severe.


A few moments ago in taking note, I alluded to one of the problems we get when we cancel COAG. COAG was actually going to look at something which all Australian electors, of whatever political persuasion, would want fixed. There are 173 young people in aged-care facilities and this was one of the issues that was going to be alleviated, decided or helped along in the COAG process. This is where COAG needs to look at how the NDIS fits in with the health system to make sure we don't have young people falling through the cracks. So this is one tiny microcosm of the myriad problems that the government faces: 173 young people falling through the cracks of the NDIS system and not being treated appropriately because of the inability of this government to be unified, cohesive and the like.


I put on the record, and I'll put it on the record again, that, since I have been appointed as the deputy chair of the oversight committee for the National Disability Insurance Scheme, there have been quite a number of ministers—




Senator Jacinta Collins:
  How many?




Senator GALLACHER:
  Five ministers is my understanding. One of them was actually the Hon. Scott Morrison. This is an area where there's no debate; this is bipartisan policy. The ministers have been the Hon. Kevin Andrews, the Hon. Scott Morrison, the Hon. Christian Porter, the Hon. Dan Tehan and the Hon. Paul Fletcher, who is current. That's in a short space of time: 2013 to now. How is it possible that the electorate is getting the government that it needs when there's been this inordinate amount of change? It is akin to musical chairs. Who you support as Prime Minister, in some respects, means that you become a minister.


Clearly, in the case of the Hon. Dan Tehan—who's been in three portfolios in nine months, and in seven portfolios in two years and seven months—he has barely had time to get his head around the various jobs he has been asked to undertake. That's not good public policy. That doesn't engender good outcomes in government. I have the greatest respect for the Hon. Dan Tehan. I think he did some excellent work in the veterans' affairs area. But he's no longer in veterans' affairs; he's in there trying to fix up the problems created by the Hon. Simon Birmingham in education.


If you look at COAG again, you'll see that the Hon. Simon Birmingham left putting out the debate and the contested different positions in education, and that the Hon. Scott Morrison has had to put in place someone who's mother, I think, was actually the education minister in Victoria. He'll give it a go, but he's starting behind the eight ball because a lack of continuity in the Prime Ministerial position has meant an inordinate amount of loss of continuity in the subsidiary positions. And that is right down to our ordinary old Senate process here. Us backbenchers, we love our Senate process!


The Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee had a very vital inquiry which couldn't become quorate because our chair and deputy chair, the Hon. Linda Reynolds and the Hon. David Fawcett, had been promoted. So it doesn't just stop at the ministerial level; it flows right down to the work of the entire parliament. There we were in Brisbane and Townsville with veterans who had very widely-held and deeply-felt contested positions. They wanted resolution, they wanted fairness out of their government and they wanted their hearing dates to be honoured and for them to be able to contribute, and we couldn't even do that! The division, the dysfunction and the instability is absolutely catastrophic in all facets.


I dare to say that there are ministers on the other side who haven't got their charter letters yet. I dare to say that there are people who haven't had their charter letters. In other words, their responsibilities and their duties are not clearly defined, so they're still getting briefings about what they might possibly be looking after. How on earth is it possible that that can look like good government? How on earth is that possible? We know from the estimates process, as I mentioned in taking note, that the Hon. Christopher Pyne and the Hon. Marise Payne appeared to be having quite a contest between each other about what was going to be in those charter letters and about the areas of responsibility they were going to take respectively, because it was quite some time after their ministerial appointment that the charter letters were actually confirmed to have been delivered.


You have a situation where dysfunction, division and instability are endemic in the coalition. I don't think you can actually characterise it any other way. It has been a guerrilla war conducted by the Hon. Tony Abbott. It was a nuclear option conducted by the Hon. Malcolm Turnbull: 'Show me the 43 people who are against me. I want to see their names. I want them recorded in Liberal Party history. Show me the 43 names.' That has never been heard of before. A leader would normally call a party room meeting on a number of names. He wanted 43; he wanted the majority of those people against him to sign their names. It was really interesting to read what some people signed on it. They signed the petition but said, 'I support the Prime Minister.' My goodness!


It's obvious that people played both sides of the fence. There is one person in the chamber, the Hon. Mathias Cormann, who backed three people in three days! He was on three different potential prime ministers' sides in three days. If you want a better example of what division, instability and lack of governing for the Australian people looks like, when you see them up there on the back bench—don't worry; they were only there for six hours. He then came into the chamber and said: 'We want a more powerful economy. We want more employment.' I'm sure he does, but he's not doing a very good job of delivering it because the division, the instability and the lack of good governance has catastrophic outcomes for the electorate. The concerns of those 173 kids in aged-care facilities should be addressed. They should be out of there, and COAG should be meeting to do it.

"Hume, Sen Jane",LP,2018-09-19,"



Senator HUME
 (Victoria—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (16:16):  I rise today to speak on the matter of public importance introduced to this place by our very dear friend from the Australian Labor Party Senator Doug Cameron—always cheerful, always merry; 'Senator Bagpipes'; a happy chap. It was beautifully followed by his dear friend Senator Gallacher, who again is a very cheerful man. I actually didn't realise that Labor could waste taxpayer money while in opposition, but I'm absolutely certain that I heard exactly the same speech in take note of answers only half an hour ago. That's quite extraordinary. The taxpayers already paid once today for that drivel that we heard from Senator Gallacher, so that is quite an extraordinary achievement. I think you should be very, very proud indeed!


If you want a party that really cares about governing for all Australians, you can look over here; if you want to see a party that doesn't care a jot about ordinary Australians, all you need to do is look over there to the opposition benches. On this side of the chamber, it's quite clear we have a plan that's working for all Australians. We are making Australia strong. The government's policies are working. The economy is growing at 3.4 per cent. That is the strongest growth since the height of the mining boom. It's growing at a stronger rate than the world's seven largest advanced economies—the USA, Canada, Germany, France, Italy, the UK and Japan. It's growing faster than the OECD average.


Over the past five years alone, the coalition has demonstrated that it gets the results that Australians expect from their government. The Liberal-National Morrison coalition want to do things. The Labor opposition want to stop things. We are putting in place policies that actually matter. Think, for instance, of the instant asset write-off that has recently been renewed. If you want proof that the coalition is the only party that backs small business, look no further than the instant asset write-off. In Australia, more than 350,000 small businesses have taken up the instant asset write-off. This is a policy that would not be possible without the coalition in office.


Have a look at small business tax cuts. We've given tax cuts to more than 3.3 million businesses, and further tax relief has been legislated to reduce the rate from 27.5 per cent to 25 per cent for businesses with an annual turnover of less than $50 million. For unincorporated businesses with a turnover of less than $5 million, we've introduced a tax discount of eight per cent capped at $1,000 and have legislated a further increase to 16 per cent.


As you can see, we don't scoff at small businesses. We don't make fun of small businesses. We don't poke fun at small businesses. We understand their needs, and we are backing them. The coalition is the only party that can ensure that less red tape falls to businesses, reducing those excessive compliance costs. Individuals, businesses and community groups have had their compliance costs cut by $5.9 billion since 2013, including through things like simplified business activity statements, a small business superannuation clearing house and thousands of other decisions that make life easier for small businesses.


We have fixed the budget—in fact, over $41 billion in budget savings have been delivered since the 2016 election alone. We have halved the growth in spending, which was out of control under the six years of Labor government—out of control. We have halved the growth in spending from four per cent a year under Labor to 1.9 per cent under the coalition. That is the most restrained of any government in more than 50 years. The budget deficit in 2017-18 is projected to be $18.2 billion, which is less than half what it was two years ago, and we are on track for a balanced budget in 2019-20, a year earlier than anticipated.


The outcome that I'm most proud of is the promise that we made in 2013 to deliver one million new jobs to the Australian economy within five years, and we have delivered it in spades. In fact we promised it within two terms of government and we delivered it one year early, within five years, with 1,114,500 more Australians in work since September 2013, and over half of those are in full-time jobs. The vast majority of jobs have gone to women, and, in the last 12 months alone, at least 100,000 have gone to regional Australia. In 2017-18 alone, 349,500 jobs were created. That's the best financial year result since 2004-05, over a decade ago. Most importantly, of those jobs, over 100,000 went to young Australians. In fact, growth in youth employment is the best that we've seen in 30 years. The unemployment rate sits at 5.3 per cent, the lowest level since 2012 and well below the level we inherited from Labor in 2013 at 5.7 per cent.


If you want to see division, if you want to see instability, if you want to see illegitimacy, you need look no further than those opposite. They're very good at throwing stones but they've got a bit of a glass jaw over there. When we start talking about things like border protection, you can see the whites of their eyes, because they are divided on border protection. They don't know where they stand on border protection. When we talk about things like the Israel-Palestine relationship, you can see the whites of their eyes. They don't know where they stand on Israel and Palestine. They certainly don't know where they stand on the TPP. We've seen the leaks coming out just this week alone. They don't know whether they're Arthur or Martha. Are they in favour of the TPP? Are they against the TPP? I can assure you that, if you want to see stability and you want to see good government, you will only see that from the coalition. We're not here to fight about it; we are here to fix it.

Senator KITCHING
 (Victoria) (16:23):  What a coalition of chaos we have opposite. The Prime Minister has cancelled next month's COAG. There won't be one until December now. But, lest we think that that was a level of dysfunctionality, in the other place in question time, the Prime Minister said, 'We can't have COAG on 4 October because we're having a drought summit on 26 October.' Two meetings at both ends of the month—it's a little bit hard to handle when you're so dysfunctional.


The Prime Minister can't get any clear air because there are so many things going on in the Treasury benches. He can't get any clear air because Liberal woman after Liberal woman has come forward to complain about a culture of bullying and intimidation within the Liberal Party. He can't get any clear air because his cabinet colleagues keep leaking documents and policy initiatives. He can't get any clear air because they keep moving the deckchairs around, and he can't get any clear air because everyone's so concerned with watching to see how many ministers are wearing their Australian-flag lapel badges.


Going back to the bullying complaints, the latest woman to come forward was the member for Gilmore, who said there was behaviour from 'boys who should know better'. The Liberal Party has, of course, decried the use of quotas, or maybe it's just the word 'quota'—it's a little bit unclear for everyone else at the moment—although, the Liberal Party disproves its own current argument on quotas because it has had quotas since 1944. When Sir Robert Menzies was looking to match the ALP's support base, he went to the inheritors of the suffragette movement—some of the largest women's community groups of that time. Those women struck a hard bargain—if only that were the case in this day and age. They said, 'If you want our numbers, we want fifty-fifty quotas throughout the Liberal Party organisation,' and Sir Robert Menzies agreed. Now, though, this party that started out so well has gone backwards. They are moving so far backwards that, in fact, after the next election, because they haven't preselected any women, they are likely to have fewer women than the Saudi Arabian legislature, and that is a disgrace. It was a party that started out so well but has now become a party where so many women feel shut out.


What does the Prime Minister do with these complaints? Does he listen, does he acknowledge these complaints and does he acknowledge that his party has gone backwards? No. What he does is he tries to offshore these women. He's offered the New York United Nations post to the member for Chisholm. She rejected it. Now he's offered it to the member for Gilmore. She's considering it. But it's pretty insulting to use a posting as a 'there, there, don't worry' consolation prize. But fear not, because the Prime Minister did say he's 100 per cent confident that bullying is not a problem in the Liberal Party. That's good to know—and oh so convincing! Of course, that was a couple of days ago. Now he's asked a Liberal Party organisation to investigate the member for Gilmore's complaints. That was yesterday. I guess we need to wait until tomorrow to see what happens with those complaints and whether there's actually going to be any action taken.


In another shooting-in-the-foot incident, the Prime Minister self-described the coalition as a muppet show. The Muppet Show, we could say, is a vaudeville variety act, and that's what we've been seeing for the last few months. Just as a fun exercise, let's ask ourselves: which muppet character does the Prime Minister mostly resemble? Is it the straight man Kermit the Frog? No, because Kermit actually gets the show running and keeps it running. I'm not sure we can say that about the Prime Minister. Also, Kermie would probably never use Fatman Scoop's lyrics to be put to such a discombobulating use. Is he Miss Piggy? No, because they don't really encourage women over there on the treasury bench, and Miss Piggy is quite a forceful personality, so it's probably quite unlikely she would ever get preselected in the first place. Is he Statler or Waldorf? No, I think that might be Senator Macdonald or Senator O'Sullivan—although, having said that, I don't believe those senators have a proprietary ownership on that type of personality. Maybe he's Gonzo. You know Gonzo—Gonzo who plays the end of the opening song, but it never quite goes to plan. He never manages to quite hit the right note. I feel that Gonzo is probably our Prime Minister.


One of the great Labor prime ministers said in 1990 about a hopelessly divided Liberal Party, 'If you can't govern yourselves, you can't govern the country.' He said it as a qualifying standard—a pre-election test for any party seeking to govern. Nearly three decades on, we see the truth of Bob Hawke's assertion, for this great, exceptional country and this prosperous, productive, culturally diverse and inclusive society is governed by the worst of the worst—by B-graders, rank amateurs, petty squabblers and backstabbers.


This government aren't governing. This great, exceptional country—the envy of our neighbours, a beacon of strength in our region with so much opportunity and so much promise and potential—is governed by a government literally without an agenda. In fact, they've moved legislation off the agenda today, literally filibustering their own legislation, and they've deferred COAG meetings because they have nothing to say. This government isn't governing. This great, exceptional country, which rightly spends billions on our national defence and on border protection, is revealed to have an immigration minister who, while he pretended to be a tough cop on the beat of our border, was in fact secretly allowing Liberal donors and mates to smuggle in illegal workers to work as their servants. The tough cop on the beat of our border has been revealed to be nothing more than, essentially, a people smuggler for the aid and comfort of Liberal donors and mates. The government aren't governing. 


We have a coalition that disagree on nearly everything except hating each other, hating unions, cutting essential social services and appointing mates to government boards, tribunals and embassies. And let's not forget that the Prime Minister doesn't like Tasmanians either. The government aren't governing. They disagree about energy. They have no credible energy policy. They have had multiple proposals and can never agree on them. Margaret Thatcher, however briefly, once exhorted us to deal with the challenge of climate change. The government have refused to countenance four energy policies in nine years. Silicon Valley's cutthroat venture capital industry, as keen on profit as any other investor, is applying tens of billions of dollars of capital to improving renewable energy technology. Yet, this do-nothing, deeply confused, totally self-obsessed government regard Margaret Thatcher's green period and the world capital markets as mad lefties embarking on a renewables rampage. You don't even have to accept the scientific consensus on climate to embrace the simple fact that the sun, the wind and the waves don't cost us anything to use as a form of power. They disagree about tax. They disagree about complying with our international treaty obligations, like the Paris accord. They disagree about leadership. They disagree about My Health. They disagree about so many issues.


Australians don't expect miracles out of Canberra. But we do expect our leaders to put the national interest first. We do expect our leaders to insist on clean, accountable government that is willing to explain its decisions: explain the visas it grants, explains the grants it gifts to environmental groups, and explain its policies and its agenda for the future. We do expect our leaders to be focused on the kind of country we leave to the next generation.


That's why I believe, should Labor earn the trust of the Australian people at the next election, that a Shorten Labor government will address the big issues confronting all of us: maintaining Australian prosperity, ensuring Australians share in that prosperity with a decently paying job or the help they need, holding together the great social infrastructure that keeps Australia the most liveable place on the planet, defending our land from polluters within and enemies without, and ensuring that our country always passes the toughest test. That test is set out for all of us in Matthew, chapter 25, verse 40:


Truly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me.


The single most important measure of our society is how we treat the vulnerable: the single mum with kids struggling to make ends meet; the elderly man in a nursing home with no visitors and no voice; and our most recent arrivals, who so desperately want to succeed here and will, if we give them a chance.


That's why I'm here. I think there are many in this country who look on with horror at this government and wonder why they are here—for this government isn't governing. This exceptional country, with its magnificent people, deserves a government that works as hard as Australians do. We shouldn't have to wait for this government to crawl its way to the latest date an election can be held, but it seems we will have to. (Time expired)

Senator HANSON
 (Queensland) (16:34):  I'm so pleased Senator Cameron raised 'the inability of the divided, unstable and illegitimate Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison government to govern for all Australians' because it allows us to take a trip down memory lane and relive the divided, unstable and illegitimate Rudd-Gillard-Rudd government Australians had to endure. Remember former Labor Prime Minister Kevin Rudd? His own right-wing powerbrokers said they'd had enough of what they called Kevin Rudd's chaotic prime ministership. Those words came from none other than Bill Shorten. Then they wheeled in Julia Gillard, who was Australia's first female Prime Minister, and their factional divide ruined her too.


Labor stuffed up the mining tax and installed a Speaker in the House of Representatives who didn't mind giving blokes a touch-up when he got on the sauce. Labor signed a poisonous coalition deal with the Greens in 2010 to ensure they could get their legislation through the Senate. Although Julia Gillard promised there would be no carbon tax, the deal she did with the Greens meant every single household and business got slapped with the tax, which nearly sent pensioners to the wall. So much for her saying, 'There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead.' Labor propped up Craig Thomson, who had a filthy past involving hookers and boozy nights at the expense of the Health Services Union.


Labor launched the atrocious $50 billion NBN, which has been a dog's breakfast under both Labor and this government. Labor had 50,000 illegal boat people claim refugee status, costing this country billions upon billions of dollars, until this government put a stop to the boats. Labor took our economy from a $57 billion surplus to debt of $300 billion. The coalition is no better. The coalition is spending $50 billion—maybe higher, up to $200 billion—on subs. Immigration levels are the highest of the OECD countries and others at 1.7 per cent. Foreign ownership and assets gone—that's Australians. Both of you have destroyed our nation, identity, economic stability and credibility. The people will decide at the next election: get rid of them both.

"Paterson, Sen James",LP,2018-09-19,"



Senator PATERSON
 (Victoria) (16:36):  One can only assume that the Labor Party settled on their topic for today, moved by Senator Cameron no less, before opening Melbourne's Herald Sun newspaper this morning. Had they done so, they might have appreciated the irony of accusing others of being divided, particularly given the starring role that Senator Cameron himself played in that newspaper article. For those playing at home who haven't read the journalism of Mr Rob Harris this morning, he helpfully detailed the profound and deep divisions within the Labor Party on the question of trade and, in particular, the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Not only was Mr Harris able to go inside the Labor caucus and recount in some detail the exchanges between Labor colleagues over a profound issue of national importance—that is, free trade—but he was helpfully able to do so by relying on effectively a transcript of the proceedings—a transcript so detailed that it was able to recount exactly what each member of the Labor caucus, including the shadow ministry, had to say on the TPP.


This is a party which is self-evidently hopelessly divided on a key question. We had frontbenchers getting up and speaking against each other on a major policy issue. On the one hand, you have people like Jason Clare, the shadow trade minister, speaking in favour, with Senator Penny Wong, the opposition's leader in the Senate, backing him up. On the other hand, you have Senator Doug Cameron apparently moving a motion to recommit to debate and re-examine in their caucus again this week the issue which they had apparently resolved last week in their caucus. I presume that the opposition tactics committee in the Senate hasn't got their subscription to the Herald Sun up to date. They haven't been receiving their papers in the morning. I can only encourage them to make sure they are reading Melbourne's biggest-selling newspaper before they settle on their questions or MPI topics.


Of course, this is a political party which only a few months ago had an alternative leader in Mr Albanese, was openly trailing his coat for the Labor leadership. In the lead-up to the by-elections in Longman, Braddon and elsewhere, Mr Albanese was helpfully posing for nice photos for newspapers, granting tell-all interviews about his personal story and background, and openly flaunting and showing his wares for all of his colleagues to see. This is a party that, were it not for some slightly better-than-expected results in the by-elections, fortunately for them, would now be in the midst of a serious debate about their own leadership—and may yet be again, because we know they have a track record in this area.


By contrast, the Liberal-National government—our government—is not only governing for all Australians; it is actually delivering for all Australians. This is a government which, before the 2013 election, promised that we would deliver more than one million new jobs in our first two terms of office. We promised that we would do that. When we did so, at the time, we were told by Labor and the media that it was a fanciful and ridiculous promise and there was no way we could ever meet it.


Not only have we met that task, not only did we meet that task early; we've comfortably exceeded that task, with 1,114,500 new jobs created under this government. That's more than one million lives changed for the better because of the successful policies of this government, implemented while we've governed for all Australians. More than half of those jobs have been full time. Almost 350,000 of those jobs were created in the 2017-18 financial year alone. This was the most jobs created in any financial year since 2004-05, back in the glory days of the Howard government. More than 100,000 of these jobs were for young Australians, and that is the most for any year on record. That's 100,000 young people's lives improved. They're getting a good start in life, a step on the first rung of the ladder of opportunity—which those opposite used to talk about—thanks to the policies of this government.


According to figures released by the ABS, 2017 was the first full year in which employment rose every single month since the ABS began collecting that data in 1978. This didn't happen by accident. This didn't happen by coincidence. This happened because of a series of policies implemented by the Liberal-National government over the past five years that were deliberately aimed at creating employment and opportunities for Australians. It's resulted in an economy growing at 3.4 per cent, higher than at any time since 2012 and the height of the mining boom. Under this Liberal-National government, our economy is growing at a faster rate than many of the world's largest advanced economies, including Canada, Germany, France, Italy, the UK and Japan. It's the direct result of the policies we put in place—for example, the first and vitally important stages of our enterprise tax plan. We have legislated a five per cent cut in company tax for all Australian businesses with a turnover of up to $50 million.


This will deliver the lowest small business tax rate in half a century. It's already benefitting more than 3.3 million businesses which, between them, employ about seven million Australians. Even more businesses and Australians working for those businesses would have benefitted if it hadn't been for the opposition of the Labor Party and the Greens in this chamber. Sadly, even those businesses which have benefitted from this reduction in tax—and those workers and shareholders of those businesses and customers of those businesses who have benefitted from this new opportunity—are under grave threat if Mr Bill Shorten and his Labor team win the next election, because we know they're planning to substantially reverse those tax cuts for small business.


It hasn't only happened because of our small business tax cut plan. It's also happened because we've restored the rule of law in the building and construction industry. We've re-established the Australian Building and Construction Commission. We've established the Registered Organisations Commission. Together they are cracking down on the wanton lawlessness in that industry perpetuated by some unions—in particular, the CFMEU—and, again, this is at threat if Mr Shorten becomes Prime Minister. It's also because of our free trade agenda—a comprehensive free trade agenda that we don't just talk about on this side of the chamber but we actually deliver on, in stark contrast to the previous Labor government, which liked to talk so much about its embrace of a multinational trade agenda but never delivered anything tangible. We've delivered free trade agreements with our most significant trading partners, not only with China but also with Korea, Japan, Peru and the one we were talking about earlier, the Trans-Pacific Partnership with 11 major nations.


This is the very same Trans-Pacific Partnership that the opposition advised us to abandon. Mr Shorten, Mr Clare and others said it was a dead agreement, that there was no hope and that, once the United States pulled out, it would not proceed. How wrong that advice was and how lucky it was that this government, particularly our previous trade minister, Steven Ciobo, did not follow that advice. How lucky it was that they continued to prosecute that trade agreement, now successfully signed, and, I hope, soon successfully legislated through this chamber.

"Patrick, Sen Rex",CA,2018-09-19,"



Senator PATRICK
 (South Australia) (16:44):  I rise to speak on the MPI today. Division, instability and illegitimacy are characteristics that no government wants to be associated with. The division amongst the Liberal Party on energy policy is just one example of how disunity, coupled with a leader who lacked the courage of conviction, can cripple a government. The PM made a wrong decision and paid the ultimate price. However, we should not forget that it is not just the decisions of government that affect Australians; it is the decisions of all of us in this place. We have a responsibility to ensure that we are aware of the consequences of those decisions. 


That brings me to division on this side of the chamber in relation to the TPP. Labor is voting for the TPP enabling legislation, in contrast to its national platform. It's going to allow ISDS provisions to be included in the TPP agreement. It is also going to allow the waiving of labour market testing. They are going to do that knowing they could stop it. Centre Alliance, One Nation and the Greens are prepared to vote it down and only need Labor to stop those cancerous provisions being in that particular bill. They know they can stop it, but they have no courage of conviction. That has led to the same situation that Senator Paterson was describing before, where we now see, inside the Labor Party, significant division and we are starting to see leaks popping out through media channels. That, of course, is exactly what happened on the other side of the chamber. 


So my message is to both the government and the Labor Party. The government should seriously consider introducing an emissions intensity scheme to deliver industry and consumers significant reductions in power prices. The Australian Labor Party should seriously reconsider its decision to wave through the TPP without any changes to the ISDS clauses and with labour market testing waived. They need to remember who their supporter base is.

"Dodson, Sen Patrick",ALP,2018-09-19,"



Senator DODSON
 (Western Australia) (16:46):  A good government would govern for all Australians. It would ensure that it worked to bring Australians together, rather than constantly allowing division and discord, hatred and lies and attacks on those who cannot defend themselves in this parliament, which takes place from time to time. First Nations people do not see the current Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison government leading or, in fact, governing for us. We saw the debacle that took place when the Uluru statement came to this place. It was not even immediately brought to this chamber. It was leaked to some newspaper in Queensland and dribbled out to say there was no interest in acknowledging First Nations people either by way of legislation or by way of constitutional guarantee.


Then we get the absolute absurdity of an envoy being appointed to represent First Nations people. I'm not sure to whom—is it to the Minister for Indigenous Affairs, or the Prime Minister, or is it for the First Nations to be representing themselves back through this envoy, Mr Abbott, to one or other of those ministers? I don't know what resources he's got. I don't even know what he's going to do. He's appointed himself to be the schoolmaster of Indigenous kids around Australia, as if many of those families can't look after their own kids. There is an assumption that we cannot look after ourselves and we need a special envoy. One of my friends, who is very ill, when he heard of this—he's a West Australian—said, 'What we need is an Abbott-proof fence. We need to keep this bloke away from us.' Because when he came into power and was supervising the place as the Prime Minister, he called the homelands, where people live in poverty in remote communities, a lifestyle choice. He said the Eora people basically didn't exist. There was empty bush, and the invasion of these lands was a blessing upon us. In 2014 he said, 'When you look around at the glorious city of Sydney, as we see the extraordinary development, it's hard to think that back in 1788 there was nothing but bush.' This is the envoy to the First Nations of this country. What an insult. What an arrogant position the current Prime Minister, Mr Morrison, has taken. He hasn't defined what his position is. He hasn't shown us what he is prepared to do. He hasn't even made a statement as to the obligations of this particular envoy.


Again, when Mr Abbott was the Prime Minister and Mr Hockey was the Treasurer, they slashed the budget to Indigenous programs, which has left us with legacies that we're still trying to mop up. We've seen in recent times the role of the Minister for Indigenous Affairs—I don't know what his role is in relation to this envoy—in slashing the remote housing program, one of the key factors to get social determinants of health actually fixed and to give people, kids and families a decent quality of life. This government have just slashed that and decided that Western Australians, Queenslanders and people in South Australia are of no regard—these are remote Indigenous peoples.


Again, under the community development scheme—I hope the envoy is going to fix this because people are penalised by this draconian program that puts people on penalties for eight weeks, trying to survive without food—in fact, it's a starvation program. It's a horrid program. It creates poverty and despair, and I'm not sure how he's going to help the Minister for Indigenous Affairs fix this or help us fix the problem with his current government.


What we need is a united government that's not divided and can talk to its colleagues, have debates, have arguments but come out with consensus, a clear strategy and a clear approach as to how we're going to get behind the constitutional recognition of the First Nations and social policies that are, in fact, going to lead to equality. We've got some truth-telling to do about how the First Nations people are being denied their rightful place in this country. Thank you.

"Brockman, Sen Slade",LP,2018-09-19,"



Senator BROCKMAN
 (Western Australia) (16:51):  I'll agree with Senator Dodson on at least one thing: unity is important. On this side of the chamber, we have seen a government that is getting on with the job of delivering for Australians. Senator Watt is having a chuckle over there—and he must have had a chuckle when he read the paper this morning with the inside information on the caucus meeting, showing division over trade revealed for all to see, including very fine detail as to what was actually said in that meeting. I'm sure Senator Watt would have had a chuckle then.


What that reveals is an opposition with significant problems, and it comes at a time when we see right around the world a belief in the benefits of trade being challenged by a return to a populist view of economics. Clearly, that is strongly at play in the Labor Party of today where you've got a risk to the benefits of free trade when Australian businesses, Australian workers and Australians on the whole know that Australia is at the end of the line. We are a trading nation. If we do not trade, we have nothing. We need to trade with the rest of the world. In Western Australia, some 95 per cent of the wheat grown needs to be exported. There is no domestic market for it. With our livestock and so many areas of our agricultural production and mineral wealth that we export to the world, we are a trading nation and an exporting nation. We need to develop those trade links with the rest of the world in order to generate the wealth, in order to drive those businesses and in order to drive the jobs and the wages growth that all Australians want and which this government has been delivering.


My two colleagues who spoke before me, Senator Hume and Senator Paterson, talked about the jobs being created, so I won't go into that in detail. But 1,144,500 jobs—more than achieving the commitment of this government to deliver a million jobs in two terms. What do jobs do? Jobs give incomes to families. Jobs give people hope. Jobs give people dignity. The vast majority of those jobs are in the private sector. The majority of those jobs were full-time jobs. This is an unashamedly good-news story built on the back of a stronger economy and significantly positive economic reforms that this government has undertaken over the last five years.


The last quarterly results that came out show an Australian economy growing at 3.4 per cent, surpassing market expectation significantly. In fact, Australia is now in its 27th year of consecutive economic growth—the highest growth rate since 2012, a year, I will note, that was the height of the mining boom. Our economy is growing at a stronger rate than the world's seven largest advanced economies, the G7: the United States, Canada, Germany, France, Italy, the United Kingdom and Japan. And we are growing faster than the OECD average. If you listened to those opposite, you'd think that perhaps something very different was the case, but in actual fact our economy is performing extraordinarily well.


And it's not an imbalanced growth; that growth is being shared across the economy and across all states. The strongest growth was, in fact, in South Australia. Victoria is next and then Tasmania—not necessarily the states you would think of as being those driving the economic strength of Australia. But, of course, all states grew in that particular quarter, contributing to that nominal GDP growth rate for the year of 4.7 per cent as of September 2018. That beat the budget forecast of 4.25 per cent.


This means that in the economy no one sector needs to do the heavy lifting. We're not relying on the mining sector to drive economic growth, jobs and opportunities for Australians. It's a broad based economic growth that is good for all Australians. Again, it's good for Australians because it delivers those jobs. It delivers those high-quality jobs—those full-time jobs, those jobs that put food on the table for families and which give opportunities for gain further knowledge, to go and complete more education, and to gain the dignity that exists from having a job in a positive economy.


Household spending is above the long-term average, demonstrating confidence in the economy—confidence by the Australian people. That, in turn, is supporting this strong job creation achieved by the coalition government. And with job creation and a low unemployment rate, that will flow through into wages growth.


For my home state of Western Australia, the consistency in this government has delivered a significant reform to a very intractable problem, which was the GST issue. Since July 2018, along with the release of the Productivity Commission report, we have proposed reforms vital to fixing the issue of GST-sharing arrangements. This government wants to make the GST-sharing arrangements fairer, particularly in light of the situation in WA, whilst also making sure that no state is worse off. Currently—we all know this—Western Australia receives 47c in every dollar. That would jump to 70c and then to 75c under this government's plan. That results in a significant extra amount to spend on things such as schools, hospitals and other services over the next eight years: $4.7 billion. So we see a government that is actually delivering on the ground, delivering for my home state of Western Australia.


What is the flow-on effect of all of this economic growth which I have mentioned, and fixing economic problems like the GST-sharing arrangements and delivering a million-plus jobs into the economy—a vast majority of which, I will say again, are in the private sector and a majority of which are full-time jobs? It's less welfare dependency; it's fewer people who are actually relying on the welfare system. We have seen the percentage of working-age Australians on welfare falling to 15.1 per cent, the lowest rate of welfare dependency in over 25 years. On this side of the chamber, that is unmistakably a positive thing. But I do wonder if that's how those opposite feel.


New welfare reform measures have made the welfare system fairer, more equitable and easier to understand. We have strengthened mutual obligation requirements and are providing more incentives to help people move from welfare to work, and that's what they've done. We have seen jobs created and the welfare rolls fall. This is unashamedly good for the economy as a whole, taking the burden off taxpayers, allowing money to be redirected to important government spending and to tax cuts. It also means that people who are no longer on the welfare roll have a chance of breaking the cycle of welfare dependency that every study shows and everybody knows is so destructive to individual and family wellbeing.


We do believe that the best form of welfare is a job. We've delivered those million-plus jobs over the past five and a bit years, in less than two terms of government, and we will continue to deliver, because that is what this side of the chamber does for the Australian people. We deliver what we say we're going to deliver. We deliver good government and we deliver good economic management, and that allows us to provide such things as income tax relief to hardworking Australians. We're making income taxes lower, fairer and simpler. In 2018-19, around 4.4 million Australians will get tax relief of $530 per year and over 10 million taxpayers will get some tax relief. By the time our tax plan is fully implemented, we will see 94 per cent of taxpayers pay no more than 32.5 cents in the dollar. This is a great economic reform for Australia. It will allow Australian families to keep more of their own hard-earned money and invest that money in their families, their own future, their own education and their own wellbeing. It will give people opportunities into the future—opportunities to perhaps start a small business and create the new jobs of the future, which deliver such benefits to all Australians.

Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (17:01):  One of the many things you learn as a member of parliament, or even working in this building, is to sniff the air. You can feel the tempo in here. I don't think there's anyone working in this chamber at the moment who doesn't feel this government has lost control—total chaos. We've now got the Governor-General's address-in-reply speeches on the parliamentary schedule—on the Dynamic Red. You know they're scraping the bottom of the barrel when they have to bring up the in-reply speeches to the Governor-General's speech, which was delivered nearly two and a half years ago. We've seen the Liberals come in here and filibuster the most obscure bills during the Committee of the Whole stages. Senator Macdonald has been on his feet for nearly half the time we've been in the chamber this week—break the glass and roll out Senator Macdonald if you want a good filibuster. We've seen it. And what did we see this morning? We saw a piece of legislation written for Senator Leyonhjelm, and a minister who couldn't answer the most basic questions. This government has lost control, but I don't want anybody listening to this debate to think it can be seen just in the small things.


Stretch your mind back to only a week ago. We have a government whose numbers are so tight in the House—they are teetering on the edge of a no-confidence motion—that they had to send a junior minister to one of the most important meetings of the International Whaling Commission in 30 years. They couldn't send the environment minister, they couldn't send the Prime Minister and they couldn't even send the foreign minister. They couldn't afford to let anyone go, because their numbers are so tight in this place that they are hanging onto control by the tips of their fingernails.


The week before that we saw a meeting of the Pacific Island leaders putting out videos, one of which I shared on my Facebook page, slamming the Australian government for their lack of action on emissions and on an electricity sector policy to meet our Paris targets. Yesterday, we heard the chair of the Great Barrier Reef Foundation, which was recently awarded half a billion dollars of public money, say to a Senate committee that he believed that not only is the Great Barrier Reef in danger from rising emissions but indeed the world's coral reefs are all in danger from rising emissions. This is from a guy who was the CEO of Esso, or ExxonMobil, 30 years ago. He was telling the Senate that all our world's reefs are now in danger on the same day that our new energy minister in that other place was telling the Australian parliament that they have no policy for renewable energy beyond 2020. There is no Renewable Energy Target and no policy for renewables at a time when we most desperately need to reduce emissions.


This is a government that has a by-election looming in the seat of Wentworth. This is a government and a political party that is wracked by internal divisions following the second knifing of a Prime Minister in the last four years. If you want to see how divided this political party is, just have a look at the last votes when Mr Scott Morrison became Prime Minister elect by his own party. Not only did he fail to take more votes off Mr Peter Dutton than Mr Malcolm Turnbull did but he actually lost five votes to Mr Peter Dutton. That's how serious the situation is in the Liberal Party. I've seen it, and it goes back to that first comment about the tempo; even today's flaccid attempt to stand in here and mount some kind of resistance on their government doing a good job—




Senator Molan:
  That's not very nice!





Senator WHISH-WILSON:
  Yes, some men don't like that word. I do appreciate that, Senator Molan! Their flaccid resistance in this place today to mount a case for their government is very much what we've seen all week. More than half their senators aren't in here helping. They're not in here helping. I haven't seen them on speaking lists, probably because half of them have been moved from the frontbench to the backbench in recent weeks. This government is on the edge of losing control, but that's okay, because we want an election and we want to boot them out. (Time expired)

Senator FARUQI
 (New South Wales) (17:07):  by leave—I move:


That the Senate take note of document no. 2.


Today we have seen the release of mortality statistics from the Australian Meat and Live-stock Industry Act 1997 Livestock mortalities during export by sea report for the period 1 January to 30 June 2018, and they make for grim reading. Thousands of sheep are dying as these live export ships ply the seas in their trade of misery. We are still in the northern summer period for the Middle East, where oppressive heat conditions mean temperatures are reaching above 40 degrees. These are exactly the same conditions the infamous Awassi Express sailed in, which led to the extreme cruelty that we saw on 60 Minutes.


And now the Morrison government has approved the Maysora to go to the Middle East with tens of thousands of sheep. This is an incredibly reckless decision. Sheep are almost guaranteed to die of extreme heat stress. So much for our agricultural minister's crocodile tears for animals when he said that it was bullshit that sheep continue to die at sea on live export ships. For the federal government to give the go-ahead to a new shipment when they haven't even released their review of the live export regulator shows how little they think of this process. They're only interested in paying lip-service to animal welfare and just ticking the boxes.


In May this year the Australian Veterinary Association said that there shouldn't be shipments in the northern summer due to the heat stress risks. And the RSPCA has said that this advice was consistent with the outcomes of the recommendations made by Dr Michael McCarthy. But instead of acting on these recommendations, the government has opted for further testing and consultation, all while continuing to approve further export permits.


Prime Minister Morrison has gone out of his way to humiliate his Liberal colleagues, who actually care about this issue. I'm sorry to say that the time for inside-the-tent diplomacy really has passed. Liberal MPs who support the Greens bill to end the live export trade for sheep must walk the talk and bring it on for debate in the House of Representatives. What more evidence do we need that the Prime Minister does not care about the views of MPs in his own party? If you want to end the long-haul export of sheep to the Middle East, the only way is to vote with your head and your heart.


This ship, the Maysora, has a particularly troubled history. It's an old ship and it is completely unable to meet community expectations. On previous voyages, there were reports of sheep not being able to lie down and having inadequate access to food and water, as well as many sheep mortalities. I also note today's news that 19 crew members of the Maysora, which was preparing to load sheep on the docks in Fremantle for the Middle East, presented themselves to Australian Border Force officers on Monday night, claiming that they had gone unpaid for a long period of time and they did not want to return to the ship. It seems that live exports are not only bad for sheep; they're also bad for workers.


Going ahead with shipments before the review of the regulator is released just proves what we have known all along: that the history and the industry will not change. It really is just a matter of time before we get yet another expose of animal cruelty, the same as we have been getting consistently for 30 long years now. It's time to break this government's fake outrage cycle, commit to real action and end the cruelty. The only option is to ban live exports and to transition to the vastly more profitable and humane chilled meat export industry. No more excuses. The time for action is now.

"Brockman, Sen Slade",LP,2018-09-19,"



Senator BROCKMAN
 (Western Australia) (17:12):  I rise to take note of the same document. I will talk about outrage to start. I'll talk about the outrage of 1,000 farmers in a community hall in Katanning a few months ago about the threat from radical activist groups and some in this place to their livelihood, to their business, to their economic wellbeing and to their future, based on misinformation and half-truths. I have the document we are considering today in front of me, the livestock mortalities documentation, which is regularly reported as per the legal requirements on the industry. It shows further positive results from the industry in achieving good animal welfare outcomes.


This government has taken note of what occurred on ships last year. There were some particularly egregious instances that the public were rightly outraged at. But the track record of the industry is very good. We see today that mortality rates are 0.6 per cent amongst sheep and 0.14 per cent amongst cattle. There are a very small number of buffaloes that are exported live, and the mortality rate there is 0.08 per cent. We've seen an ongoing commitment from all parts of this industry to improving standards.


The government did ask Dr McCarthy to do a review. The review has reported, and the government has accepted those recommendations. Some of them required further work. There were clearly recommendations that needed to be able to be monitored and measured before they were actually implemented, and how that was to be done in a practical way needed to be worked through. That is an ongoing effort, and the government is committed to it. But the ship that has been in the media today that is going out shortly is largely a cattle ship, and I believe that those directly opposite still support the export of cattle in this way. I certainly hope they do. I certainly hope senators like Senator Watt from Queensland, if they no longer support the export of live cattle, tell the electorate that before the next election—




Senator Watt:
  We've never said we support that! We were talking about sheep; they're different to cattle.




Senator BROCKMAN:
  I think you should tell the electorate in Queensland if you're changing your mind on cattle, Senator Watt, because a lot of these issues are being conflated together when, in actual fact, these are very important parts of both the sheep industry, particularly in Western Australia, my home state, and South Australia and the cattle industry across the north of Western Australia, Northern Territory and Queensland. These are very important issues and getting the live sheep trade going again from Western Australia is a very important part of the economic wellbeing and the future of the industry in Western Australia, and of the economic wellbeing of 5½ thousand families who significantly rely on that trade. If you had been at that public meeting in Katanning a few months ago, you would have seen how dreadfully impacted those families were by what was going on, not only by the way their industry was being characterised, particularly by the Greens, but also by the abandonment of the industry by those in the Labor Party directly opposite us.


The industry does have a track record of positive outcomes and improving outcomes and it can do better; it will do better. This government is committed to allowing it to do better and has made a significant set of changes in order to do that, such as having an independent observer on every vessel leaving Australia. Changes like this have made and will continue to make a positive difference. We need to see the trade from a Western Australian perspective particularly continuing. We need to see strong support—I would hope bipartisan support—for the trade, not just the cattle sector of the trade but the whole trade going forward.

Senator WATT
 (Queensland) (17:17):  At the request of the Chair of the Procedure Committee, I present the Procedure Committee's third report of 2018 on disorder outside formal proceedings and I move:


That the Senate take note of the report.


This report flows from the statement made by the President on 13 August which dealt with an exchange between two senators on last sitting day in June. From a technical perspective, although the exchange occurred in the Senate while it was sitting, it occurred outside formal proceedings. The President asked the committee to consider the adequacy of the Senate's orders and practices to deal with allegations of disorder in these circumstances. The committee endorsed the approach signalled in the President's statement; in particular, the committee strongly endorsed the President's observations that this is rightly a place of vigorous debate, but personal abuse has no place in this chamber, particularly if it targets personal attributes such as race or gender; nor does the abuse of epithets or labels have a place. The use of such language does nothing to facilitate the operation of a chamber and free debate within it. We are all capable of vigorously arguing our case without resorting to it.


The technicality that conduct alleged to be disorderly occurs alongside but not as part of formal proceedings does not prevent the chair dealing with it in accordance with the standing orders. This is no different than the ability of the chair to deal with points of order about disorderly interjections that are not heard by the chair but are reported by other senators. However, the committee agreed it was generally undesirable to change the basis for dealing with disorder, which requires senators to raise points of order at the time of the incident to which they relate. This ensures those involved are in the Senate when the matter is addressed.


The committee agreed to draw senators' attention to this requirement but also recognised that a senator may not be in a position to draw interjections or other disorderly conduct to the attention of the chair at the time in all circumstances. The committee, therefore, also reminds senators that they have the capacity to make personal explanations by leave under standing order 190. This presents an opportunity to raise such matters outside the strictures of the process for determining points of order. I commend the report to the Senate.

 (Queensland—Minister for Resources and Northern Australia) (18:35):  


I move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard.


Leave granted.




The speech read as follows—



The Government stands shoulder to shoulder with our farmers, to ensure they can survive against the severe and widespread drought that has affected so many. 


Our farmers are the backbone of the nation, with farming families providing the produce all Australians rely on to feed our families. For this reason, the Government has an important role to play in backing our farmers in difficult times, and this Government is committed to doing what we can to help drought affected farming families across Australia.


The Government can't make it rain. But we can ensure that farming families and their communities get all the support they need to get through the drought, recover and get back on their feet. 


On 19 June 2018, the Government extended the availability of the Farm Household Allowance from three to four years, effective from 1 August 2018. 


On 5 August 2018, the Government announced a $190 million package of immediate additional financial support to help farming families and their communities fight one of the worst droughts of the past century. The package included further significant changes to the existing Farm Household Allowance to provide two lump sum supplementary payments worth up to $12,000 for eligible couples and $7,600 for singles. Also included were changes to the assets test to allow thousands more farmers to access support. 


These changes provide many farming families what they sorely lack during drought – cash income. This income helps put food on the table and cover basic expenses such as bills and school fees, and will flow through to businesses in country towns doing it tough. 


The package also included increased funding for mental health support, rural financial counselling and small grants for rural and regional not-for-profit community groups. The package took total support provided by the Commonwealth Government to drought-affected households and communities to more than $576 million.


At the same time, the Government announced that longer-term measures to improve the resilience of rural communities to handle drought conditions were being developed across Government in response to the issues raised with the then Prime Minister, Deputy Prime Minister, and Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources during their listening tour of New South Wales and Queensland in early June 2018.


On 19 August 2018, the Government announced the appointment of Major General Stephen Day, DSC, AM, as the National Drought Coordinator. The Government also announced the further expansion of direct assistance and concessional loans to aid drought-affected farmers, increasing total assistance to $1.8 billion, including:


additional funding for the Drought Communities Programme;


extending drought loans through the Regional Investment Corporation;


a dedicated drought preparedness round for the National Water Infrastructure Development Fund;


extension of funding for the Great Artesian Basin Sustainability Initiative;


Regional Weather and Climate Guides (through the Bureau of Meteorology);


streamlined Farm Household Allowance application forms and processing; and


providing an immediate deduction for fodder storage assets.


This Bill gives effect to the tax announcement. It amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to allow primary producers to immediately deduct the cost of fodder storage assets, first used or installed ready for use from 19 August 2018.


Currently, primary producers can deduct the value of fodder storage assets over three years under existing accelerated depreciation arrangements.


Providing an immediate deduction for fodder storage assets will make it easier for primary producers to stockpile fodder.


It will also reduce compliance costs as primary producers will no longer have to track the depreciation of fodder storage assets for more than one year for tax purposes.


This initiative complements the Government's $20,000 instant asset write-off for eligible small businesses, which we are extending to 30 June 2019.


I call on all Parliamentarians to give this Bill their full support so that we can provide farmers with faster tax relief on fodder storage assets, assisting them to better drought-proof their properties.


We will continue to engage with farmers to ensure our drought assistance measures meet their needs.


Full details of the initiative are contained in the Explanatory Memorandum.

Senator KETTER
 (Queensland—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (19:20):  I rise tonight to talk about the recent commitment by federal Labor to fund the duplication of the Linkfield Road overpass at Bald Hills. Currently the Linkfield Road overpass is a congestion choke point for motorists coming on and off the Gympie Road arterial in Brisbane, particularly where drivers travelling from the west turn north onto the highway where two lanes merge into one immediately before the turnoff. In recent years there has been significant residential development around Bald Hills, Carseldine and Bracken Ridge, populations that are or should be serviced by this particular road. Unfortunately, despite the growing residential population, the capacity of the overpass continues to be neglected by current Liberal representatives. It's now an infamous stretch for accidents and traffic congestion, and it has been identified by the state's peak road body, the RACQ, as a key priority for government action. That's why on 24 August Labor's shadow minister for infrastructure and transport, Mr Albanese, joined with federal Labor candidates for Petrie, Corinne Mulholland, and Dickson, Ali France, to announce that a Shorten Labor government will invest $60 million to duplicate this overpass. While local Liberal representatives Mr Howarth and Mr Dutton were busy plotting to overthrow former Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, Corinne Mulholland and Ali France were out there listening to the needs of the community and campaigning to get this commitment.


I want to mention that Corinne Mulholland has been here in Canberra this week meeting with key decision-makers and lobbying on behalf of residents in the Petrie electorate. Locals are telling her that they are fed up with Liberal cuts to health and education. They're fed up with Liberal inaction on transport infrastructure. They are particularly fed up with Liberal re-announcements of already-funded projects, a trick they tried again this year in the Turnbull-Morrison budget in May. Is it any wonder that those opposite have to resort to re-announcing projects? As we saw in media reports today, they are so torn up internally that any semblance of an agenda to take this country forward seems to have been lost.


But, while this chaotic, dysfunctional Liberal government tears itself apart through infighting, bullying, plotting and scheming, Labor is getting on with the job. While those opposite are cancelling COAG and shutting down parliament, Labor is focused on the needs of everyday Australians. We don't want people sitting in traffic for one second longer than they have to. We want workers to have more time at home with their families and friends, engaging in recreational activities and being more productive in the workforce. These are our Labor values. It is strong investment in transport infrastructure, both road and rail, that helps us to achieve these goals.


Our record on this side of the chamber speaks for itself, particularly in the northern suburbs of Brisbane. It was Labor who finally invested in the Redcliffe Peninsula railway line, a project that was talked about for over a century before Labor governments at the state and federal levels stumped up and delivered. Labor again, at both federal and state levels, has delivered billions of dollars in upgrades to the Bruce Highway and the Gateway Motorway. It is Labor who will deliver the Cross River Rail to clear the way for more frequent train services between the city and the northern suburbs, particularly across peak hours. In the electorate of Petrie, Corinne Mulholland has also secured a commitment to expand the availability of parking at the Mango Hill train station.


While those opposite like to turn up to the opening of Labor projects when they're in government, it is Labor who get the work done when we are in government. And while the Liberal-National government is happy to cancel COAG, denying the states and territories the chance to have crucial conversations about funding for key issues like health, education, drought assistance and transport infrastructure, while they're happy to skip out on this important forum, Labor want to work with the states and territories. We relish the chance to hear what they want and what they need.


In Queensland, federal Labor will work with the Palaszczuk government to deliver the transport infrastructure that our suburbs need, like Cross River Rail and the Linkfield Road overpass. Our commitment of $60 million for this upgrade will greatly improve the liveability of nearby suburbs, including Strathpine, Bald Hills, Bracken Ridge, Carseldine, Warner and Albany Creek. This duplication will improve business opportunities in the industrial hub of Brendale and slash local commuter travel times.
