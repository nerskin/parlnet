Senator PRATT
 (Western Australia) (12:31):  The Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Cost Recovery) Bill 2014, which we are debating today, is part of a commitment to a more streamlined and efficient environmental assessment process. That is a well-documented thing and it is part of Labor's election commitments, so we are supporting this bill that is before us. But it is important in this context, because of how the government has framed this debate, to note that Labor on the other hand does not support in any way the other processes put in train by this government to delegate the approval of environmental powers to both state and local governments.


We acknowledge that the principle of this bill—in terms of cost recovery—is sound, because it allows for proponents of developments to contribute to the cost of assessment and to the development of the application process by the Commonwealth. We think that is a good thing. What we do object to, though, is the fact that the minister has presented this bill as part of the government's overall agenda to hand over the Commonwealth's important responsibility to protect matters of national environmental significance to state governments. As we have recently discovered, this also includes local councils.


As we know, the government has begun the process of handing over environmental approval powers to the states. I really object to the fact that this will give people like Campbell Newman control over the Great Barrier Reef, and, indeed, it will give Colin Barnett control over our wonderful Ningaloo Reef. It is important today that I emphasise that our attitude to this bill is very separate to our overall attitude to those ministerial intentions, even though the government has sought to present them together as a package. That is, the government wants to broadly hand over our responsibilities under the EPBC Act to the states. We believe that these should be packaged very separately.


The delineation between us and the coalition on these matters should be very clear from the outset. We should be able to do streamlining, as this bill does, and save taxpayer money without attacking standards. Environmental standards have been under demonstrable attack right around the country time and time again. I will highlight some of those attacks for the chamber today. The government went against all reason in handing over—quite sneakily, in my view—the world's largest marine reserve system by reproclaiming it and undoing the very management plans that gave those marine protections effect.


The government has also, in my view, all but abandoned efforts to have Queensland's Cape York added to the World Heritage List. It has also approved every request for development in the Great Barrier Reef that has landed on the minister's desk. This is despite the fact that UNESCO has threatened to list the reef as endangered. We have seen some of those issues play out before the World Heritage Committee this week.


Sharks have been on the hit list, with the minister approving an exemption to the WA government to allow drum lining to take place off the WA coast. That is a completely illogical process, because it has been reeling in shark species that are not even the ones that are implicated in the shark attacks that have been taking place against West Australians. There is a huge amount of environmental damage being wreaked against animals that actually have not been implicated in any of the shark attacks that have taken place.


We know that this government has also been taking us backwards on climate change. We are the laughing stock on the world stage. In Warsaw this year, during the last climate change talks, we were awarded an unprecedented five Fossil Awards. As we have seen just today, the attempt of the government to approach the World Heritage Committee to delist 74,000 hectares of Tasmanian wilderness has very fortunately been completely rejected by the World Heritage Committee. I cannot begin to tell you how relieved I am that that is the case. We are now resorting to international fora to protect our important World Heritage listed sites, as the government itself has abandoned them. All these issues truly expose the government's lack of environmental credentials, which has been on display time and time again. These kinds of environmental standards are under attack in the other bill that is before this place, which the government claims is packaged up with this one. The EPBC Act deals with bilateral assessments and approvals, but that other bill would allow state and local governments to approve developments in what are, in my view, some of the nation's most iconic and significant environmental assets. 


I want to reflect very briefly on the parts of this bill which are important and which we do not object to. There is a fee structure for cost recovery within this bill for environmental assessments. This fee structure will be put within regulation and ministerial determinations and will have a formula to ensure appropriate cost recovery for the assessments. Environmental assessment activities are, in Labor's view, appropriate for cost recovery as the activities provide a clear benefit for particular proponents to undertake developments that may impact on the environment. I think this is a clear and important objective. We note that exemptions and waivers are also going to be part of this system, which will ensure that public entities providing a public benefit will not be burdened by additional fees. You can see where cost recovery is appropriate. Where we have resources that are going to be economically exploited, the cost recovery for those environmental assessments should take place but we should distinguish them from things that require assessment for the public benefit. We want to see cost recovery encourage proponents to think about engaging early and in a very strategic way in how to manage their costs within the environmental assessment process. We have seen in the past that there can be a cost blow-out for government as these processes drag on. So this measure is a good thing, because we think it will contribute to a more streamlined assessment process as proponents seek to manage their costs in the most efficient way possible. 


To conclude, Labor support the streamlining of environmental assessments for major projects but final approval of matters of national environmental significance should, in our view, remain with the national government—but that is a separate issue to the matters before us in this bill which pertain to cost recovery for environmental assessment and which we are prepared to support.

"Waters, Sen Larissa",AG,2014-06-24,"



Senator WATERS
 (Queensland) (12:40):  I rise to speak against the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Cost Recovery) Bill 2014, and I do so for several reasons. The crux of this bill is to say that the Department of the Environment can only get properly funded if it is prepared to tick off on myriad destructive proposals. I think that is perverse logic. Sadly, we have seen over many years a consistent imposition of an efficiency dividend. We have seen staff cut after staff cut at the environment department. The department is chronically underresourced, such that it is not able to perform its functions adequately. Now we have this dangerous proposal to say: 'That's all right. You can take money from the developers because you won't have your independence compromised. It's not like you're starved of funds and you need to approve these development applications to get the money that you need'! So this is a very dangerous course of action. The inability to manage those risks is the very reason why the Greens are opposing this bill. 


There is obviously well-documented literature on regulatory capture, and I raised this issue in Senate estimates. Much to my surprise, the department had not engaged very deeply with the concept and nor were they able to reassure me that they had these mechanisms in place to manage the inappropriate influence that was being put on them by the industries which they are meant to be regulating as opposed to facilitating. Sadly, what we see is that there is no political will to ever refuse development. There have been literally 10 refusals in the 14 years that we have had the EPBC on foot. This just makes a mockery of our environmental approval system. It just makes it a tick-and-flick process—which brings me to the ANAO audit that was issued last week in which this point was highlighted. 


The ANAO report said, in fact, that chronic underresourcing of the department is why it has an inability or perhaps a lack of political will to enforce conditions. The ANAO report was incredibly damning. It found that the staffing in the department was so low that compliance was simply not happening to the level that the public would expect it to happen. This has been an open secret for a long time. Everybody knows that the developers can get away with blue murder because the department is simply not enforcing its own conditions. Evidently from this government there is no political will to do that, but certainly those public servants themselves do not lack the political will; they lack the resources to do their jobs properly. Despite this and despite the regular reports finding that compliance is poor—we had the Gladstone inquiry report just a few weeks and the ANAO report last week—this government is going to increase the staff cuts to that department and to many others. There are going to be 129 staff cut from the section that includes compliance. Again, in estimates, I asked: 'Are you serious? Are you really going to cut more people from compliance?' They were not able to give me the figures for how many will come from that subset, but 129 people will be sacked from the division that includes compliance. This is incredibly concerning to the Greens. This is just the latest assault on the environment from this government.


Sadly, in the short period that this government has been at the helm, we have seen a litany of attacks and assaults on Australia's environment. We have this crazy and dangerous proposal to give away the Commonwealth's powers to protect the environment to state governments. That is obviously coming to us in a separate bill, which I hope this place kicks out on its rear end for the dangerous and dodgy proposal that it is. 


This plan to say that the Commonwealth could no longer stop development in World Heritage areas, that it could no longer save the last remaining habitat of a federally threatened species—what planet are we on? We have had 30 years of increasing involvement of the Commonwealth government in protecting the environment, and rightly so. The national environment is not just nationally significant; we have told the world that it is internationally significant when we protect it with something like a World Heritage listing. The notion that you could put the state governments in charge of that—and even, as this government wants, the local governments in charge of that—just boggles the mind. You seriously could not think of a worse proposal for the environment. And it comes at the worst possible time in history, when we are in a climate crisis, when we are in a biodiversity crisis and when all of our environmental indicators on soil health, land health and marine are going down. 


Sadly, that is just the first assault. There have been so many others. We do not have a minister for science anymore. We do not have a stand-alone minister for climate change, because of course climate change is crap, according to this Prime Minister. We do not have funding for the Environmental Defender's Offices anymore—the only independent, public-interest community legal centre that helps the community enforce environmental laws. Senator George Brandis decides that, no, he does not like the fact that the community can enforce the law, so he has abolished the funding to the EDO. 


We have got the attempt to roll back our climate laws, which, again, I hope this place stands firm on and sends packing, because we desperately need to do something about climate change. The system we have got in place is the best system that we can have. It is designed to be improved and it is designed to set this country and our grandchildren up for a liveable future. This government is trying to abolish the Climate Commission, the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and ARENA. Again, it is economic lunacy to not invest in renewable energy, to not invest in the future, with the clean energy and the job creation those bodies have facilitated, along with the fact that the CEFC is making us money when we are in this so-called budget crisis. Where on earth is the rationale for abolishing that body? 


The approval of the world's largest coal port in the Great Barrier Reef comes in at No. 7 on my list of the Abbott government's assault on the environment. I do not know in what universe that is considered acceptable, given the hundreds of scientists and the many thousands of community members who have spoken out about it, along with the international condemnation of the World Heritage Committee. They have come out saying not only that climate change is a huge threat to the reef on top of crown-of-thorns and water quality from run-off but that dredging and dumping is the latest threat to the reef. Yet we have the world's biggest coal port approved by the Abbott government at Abbot Point. Perhaps he just liked the synergy there with his name. 


Reef Rescue is a fantastic program where work has been going on with farmers. Sadly, $40 million has been cut out of that successful program. The Water Commission too has been abolished. Again, that was an independent body that was doing excellent work and providing independent scientific advice. This government is not so keen on science; it prefers to listen to—I don't know—the IPA. 


There has been an attempt to delist the Tassie forests. Thank goodness overnight that was roundly rejected by the international community and the World Heritage Committee, with one country even calling the attempt feeble. Thank heavens we still have protection for those beautiful and important forests. Unfortunately, the Prime Minister thinks we have got too much forest locked up in national parks. Apparently he does not realise that, actually, half of Australians like to visit national parks on a regular basis and that tourists kind of like to visit them too. So it is not just good for biodiversity; it is actually also good for our economy. But, no, we have got too much forest locked up. The government is dismantling world-leading marine protection laws. Again, these are not only attacks on the environment but an assault on economic profitability and the tourism sector. 


All of the megamines proposed for the Galilee Basin in my home state of Queensland would be a climate disaster should they proceed, including for the likes of Mr Clive Palmer and Ms Gina Rinehart. If we open up the Galilee Basin and mine all of that coal it would make that region, that basin, the seventh largest carbon emitter in the world—right when we are in a climate emergency and right when we should be, at every moment, thinking of the lives that we will leave for our grandchildren.


The list goes on, unfortunately. The government is refusing to give landholders the right to say no to coal seam gas or coal on their land because of the huge threats to groundwater—and to surface water, for that matter—and to the very farming operations themselves. So much for standing up for the farmers. I have brought bills and motions before this place. We have not received support for those actions to try to protect land and water from the rapacious fossil fuel industry, which is thankfully coming to its end. Do we want to fix the mining tax and raise some revenue in this so-called budget crisis? Nah. We just want to give the big miners what they want, so this government wants to abolish the mining tax. 


The government are already seeking to abolish the Biodiversity Fund, one of the few measures that has actually been helping to rehabilitate land and has been available to land managers to access support for the good land management that they do and could have been funded to do. No—they want to abolish that as well. Cape York World Heritage nomination: where did that go? It got delayed and now we find out in estimates that the staff have been slashed to progress that nomination. There used to be 5.7 people and now there are only 1½ people progressing that. The traditional owners want that listing. They were so close to finalising the consultation—they were about to put the lines on the maps—and the government have pulled the rug out from underneath them because they are not committed to World Heritage. And almost half a billion dollars has been slashed from Landcare over five years.


It is against that backdrop and against that most heinous assault of giving the powers to protect Australia's national environment to states or councils—they don't care who; anyone will do—that we have this bill to seek to recover the costs of assessing development applications that would have a significant impact on a matter of national environmental significance. It is somewhat ironic that we are seeing this bill now given that the Abbott government soon will not have many applications to assess anyway, precisely because they are giving away those powers to the states and local councils. Frankly, one wonders why they are bothering. Indeed, one wonders why they are bothering when they have not set up a structure that will enable the conflict of interest to be managed. 


A year or more ago we saw a similar proposal mooted for the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority so that they would be able to increase their fees for offshore dumping. We opposed that as well, because you simply cannot have a regulator hooked on funds from the damaging activity that they are meant to be regulating rather than facilitating. So there is no mechanism to manage the conflict of interest there, nor to manage the threat to the independence of the department. Given the chronic under-resourcing and chronic understaffing, it is a slap in the face to say, 'The department does not deserve to be funded and well resourced; we are going to make the developers do the work that the government should be doing.' 


The Department of the Environment needs to be properly resourced to do its job independently without scrimping and saving, and ticking and flicking. They should not be in a position where they do not have the people, the expertise, the time or the money to properly scrutinise these most damaging of applications. They are not assessing people's carports or a house going up; they are assessing significant impacts on matters of national environmental significance. This is the worst of the worst, and we are chronically underfunding and understaffing the regulatory folk who are meant to be doing that job. It simply demonstrates that there is no political will in the government to stand up for the environment, and there is simply a mentality of tick and flick, and of continuing to slash staff. 


That is why the Greens will be opposing this bill, as we will oppose those other assaults on the environment that I mentioned earlier, and as we will oppose, with every fibre of our being, this plan to put state governments or local councils—anyone will do—in charge of the national environment. It is a recipe for destruction, and we will fight it with everything we have.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2014-06-24,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (12:53):  I rise to contribute to the debate on the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Cost Recovery) Bill 2014. On this side we have been asked to confine our remarks because we are keen to get these bills through, but it is important to enter the debate, particularly after hearing a Greens political party speaker speak. Some people do listen to these broadcasts, and if you listened to the previous speech you would be appalled at where it said Australia is going. The Greens political party and their friends—the Wilderness Society, the WWF, I regret to say, and the Marine Conservation Society—work on the basis that any lie, any misrepresentation, will justify the means. That is why the Greens and all those other groups are spending literally tens of millions of dollars on a glossy brochure campaign full of misrepresentations and inconsistencies to try and shut down the Australian coal industry that gives this country the standard of living it currently has and many of the jobs that are currently provided for fellow Australians.


I am conscious of time, but I cannot let the previous speech go without addressing some of outrageous claims the previous speaker made. For example, we are being told that the Commonwealth EPBC Act is being thrown out the door and that the laws will no longer apply because we are getting a one-stop shop for the states to administer. The same laws will apply. Nothing is happening with the EPBC Act except having something instead of the process of the state governments assessing a project and then, when they have finished, having another group of Commonwealth bureaucrats going through the same process, doubling the time to obtain an environmental approval. 


I have not had a chance to get the figures—if someone wants to correct me they can—but as I recall under Labor, when someone made an application for an EPBC Act approval, the average number of days to get an approval, subject to conditions, or a knock-back was over 700 days. Under the current government, as I recall, the same applications are averaging something like 87 days. Those figures may not be accurate, but they are in the ballpark. That is because the Labor Party has always relied on the Greens in order to retain government. The Labor Party knows that the Greens want to stop every development in Australia, so they have a deliberate go-slow policy federally and they do that on top of the state regimes, who have already assessed most applications. 


What this range of bills will do is ensure that all of the applications can be dealt with by one set of bureaucrats, using two sets of laws, Commonwealth and state, but assessing almost the same things. If you listened to the previous speaker, you would think that the Commonwealth EPBC Act has been thrown away. I often say to my friend Robert Hill, who introduced that act—a Liberal minister—'Look, a lot of people are unhappy about the way that act delays everything.' He says to me, quite rightly, 'It is not the act that is the problem; it is the way it is administered.' Under Liberal governments it is administered properly, efficiently and quickly, and you either get a no or a yes, and away you go. Under Labor you have to wait something like years to get these approvals. 


I relate an instance up my way in North Queensland: an aquaculture prawn farm—we like aquaculture as it saves the wild-caught fishing industry—spent something like $15 million over about five years trying to get approval for one prawn farm. They eventually got the state approval but they then had to turn around and start all over again for a federal approval. No wonder we cannot afford the price of prawns in Australia at the present time.


Senator Walters complained that we had stopped funding for certain purposes only for the Environmental Defender's Offices. She says that that means now the public cannot stop anything and cannot enter into any contest with the Commonwealth. Yes, they can, Senator Walters. If they feel so strongly about it, some of these groups that are spending millions on this glossy brochure campaign to stop the coal industry could actually put some of that funding into paying their own lawyers. 


If you listened to Senator Walters, you would think we have taken away the ability to contest these things. What we have done is redirect funding for much-needed legal aid to those places where legal aid is desperately needed. The senator could not resist her ongoing campaign on global warming. I recommend that she read a very thoughtful and well-developed argument in the papers recently from Maurice Newman, who, unfortunately for the senator and her cohorts, points out that, on any evidence at all, there has been no global warming for more than 20 years. But I will not enter into that. She then said the Abbot Point decision was an assault on the environment and an assault on the Barrier Reef. Senator Walters is always very careful with the words she chooses, but the dredging at Abbot Point is nowhere near the Great Barrier Reef—nowhere near it; 40 or 50 kilometres away. She talked about the dredging and dumping on the Great Barrier Reef. As she knows, it is nowhere near the Great Barrier Reef; Abbot Point is in the lagoon a little way out from the mainland. It is near where I live and I enjoy that part of the Barrier Reef. I am not worried about it, and neither is the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority—the scientific, well-funded group that looks at these things. The Institute of Marine Science does not get directly involved but lends support to various elements.


Then we got on to the World Heritage Commission. What an outrageous decision it was last night on the Tasmanian forest! Why do we bother being directed by this foreign group? Have a look who is on that, Senator Walters, and have a look at the environmental significance of the countries they come from. And yet they are sitting in judgement of us. As Senator Colbeck has said many a time, this World Heritage forest they are talking about is a forest that has been logged for years. So how come it is a pristine heritage forest, when it has already been logged? For the World Heritage Commission to enter into that is an absolute disgrace; and I might say the same about their deliberations on the Great Barrier Reef. They have given it a temporary reprieve, but the Great Barrier Reef is there; it will continue to exist forever; it will continue to attract tourists from all over the world; and it will continue to do that no matter what the World Heritage Commission says. As an Australian and a Queenslander, I get disgusted when people like the Greens political party and this foreign body try to diminish or shut down Australia's tourism industry by making false accusations on the Great Barrier Reef. There is some recent science which shows—as I have always said, nature is a wonderful thing, Senator Walters—the reef will regenerate itself.




Senator Hanson-Young:
  On a point of order, Mr Acting Deputy President, I would like to remind Senator Macdonald that the senator's name is Senator Waters, not Walters.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  I apologise to Senator Waters if I have been mispronouncing her name. I do wish that you would also get your facts correct before you enter into these debates. Senator Waters also talked about the marine protected zones which the Abbott government has changed so that decisions are now made on the basis of—heaven forbid—science and scientific advice. That is rather different to relying on some American conservation agency that was set up, I might say, on the back of the profits of the oil industry decades ago. That group was embarrassed by what it had done to the American environment and now it pours millions of dollars into the Pugh Foundation, which then roams the world lecturing everyone else in the world about proper management of marine parks. Fortunately, under the Abbott government, marine parks will be managed according to science.


I am sorry that I have not even got onto my speech yet, but this is a debate and I cannot let the Greens continue to mislead the Australian public. Senator Waters laments the passing of the mining tax, but it was tax that did not make any money. It was a tax that cost more to implement than it ever recovered. Why wouldn't you get rid of it? Senator Waters also talked about the abolition of the Biodiversity Fund. She does not remember that it was the Howard government's Natural Heritage Trust that put all that money into the protection of biodiversity. Senator Waters also laments that a group of Canberra bureaucrats will lose their jobs because they will no longer have work to do in the Commonwealth Department of the Environment. That is because the work they were doing was duplicating work that another set of bureaucrats had done in Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne, Hobart, Adelaide and Perth. Why should you employ a group of people to do exactly the same work as another set of bureaucrats? Of course we will reduce the numbers, because they are not needed. The Commonwealth laws will be addressed by the state bureaucrats when they are doing the state environmental assessments. 


The final comment of Senator Waters that I recorded was that local councils would make decisions on the EPBC Act. I would like you to show me where that is provided for, Senator Waters. It sounds good. It will frighten some people who have Labor councils, I guess, in Sydney and elsewhere, to think that they would be left in charge of EPBC Act applications, but the state governments will be administering things, as they should.


I have extended my time to speak but I have not even got on to my speech. The second reading speech does clearly indicate what it is all about. I will not repeat that, except to say: the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Cost Recovery) Bill 2014 will amend the act to allow for cost recovery for environmental impact assessments and approvals. And who could argue with that? That is the way things are these days. Cost recovery will help to ensure that the Department of the Environment is adequately resourced to undertake efficient environmental assessments.


In a nutshell, that is what this bill is all about. I welcome the support of the Labor Party for the bill. It would be too much to expect that the Greens would support anything that the Howard or Abbott governments brought forward, and so I, to a degree, disregard their mismatch of reasons for not supporting this. But this is an appropriate step on the way through to bring some sense and good process to the protection of our environment, which this government is so keen to do and enhance.

"Urquhart, Sen Anne",ALP,2014-06-24,"



Senator URQUHART
 (Tasmania—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (13:08):  I rise to make a short contribution to the debate on the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Cost Recovery) Bill 2014. I note that this bill was referred to the Senate Environment and Communications Legislation Committee together with the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Bilateral Agreement Implementation) Bill 2014, and the committee reported yesterday. That inquiry found serious shortcomings with the bilateral agreement amendment bill and, unfortunately, that bill has not yet been brought on for debate.


The cost recovery amendment bill before us is supported by the opposition. I note from the inquiry that there are only two groups opposed to the bill: the Greens, and the mining industry together with the Business Council of Australia—an unlikely alliance, of course, for very different reasons.


At the hearing we had the opportunity to question representatives from the Minerals Council and the Association of Mining and Exploration Companies. Despite being the champions of the one-stop shop reform, and despite the hearing being held in their home town of Melbourne, the Business Council refused the committee's offer to appear at the hearing.


At the hearing, when asking the miners about cost recovery, I noted from their submissions that they were opposed for two general reasons: they wanted general government revenue to finance the environmental approvals process, and they did not like that the cost recovery hit a mining company at the early stage of a project. I then put it to the miners that there was currently a superprofits tax in place that contributes to general government revenue and only taxes a miner when they are making a superprofit, not when they are in the exploration or investment phases. Based on this logic, I put to the miners this question: would this superprofits tax be a fairer way of paying for the management of regulations than cost recovery? The answers were entirely predictable. Both organisations did not like cost recovery because it hit their members' bottom line and they already pay enough tax—those were their words. Both organisations were supportive of the abolition of the superprofits tax, with the AMEC noting that it does not affect its members as they are exploration companies, but still noting its opposition. The answer was that general government revenue rather than cost recovery should be used to finance the environmental approvals.


What is striking is that almost no-one else agrees. The Liberal and National parties are in support of cost recovery, through their moving of this bill here today. But the Greens political party are opposed to cost recovery. The Greens' brief dissenting report on the bill highlights the principle of 'regulatory capture' where a regulator which is supposed to act in the public interest is compromised because of relationships developed with those it is charged with regulating. In this case, they refer to the regulator relying on the cost recovery fees to sustain their operations. However, I do not believe this principle holds in this instance because no-one is proposing that cost recovery cover all of the costs of running environmental regulation in the Department of the Environment. For a start, the fees have not been set yet, and the fee structure will be specified in regulation and ministerial determinations. Further, a range of exemptions and waivers will be available for small business in particular, and also for other bodies at the discretion of the minister. Of course, we will need to assess this fee structure and formula once it has been developed, to ensure appropriate cost recovery. At that point, it would be appropriate to compare the resources of the department in environmental regulation with the proposed fee intake to ensure that there are sufficient funds for the management of the output.


At this point I just want to note that I am appalled by the job cuts proposed by Minister Hunt for his department and the broken promises of Mr Hunt and Mr Abbott on a range of environmental protection measures.


I urge the Greens to support the bill and work with the opposition when the ministerial determinations and regulations are handed down, to ensure that they are appropriate.

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance) (13:12):  I thank senators who have contributed to this debate. Cost recovery for environmental assessment activities under the EPBC Act is an important initiative. The introduction of cost recovery is in line with past and present government policy and guidelines on cost recovery. Incredibly, the decision to introduce cost recovery for environmental assessments was taken by the previous government and was included as a measure in the 2012-13 budget—that is, two budgets ago—and of course it comes down yet again to this government to actually progress legislation for the parliament to give effect to a measure that the previous government had banked in their budget two budgets ago.


This bill will allow for the effective implementation of cost recovery for Commonwealth environmental assessment activities, including strategic assessments, by allowing regulations to set fees for environmental assessments and make provision for fee waivers, exemptions and refunds. Cost recovery will provide incentives to industry to undertake early engagement and incorporate the most environmentally acceptable outcomes into their business planning in order to reduce costs.


The Australian government is committed to delivering a one-stop shop for environmental approvals. That was one of the commitments that we took to the last election. Cost recovery complements the government's commitment to streamlining environmental approvals under the one-stop shop arrangement. It will improve the Department of the Environment's ability to meet statutory time frames by providing a sustainable source of resources to improve the efficiency of the assessment process. Cost recovery arrangements under the EPBC Act will apply only to Commonwealth assessment activities and not to state assessment activities. When an action is covered by the one-stop shop a person will not have to pay any fees to the Commonwealth for the state assessment. It will be up to the states and territories to decide whether to cost recover for their own environmental impact assessment activities.


In conclusion, the implementation of cost recovery will assist with the government's streamlining agenda by helping to ensure that Commonwealth government environmental assessment activities are carried out as efficiently and as effectively as possible. The bill demonstrates the government's commitment to implementing genuine reform to deliver more effective and efficient regulatory processes while maintaining high environmental standards. I commend the bill to the Senate.

Senator PRATT
 (Western Australia) (12:31):  The Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Cost Recovery) Bill 2014, which we are debating today, is part of a commitment to a more streamlined and efficient environmental assessment process. That is a well-documented thing and it is part of Labor's election commitments, so we are supporting this bill that is before us. But it is important in this context, because of how the government has framed this debate, to note that Labor on the other hand does not support in any way the other processes put in train by this government to delegate the approval of environmental powers to both state and local governments.


We acknowledge that the principle of this bill—in terms of cost recovery—is sound, because it allows for proponents of developments to contribute to the cost of assessment and to the development of the application process by the Commonwealth. We think that is a good thing. What we do object to, though, is the fact that the minister has presented this bill as part of the government's overall agenda to hand over the Commonwealth's important responsibility to protect matters of national environmental significance to state governments. As we have recently discovered, this also includes local councils.


As we know, the government has begun the process of handing over environmental approval powers to the states. I really object to the fact that this will give people like Campbell Newman control over the Great Barrier Reef, and, indeed, it will give Colin Barnett control over our wonderful Ningaloo Reef. It is important today that I emphasise that our attitude to this bill is very separate to our overall attitude to those ministerial intentions, even though the government has sought to present them together as a package. That is, the government wants to broadly hand over our responsibilities under the EPBC Act to the states. We believe that these should be packaged very separately.


The delineation between us and the coalition on these matters should be very clear from the outset. We should be able to do streamlining, as this bill does, and save taxpayer money without attacking standards. Environmental standards have been under demonstrable attack right around the country time and time again. I will highlight some of those attacks for the chamber today. The government went against all reason in handing over—quite sneakily, in my view—the world's largest marine reserve system by reproclaiming it and undoing the very management plans that gave those marine protections effect.


The government has also, in my view, all but abandoned efforts to have Queensland's Cape York added to the World Heritage List. It has also approved every request for development in the Great Barrier Reef that has landed on the minister's desk. This is despite the fact that UNESCO has threatened to list the reef as endangered. We have seen some of those issues play out before the World Heritage Committee this week.


Sharks have been on the hit list, with the minister approving an exemption to the WA government to allow drum lining to take place off the WA coast. That is a completely illogical process, because it has been reeling in shark species that are not even the ones that are implicated in the shark attacks that have been taking place against West Australians. There is a huge amount of environmental damage being wreaked against animals that actually have not been implicated in any of the shark attacks that have taken place.


We know that this government has also been taking us backwards on climate change. We are the laughing stock on the world stage. In Warsaw this year, during the last climate change talks, we were awarded an unprecedented five Fossil Awards. As we have seen just today, the attempt of the government to approach the World Heritage Committee to delist 74,000 hectares of Tasmanian wilderness has very fortunately been completely rejected by the World Heritage Committee. I cannot begin to tell you how relieved I am that that is the case. We are now resorting to international fora to protect our important World Heritage listed sites, as the government itself has abandoned them. All these issues truly expose the government's lack of environmental credentials, which has been on display time and time again. These kinds of environmental standards are under attack in the other bill that is before this place, which the government claims is packaged up with this one. The EPBC Act deals with bilateral assessments and approvals, but that other bill would allow state and local governments to approve developments in what are, in my view, some of the nation's most iconic and significant environmental assets. 


I want to reflect very briefly on the parts of this bill which are important and which we do not object to. There is a fee structure for cost recovery within this bill for environmental assessments. This fee structure will be put within regulation and ministerial determinations and will have a formula to ensure appropriate cost recovery for the assessments. Environmental assessment activities are, in Labor's view, appropriate for cost recovery as the activities provide a clear benefit for particular proponents to undertake developments that may impact on the environment. I think this is a clear and important objective. We note that exemptions and waivers are also going to be part of this system, which will ensure that public entities providing a public benefit will not be burdened by additional fees. You can see where cost recovery is appropriate. Where we have resources that are going to be economically exploited, the cost recovery for those environmental assessments should take place but we should distinguish them from things that require assessment for the public benefit. We want to see cost recovery encourage proponents to think about engaging early and in a very strategic way in how to manage their costs within the environmental assessment process. We have seen in the past that there can be a cost blow-out for government as these processes drag on. So this measure is a good thing, because we think it will contribute to a more streamlined assessment process as proponents seek to manage their costs in the most efficient way possible. 


To conclude, Labor support the streamlining of environmental assessments for major projects but final approval of matters of national environmental significance should, in our view, remain with the national government—but that is a separate issue to the matters before us in this bill which pertain to cost recovery for environmental assessment and which we are prepared to support.

"Waters, Sen Larissa",AG,2014-06-24,"



Senator WATERS
 (Queensland) (12:40):  I rise to speak against the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Cost Recovery) Bill 2014, and I do so for several reasons. The crux of this bill is to say that the Department of the Environment can only get properly funded if it is prepared to tick off on myriad destructive proposals. I think that is perverse logic. Sadly, we have seen over many years a consistent imposition of an efficiency dividend. We have seen staff cut after staff cut at the environment department. The department is chronically underresourced, such that it is not able to perform its functions adequately. Now we have this dangerous proposal to say: 'That's all right. You can take money from the developers because you won't have your independence compromised. It's not like you're starved of funds and you need to approve these development applications to get the money that you need'! So this is a very dangerous course of action. The inability to manage those risks is the very reason why the Greens are opposing this bill. 


There is obviously well-documented literature on regulatory capture, and I raised this issue in Senate estimates. Much to my surprise, the department had not engaged very deeply with the concept and nor were they able to reassure me that they had these mechanisms in place to manage the inappropriate influence that was being put on them by the industries which they are meant to be regulating as opposed to facilitating. Sadly, what we see is that there is no political will to ever refuse development. There have been literally 10 refusals in the 14 years that we have had the EPBC on foot. This just makes a mockery of our environmental approval system. It just makes it a tick-and-flick process—which brings me to the ANAO audit that was issued last week in which this point was highlighted. 


The ANAO report said, in fact, that chronic underresourcing of the department is why it has an inability or perhaps a lack of political will to enforce conditions. The ANAO report was incredibly damning. It found that the staffing in the department was so low that compliance was simply not happening to the level that the public would expect it to happen. This has been an open secret for a long time. Everybody knows that the developers can get away with blue murder because the department is simply not enforcing its own conditions. Evidently from this government there is no political will to do that, but certainly those public servants themselves do not lack the political will; they lack the resources to do their jobs properly. Despite this and despite the regular reports finding that compliance is poor—we had the Gladstone inquiry report just a few weeks and the ANAO report last week—this government is going to increase the staff cuts to that department and to many others. There are going to be 129 staff cut from the section that includes compliance. Again, in estimates, I asked: 'Are you serious? Are you really going to cut more people from compliance?' They were not able to give me the figures for how many will come from that subset, but 129 people will be sacked from the division that includes compliance. This is incredibly concerning to the Greens. This is just the latest assault on the environment from this government.


Sadly, in the short period that this government has been at the helm, we have seen a litany of attacks and assaults on Australia's environment. We have this crazy and dangerous proposal to give away the Commonwealth's powers to protect the environment to state governments. That is obviously coming to us in a separate bill, which I hope this place kicks out on its rear end for the dangerous and dodgy proposal that it is. 


This plan to say that the Commonwealth could no longer stop development in World Heritage areas, that it could no longer save the last remaining habitat of a federally threatened species—what planet are we on? We have had 30 years of increasing involvement of the Commonwealth government in protecting the environment, and rightly so. The national environment is not just nationally significant; we have told the world that it is internationally significant when we protect it with something like a World Heritage listing. The notion that you could put the state governments in charge of that—and even, as this government wants, the local governments in charge of that—just boggles the mind. You seriously could not think of a worse proposal for the environment. And it comes at the worst possible time in history, when we are in a climate crisis, when we are in a biodiversity crisis and when all of our environmental indicators on soil health, land health and marine are going down. 


Sadly, that is just the first assault. There have been so many others. We do not have a minister for science anymore. We do not have a stand-alone minister for climate change, because of course climate change is crap, according to this Prime Minister. We do not have funding for the Environmental Defender's Offices anymore—the only independent, public-interest community legal centre that helps the community enforce environmental laws. Senator George Brandis decides that, no, he does not like the fact that the community can enforce the law, so he has abolished the funding to the EDO. 


We have got the attempt to roll back our climate laws, which, again, I hope this place stands firm on and sends packing, because we desperately need to do something about climate change. The system we have got in place is the best system that we can have. It is designed to be improved and it is designed to set this country and our grandchildren up for a liveable future. This government is trying to abolish the Climate Commission, the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and ARENA. Again, it is economic lunacy to not invest in renewable energy, to not invest in the future, with the clean energy and the job creation those bodies have facilitated, along with the fact that the CEFC is making us money when we are in this so-called budget crisis. Where on earth is the rationale for abolishing that body? 


The approval of the world's largest coal port in the Great Barrier Reef comes in at No. 7 on my list of the Abbott government's assault on the environment. I do not know in what universe that is considered acceptable, given the hundreds of scientists and the many thousands of community members who have spoken out about it, along with the international condemnation of the World Heritage Committee. They have come out saying not only that climate change is a huge threat to the reef on top of crown-of-thorns and water quality from run-off but that dredging and dumping is the latest threat to the reef. Yet we have the world's biggest coal port approved by the Abbott government at Abbot Point. Perhaps he just liked the synergy there with his name. 


Reef Rescue is a fantastic program where work has been going on with farmers. Sadly, $40 million has been cut out of that successful program. The Water Commission too has been abolished. Again, that was an independent body that was doing excellent work and providing independent scientific advice. This government is not so keen on science; it prefers to listen to—I don't know—the IPA. 


There has been an attempt to delist the Tassie forests. Thank goodness overnight that was roundly rejected by the international community and the World Heritage Committee, with one country even calling the attempt feeble. Thank heavens we still have protection for those beautiful and important forests. Unfortunately, the Prime Minister thinks we have got too much forest locked up in national parks. Apparently he does not realise that, actually, half of Australians like to visit national parks on a regular basis and that tourists kind of like to visit them too. So it is not just good for biodiversity; it is actually also good for our economy. But, no, we have got too much forest locked up. The government is dismantling world-leading marine protection laws. Again, these are not only attacks on the environment but an assault on economic profitability and the tourism sector. 


All of the megamines proposed for the Galilee Basin in my home state of Queensland would be a climate disaster should they proceed, including for the likes of Mr Clive Palmer and Ms Gina Rinehart. If we open up the Galilee Basin and mine all of that coal it would make that region, that basin, the seventh largest carbon emitter in the world—right when we are in a climate emergency and right when we should be, at every moment, thinking of the lives that we will leave for our grandchildren.


The list goes on, unfortunately. The government is refusing to give landholders the right to say no to coal seam gas or coal on their land because of the huge threats to groundwater—and to surface water, for that matter—and to the very farming operations themselves. So much for standing up for the farmers. I have brought bills and motions before this place. We have not received support for those actions to try to protect land and water from the rapacious fossil fuel industry, which is thankfully coming to its end. Do we want to fix the mining tax and raise some revenue in this so-called budget crisis? Nah. We just want to give the big miners what they want, so this government wants to abolish the mining tax. 


The government are already seeking to abolish the Biodiversity Fund, one of the few measures that has actually been helping to rehabilitate land and has been available to land managers to access support for the good land management that they do and could have been funded to do. No—they want to abolish that as well. Cape York World Heritage nomination: where did that go? It got delayed and now we find out in estimates that the staff have been slashed to progress that nomination. There used to be 5.7 people and now there are only 1½ people progressing that. The traditional owners want that listing. They were so close to finalising the consultation—they were about to put the lines on the maps—and the government have pulled the rug out from underneath them because they are not committed to World Heritage. And almost half a billion dollars has been slashed from Landcare over five years.


It is against that backdrop and against that most heinous assault of giving the powers to protect Australia's national environment to states or councils—they don't care who; anyone will do—that we have this bill to seek to recover the costs of assessing development applications that would have a significant impact on a matter of national environmental significance. It is somewhat ironic that we are seeing this bill now given that the Abbott government soon will not have many applications to assess anyway, precisely because they are giving away those powers to the states and local councils. Frankly, one wonders why they are bothering. Indeed, one wonders why they are bothering when they have not set up a structure that will enable the conflict of interest to be managed. 


A year or more ago we saw a similar proposal mooted for the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority so that they would be able to increase their fees for offshore dumping. We opposed that as well, because you simply cannot have a regulator hooked on funds from the damaging activity that they are meant to be regulating rather than facilitating. So there is no mechanism to manage the conflict of interest there, nor to manage the threat to the independence of the department. Given the chronic under-resourcing and chronic understaffing, it is a slap in the face to say, 'The department does not deserve to be funded and well resourced; we are going to make the developers do the work that the government should be doing.' 


The Department of the Environment needs to be properly resourced to do its job independently without scrimping and saving, and ticking and flicking. They should not be in a position where they do not have the people, the expertise, the time or the money to properly scrutinise these most damaging of applications. They are not assessing people's carports or a house going up; they are assessing significant impacts on matters of national environmental significance. This is the worst of the worst, and we are chronically underfunding and understaffing the regulatory folk who are meant to be doing that job. It simply demonstrates that there is no political will in the government to stand up for the environment, and there is simply a mentality of tick and flick, and of continuing to slash staff. 


That is why the Greens will be opposing this bill, as we will oppose those other assaults on the environment that I mentioned earlier, and as we will oppose, with every fibre of our being, this plan to put state governments or local councils—anyone will do—in charge of the national environment. It is a recipe for destruction, and we will fight it with everything we have.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2014-06-24,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (12:53):  I rise to contribute to the debate on the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Cost Recovery) Bill 2014. On this side we have been asked to confine our remarks because we are keen to get these bills through, but it is important to enter the debate, particularly after hearing a Greens political party speaker speak. Some people do listen to these broadcasts, and if you listened to the previous speech you would be appalled at where it said Australia is going. The Greens political party and their friends—the Wilderness Society, the WWF, I regret to say, and the Marine Conservation Society—work on the basis that any lie, any misrepresentation, will justify the means. That is why the Greens and all those other groups are spending literally tens of millions of dollars on a glossy brochure campaign full of misrepresentations and inconsistencies to try and shut down the Australian coal industry that gives this country the standard of living it currently has and many of the jobs that are currently provided for fellow Australians.


I am conscious of time, but I cannot let the previous speech go without addressing some of outrageous claims the previous speaker made. For example, we are being told that the Commonwealth EPBC Act is being thrown out the door and that the laws will no longer apply because we are getting a one-stop shop for the states to administer. The same laws will apply. Nothing is happening with the EPBC Act except having something instead of the process of the state governments assessing a project and then, when they have finished, having another group of Commonwealth bureaucrats going through the same process, doubling the time to obtain an environmental approval. 


I have not had a chance to get the figures—if someone wants to correct me they can—but as I recall under Labor, when someone made an application for an EPBC Act approval, the average number of days to get an approval, subject to conditions, or a knock-back was over 700 days. Under the current government, as I recall, the same applications are averaging something like 87 days. Those figures may not be accurate, but they are in the ballpark. That is because the Labor Party has always relied on the Greens in order to retain government. The Labor Party knows that the Greens want to stop every development in Australia, so they have a deliberate go-slow policy federally and they do that on top of the state regimes, who have already assessed most applications. 


What this range of bills will do is ensure that all of the applications can be dealt with by one set of bureaucrats, using two sets of laws, Commonwealth and state, but assessing almost the same things. If you listened to the previous speaker, you would think that the Commonwealth EPBC Act has been thrown away. I often say to my friend Robert Hill, who introduced that act—a Liberal minister—'Look, a lot of people are unhappy about the way that act delays everything.' He says to me, quite rightly, 'It is not the act that is the problem; it is the way it is administered.' Under Liberal governments it is administered properly, efficiently and quickly, and you either get a no or a yes, and away you go. Under Labor you have to wait something like years to get these approvals. 


I relate an instance up my way in North Queensland: an aquaculture prawn farm—we like aquaculture as it saves the wild-caught fishing industry—spent something like $15 million over about five years trying to get approval for one prawn farm. They eventually got the state approval but they then had to turn around and start all over again for a federal approval. No wonder we cannot afford the price of prawns in Australia at the present time.


Senator Walters complained that we had stopped funding for certain purposes only for the Environmental Defender's Offices. She says that that means now the public cannot stop anything and cannot enter into any contest with the Commonwealth. Yes, they can, Senator Walters. If they feel so strongly about it, some of these groups that are spending millions on this glossy brochure campaign to stop the coal industry could actually put some of that funding into paying their own lawyers. 


If you listened to Senator Walters, you would think we have taken away the ability to contest these things. What we have done is redirect funding for much-needed legal aid to those places where legal aid is desperately needed. The senator could not resist her ongoing campaign on global warming. I recommend that she read a very thoughtful and well-developed argument in the papers recently from Maurice Newman, who, unfortunately for the senator and her cohorts, points out that, on any evidence at all, there has been no global warming for more than 20 years. But I will not enter into that. She then said the Abbot Point decision was an assault on the environment and an assault on the Barrier Reef. Senator Walters is always very careful with the words she chooses, but the dredging at Abbot Point is nowhere near the Great Barrier Reef—nowhere near it; 40 or 50 kilometres away. She talked about the dredging and dumping on the Great Barrier Reef. As she knows, it is nowhere near the Great Barrier Reef; Abbot Point is in the lagoon a little way out from the mainland. It is near where I live and I enjoy that part of the Barrier Reef. I am not worried about it, and neither is the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority—the scientific, well-funded group that looks at these things. The Institute of Marine Science does not get directly involved but lends support to various elements.


Then we got on to the World Heritage Commission. What an outrageous decision it was last night on the Tasmanian forest! Why do we bother being directed by this foreign group? Have a look who is on that, Senator Walters, and have a look at the environmental significance of the countries they come from. And yet they are sitting in judgement of us. As Senator Colbeck has said many a time, this World Heritage forest they are talking about is a forest that has been logged for years. So how come it is a pristine heritage forest, when it has already been logged? For the World Heritage Commission to enter into that is an absolute disgrace; and I might say the same about their deliberations on the Great Barrier Reef. They have given it a temporary reprieve, but the Great Barrier Reef is there; it will continue to exist forever; it will continue to attract tourists from all over the world; and it will continue to do that no matter what the World Heritage Commission says. As an Australian and a Queenslander, I get disgusted when people like the Greens political party and this foreign body try to diminish or shut down Australia's tourism industry by making false accusations on the Great Barrier Reef. There is some recent science which shows—as I have always said, nature is a wonderful thing, Senator Walters—the reef will regenerate itself.




Senator Hanson-Young:
  On a point of order, Mr Acting Deputy President, I would like to remind Senator Macdonald that the senator's name is Senator Waters, not Walters.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  I apologise to Senator Waters if I have been mispronouncing her name. I do wish that you would also get your facts correct before you enter into these debates. Senator Waters also talked about the marine protected zones which the Abbott government has changed so that decisions are now made on the basis of—heaven forbid—science and scientific advice. That is rather different to relying on some American conservation agency that was set up, I might say, on the back of the profits of the oil industry decades ago. That group was embarrassed by what it had done to the American environment and now it pours millions of dollars into the Pugh Foundation, which then roams the world lecturing everyone else in the world about proper management of marine parks. Fortunately, under the Abbott government, marine parks will be managed according to science.


I am sorry that I have not even got onto my speech yet, but this is a debate and I cannot let the Greens continue to mislead the Australian public. Senator Waters laments the passing of the mining tax, but it was tax that did not make any money. It was a tax that cost more to implement than it ever recovered. Why wouldn't you get rid of it? Senator Waters also talked about the abolition of the Biodiversity Fund. She does not remember that it was the Howard government's Natural Heritage Trust that put all that money into the protection of biodiversity. Senator Waters also laments that a group of Canberra bureaucrats will lose their jobs because they will no longer have work to do in the Commonwealth Department of the Environment. That is because the work they were doing was duplicating work that another set of bureaucrats had done in Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne, Hobart, Adelaide and Perth. Why should you employ a group of people to do exactly the same work as another set of bureaucrats? Of course we will reduce the numbers, because they are not needed. The Commonwealth laws will be addressed by the state bureaucrats when they are doing the state environmental assessments. 


The final comment of Senator Waters that I recorded was that local councils would make decisions on the EPBC Act. I would like you to show me where that is provided for, Senator Waters. It sounds good. It will frighten some people who have Labor councils, I guess, in Sydney and elsewhere, to think that they would be left in charge of EPBC Act applications, but the state governments will be administering things, as they should.


I have extended my time to speak but I have not even got on to my speech. The second reading speech does clearly indicate what it is all about. I will not repeat that, except to say: the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Cost Recovery) Bill 2014 will amend the act to allow for cost recovery for environmental impact assessments and approvals. And who could argue with that? That is the way things are these days. Cost recovery will help to ensure that the Department of the Environment is adequately resourced to undertake efficient environmental assessments.


In a nutshell, that is what this bill is all about. I welcome the support of the Labor Party for the bill. It would be too much to expect that the Greens would support anything that the Howard or Abbott governments brought forward, and so I, to a degree, disregard their mismatch of reasons for not supporting this. But this is an appropriate step on the way through to bring some sense and good process to the protection of our environment, which this government is so keen to do and enhance.

"Urquhart, Sen Anne",ALP,2014-06-24,"



Senator URQUHART
 (Tasmania—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (13:08):  I rise to make a short contribution to the debate on the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Cost Recovery) Bill 2014. I note that this bill was referred to the Senate Environment and Communications Legislation Committee together with the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Bilateral Agreement Implementation) Bill 2014, and the committee reported yesterday. That inquiry found serious shortcomings with the bilateral agreement amendment bill and, unfortunately, that bill has not yet been brought on for debate.


The cost recovery amendment bill before us is supported by the opposition. I note from the inquiry that there are only two groups opposed to the bill: the Greens, and the mining industry together with the Business Council of Australia—an unlikely alliance, of course, for very different reasons.


At the hearing we had the opportunity to question representatives from the Minerals Council and the Association of Mining and Exploration Companies. Despite being the champions of the one-stop shop reform, and despite the hearing being held in their home town of Melbourne, the Business Council refused the committee's offer to appear at the hearing.


At the hearing, when asking the miners about cost recovery, I noted from their submissions that they were opposed for two general reasons: they wanted general government revenue to finance the environmental approvals process, and they did not like that the cost recovery hit a mining company at the early stage of a project. I then put it to the miners that there was currently a superprofits tax in place that contributes to general government revenue and only taxes a miner when they are making a superprofit, not when they are in the exploration or investment phases. Based on this logic, I put to the miners this question: would this superprofits tax be a fairer way of paying for the management of regulations than cost recovery? The answers were entirely predictable. Both organisations did not like cost recovery because it hit their members' bottom line and they already pay enough tax—those were their words. Both organisations were supportive of the abolition of the superprofits tax, with the AMEC noting that it does not affect its members as they are exploration companies, but still noting its opposition. The answer was that general government revenue rather than cost recovery should be used to finance the environmental approvals.


What is striking is that almost no-one else agrees. The Liberal and National parties are in support of cost recovery, through their moving of this bill here today. But the Greens political party are opposed to cost recovery. The Greens' brief dissenting report on the bill highlights the principle of 'regulatory capture' where a regulator which is supposed to act in the public interest is compromised because of relationships developed with those it is charged with regulating. In this case, they refer to the regulator relying on the cost recovery fees to sustain their operations. However, I do not believe this principle holds in this instance because no-one is proposing that cost recovery cover all of the costs of running environmental regulation in the Department of the Environment. For a start, the fees have not been set yet, and the fee structure will be specified in regulation and ministerial determinations. Further, a range of exemptions and waivers will be available for small business in particular, and also for other bodies at the discretion of the minister. Of course, we will need to assess this fee structure and formula once it has been developed, to ensure appropriate cost recovery. At that point, it would be appropriate to compare the resources of the department in environmental regulation with the proposed fee intake to ensure that there are sufficient funds for the management of the output.


At this point I just want to note that I am appalled by the job cuts proposed by Minister Hunt for his department and the broken promises of Mr Hunt and Mr Abbott on a range of environmental protection measures.


I urge the Greens to support the bill and work with the opposition when the ministerial determinations and regulations are handed down, to ensure that they are appropriate.

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance) (13:12):  I thank senators who have contributed to this debate. Cost recovery for environmental assessment activities under the EPBC Act is an important initiative. The introduction of cost recovery is in line with past and present government policy and guidelines on cost recovery. Incredibly, the decision to introduce cost recovery for environmental assessments was taken by the previous government and was included as a measure in the 2012-13 budget—that is, two budgets ago—and of course it comes down yet again to this government to actually progress legislation for the parliament to give effect to a measure that the previous government had banked in their budget two budgets ago.


This bill will allow for the effective implementation of cost recovery for Commonwealth environmental assessment activities, including strategic assessments, by allowing regulations to set fees for environmental assessments and make provision for fee waivers, exemptions and refunds. Cost recovery will provide incentives to industry to undertake early engagement and incorporate the most environmentally acceptable outcomes into their business planning in order to reduce costs.


The Australian government is committed to delivering a one-stop shop for environmental approvals. That was one of the commitments that we took to the last election. Cost recovery complements the government's commitment to streamlining environmental approvals under the one-stop shop arrangement. It will improve the Department of the Environment's ability to meet statutory time frames by providing a sustainable source of resources to improve the efficiency of the assessment process. Cost recovery arrangements under the EPBC Act will apply only to Commonwealth assessment activities and not to state assessment activities. When an action is covered by the one-stop shop a person will not have to pay any fees to the Commonwealth for the state assessment. It will be up to the states and territories to decide whether to cost recover for their own environmental impact assessment activities.


In conclusion, the implementation of cost recovery will assist with the government's streamlining agenda by helping to ensure that Commonwealth government environmental assessment activities are carried out as efficiently and as effectively as possible. The bill demonstrates the government's commitment to implementing genuine reform to deliver more effective and efficient regulatory processes while maintaining high environmental standards. I commend the bill to the Senate.

 (Tasmania) (15:16):  I move: 


That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Employment (Senator Abetz) to a question without notice asked by Senator Thorp today relating to the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area.


Today Australians can be in no doubt that we cannot trust this government to look after our environment. Since it gained power, the Abbott government has systematically tried to dismantle Australia's strong environmental protections and attempted to open up Australia's precious World Heritage spaces to loggers and big polluters, but overnight in Doha, common sense has prevailed. The World Heritage Committee took just seven minutes to reach agreement that the Abbott government's attempt to delist 74,000 hectares of World Heritage forest in my home state of Tasmania should not proceed. The committee saw what was clear to anyone who had even a passing acquaintance with the facts: that the delisting was completely unjustified and, if approved, would have set a dangerous global precedent. 


Ironically, the very area in question is the very area the World Heritage Commission itself requested Australia to include in our World Heritage listings in 2007, 2008, 2010 and again in 2012. Really, the government were asking the World Heritage Committee to say that it was wrong when it repeatedly asked for the extensions in these years and wrong again when it supported the extension application in 2013. Not only that, but in preparing its submission for the excision, the government relied on exactly the same data that convinced the World Heritage Committee to list the area only a year ago. No extra information was sourced, no field trips were undertaken by the department, no further mapping was done and no experts were consulted. Instead, in its submission to the World Heritage Committee, the government simply jotted down a few words next to each of the 13 areas they wanted to excise. In fact, 10 of these areas only had the words 'contained logs/degraded areas' as the single justification for their excision. It is almost as though the government thought they did not need to provide any sort of evidence to support their claims—as if their very words alone would make it so. Well, it is not so. 


It seems the World Heritage Committee agrees; one member nation referred to the Abbott government's application as 'feeble'. And feeble is exactly what it is. Recently I chaired an inquiry into the delisting which found that the vast majority of the proposed excision area—unlike the comments from Senator Abetz earlier—is pristine, untouched wilderness. During hearings, expert witnesses described the government's claims to the contrary as 'incorrect', 'grossly overstated' and 'blatantly misleading if not downright dishonest'. Again and again, witnesses asserted that the vast majority of the 74,000 hectares is in no way degraded. Many attested that more than 90 per cent of the excision area has high conservation values and no evidence of logging. Tellingly, the Department of the Environment representatives agreed under questioning that only four per cent of the area could be described as heavily disturbed.




Senator Colbeck:
  That is not true.




Senator THORP:
  It is true. In fact, the 748-hectare area to be listed at Dove River near Cradle Mountain has been put forward to be excised despite the fact the environment department has determined the degree of disturbance to be precisely none. Of course, the World Heritage Committee last year found the area to be of outstanding universal environmental and cultural value. This is not surprising when you understand the area is habitat to iconic rare and endangered species such as the Tasmanian devil, the Tasmanian wedge-tailed eagle, the spotted-tail quoll, the grey goshawk and the myrtle elbow orchid. It also incorporates pristine tracts of old-growth tall eucalypt forests, rainforests, cave systems and moorlands that are simply too precious to lose.


What made the excision request even more absurd was that it was supposed to deliver economic and social outcomes by invigorating the forest industry. Sadly, and perhaps even a little ironically, it is this government's cavalier excision plan that would have done more damage to the forest industry than they can possibly imagine. The inquiry heard again and again that this excision, if it were to go ahead, would threaten Tasmania's Forest Stewardship Council's certification, which would in turn threaten the viability of our timber industry. Thanks to this government, we are becoming rapidly known as having an aggressive anti-environment agenda which pays scant regard to the impacts on generations to come— (Time expired)

"Bushby, Sen David",LP,2014-06-24,"



Senator BUSHBY
 (Tasmania—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (15:21):  I also rise to take note of answers from Minister Abetz. As Minister Abetz noted when he provided the answers to the questions on this matter, the people of Tasmania have spoken on this issue. Both the federal and state elections saw a resounding mandate provided to the Liberal parties at federal and state level for the policies that both those state and federal parties took to the respective elections.


In the federal scenario, we saw massive swings in Braddon and Lyons, those being the electorates in Tasmania most heavily affected by forestry—particularly Lyons, where Eric Hutchinson, the excellent and very strong member for that federal electorate, achieved the largest swing of any winning seat in the country. That, to a large extent, is because of the strong support for him by the people of Lyons because of this issue and the stance that he and the Liberal Party took on it. Similarly, at the state election, Labor received an absolute thumping—the biggest thumping it had received since 1992. And nowhere was that bigger than in Braddon, an area also heavily impacted by decisions to wind back forestry.


The fact is that the boundary adjustments of the year before last occurred as part of a flawed political process. Tasmanian Labor went to the 2010 election on a bipartisan ticket to support forestry, as it had done for decades. But it ended up in minority after the 2010 election, and it did a dirty deal with the Greens. Part of that deal was the so-called forest peace agreement which they put together. Out of that forest peace agreement came the boundary adjustment under which Labor gave in to the longstanding claims of the extreme environmental movement who want nothing more than to shut down the forestry industry in Tasmania completely. They did that by reducing the areas of forest available for harvest to below viable levels. This was achieved through this flawed, rushed process which saw the WHC list these additional small adjustments to the existing World Heritage areas.


It is worth looking for a minute at the truly sustainable state of what the forest industry used to do prior to the IGA being put in place in Tasmania. Back then, only a few years ago, on the rate of harvesting that was occurring at that time, in 100 years time there would have been 103 per cent of the native forests in Tasmania that there were at that time. There was more native forest being replanted than was being harvested. In 100 years time, there would have been 103 per cent of the native forests in Tasmania that then existed.


What, you might ask, was being planted instead? Were we putting in plantation forests or something that was changing the nature of those forests? No. With every coupe that was being harvested through Forestry Tasmania in Tasmania, they would go in beforehand and harvest seeds from all the plants in that very coupe, to maintain the genetic material of that coupe. They would then go off and take those seeds away and start growing them. They would come in and do the harvesting of the forests, and then they would go back and plant the same seeds from the same trees that were harvested in those coupes. Five years down the track, if you were to go back and look at those coupes, you would see that there was lots of healthy growth with a mix of plants that reflected what was there before. In 20 years time, if you were to come back you would not know it from the coupe next door that had not been harvested. And in 100 years time, there would be big trees and everything—and 100 years time is what we are talking about, when there would be 103 per cent of the native forests. That is the standard of the forest practices that were occurring—and what they were trying to stop here.


It is also important to remember this. I think Senator Thorp mentioned eagles and other issues of concern to many people. Well, if there is an eagle's nest found in a forest, I cannot remember exactly but I think they were not allowed to log within five kilometres around it. If there were streams or waterways, there was a buffer of half a kilometre or something similar to that where they could not log. These were the practices that were in place for Tasmanian forests. They were outstanding. They were world's best practice. And they protected all the sorts of environmental values and heritage that Senator Thorp was saying were threatened by our attempted delisting. We do it so well, in fact, that a lot of the areas that were added to the World Heritage area through the boundary adjustment were areas that had been previously forested and had regrown. The environment movement now claims that these are so well regrown that they are now World Heritage in terms of the standard of their forests.

"Urquhart, Sen Anne",ALP,2014-06-24,"



Senator URQUHART
 (Tasmania—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (15:26):  I also rise to speak to the motion to take note of answers given by the Minister for Employment, Senator Abetz, to questions without notice asked today by Senator Thorp on the Abbott government's feeble and failed attempt to have parts of the Tasmanian wilderness removed from the World Heritage list. Senator Abetz's response was a personal attack on Senator Thorp, and showed his resolve to play politics over policy in regard to Tasmanian forests.


I begin by highlighting the remarks of the Portuguese delegation to the World Heritage Committee, who said that the arguments of the Australian government were, to say the least, feeble, and would set an unacceptable precedent. Of course these are just the first comments to come out of Doha, and we will all wait with interest to see what other responsible governments have to say about the Abbott government's almost unprecedented move to seek a delisting.


From the beginning, the rhetoric from the Tasmanian Liberals against a forest peace deal was simple political point-scoring. They saw an opportunity to wedge the community once more, just so that they could get into government. Once in government, of course, everything was out of the window.


Just a few weeks ago, Parliamentary Secretary Colbeck, Premier Hodgman and the member for Braddon, Brett Whitely, were more than happy to turn the sod on a project funded through the Tasmanian forests agreement package at Ta Ann in Smithton—the very agreement that saw industry, unions and environmentalists come together and end the decades-long war in the forests; the very agreement that was conceived by the industry because they knew that if the forest wars were to continue then their markets would continue to look elsewhere.


In December last year, the ABC reported what everyone in this place knows: without the peace deal, Ta Ann would have left Tasmania. Ta Ann's Executive Director, Evan Rolley, said at the time:


I don't think we would be operating the business, frankly … the Forest Agreement provided the basis on which we could go back in the market, hold the small amount of market that was still there for us …


Interestingly, despite all the huffing and puffing over the past four years, it is reported that, when push came to shove, the Abbott Liberal government did not even put in much of an effort to have the World Heritage listing reversed.



The Advocate newspaper in Burnie reported today that lobbyists at the meeting said there appeared to be little evidence of Australian government lobbying for the wind-back, in contrast to concentrated effort last week to avoid the listing of the Great Barrier Reef as in danger. After all of the rhetoric and all of the negativity, reports are out that the Liberal government barely even lobbied to see through the delisting. I suspect that industry has had a quiet word about how life is now and that there is peace in the forests. I also suspect that industry has had a quiet word to the Liberal state government about its bill to unwind the Tasmanian Forests Agreement. The state Liberals were just as rabid as the federal Liberals in pointing the finger at Labor. And the state Liberals promised to unlock Tasmania. And, as Senator Bushby said, they were rewarded for their campaign at the ballot box. But once they were in government the Tasmanian Liberals put up a bill that will not see one extra log available for harvesting for the next six years.


Tasmanians are waking up to the constant deception of the Abbott and Hodgman governments. The Burnie Advocate was running an online poll asking whether people supported the World Heritage Committee's decision. Over 50 per cent of respondents agreed with the World Heritage Committee's decision. We all know how vexed this issue is in Tasmania, yet a poll in the north-west's local newspaper showed that over 50 per cent are in support of the World Heritage Committee's decision. It is just further evidence that the Australian public is wising up to the negative feeble campaigns of the Liberal and National parties.



Senator Colbeck interjecting—




Senator URQUHART:
  I conclude my contribution by noting that the 'robust and rigorous' Senator Colbeck, as Senator Abetz described him, has suffered from 'bandwidth limit exceeded' on his website today. I wanted to take another look at Senator Colbeck's photos of a so-called degraded area. These are photos that the department assured me in estimates were not included in the submission to the World Heritage Committee, photos that Senator Colbeck, Senator Abetz and the self-titled 'three amigos'—Mr Whitely, Mr Nikolic and Mr Hutchinson—use time and time again in their feeble campaign to unlock this so-called degraded area. The embarrassment to the Australian people on the international stage is the responsibility of Senator Colbeck, Senator Abetz and the three amigos. All Tasmanians—indeed, all Australians—deserve much better from our government.

"Colbeck, Sen Richard",LP,2014-06-24,"



Senator COLBECK
 (Tasmania—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture) (15:31):  It gives me great pleasure to speak on the motion moved by the Labor Party in respect of questions asked of Senator Abetz by Senator Thorp. What the Labor Party have just demonstrated, yet again, is two things. One is their strong connection with the Greens—and they are arguing now for Greens policy. We know that the Greens want to close down the native forest industry in Australia, and the Labor Party are complicit with them in that process. We have just heard that argument. The second thing is that they have absolutely no understanding of the forest industry. Senator Urquhart talks about the area not being utilised in Tasmania for another six years. It is not needed in an immediate sense, but it is needed for the sustainability of the forest industry in the long term. What the Labor Party do not know—or are not prepared to admit—is that the Tasmanian Forests Agreement was actually a death sentence for the forest industry in Australia. That is why the green group supported it. It was a death sentence for the forest industry in Australia. And I wonder if the Labor Party would have been prepared to stump up again in 2027-30 to pay out what was left of the industry when their wood supply ran out. That is what the Labor Party and the Greens condemned the forest industry in Tasmania to. But of course they are not prepared to admit it; probably they do not even understand that that is what they did. They keep on trotting around saying that they left a sustainable industry behind. But all you had to do was look at the wood supply figures to know that there was not a sustainable industry left at the scale it is currently at in Tasmania. I would like to make a particular mention of the Ta Ann project. The coalition has delivered for Ta Ann without the disaster of the Tasmanian Forests Agreement. So much for Senator Urquhart's comment that if the TFA goes away so does Ta Ann. They are still there, Senator—and they are expanding, and there is no Tasmanian Forests Agreement; it is being unwound. So the scare tactics of the Labor Party are just not demonstrated.


We are disappointed that the World Heritage Commission did not accept our nomination to remove 74,000 hectares from the wilderness estate that was dishonestly put in through the disastrous TFA process in 2013 by then minister Tony Burke, that was done without consultation, that was done without the opportunity for all Tasmanians to make a contribution, that was done despite then minister Tony Burke saying to our legislative council in Tasmania, 'I don't think I'm going to go ahead with the nomination and then walking out the door and announcing that there would be a nomination. You cannot believe a word this guy says.


It was a disastrous process that left large sections of the community disenfranchised. There are hundreds and hundreds of property owners who now have World Heritage wilderness areas as boundaries, with no understanding that that has come their way, with no consultation, and who now have new planning requirements over their properties that they did not know they had before—hundreds and hundreds and hundreds. The so-called experts who appeared before the Senate inquiry said that there were perhaps one or two. Well, they did not know, or they were not telling the truth. And the so-called experts who appeared before the Senate inquiry said, 'You can discount logging before 1960, because it is not industrial.' That was a lie. You only have to go into the forests of the Styx and the Florentine, which historian Peter MacFie clearly showed in the last fortnight are in fact 60- and 70-year-old regrowth forests, which the Greens and the Labor Party portrayed to the Australian community as old-growth forest. The dishonesty from the Labor Party and the Greens on this issue continues.


As I have said, the coalition—the government—will respect the decision of the World Heritage Commission. We will consider the decision of the World Heritage Commission. But we will do one thing. We will continue to stand up for the forest industry and forest workers in Tasmania. The really sad fact is that the light on the hill for the Labor Party now has a very nasty green tinge to it. It is not the traditional light on the hill for workers. The Labor Party have sold out the forest industry and its workers in Tasmania, and that is why they suffered so badly at the Tasmanian election. That is why they are down to seven members in the House. That is why the Greens lost 40 per cent of their representation and party status in the Tasmanian parliament. We will continue to stand up for the timber industry in Tasmania— (Time expired)

"Brown, Sen Carol",ALP,2014-06-24,"



Senator CAROL BROWN
 (Tasmania) (15:36):  I rise to also make a contribution, in this taking-note debate, on responses by Senator Abetz to Senator Thorp. In the contributions this afternoon we have already heard that the United Nations World Heritage Committee took just seven minutes to reject the Abbott government's application to remove 74,000 hectares—




Senator Conroy:
  How long?




Senator CAROL BROWN:
  Seven minutes, Senator Conroy. It took just seven minutes to reject the Abbott government's application to remove 74,000 hectares of the Tasmanian wilderness forest from the World Heritage List.


Yet again, those opposite have been exposed for their anti-environment agenda. In the last few seconds of Senator Colbeck's contribution he really did expose the Abbott government's agenda. It is a political agenda. It is about dividing the Tasmanian community. It is about causing conflict in Tasmania. It is not about industry. It is not about the environment. It is about their own political agenda, at anyone's expense and, particularly, at the expense of Tasmania.


We had a rejection of the Abbott government's application in just seven minutes. It is just another example of the embarrassment that this government agenda has caused Australia on the world stage. World leaders have condemned Mr Abbott's climate inaction. The World Heritage Committee has asked him to reconsider handing over environmental protection powers to the states. Here in this place we have twice rejected attempts to abolish the Clean Energy Finance Corporation.


The government's proposal to reverse protection of this section of the Tasmanian wilderness forest should never have gone to the World Heritage Committee in the first place. The report of the Senate Environment and Communications References Committee inquiry into the Tasmanian wilderness World Heritage area, which was ably chaired by my Tasmanian colleague Senator Lin Thorp, to quote from recommendation No. 1, said:


The committee recommends that the Government's proposal to the World Heritage Committee to remove 74,000 hectares from the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area be withdrawn.


Unfortunately, the Abbott government did not agree with this recommendation, but the World Heritage Committee obviously did. It took seven minutes to chuck out this government's application. That is exactly what it deserved. It deserved that action because it was feeble. It was a feeble application, just like the feeble attempt that Senator Abetz made to answer a very good question by Senator Thorp. Senator Abetz's responses were feeble and the government's application to the World Heritage committee was feeble.


We also heard in Senator Abetz's response today about the area being degraded. The World Heritage Committee and the Senate committee considered the Abbott government's argument that degraded areas, such as previously logged forests and plantations, should be removed from the extended Tasmanian wilderness World Heritage area. The evidence received by the Senate committee was clear. Unlike what Senator Abetz and Senator Colbeck would have you believe, only a small portion of the 74,000 hectares could actually be described as degraded. We heard from experts. Experts and stakeholders alike agree—unlike Senator Abetz's description in here today of extensive road networks, abandoned quarries and other degraded areas—that the degraded areas comprise less than 10 per cent of the area proposed. In those areas where there has previously been logging activities, there are clear signs the forest is recovering. (Time expired)

The speech read as follows—





ABORIGINAL AND TORRES STRAIT ISLANDER AMENDMENT (A STRONGER LAND ACCOUNT) BILL 2014



I am pleased to introduce this Bill to strengthen the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Account. Land is central to the spiritual, economic, social, cultural and environmental wellbeing of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples.


The Land Account and the Indigenous Land Corporation (ILC) were part of the ‘grand bargain’ that followed the High Court’s recognition of native title in the Mabo judgment in 1992. This was a watershed moment in the history of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples’ struggle towards recognition in this nation.


In 1993, after intense negotiations, the Keating Government legislated the Native Title Act – the first part of this bargain. This provided a process for claiming native title. It was an historic moment for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples.


At the time, then Prime Minister Paul Keating noted that despite its historic significance, the Mabo decision would “give little more than a sense of justice to those Aboriginal communities whose native title has been extinguished or lost ... their dispossession being total, their loss complete. While these communities remain dispossessed of land, their economic marginalisation and their sense of injury continue.”


So the Land Account was established to provide recognition and partial compensation for the fact that most Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples were unlikely to benefit from the Native Title Act. For those Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, the Land Account provided them with an opportunity to be—at least in part—compensated for what had been taken from them. 


The ILC was set up with the Land Account for one purpose: ‘to enable Indigenous people to acquire land and maintain it in a sustainable way to provide economic, social and cultural benefits for themselves and for future generations of their people’. But it wasn’t just Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples who were to benefit from this bargain. Through these negotiations, Aboriginal people gave up significant rights in order to give non-Indigenous Australians certainty over their land title, and the Land Account recognised this fact.


The deal that was brokered after Mabo must go on being respected and the Land Account must be protected.


This Bill makes it clear that it is the Commonwealth’s responsibility to manage the Land Account for the sole benefit of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. It reinforces the nature and purpose of the Land Account as being partial acknowledgement for the dispossession of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders’ lands. It gives Aboriginal people and Torres Strait Islanders an assurance that the Land Account will be protected for the benefit of future generations. 


The Bill prevents Land Account funds from being utilised for any purpose other than the original intended purpose of acquiring and managing land for the environmental, social, cultural and economic benefit of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. The Bill also includes provisions to enable the Land Account to grow over time, to ensure that future generations of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples can continue to benefit from the opportunities it provides to strengthen their links to the land.


The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Amendment (A Stronger Land Account) Bill 2014 emphasises the importance to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples of having an independent and Indigenous controlled ILC Board to manage the way Land Account funds are used. It strengthens appointment processes to ensure Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples have input into who runs the ILC and makes decisions about the way Land Account funds are used on their behalf. It strengthens the provisions that are currently in the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Act which prevent the Minister from directing the ILC and reinforces the ILC’s independence. The Bill also implements very strong corporate governance and transparency measures to give Australians, and especially Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, the confidence that the ILC and Land Account funds are being managed in accordance with the highest standards.


The Minister for Indigenous Affairs has indicated he is considering a ‘major overhaul’ of both the ILC and Indigenous Business Australia. It is unclear why Government would consider significant change that has the potential to weaken the ILC and put the Land Account at risk. 


On 2 December 2013, the Minister for Indigenous Affairs initiated a review of the ILC and Indigenous Business Australia by Ernst & Young. The terms of reference asked the reviewers to consider an amalgamation of the two agencies, under greater ministerial control. The Minister publicly released the report on 4 May 2014. While this report recommended that the ILC and IBA remain separate organisations, the Government’s Commission of Audit report released on 3 May 2014 recommended a merger of the two agencies. The Government has not yet indicated if it will be acting on the recommendations of either report. 


Any new arrangement proposed for the ILC comes with a risk that funds from the Land Account will be diverted to non-land commercial purposes. The beneficial owners of the Land Account are Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. The intention of the first legislation setting up the Land Account and the ILC was that the government of the day would always ensure Land Account funds were used for their original purpose: to provide land acquisition and management assistance to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples across Australia.


Rather than weakening Indigenous rights, there is a need to strengthen legislative recognition of the unique status of the Land Account, to prohibit ministerial or departmental involvement in re-allocating funds derived from the Land Account and to increase Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples’ involvement in land management.


This Prime Minister needs to demonstrate that his rhetoric before taking office that he would “place Aboriginal people at the heart” of his new Government, in “word and deed”, is not just that – rhetoric. 


As we move towards another watershed moment in the history of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples’ struggle for recognition in this nation – the recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in the Constitution – we must ensure that we build on what has already been achieved.


That is what this Bill does.


I commend this Bill to the Senate.

Senator STEPHENS
 (New South Wales) (16:03):  by leave—I table and present the report of the Australian parliamentary delegation to Vanuatu and New Zealand by the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee, which took place from 30 April to 9 May 2014. I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the report.


Leave granted. 




Senator STEPHENS:
  I move:


That the Senate take note of the document.


This report outlines the activities, observations and conclusions arising from the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee exchange visit to Vanuatu and New Zealand between 30 April and 9 May 2014. I was honoured to lead the delegation. The other delegation members were Senator David Fawcett from South Australia, Senator Helen Kroger from Victoria and Senator Anne McEwen from South Australia. We were accompanied by Mr David Sullivan as the delegation secretary.


The Australian and New Zealand national parliaments have, for a number of years, operated an annual parliamentary committee exchange program. The purpose is to enable Australian and New Zealand parliamentarians working on committees to explore issues of common interest that are the subject of consideration by their committees. 


Each year, one New Zealand parliamentary committee visits Australia and one Australian parliamentary committee visits New Zealand. As the Australian parliament has Senate, House of Representatives and joint committees, with joint committees comprising both senators and members, the Australian parliament conducts the exchange program on a rotational basis over a three-year cycle, with a Senate committee selected one year, a House committee the second year and a joint committee in the third year. 


Each visit is focused on the particular subject field of the committee selected for the visit. Meetings, roundtables and inspections are arranged that allow the committee members to exchange views and information with their parliamentary counterparts, as well as with public servants, senior private enterprise personnel, academics and experts working in the subject field of the committee. 


For Australia, each year the Presiding Officers call for nominations from committees to participate in the program, with committees required to outline the reasons they wish to be considered in that particular year. The Presiding Officers select the committee they consider has put forward the most compelling reasons for undertaking the visit. 


In 2014, the committee visit to New Zealand was adjusted to include a visit to one other Pacific region country. Another annual committee visit, the parliamentary committee visit to the Asia-Pacific, was adjusted at the same time to simply become a parliamentary committee visit to Asia. Of course it was the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee which put forward an excellent proposal and was therefore selected by the Presiding Officers to participate in that 2014 committee exchange program. The committee nominated Vanuatu as the Pacific country of its choice.


The committee's visit to Vanuatu and New Zealand was timely in the light of its inquiry into Australia's overseas development assistance program, the report of which was tabled here in March 2014. The inquiry's terms of reference focused on the broad policy settings for the delivery of Australia's overseas aid, including its international development priorities and the integration of AusAID into the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and including the freeze in international development assistance funding.


A number of aspects of the inquiry's report are relevant to the committee's visit to Vanuatu and New Zealand. For example, the report noted that more than 80 per cent of Australia's ODA is directed to its nearest neighbours in the Asia-Pacific region. Indonesia and Papua New Guinea are the two largest beneficiaries of Australia's support. It noted, too, that the allocation of development priorities in the Australian aid program for 2013-14 was education, 22 per cent; economic development, 20 per cent; health, 19 per cent; humanitarian, 16 per cent; governance, 16 per cent; and general development support, seven per cent.


Australian aid should be allocated to the most effective mechanism for delivery, including non-government organisations, private-sector contractors, bilateral agreements and multilateral organisations. Finally, the report found that, while integrating AusAID into DFAT has created opportunities to improve Australia's aid program, there are also risks associated with the merger, including that DFAT may lose key personnel, skills, procedures and specialist staff needed to effectively administer Australia's aid program.


However, the main objective of the visit was for the committee to investigate three key issues within the committee's portfolio responsibility: defence partnerships, tourism and overseas aid. The committee was particularly interested in exploring the priorities, effectiveness and delivery of Australian aid to Vanuatu, as well as Australia's contribution to Vanuatu's tourism sector and infrastructure projects. The committee also explored the reforms to New Zealand's aid program that paralleled recent developments in Australia, including the reintegration of aid into the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, in 2009; New Zealand's tourism sector and its contribution to the national economy, focusing on Queenstown as a national and international tourism hot spot; and the reconstruction of Christchurch following the devastating 2010 and 2011 earthquakes, including the city's economy and tourism prospects. Finally, the committee also explored Australia's defence and security cooperation with Vanuatu and New Zealand, and the current and emerging security environment in the Asia-Pacific region.


Many people assisted the committee's visit to Vanuatu and New Zealand. The committee expresses its appreciation to all those involved in making the visit a success. In particular, the committee would really like to thank the International and Community Relations Office, which facilitated the committee's travelling arrangements and development of the program for the official visits; the officers from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Department of Defence who briefed the committee before and after the official visit; the officers from the Australian high commission in Vanuatu and New Zealand who met with the committee; and particularly Ms Tanya Parkin, the deputy high commissioner at the Australian high commission in Vanuatu, the staff at the Australian high commission, and Mr Remo Moretta, the deputy high commissioner at the Australian high commission in New Zealand; Ms Liz Kitto, of the Department of Internal Affairs of New Zealand; Mr Darryl Stevens, of the Office of the Clerk of the House of Representatives of New Zealand, for facilitating all aspects of the New Zealand program. The committee also records its appreciation to everyone who took the time to discuss their work and for the hospitality and courtesy extended to the committee during its visit to Vanuatu and New Zealand. The committee would particularly like to thank the Hon. Philip Boedoro, Speaker of the parliament of Vanuatu; the Hon. Moana Carcasses Kalosil, the former Prime Minister of Vanuatu and now leader of the opposition; and the Hon. David Carter, Speaker of the House of Representatives in the parliament of New Zealand.


The report is well worth reading. I mention two brief chapters, one of which provides an introduction to Vanuatu and outlines the key issues that were canvassed by the committee during its two-day program there, and the other that goes to issues in New Zealand, following an outline of the key issues canvassed by the committee during its five-day program.


In conclusion can I say that what really impressed the committee most on our trip to New Zealand was the extraordinary resilience in the recovery efforts that have been going on in Christchurch around the earthquake recovery. We had only great feedback from New Zealand officials about the contribution of Australia in all facets of the recovery, from the immediate disaster relief response, to continuing support with skilled personnel and advisers. It was an amazing challenge for New Zealand. The committee was overwhelmed by what they are facing. We are good friends with New Zealand. Our relationship is very close. Australia's response to the disaster they experienced is deeply appreciated and has gone a long way to strengthening the relationship between our two countries.

"McEwen, Sen Anne",ALP,2014-06-24,"



Senator McEWEN
 (South Australia—Opposition Whip in the Senate) (16:12):  I, too, would like to make some comments about this report of the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee's recent delegation to Vanuatu and New Zealand. Before I get to the details of that delegation, of which I was privileged to be part, I would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge the departing members of the Senate foreign affairs, defence and trade committees, in particular Senator Stephens, who was and still is the Chair of the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee; Senator Alan Eggleston, who is the Chair of the Senator Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee; and Senator Helen Kroger, who, like me, is a member of those committees. I also acknowledge Senator Mark Bishop, who was a long-term member of the foreign affairs, defence and trade committees of this parliament and who is also retiring.


It is one of the most interesting committees of the federal parliament. In my few years on that committee I have been involved, as have those retiring senators, in numerous inquiries into aspects of Australia's foreign affairs and defence portfolios. Some of those areas of investigation have included monitoring Australia's engagement in Iraq—a topical issue right at this moment—and also our engagement in Afghanistan and the withdrawal of our troops from that country.


We have been involved, as well, in numerous inquiries into allegations and findings of sexual and other abuse in Australia's Defence forces. There were some harrowing inquiries and evidence there that the parliament has had to deal with. The flow-on effects from those inquiries have seen substantial changes to the way Defence handles the issues that arise not just from ADFA but from deployments overseas and activities on naval ships et cetera. It has been one of the more interesting things for the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee to be part of that change of culture, if you like, within the Defence forces.


The committee has also been engaged in military justice and the implementation of military justice. That is a very significant inquiry that was undertaken with significant outcomes. That committee deals with the Defence Materiel Organisation, which is an organisation that plans, budgets for and schedules replacement or refurbishment of Australia's Defence estate and capabilities. Again, it is a committee that has to grapple with significant issues, as that is one of the biggest budget spends in the Australian government budget every year. The committee pays careful attention to where Australian governments, of all persuasions, are spending money in the area of Defence materiel.


The committee has dealt a lot with recruitment in the Defence forces. Over a number of years, they have worked with the ADF to ensure that there is some focus on the recruitment of women into the Australian Defence Force. A number of senators on the committee have paid particular attention to that. This committee also deals with the Australian War Memorial, an iconic institution much loved by most Australians. At every Senate estimates, we are always pleased to hear about the plans for that institution from whoever the director of the War Memorial is at the time.


The committee deals with the Foreign Affairs portfolio of the federal parliament. One of the more current issues that has been dealt with in the Foreign Affairs portfolio is the rolling of what was AusAID into the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. A significant difference to the way that overseas development aid is rolled out in Australia is being monitored and considered by that committee. Overseas development aid is very topical at the moment with the Minister for Foreign Affairs' recent statement on the delivery of overseas development aid. What would be an appropriate funding allocation for the overseas development aid budget is something that we probably disagree about a fair bit on the committee. Overall, I would have to say there is a commitment on that committee to continue our overseas development aid and, in particular, to ensure that overseas development aid in our nearby regions goes to support women in developing countries.


Those are just some of the many things that the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee has dealt with. I would like to commend Senators Kroger, Eggleston, Stephens and Bishop for their extraordinary work. It is a very hardworking committee with a lot of responsibilities. I have been privileged to work with all of those retiring senators on those issues that I have just outlined. In terms of the most recent delegation that I was privileged to be on with Senators Kroger, Fawcett and Stephens, it was and always is inspiring to go to the Pacific Islands and the Pacific nations in our region, like Vanuatu, to see the very real benefits of Australia's overseas development aid being rolled out on the ground.


The delegation was given many opportunities to see the value of Australia's overseas development aid. We had a look at numerous projects. One that sticks in my mind is the midwifery course at Port Vila in Vanuatu, where both women and men were being trained in midwifery by Australian doctors so that they could go out—not just into Port Vila but also into regional areas—and assist women to give birth safely. We understand and appreciate the importance of their work. It was great to see the Australian and New Zealand doctors and nurses there in Vanuatu training men and women to become effective midwives.


We were also privileged to visit a training facility that is similar to one of our TAFEs, where there was VET training for people in Vanuatu to work, in particular, in the tourism industry. They learned important skills like how to manage a small business and how to take advantage of the few advantages that there are in Vanuatu. That includes the massive cruise industry, which Australians make great use of. It is really important that the value-add from the cruise industry goes to the people of Vanuatu and not necessarily just to the big cruise liner ships. Again, it is great to see Australian initiatives there, which are assisting the people of Vanuatu to make the most of whatever opportunities come their way.


In New Zealand, we were very privileged to meet with the Ministry of Defence there, as well as the Minister of Defence. I appreciated his frank discussions about issues within their defence force about recruitment and, in particular, the recruitment of women into the defence force. I appreciated his frank comments about the difficulties they have had recruiting women but the important steps that they have taken to ensure that their defence force is a welcoming place for women who see that as a potential career.


As always with New Zealand, there is a lot that we can learn because of our shared histories, let alone our shared tourism opportunities. The people of New Zealand were very welcoming of us. Like Senator Stephens, I too acknowledge the incredible efforts of New Zealanders and, indeed, Australians who went to work in New Zealand on the reconstruction of Christchurch. The devastation of Christchurch from the earthquakes has been phenomenal, but even more phenomenal have been the reconstruction efforts and the way in which that has been coordinated. It was a great lesson for those of us from Australia to learn about disaster response activities and how we can do better in that space. Again, I would like to thank my departing colleagues for the opportunity to work with them on the Senate Foreign, Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee.

Senator MOORE
 (Queensland) (16:22):  Madam Acting Deputy President Stephens, I want to take this opportunity to acknowledge your longstanding work on the Senate Foreign, Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee. This afternoon, Senator Stephens, you have earned: you have made a speech, you are now in the chair and you are about to make a final contribution. It is a good chance to say that.


I also want to take this opportunity to make a short statement about the value of the parliamentary delegation program, which celebrates the work of committees in this place and which reinforces the valuable work that parliamentarians do in a committee focus. This program goes out to the committees of the Senate and encourages them to bid for the opportunity to visit other countries and to work with other parliamentarians to develop their skills. Over the years, this has provided amazing value to so many committees in this place. I acknowledge the work that we have heard about this afternoon by the foreign affairs, defence and trade committees. They beat out a very strong bid from the community affairs committee.


In terms of this process, several years ago, as a community affairs committee, we were able to benefit from going to New Zealand and looking at the issues around mental health. The work which we have heard about this afternoon from both you, Senator Stephens, and Senator McEwen looked at what you were able to do as members of the committee, working with parliamentarians in both New Zealand and Vanuatu, through this process. Again, this was reinforcing the sharing of skills and experience and, most particularly, reinforcing the role of committees—parliamentarians across parties looking at issues of value, not just to the Senate but to the wider community. So I felt this was a fine opportunity to say that. 


We will hear much more over the years about the way this program operates. I think it is something that must be retained. We learn so much from it. I look forward to other strongly competitive bids amongst the committees of the Senate to ensure that this knowledge is effectively used and that the kinds of issues we have heard about are taken outside parliamentary debate into aspects of learning and working together. 


Question agreed to.

"Williams, Sen John",Nats,2014-06-24,"



Senator WILLIAMS
 (New South Wales) (18:50):  I rise to speak about a good friend who passed away recently. His name is Khun Kanit Wanachote, a Thai bloke. He was born on 15 February 1928 in Surat Thani Province, Thailand. 


Khun Kanit's association with Sir Edward 'Weary' Dunlop commenced when ex-POWs and Thai-Burma Railway survivors Keith Flanagan OAM and Bill Haskell OAM decided in 1985 to organise the Weary Dunlop Tour, a tour retracing the course of surgeon and force commander, Colonel—later Sir—Edward Dunlop and his force from Java through to Thailand in World War II, and having his exploits recognised.


A chance meeting occurred between Weary Dunlop and Khun Kanit when the touring party of Aussies met Khun Kanit whilst traveling up the Khwae Noi River, commonly known to all of us as the River Kwai, hoping to locate the Kennyu and Hintok river camps—old prisoner of war camps from the Second World War and the infamous Thai-Burma railway project—which were in the region of Hellfire Pass.


Khun Kanit was developing his Home Phutoey River Kwai Resort down river from the camps. With the proximity of Hellfire Pass to his development, Khun Kanit had constantly thought of there being some association between the Thai-Burma Railway and his project, and here were a group of Australian ex-POWs who had actually been in the area, including the revered Weary Dunlop, who was already well known. Weary Dunlop and Khun Kanit struck a chord which was the genesis of an enduring association. Khun Kanit dedicated a large section of his resort to a Weary Dunlop park, which includes the Weary Dunlop pavilion. He was nominated for an OAM as he had served the Australian community through his contribution to the preservation of Australian-Thailand history. He assisted significantly in preserving the memory of the sacrifices of Australian military personnel. Khun Kanit was awarded the OAM in 2010.


These days, Quiet Lion Tours travel to Thailand, and Khun Kanit's Home Phu Toey Resort is a central focus at Anzac cup. Some of Weary Dunlop's ashes were spread in Hellfire Pass, and the balance were floated down the Khwae Noi after being blessed by some of Weary's Buddhist medical colleagues. The dominant feature of Home Phu Toey resort is the peace park, and Weary's statue has pride of place. Perched on rails on a ledge on the side of the hill and floodlit, an old locomotive and wagon overlook the scene. There is also a replica of a prisoner of war camp. The Weary Dunlop Museum, dedicated by Khun Kanit to his friend Weary, overlooks the park guarded by a huge carved wooden statue of Weary Dunlop. Sir Edward's son and other relatives formally opened the Dunlop museum on 24 April 1997.


It is not only the history of the Thai-Burma Railway that can be taught to Australian youth by the generosity of Khun Kanit. Ex-POWs are able to revisit areas where they were imprisoned, and the relatives of deceased POWs can visit graves and participate in ceremonies. All Australians should attempt to attend a dawn service at Hellfire Pass, which I have done several times, and a wreath-laying ceremony at Kanchanaburi. All this is possible because of the foresight and friendship of Sir Weary Dunlop and Khun Kanit. 


Our dear friend passed away in Bangkok on 1 April this year, and next month a series of funeral functions will be held in Thailand, concluding with a Loy Unkarn ceremony where his ashes will be floated down the River Kwai from Home Phu Toey. 


I would like to thank Eric Wilson from Western Australia, who every year takes groups of students across to Thailand and to the Thai-Burma Railway for Anzac Day in order to educate the young about how these prisoners of war suffered so much. I also know that former prisoners of war that I have met, such as Neil Macpherson and Snow Fairclough, have fond memories of Khun Kanit and of what he did for the preservation of the war history of so many who suffered so much—not only Australians, but British, Dutch and others—on the Thai-Burma Railway. I am sorry I cannot be in Thailand around 20 and 21 July, but I know Eric Wilson will represent Australia well as they float the ashes of Khun Kanit down the River Kwai and thank a great man. 


In conclusion, I think it is quite amazing that someone in Thailand received an OAM from Australia. That clearly shows his contribution and his dedication to those Aussie prisoners of war and to preserving their history.
