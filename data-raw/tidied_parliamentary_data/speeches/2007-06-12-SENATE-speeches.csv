"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2007-06-12,"—by leave—I want to speak briefly to the part of the motion asking that the bills be taken together, and I believe I can. I make the point that the Democrats had requested that these bills not be taken together, that they be dealt with separately. They both deal with substantial and significant taxation matters. Certainly we do not wish to delay passage of them, but, given that they deal with substantial and significant matters each in their own right, we believe they each merit individual examination through the second reading stage. I want to record that as our preference. I am not going to go on at length about it, but I think it is preferable that convention applies: that, if a senator does not want them to be taken together, it not happen unless there are compelling circumstances. I do not think any exist in this case. I simply want to put that on the record. Senator Murray will nonetheless speak to them both in as much detail as he can, but we would prefer it if they were separated.
Question agreed to.
Bills read a first time.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (PERSONAL INCOME TAX REDUCTION) BILL 2007</title>,<title>First Reading</title>,Bills,4,1,speech
"Stephens, Sen Ursula",ALP,2007-06-12,"—This bill is the next legislative stage in the government’s 2006 reforms to the child support system. The Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs Legislation Amendment (Child Support Reform Consolidation and Other Measures) Bill 2007 contains a significant number of technical and consequential amendments following from the original two pieces of child support reform legislation considered by the parliament last year. Labor supported these previous child support reform bills in the parliament after expressing our reservations that the government had failed to provide protection for low-income families, who may lose income as a result of the changes to the scheme. Again, we support this legislation, but Labor remain concerned about the protections for low-income families that have to date still not been adequately resolved. This bill also incorporates relevant amendments relocated from the Child Support Legislation Amendment Bill 2004, which Labor was intending to support. We note that the government has now withdrawn that bill from the House Notice Paper.

This amendment bill includes a range of non-child-support changes to various pensions and family payments, including the payment of the baby bonus in instalments for under-18-year-old mothers, and the extension of the pension assets test from 12 to 24 months following the sale of the principal home. Labor welcomes both of these initiatives—not only are they good policy; they were in fact our suggestions in the first place. If this government has completely run out of fresh ideas, Labor will continue to provide them.
The Child Support Scheme was set up in 1988 by the Hawke Labor government and has become an international model and the basis of a similar scheme established in the United Kingdom. Labor acknowledges the genuine concerns about the scheme, including concerns about the fairness of the scheme, the assessment formula and, in particular, compliance. Let me reiterate that Labor acknowledge the need for reform of our child support system. The view we take on the reform challenge, however, is that fundamentally the interests and wellbeing of children must come first and that as far as possible child support policies should serve to support the child in security and in economically acceptable conditions.
The May 2005 report of the Ministerial Taskforce on Child Support, the Parkinson report, was the first systematic evaluation of the child support arrangements. It recommended a new formula for child support assessment based on evidence of the actual costs of raising children, shared parental responsibility for those costs and recognition of each parent’s level of care. The report examined the scheme using sound principles and was generally well received. Labor believes that the report provides a constructive basis for moving forward on child support reform.
Last year this parliament passed two bills which implemented the new Child Support Scheme, including a new payment formula. Whilst not all the recommendations of the Parkinson report were adopted and the new scheme was not entirely to Labor’s satisfaction, we supported those bills. Today’s bill makes further amendments to the new Child Support Scheme.
At last week’s Senate inquiry into this bill the Department of Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, the agency responsible for child support policy, gave evidence that the implementation of the new regime is not progressing as smoothly as expected. The promised stakeholder reference group, for example, has only met once this year. There is also still a lack of detailed information on the impact of the new formula and the new arrangements on families. Ms Jacqueline Taylor from the National Council of Single Mothers and their Children said at the Senate inquiry:
... calculating the financial impact on single mother families post July next year has actually been an incredibly difficult thing to do because there is nothing available to help us with that. There has been no modelling done by the government to actually calculate the impact that these changes will have on sole parent families and we cannot forget that this is also in conjunction with Welfare to Work and the loss of income from that.
The government needs to do more research on the impact of these changes.
Labor believe that there is a responsibility on the government to ensure that the wellbeing of children is not compromised by the combined impact of these policy changes. Labor acknowledge the concerns of many resident parents that they will receive lower child support payments under the new formula. We also note that Professor Parkinson, chair of the ministerial task force, does not disagree that a significant proportion of single parents will receive lower payments as a result of the bill. Last year he gave evidence to a Senate inquiry that around 55 per cent of assessments will decrease under the new formula. At the request of the ministerial task force, NATSEM modelled some of the impact of the new formula. That modelling showed that resident parents on low annual incomes of $26,000 a year or under will incur the biggest reductions in child support payments. For example, where a non-resident parent earns $78,000, a resident parent with an income of $26,000 will be $50 a week worse off. That is a lot of money for a parent earning just $26,000 a year.
More account also needs to be taken of the interaction of the new system with the recent Welfare to Work changes. On the one hand, we have family law and child support law encouraging shared parenting and an acknowledgement that, where there is between 35 per cent and 65 per cent of care, it is considered shared. On the other hand, we have income support policies under the government’s Welfare to Work changes where only one parent can be given principal carer status and we have the important concessions in terms of activity requirements, which can leave the other parent and the children exceptionally vulnerable. Labor is closely monitoring the impact of the intersection of the Welfare to Work laws, the importance of principal carer status and the promotion of shared care under family law to ensure that parents with largely shared caring responsibility are not disadvantaged.
I now turn to some of the other provisions in the bill. First of all, the bill makes some technical changes to the process of administrative and judicial review of decisions in child support cases by the Social Security Appeals Tribunal or by the courts. The Law Council, in its submission to the Senate inquiry into the bill, expressed concerns at the proposed new clause 64 of schedule 1. This provision gives the Social Security Appeals Tribunal the power to make a determination on which documents are relevant to a review of its decision by the court conducting that review. The Law Council is concerned at the appropriateness of this amendment and it believes that it is preferable that the court be entitled to review all documents to determine which are relevant in a decision on the matter before it.
In relation to issues in parenting procedures, the bill contains amendments to clarify situations where a court makes orders for the repayment of child support where payments have been made by a person who is not the parent of the child. Under these provisions a mere suspicion on the part of either parent that the payer is not the parent of the child is a factor that is relevant for the court to consider when making an order on a possible repayment, even when this suspicion or knowledge falls short of a reasonable doubt about parentage.
Schedule 5 deals with changes to the maintenance income test provisions in the A New Tax System (Family Assistance) Act 1999. These amendments will clarify the definitions of ‘amount received’ and ‘amount payable’ in the child support formula. They will also clarify that maintenance income received by a payee for one or more children will reduce the payee’s amount of family tax benefit part A above the base rate, for those children only.
In relation to ongoing collections from contractors, currently, ongoing child support can only be collected from employers if the payer is a wage or salary earner or they receive a Centrelink payment. This amendment will broaden the agency’s power to issue notices requiring the deduction of child support and the forwarding of that deduction to the Child Support Agency to include cases where the payer is under contract for service arrangements that effectively substitute for wages. This change extends the reach of the ongoing collections system to independent contractors, who are effectively employees. Labor supports this change.
Other aspects of the family payment system are also amended by this bill. One significant change is to require the baby bonus to be paid in 13 instalments to parents who are under the age of 18. There is an unfortunate tendency for some to portray young mums in a negative fashion. We certainly do not support this form of reporting. However, there have been noted among some welfare groups and social workers disturbing occurrences of young mothers being abused and exploited over their baby bonus payments. Young women are in a position of special vulnerability when it comes to these issues. Some domestic violence services report that levels of abuse rise sharply around the time the bonus is paid. Women will hand over the money just to get rid of a violent partner. There are far too many stories of young mothers being exploited for the baby bonus money. Government has a responsibility to ensure that its efforts to help families at a critical time are not misused by desperate or selfish people who have kids they neither want nor care for. On this basis, Labor supports the government’s change to fortnightly payments for young mothers.
Labor also supports the common sense change for the maternity payment to be officially known by its commonplace name—the ‘baby bonus’. All family payments will now be conditional upon the registration of the birth. In their submission to the Senate inquiry, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said that the registration requirement would improve the accuracy of Australia’s demographic statistical collections. In oral evidence, the ABS noted that:
Births to mothers in their 30s are more likely to be registered promptly whereas births to younger mothers aged under 24 years were likely to be registered later. It is expected that the proposed requirement to have all births registered before applying for the baby bonus may result in a change in parents’ behaviour.
Labor hopes that the behavioural change will be positive. Given the tendency for late registration amongst those from disadvantaged backgrounds—especially those in the Indigenous community and single mothers—this new requirement must be implemented in such a way that those with particular vulnerabilities are not disadvantaged and do not miss out on any payments that they especially would benefit from.
The other Labor proposal the government is adopting in this bill is an amendment to the Social Security Act and the Veterans’ Entitlements Act to extend the pension assets test exemption period from 12 months to 24 months following the sale of the principal home. Labor proposed an amendment to the Social Security Act in 2006 along similar lines to support pensioners who were unable to have their new home built during the 12-month period due to delays caused by the skills shortage. The 12-month rule was particularly affecting pensioners who were trying to build a new home and being delayed by this government’s skills crisis. Under the current arrangements, a person has 12 months to sell their existing home and construct a new home before the proceeds of the sale of the existing home become an assessable asset. Because of the huge skills shortage, and therefore the delays in building completion dates, a number of pensioners have been unable to get their homes completed within that 12-month time frame. Stories of waiting for trades people to turn up are well known. Labor was concerned about the impact on pensioners of delays that were forcing them to be caught up by the assets test. It now appears that the government is concerned too.
Labor also supports the changes to allow family tax benefits to continue to be paid to members of the Australian Defence Force and members of the Australian Federal Police International Deployment Group who are deployed overseas. Normally, family tax benefit is only payable at the full rate to people who are temporarily overseas for up to 13 weeks. Discretion to extend that period exists where certain prescribed events prevent or delay their return. Presently, ADF and AFP personnel on overseas deployment are not covered adequately by this discretion. The bill makes amendments to rectify this deficiency. Labor supports this lengthy amendment bill; however, we still note our ongoing concerns with the impact of the new child support scheme on low income families.",SENATE,"<title>FAMILIES, COMMUNITY SERVICES AND INDIGENOUS AFFAIRS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (CHILD SUPPORT REFORM CONSOLIDATION AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2007</title>",<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,5,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2007-06-12,"—The Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs Legislation Amendment (Child Support Reform Consolidation and Other Measures) Bill 2007 is one in a series that have made significant changes to the child support arrangements in Australia. We all know that child support is a very contentious area and is often played out through conflict between parents who have split up. In such contexts it is always very important to remind ourselves of the key purpose of child support, which is, as its name implies, supporting children and what is in the interests of children. I believe we need to put that factor always front and centre whenever we consider this issue—and indeed many others, I might say. Certainly it is an unavoidable fact that family law arrangements and legislated child support requirements are often going to occur in an environment where the adults involved are not necessarily getting on terribly well and often have quite a negative relationship with each other—although I should also point out, of course, that that is far from universal. Many people do manage separations, with or without children involved, quite effectively and very well. But sometimes that does not happen, and in those circumstances it is important that, in amongst all of the difficulties, the interests of the children involved are put first and foremost.
Some of the changes in this legislation are positive ones and do clarify the operation of the whole scheme. But it does remain a concern for the Democrats that we are not sure of the full consequences. Indeed, the entire committee looking into this legislation made clear by its concluding remarks that it recognised that ‘the true impact of many of the changes will not be fully known until they are operating in practice’. I appreciate that, to some extent, you can never be 100 per cent sure of how things will play out, but, frankly, I think we could have done a better job and we should be doing a better job in at least having much clearer models of what is anticipated to occur in certain circumstances so that we are operating less in the dark in making these sorts of changes. That remains a continuing concern to the Democrats. Whilst we notice that the changes and their consequences will be monitored closely—and that is certainly welcome—we do believe that more should have been done to assess in advance what the consequences would be.
The issue about the impact on principal carers that is raised by Senator Siewert in her minority report is also a concern that I share regarding the income support definition. That, to me, seems to provide a circumstance where, as the National Council of Single Mothers and their Children stated, ‘the half-time children in the household of the person who is not deemed under social security law to be the principal carer will not attract the protections available to principal carers in the income support system’, which will leave them more likely to be disadvantaged.
The issue of the baby bonus is also contained within this legislation, although it is really a separate matter to child support changes. I must say that I am concerned about separating out and introducing a form of age based discrimination in this area. I think there are arguments for having payments made periodically in all cases, if we are going to move down that path, rather than singling out solely those who are under the age of 18, particularly given that there are no opportunities for flexibility about that. Frankly, I think that is a form of discrimination that is not warranted by the evidence that I have seen to date.
The legislation as a whole does have quite a number of different changes that are made within it. It should be noted that, in amongst all of those, really only a few parts were the subject of most of the focus and comment produced from the community during the committee inquiry process. However, the fact that those concerns only addressed a small number of issues should not therefore mean that those issues are seen as unimportant. I believe that they merit further concern and further acknowledgement than is being given by the federal government.
These changes will continue to be monitored as further changes are rolled out, and there will be further changes coming on line next year, so we are in a continual state of change. It is important that we continue to monitor that, because it is being done alongside other changes to our income support laws, some of which will also significantly disadvantage people who are already not particularly well off. We need to be watching very closely to see how they go. There is a lot of talk these days about how magnificent the economy supposedly is, and I agree that there are some good-looking numbers around the place and there are some good outcomes for individuals, but we must also acknowledge that there are many, many people who, however good you want to say the economy is, are not doing terribly well. There are significant numbers of Australians—including many, many children—who are in poverty, and significant numbers who are homeless.
The fact that the economy is going well and that unemployment is low is a good thing, but if we are not able to address wider economic factors, like the worst housing affordability crisis we have had in over a generation, then all the good economic figures in the world cannot hide the fact that it is still not delivering basic security for very many Australians. I would suggest that that is a key reason for this apparent bafflement amongst some of the coalition people like Mr Abbott and others, who cannot seem to understand why people might not all, automatically, be going to vote Liberal, when they think the economy is going so fabulously. The simple fact is that for many people the economy is not delivering security for them and for their children. Those people are often forgotten. They are rarely referred to in all of the talk about economic statistics, but they are very real. We need to remember that. And we need to remember, when we are looking at legislation like this, that we are not just talking about theories or abstract policies; we are talking about human beings. Many of those human beings, particularly single parents, are struggling enormously in Australia at the moment.

"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2007-06-12,"—My question is to Senator Minchin, the Minister representing the Prime Minister. Can the minister advise how much more advertising on industrial relations has now been authorised by the government? Can the minister indicate whether the Ministerial Council on Government Communications has met to authorise further expenditure and, if so, how many more taxpayer dollars this government is intending to spend on this advertising?

Senator Kemp interjecting—

Could you advise whether the $36.5 million will include yet another taxpayer funded ad blitz, to the tune of $25,000 an hour, which was seen in stage 1 of this campaign? Minister, why does the government display such contempt for Australian taxpayers? And isn’t this just another example of the Howard government treating taxpayers’ money as its own?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Advertising Campaigns</title>,Questions Without Notice,6,1,question
"Minchin, Sen Nick (Leader of the Government in the Senate)",LP,2007-06-12,"—Mr President, this issue of government advertising was, of course, exhaustively discussed at Senate estimates, but I am delighted to talk about it again. This government is a reformist government. We have much to communicate to the Australian people. There is a significant and well-established precedent from the former Labor government—and, indeed, state Labor governments, who have set new benchmarks in this area—for using advertising to communicate government policies and changes to government policies. Indeed, as a result of our changes to workplace relations, private health insurance and superannuation, we have taken advantage of the opportunity to properly inform Australians of those changes through factual government advertising.
In relation to the industrial relations campaign to which Senator Wong refers, for the campaign to date, in relation to changes that we are making to industrial relations arrangements, the media cost of advertising has been about $3.5 million for the week of 20 May 2007, plus other non-campaign advertising. I would add, in relation to the slur upon on the advertising that Senator Wong casts in suggesting that it is anything other than factual, that there was a very interesting report in the Age of 1 June quoting an actor, Alan Fletcher, whose voice was used in the voice-over in the government’s advertisements. He was quoted as saying:
The workplace relations ad appeared to me to be a non-political commercial that advertised changes to the law and how to get information about those changes.
The ad offered no endorsement of Government policy on workplace relations and, as such, did not conflict with my personal principles.
I note that this Mr Fletcher is the federal vice-president of the Media, Entertainment and Arts Alliance, as well as a professional actor.
The government has no embarrassment whatsoever in properly advertising its changes to workplace relations. Workplace relations does affect millions of Australians. These are important changes. It is important that Australians have the facts in relation to this advertising.

But I do think Senator Wong ought to take account of what her own Labor governments do around the country. I was surprised to see, in the Adelaide Advertiser of 9 June, this full page ad: ‘Building a healthy future for South Australia.’ What have we got here? The smiling face of Labor Premier Mike Rann, extolling the virtues of his Labor budget! Look at it! It is incredible—the hypocrisy of this lot in attacking us for our advertising when they have six state Labor governments absolutely blowing their budgets! They are now actually in deficit as a result of the extraordinary spending they conduct, much of which is on their own party advertising.

"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2007-06-12,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of answers given by ministers to questions without notice asked by Opposition senators today.
Today in question time we had yet further examples of the arrogance of this government. The arrogance of the Howard government was on full display in question time today. This is a government and a Prime Minister which treats taxpayers’ money as its own. We have seen that in recent months with the millions of dollars in taxpayer funded government advertising that this government is foisting upon the Australian people in its attempt to improve its electoral chances.
In question time today we saw Senator Minchin refuse to indicate whether the figure that has been quoted in public—of $36.5 million on the second wave of the government’s Work Choices advertising campaign—is correct or not. So we look forward to Senator Minchin coming clean with the Australian people as to how much of their money this government intends to spend on Work Choices mark 2. Bear in mind that this is a government that has already spent, or has budgeted to spend, over $1.8 billion—over the life of the government—by polling day. It has already spent, or has budgeted to spend by polling day, over $1.8 billion—and that is what we know about; that does not include what the government has not fessed up to yet, including the $36 million that is now out there in the public arena. It is interesting; Senator Minchin says he cannot confirm it, but somehow somebody has leaked it to the Australian already.
Probably one of the worst examples in recent times of the government’s complete lack of regard for public funds and taxpayers is the use of Kirribilli House for a Liberal fundraiser. The Prime Minister says this was not a Liberal Party fundraiser. The reality is it was, and the Australian people know it. These are the facts. Kirribilli House is a taxpayer funded official residence. It is not a Liberal Party function centre, but that is precisely what this Prime Minister and this government have been using it as. This is Prime Minister Howard acting like he owns the place, using Kirribilli House, a taxpayer funded official residence, for a fundraiser.
We have seen attempts in recent days by the Prime Minister to worm his way out of this embarrassing situation. First he hides behind saying that this was not a fundraiser; it just happened to be a function to which business observers—who have paid thousands of dollars to the Liberal Party of Australia—were invited. Part of what they get for their donation and attendance at the Liberal Party Federal Council is an invite to Kirribilli House for drinks with the Prime Minister. It is very simple: you pay money to the Liberal Party and in return, amongst other things, you get drinks at Kirribilli with the Prime Minister. The Australian people understand what a fundraiser looks like. This was a fundraiser.
What do we have today? Yet another variation on the theme—Senator Minchin trying to wriggle his way out of a difficult situation by saying that the government relied on the advice of Prime Minister and Cabinet that they could use Kirribilli provided the function was not of itself a fundraiser. This is what Prime Minister Howard thinks is public accountability in the late Howard era—as long as an event is not of itself a fundraiser, although it might be part of a fundraising package, it is quite legitimate to use a taxpayer funded official residence for it. The reality is that it is clear for all to see that Kirribilli House was used as part of a fundraising effort for the Liberal Party, and no amount of wriggling by this Prime Minister or his ministers is going to alter that.
In terms of the advice that Senator Minchin says was given by Prime Minister and Cabinet, not only does Senator Minchin rely on some legalistic definition; he also refuses to table the advice. So what we have from this government when confronted with the facts around a Liberal Party fundraiser is a reliance on advice that they refuse to make public and, frankly, a somewhat puerile attempt to demonstrate that this was not a fundraiser by saying, ‘Well, it wasn’t of itself a fundraiser.’ (Time expired)

"Ronaldson, Sen Michael",LP,2007-06-12,"—Talk about the pot calling the kettle black! We have heard it all today. Can I give you one example, Senator Wong. You might want to look at the Queensland papers from over the weekend—there was a full-page ad from Mr Beattie, not even authorised, that said, ‘Queensland government driving coal infrastructure’. What about Premier Rann over the weekend advertising his South Australian budget? What about the $354 million that the state Labor governments spent on advertising last year? What about the $160 million spent by the Bracks government alone in relation to advertising? What about the $90 million spent by the New South Wales government in the run-up to the last state election? What absolute, patent nonsense! How hypocritical of the Australian Labor Party to come into the Senate and talk about advertising. We have been waiting here listening intently and you have not said one word, Senator Wong, about the state Labor governments’ spending—not a single word. How duplicitous of you to come in here and plead a cheap political point. They have all of a sudden slipped from walking around with puffed out chests as an alternative government back to their old habits of being a useless opposition. Not one question today was relevant to the Australian people. There was not one policy discussion. Again, all we heard was cheap political point-scoring.

Senator Carol Brown interjecting—

—Let’s have a talk about this government’s advertising. Senator Carol Brown can yell and scream as much as she likes. She actually has to explain to the people of Tasmania why they cast 12,000 jobs out of Telstra. There has not been a word from the Australian Labor Party. Under Kim Beazley, as communications minister, 12,000 Telstra jobs were cut. Senator Brown, can I suggest you check your facts before you ask those stupid dorothy dixer questions at question time.
Let’s have a look at what we have spent on advertising. There was $118 million spent through the 2006-07 financial year on campaign advertising. There was the Telstra 3 campaign offer—we shouldn’t have used that? What about the Skills for the Future campaign to encourage people to take up apprenticeships? The Australian Labor Party is saying to the people of Australia and saying to this chamber that we cannot spend money to encourage young people to take up apprenticeships. That is what they are saying: ‘We don’t care about the future of this country’s young people and this government cannot spend money on apprenticeships.’ What about financial literacy? There was $11.6 million for the financial literacy campaign to teach people how to manage their money better. Senator Wong of all people, with her shadow portfolios, is saying that this government is not allowed to advise and assist people in how to best manage their money. Coming from the shadow minister, with the responsibilities that she has, I find that quite extraordinary.
What about the youth tobacco campaign? Are we not able to go out and try to convince young people about the dangers of smoking? Is that what the Australian Labor Party is telling us today? Shame on you—absolute shame on you. Then there is the national skin cancer campaign on which we spent $5.2 million. Is the Australian Labor Party saying it does not care enough about skin cancer to enable this government to go out and make sure the people do whatever is required to avoid the ravages of skin cancer.
I will very quickly go through a quote. I suspect that one of my other colleagues may want to talk about this as well.
The workplace relations ad appeared to me to be a non-political commercial that advertised changes to the law and how to get information about those changes. The ad offered no endorsement of government policy on workplace relations and, as such, did not conflict with my personal principles.

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2007-06-12,"—John Howard treats public property and public funds as his own private windfall. That is a real problem that we have got. Eleven years ago, Mr Howard decided to stick the Australian taxpayer with the bill for two official residences: Kirribilli House and the Lodge. Then he got to turning Kirribilli House into ‘party central’, which I named it some years ago. There is a wine consultant, a huge cellar and a $243,000 booze bill for the guzzlers at Kirribilli House. There have been massive refurbishments—renovation and refurbishing has run to more than $760,000 at Kirribilli House. And that is just the costs that we have been able to find out about.
Nobody actually thought he would turn Kirribilli House ‘party central’ into ‘Liberal Party central’, but that is what he has done now. Now we find that Kirribilli House is being used for Liberal Party fundraisers at more than $8,000 a head. This is not only outrageous, it is a totally improper exploitation of that grand Australian residence, which is part of the national estate. It is an improper use of Kirribilli House for party political fundraising.
The Prime Minister’s defence that the costs were met by the Liberal Party is a joke. We have seen year after year just how difficult it is to find out what the Howards spend on their parties down there at ‘party central’, Kirribilli House. The Christmas and New Year knees-ups that John Howard had down at Kirribilli House this year are only two examples. But of course there is no accountability for the public money that he spent there on those functions in a property that is owned by the Australian people. There was a wall of silence about who was invited to these two knees-ups. We do not know who was invited, we do not know who attended and we do not know the costs of the functions. We do not know what was spent and we do not know what was consumed because he will not tell us. Mr Howard will not tell us because he hates accountability. Given this track record, we can be sure that any costs that are disclosed by Mr Howard for re-election fund cocktail parties will be too little too late, if they are disclosed at all.
The abuse down there at Kirribilli House ‘party central’ is only one way that John Howard uses the public purse as his own pocket money. The biggest abuse—the biggest rort—is the government’s expenditure on taxpayer funded partisan political advertising. That is the biggest rort of all. Government advertising in this financial year and the next financial year alone will cost at least $550 million. These are just the ones we have been able to find out about through the Senate estimates process. The Howard government is now wasting taxpayers’ money on advertising at absolutely record speed. Between the last election and the upcoming election Mr Howard will have spent between $800 million and a billion dollars on advertising. That will take it to a total of $1.85 billion worth of taxpayer funded advertising campaigns since the election of the Howard government. This money is really burning a hole in Mr Howard’s pocket.
We have never seen an Australian government so blatant in revelling in grotesque abuses of the privileges of office as Mr Howard and his government. Of course, this is on top of the $500,000 for the proposed renovation of his dining room here in Parliament House—until we exposed him. (Time expired)

"Fifield, Sen Mitchell",LP,2007-06-12,"—We have just seen an example of Senator Faulkner’s confected outrage. It is a skill that he has honed to a fine art in the Senate estimates committees and here in the chamber. We have seen this particular act many times before.
I would like to start with the issue of Kirribilli House. It is clear that the function at Kirribilli House was not inappropriate and it was not at any cost to the Australian taxpayer. Successive prime ministers have taken a fairly broad view of what is an appropriate function to have at Kirribilli House or the Lodge. I recall a particular luncheon that was held at Kirribilli House to negotiate a particular pact between a then Labor prime minister and Labor treasurer. There has been a range of functions held at Kirribilli House.
But a true example of something that is inappropriate, again under the former Labor government, is the selling of budget night tickets for the House of Representatives gallery. That is an example of something that is inappropriate. Under the former Labor government, packages were sold and, lo and behold, part of a package was a seat in the House of Representatives gallery for budget night. If you want to look at examples of something which could perhaps be inappropriate, look no further than the previous government.
We have also heard great exclamations today about the inappropriate nature of government advertising. The advertising that this government has undertaken has been on the same basis as that of the former Labor government—on the basis of the 1995 guidelines under which Paul Keating operated, guidelines which said:
... all Australians have equal rights of access to information about programs, policies and activities which affect their benefits, rights and obligations ...
... All departments are required to conduct their public information programs at a level appropriate for ... impact on the community ...
And that is exactly what this government is doing.
What we have not heard from the Labor Party is which particular campaigns they want to knock out. Do Labor want to knock out campaigns against alcoholism and illegal drugs? Do they want to knock out campaigns encouraging people to quit smoking? Do they want to knock out campaigns encouraging people to take out Australian citizenship? Do they want to knock out campaigns about protecting our flora and fauna and about quarantine? Do they want to knock out campaigns urging people to consider and employers to support apprenticeships? Do they want to knock out campaigns urging vaccinations against cervical cancer? Do they want to knock out campaigns informing country people of their telecommunications rights? Do they want to knock out campaigns encouraging people to get involved with environmental projects? We need to hear from Labor which particular campaigns they want to knock out—not just saying that the government advertising spend is too big, but actually going through and telling us which particular campaigns they want to knock out.
We have seen Labor’s hypocrisy. When they were in office, we had the ‘money growing on trees’ campaign, costing $10 million, for their superannuation guarantee ads. We had the Working Nation advertisements, which cost $9 million and which had no content, no information, at all. And we had $250,000 paid to Bill Hunter for that government advertising campaign, only to see the same actor, Bill Hunter, then pop up in Australian Labor Party advertisements during the 1996 election commercials. So you had Bill Hunter in a paid government ad and, a few weeks later, Bill Hunter in a paid ALP ad. We had never seen anything of that nature before in Australian politics, and that is something which this government would never, ever do. We have also seen instances in the past where we have had Frank Walker, who was the housing minister in the Wran government, appearing in a government ad—the Hon. Frank Walker QC. Steve Bracks has appeared in government ads in Victoria, flying in a chopper over dams, making the point—which we all know—that water is scarce. There is no good reason for Steve Bracks to be in that particular ad; it is complete and absolute hypocrisy.
But, if we want a real example of Labor blowing taxpayers’ money, we need go no further than the front page of today’s Herald Sun, headed ‘Silk’s purse’, which reveals that Mr Mark Dreyfus QC, Labor’s candidate in the federal seat of Isaacs, was paid by the Bracks government $340,000 to help try and foist a toxic waste dump on the people of Mildura. We do not have to go too far to see examples of outrageous ALP spending; we only have to look at the state governments. We know, if we want to see that sort of thing repeated, to elect a federal Labor government—and you will see the sort of thing that we are seeing in Victoria, with Mr Mark Dreyfus QC being given $340,000 of taxpayers’ money to try and foist a toxic waste dump on the people of Mildura.
This government does spend responsibly. The Australian people are entitled to have government programs explained to them and to have government legislation explained to them. That is what we are doing. (Time expired)

"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,2007-06-12,"—What a pathetic attempt by Senator Fifield at defending this government’s record. Let me take you back to 1995, when these words were put out in a press release by the then opposition leader, John Howard. He said:
This soiled Government is to spend a massive $14 million of taxpayers’ money over the next two months as part of its pre-election panic. Judging by information coming from within the public service, if the full communication barrage runs its course it could reach $50 million. This Government has effectively allowed the Labor Party to get its fingers into the taxpayers’ till.
They were the words of the then Leader of the Opposition, John Howard. Since he became Prime Minister in 1996, John Howard has presided over the most arrogant, spendthrift government in the history of this country. It is a government that is effectively a bunch of hypocrites when it comes to dealing with issues of government advertising and government expenditure. We are not talking about the normal government advertising that is done for defence recruitment, quarantine issues or any of those other important campaigns in the interests of the Australian public. What we are talking about, as every senator on the government side knows, is the campaigns that have been blatantly used as pre-election propaganda.
I was privileged to chair the Senate Finance and Public Administration References Committee inquiry into government advertising and accountability, which reported in December 2005. That, mind you, was in the days when Senate committees were able to inquire into important issues of government accountability, unlike today. That inquiry highlighted the fact that, in the first five years of the Howard government, government advertising increased by over 40 per cent from the last five years of the Keating government. Most notably, when you take out the expenditure on such things as defence recruitment, the bulk of the expenditure was in promoting those campaigns that this government saw as important to its election prospects: the GST campaign—remember ‘unchain my heart’ or whatever it was; plagiarism at its worst—and Medicare—

Senator Sandy Macdonald interjecting—

—It worked because the Democrats sold out. That is why it worked; it had nothing to do with the advertising campaign. There was the campaign promoting the changes to Medicare. Remember the campaign on national security, the famous fridge magnet? I wonder how many people still have their fridge magnets. And of course there was that scurrilous campaign, $55 million on the introduction of Work Choices, an advertising campaign that was run before the legislation was even introduced into the parliament.
Mr Deputy President, $118 million was spent on the GST, $18½ million on the national security campaign, $54 million on Medicare, the PBS and those other health campaigns—all to convince the public on the government’s policies, to assist the government in its election campaign. As Senator Faulkner has just referred to, we now have a situation where government advertising under this government has reached $1.8 billion since the Howard government was elected, and, in the current two years, this and the next financial year, it has reached almost $1 billion. It has generally run at around $100 million to $150 million on average. It is now running at around $500 million on average. And now, again, we are going to have a campaign to try and convince the people about the changes to Work Choices, because the previous campaign did not work. The Prime Minister has now accepted that it is not a fair system, so the government is now going to spend millions more dollars trying to convince the public that it is going to change Work Choices to make it fairer.
I am old enough to remember senators and members of the coalition attacking Gough Whitlam when he bought Blue Poles—a national treasure now—and attacking Paul Keating when he put the Gould prints into the cabinet room. The worst thing that had ever happened! ‘Scurrilous and outrageous conduct,’ they cried! Yet here we have a Prime Minister who wants to increase the size of his dining room simply so he can enjoy his last supper! (Time expired)

That the Senate take note of the report.
I will not speak to the report at length, beyond noting that it did receive a degree of publicity. Prohibiting cluster munitions is an important issue which does merit further debate. I think it is important to ensure that there is an opportunity to have that report further debated in the Senate and, I might say, in the wider community. I was disappointed with the approach that the majority of the committee took, but, rather than debate that further at the moment, I would simply reinforce the Democrats’ commitment to continue to work towards prohibiting cluster munitions—cluster bombs—not just in Australia but worldwide.

"Parry, Sen Stephen",LP,2007-06-12,"—On behalf of the Chair of the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee, Senator Barnett, I present additional information received by the committee on its inquiry into Indigenous stolen wages.
—by leave—I move:
That the Senate take note of the documents.
The committee’s report was tabled in December last year—from memory, it was in the final sitting week. That was six months ago. The first point that I want to make is that there has still been no response from the federal government to the recommendations contained in that report. There were only six recommendations, from memory, and they were unanimous, having the support of all the Liberal senators—the committee at that time was chaired by Senator Payne—and all of the Labor senators, as well as that of me—I having initiated that inquiry—and of Senator Siewert on behalf of the Australian Greens. They were pretty straightforward recommendations. Only a small number of them actually related to action by the federal government. I think it is unacceptable that there has not yet been a response after six months.
I want to emphasise that the recommendations also related to state governments. It is pleasing to see the information from the South Australian government that has been tabled today, which I am taking note of. It does indicate some effort being put into examining details of the state government’s records to ascertain whether or not there are similar examples of stolen wages amongst the Indigenous people of South Australian as has occurred—and this has been quite clearly verified and acknowledged—under the Queensland government and the New South Wales government. I also note and welcome the subsequent action that was taken recently in the Western Australian parliament when the relevant minister committed the government of Western Australia to examine this issue further and to act on it. I would like to see a little bit more urgency on this issue because it affects many people who are quite old and have been waiting a long time. But it is good to see some clear commitment to action by the Western Australian government as well, and I congratulate them for that.
I would like to take this opportunity not only to note the activity that is happening in South Australia, which I think is a start although more needs to be done—and the information that has been tabled indicates that work is being done but still more has to occur—but to reiterate my call for all of those state governments that have not acted and fully examined whether there is anything more that they should be doing to act as urgently as possible. I repeat my urging of the Queensland government to redouble its efforts to properly respond to this issue. There was an initial response from the Queensland government but, as this report makes clear, that response was completely inadequate.
I reaffirm for the benefit of the Senate and those who might not know about Indigenous stolen wages—and I recommend the report to them so they can find out more about this issue—that there is a clear-cut, undenied circumstance of Indigenous people, certainly throughout Queensland and parts of New South Wales and quite probably in other parts of the country, being systematically denied the wages and entitlements that were theirs. They did the work and they had a legal entitlement to the wage but it was diverted into state government coffers under the so-called ‘benevolent protection’ of state government departments and bureaucrats. It was meant to be held in trust but in many cases it was simply never paid.
Such practices stretched over decades. These included federal family support payments that were simply taken by state governments and used by them. In many cases they were used to replace revenue that they were spending at a state level on missions and Indigenous reserves. It was a massive misappropriation of money that was directly owned by and the entitlement of Indigenous people. The response from the Queensland government was to offer a maximum of $4,000. That was simply a joke. That contrasted with the recent announcement at state level in Queensland where the state government agreed on a welcome reparations package for people who were subjected to ill-treatment as children in government institutions. Those people were able to access payments of up to $40,000, as I understand it. I welcome that; I do not begrudge that. But I note that does not apply to the Aboriginal children who were in government institutions known as Aboriginal missions and reserves. They are excluded from that payment. I find that extraordinary. Contrast that $40,000 payment with the $4,000 that people were offered as recompense for decades, in some cases, of nonpayment or underpayment of wages that they were legally entitled to. It is simply scandalous. I urge the Queensland government to do more. I know they are having negotiations at the moment about what to do with unexpended moneys from that first offer. I hope those can progress quickly. But that is not all that needs to be done.
In conclusion, I repeat my urging for the federal government, particularly the Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, Mr Brough, to respond to this inquiry. The federal government is not being asked to do a lot. It would be a simple thing to do. It would increase the pressure on those state governments which have not done the right thing so far to do more than they have. If the federal government cannot be bothered to respond to something that is so clear cut, is such a blatant injustice and actually requires so little from them after six months on an issue that we all acknowledged is urgent—everyone on the committee acknowledged this—then that really makes it much harder to put pressure on the state governments to do what they should be doing.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee</title>,Committees,21,1,speech
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2007-06-12,"—I support the motion. We should take note of the further information that has been tabled as to the inquiry on Indigenous stolen wages. I particularly record my pleasure at the announcement by the Western Australian government that they are going to establish a task force to look into the stolen wages. I note that they responded fairly quickly to the Senate committee report. When I say ‘fairly quickly’, I note the issue has been outstanding in Western Australia for a number of years. While the Western Australian government’s announcement followed relatively quickly the publication of the recommendations of the Senate committee, it has taken the Western Australian government quite a significant period of time to acknowledge that this was an issue. However, having said that, I am extremely pleased, and I hope that the task force will move very rapidly and that the state government will come up very quickly with a system of reparation, because the people affected by this stolen wages issue are starting to pass on. During the inquiry one person who had their wages stolen passed on. The many people affected who are now elderly deserve to see the fruits of their labour that were stolen from them.
The further information that is coming to light—and I suspect there is going to be much more—shows that not only was the government responsible for taking wages; some of the missions were, as were some of the pastoral stations. Some of the pastoral stations’ infrastructure was actually bought with Aboriginal wages. Aboriginal people did not own this infrastructure; those pastoral stations did. Instead of Aborigines being able to look after their welfare and their families’ welfare, they were in fact contributing to the development of the pastoral industry, from which they saw no gain.
Some of the other evidence coming to light goes to what the Commonwealth did and did not know. When it comes to pensions and child endowment, there is now clear evidence coming to light that the Commonwealth knew that the states and the pastoral properties were in fact keeping the bulk of these payments and giving ‘pocket money’ to Aboriginal people. Again, that is stolen money. That money belongs to those Aboriginal people. Not only do the Commonwealth have the responsibility to show some leadership in terms of encouraging those states that have not yet responded to take action, they have a responsibility to look into their own records to see how much they knew about child endowment and other pension payments and to see how much they need to encourage the states to provide as reparation to Aboriginal people whose entitlements were stolen. There is clear evidence that Commonwealth agencies knew at the time. They carried out audits of money being taken. They provided advice to state governments and to other employers about how much money to keep back. It is quite obvious that the Commonwealth knew, so they cannot wash their hands of this. They cannot pretend that it is purely a state issue. They need to show leadership. They need to go back to their files; to look at that evidence; to look at the evidence of the reports and the audits, which were carried out, as I understand it, on various occasions; and they need to provide that information to Aboriginal people. They also need to provide that information to the states. They need to look at the other recommendations that were made in that report that relate to them.
Once again, I am pleased that the Western Australian government has decided to establish this task force. I am concerned about the length of time that it will take. I think they need to be operating at the same time to ensure that they start thinking about what scheme is appropriate to provide reparation to those Aboriginal people, who are now getting quite elderly. They need to be looked after now and have reparation provided now rather than in some indeterminate period of time in the future. I urge the federal government to look at the recommendations of this report as a matter of urgency and take action to implement the recommendations. This is another issue where they cannot afford to sit on their hands and hope that the people who are affected will go away. They will be derelict in their responsibilities and in their duty to the Aboriginal people of Australia if they do not show this leadership now. I seek leave to continue my remarks at a later stage.

"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2007-06-12,"—by leave—The report resulted from the referral of the Cluster Munitions (Prohibition) Bill 2006—a Democrats bill—to the committee. The effect of that bill was to ban Australia’s involvement in cluster munitions. The bill arose from a visit I made to Lebanon in October last year, where it became very clear to me—and to the rest of the world—that cluster munitions in that conflict had left a legacy of destruction that would go on harming civilian populations for many years to come and that, in effect, cluster munitions had taken the place of landmines. Ninety-eight per cent of those killed by cluster munitions are civilians and many of those are children.
The Democrats were very disappointed that the submission of the Australian armed forces indicated that Australia would not accept the ban or the bill. Not only did they not wish to have that ban in place but they announced for the first time that Australia would acquire its own submunitions and that that was the reason for their opposition. The Democrats were disappointed with that finding. The committee’s report said that the newer, self-destruct munitions should be exempt from any ban, despite evidence that showed that these weapons still carried serious failure rates and caused unacceptable humanitarian harm.
In terms of Australia owning its own submunitions, we argued that this would diminish Australia’s capacity to persuade other countries to take seriously the impact of cluster munitions on civilians. There was plenty of evidence brought to the inquiry to that effect. It seems so incongruous, given the international moves to ban cluster munitions, that Australia would be a latecomer, as it were, in acquiring these munitions for itself.
I am grateful to the Senate for referring this bill for inquiry. I think it was very useful for the committee to receive submissions on the subject. It was disappointing that there was no public hearing, because there was no opportunity to quiz the Department of Defence on the reasons why they acquired these munitions at this late stage, what sorts of models they were proposing to purchase, where they came from, what they cost, what their failure rate might be, the conditions under which they were tested and so on. So it was a disappointment that both major parties determined that we would not have a public hearing into the bill. The overwhelming majority of submissions were in support of either the bill or a version of the bill which would be very restrictive on the way in which cluster munitions were used.
The inquiry was given a lot of evidence about the huge humanitarian cost to civilians. In Lebanon last year more than 1,000 cluster munitions were dropped, leaving the country littered with more than a million bomblets—devices which continue to kill year after year, as I said. Up to 50 per cent of those became unexploded ordnance as a result of that conflict. Of course, it is not the only country where they have been dropped. There have been others—for instance, Afghanistan and Iraq. And in Asia, in Vietnam and Cambodia, there are millions littering the countryside, making it almost impossible for people to go about their daily business, whether it is farming or it is children on their way to school, and they remain an enormous threat to people.
After the conflict in Lebanon, on 7 November the UN Secretary-General called on state parties to the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons to immediately address the atrocious, inhumane effects of cluster munitions at the time of their use and long after conflicts end, and to devise effective norms that will reduce and ultimately eliminate the horrendous humanitarian and developmental impact of these weapons. UNICEF Australia said that unexploded cluster bombs left over from conflict violate a number of articles of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, including those which relate to a child’s right to life, to a safe environment in which to play, to health, to clean water, to sanitary conditions and to adequate education.
This was both a timely bill and a timely inquiry, because world leaders—and, as I have just mentioned, only two of them—have been calling for international action. It was the case that Norway was the first country to really make moves in this direction. It called a conference in Oslo some months ago. Unfortunately, the Australian government decided not to attend this meeting. That is a great pity because there were 46 governments in attendance at that conference in Oslo in February this year. They agreed to conclude by 2008 a legally binding, international instrument that would prohibit the use, production, transfer and stockpiling of cluster munitions that caused unacceptable harm to civilians; to establish a framework for cooperation and assistance that would ensure adequate provision of care and rehabilitation of survivors and their communities, clearance of contaminated areas, risk education and destruction of stockpiles of prohibited cluster munitions; and to consider taking steps at a national level to address these problems. Also, they agreed to continue to address the humanitarian challenges posed by cluster munitions within the framework of international humanitarian law and in all relevant areas, and to meet again to continue their work in Lima in May-June, in Vienna in November-December and in Dublin in early 2008.
So it was pleasing that, despite not turning up to Oslo and pretty much ignoring that initiative, Australia did go to Lima in May-June. We certainly hope that the Department of Defence also goes to the Vienna meeting in November-December—and not only goes but argues very strongly for an international convention. I think it is important that our delegation at that meeting is properly informed about the dangers of cluster munitions and the risk of having a partial ban on these nasty weapons. It is much simpler, I would argue, for Australia to take a line which says: ‘There are some munitions which may be better than others but, by and large, they still inappropriately and disproportionately harm civilians. For that reason, whether they are regarded as so-called smart, whether they have self-destruct features or whether they are self-guided, they are still munitions which can disperse submunitions over large distances, and this is what makes them unacceptable in humanitarian terms.’
The government argued that there were already adequate measures in place for cluster munitions and argued that protocol V to the conventional weapons convention bound countries to particular actions. But, at the end of the day, all that protocol does is set out the obligations on countries that use cluster munitions to mark them, to clear them, to remove and destroy those that do not explode and to record, retain and transmit information about where they might be. As we know from the Lebanese conflict, that did not happen. It took some time for Israel to provide any sort of information to Lebanon about the location of the cluster munitions that were let off in Lebanon and, when some information finally came through, it was inadequate.
Protocol V of the conventional weapons convention is not adequate. Other arguments were made—that international humanitarian law guided behaviour with regard to submunitions. But, again, Dr Ben Saul said to the committee via his submission:
Humanitarian law does not expressly prohibit cluster munitions, which are subject to the ordinary rules on the means and methods of warfare. In some cases, the use of cluster munitions will comply with the principles of distinction, discrimination, proportionality and necessity; for example, where they are used against massed enemy formations in areas which are clearly distinguished from civilian populations and civilian objects.
…            …            …
While they are not inherently indiscriminate, cluster munitions may be unlawfully indiscriminate if they are used in contexts where they ‘cannot be directed at a specific military objective’ or where their ‘effects’ cannot be limited to military objectives as required—
—under the protocol. This whole area—(Time expired)

"Moore, Sen Claire",ALP,2007-06-12,"—When the Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs Legislation Amendment (Child Support Reform Consolidation and Other Measures) Bill 2007 came before us, there was such a sense of familiarity because, as we all know, this is an ongoing process of looking at reform of very complex legislation. When we were preparing for this process we were lucky enough to have yet another attempt at a Senate committee to consider these changes. We well remember in this place that when the second tranche of legislation in this process came through, there was an unholy rush—to rush through the committee process, to rush through what was then consideration with the community and also to make sure that we met a deadline that was imposed from outside the process, to meet an expectation that the legislation would go through this place, which then was not met because something more important came up. So all that rush around the second tranche of the legislation was unnecessary in many ways. We were looking at something that has been going on in the community for a very long time.
I am not going to go into the particular technical aspects of the bill and I do not think anyone has time to go into them because they are so complex. We have been looking at effective child support legislation in this country from the time the first round of legislation was introduced under the Hawke government. No-one pretended that the legislation was going to be perfect. When dealing with the issue of broken families, there is no way that legislation can appropriately respond to all the needs. However, from the time that the first round of family support legislation was brought forward, there was concern in the community and in the various departments—I think they have changed names a bit since that time but I think the expertise, the knowledge and the commitment remain—that these processes were complex, they would need to be looked at very closely and they would need, most importantly, to have the engagement of those people who were affected by the legislation. The only way that this process was going to be improved was to have some hope of looking at what was the key expectation of this legislation from day one, which was the protection and wellbeing of children—no-one argues with that; that has always been the No. 1 priority—and the attempts to work with this legislation have been based on that.
We know there have always been concerns, and I do not think that there will ever be legislation that will be able to respond effectively to all the concerns. Given that, we all shared the understanding that, from the time that the House of Reps committee report Every picture tells a story was presented, there would be a close look at the existing legislation and a commitment from all those involved that we would work to improve it and that it was going to be a long-term process. Certainly it has been long term, and I think we all come together now to make sure that we, as effectively as possible, move forward. This third round of legislation is supported by Labor, but we need to raise our ongoing concerns at this time or we are not doing our job.
From the time that the legislation came through in response to Every picture tells a story and in the supplementary approach, the Parkinson inquiry, we were concerned about who were going to be the winners and the losers out of the changes. That would seem to be an automatic response. When you change an existing system, you should have clear knowledge of how the current system works, who is impacted by it, who would benefit from it and what the impact of the new legislation is going to be. We would expect that in the drafting of the legislation and a formal impact statement there would be widespread community consultation.
The government and the departments involved have continued to commit to this community consultation. We were told through the Parkinson process there were clear understandings that, through these long-term deliberations, whatever happened into the future, there would be ongoing consultation and engagement of the various stakeholder groups. ‘Stakeholder’ is a term I do not like, but it is the current term in legislation so we will work with that. There was an understanding that the stakeholders would continue to have automatic and important involvement in the process—not just the cursory window-dressing of calling a few meetings but absolute involvement in what was going through.
There was no promise and, I believe, no understanding by anyone involved that that would mean that people would automatically agree. Indeed, in this particular area I feel that there is possibly no agreement except on the key issue that the children must be the most important element of where we go in the future. But, in terms of getting the various groups together, we have seen, even through the very truncated Senate committee process, that there are widespread and entrenched differences between people who have views on this process. So, although we were told in the second round of legislation discussions that the stakeholders committee would continue to meet and that they would have involvement in what happened next, we know that there has been only one meeting of the stakeholders group in the time between the second and third round. We hope that there will be more meetings. In fact, everybody said there were going to be more when we had the discussion at the Senate committee.
If the minister can assure me that there have been more and effective meetings, I am happy to hear that, but the evidence that we heard at the Senate committee was that there had not been extensive meetings of the stakeholders committee. What we need is transparency around what will happen in the future and to know that all the groups that have expressed their desire to be part of the process will have that opportunity. No-one can control whether or not they take that up or whether they feel that they can actually agree with other people sitting around the table, but the transparency must be that the stakeholders feel that they are part of the ongoing process.
In terms of where we go, questions that we asked in this place at the second stage of the reform of the legislation were around the effective modelling and review of the impact of this legislation on the people involved, when we saw that, at exactly the same time as the Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs Legislation Amendment (Child Support Reform Consolidation and Other Measures) Bill 2007 was going to be implemented and impact on the community, in particular on single parents, the government were implementing their Welfare to Work changes. All the way through this process we consistently asked: who has looked at the combined impact of these two significant pieces of legislation on the people who are living the experience? That is not necessarily academic involvement in the process—although the involvement of effective, committed and well-trained academics must be valued and must continue—but the use of the life experiences of people who are now raising children alone, often as a result of broken family relationships. What is the combined impact of legislation coming at them from both sides?
Again, at the recent Senate committee hearing, it was confirmed to us that that degree of modelling has not happened; that degree of examination has not happened yet. There was goodwill and an understanding of a commitment from the government to do that. There was also urgency from people at the Australian Institute of Family Studies and FaCSIA as a whole that that must happen and that it would happen in the future. But, once again, we have very significant and complex legislation being brought down on a group in our community and there is a real element of ‘trust us; let’s see what’s going to happen; let’s hope that it’s going to work’. We all hope that. What we must have at this stage in the whole process is at least some degree of trust from all those who are involved in the process that there is a willingness to move forward together and that there is an understanding that these issues will be considered.
I know that Senator Siewert has some particular issues around child care—who has responsibilities and the financial acknowledgement of that degree of care. Senator Siewert will raise that, so I will not touch on it. Labor, as I have said—and Senator Stephens will take this up—will support this legislation, but, once again, it is with some genuine concern about what happens next. This group in our community has suffered immensely. In evidence to the committee, we were led to believe that the kinds of figures that could be under consideration in this legislation on a fortnightly basis—for people who are single parents—are enormous for people on a fixed income. While people here can look at the loss of $60 or $70 a fortnight as something that can be budgeted around and that we can move forward effectively on, there are people who are currently living on a very tight budget. I know that people in the department looked very closely at the evidence that came forward in both committees. There was gut-wrenching evidence about the effectiveness of budgeting by families who know exactly where each dollar goes. So, when we are talking about legislation that is being introduced that will cut any of that income, there must be acknowledgement that there is pain and that we need to make sure that the whole environment in which these changes are made offers the best hope of support for the people involved, otherwise this legislation comes in by itself and those people will be lost in the transition.
Briefly, before Senator Siewert makes her contribution, I want to add something about the proposal in this legislation to make sure that all births are registered. This was raised in the committee. Many on the committee felt that there was an understanding that people had to have registered births before they were able to claim payment under the Centrelink system. It was enlightening to find out that that was not the case and that we needed to have this legislation in place so that we can be absolutely confident that we have effective statistics on the growth of our population and we can effectively use those statistics to plan for the future—in particular for putting the welfare of children most importantly at the forefront of any legislation that we deal with that comes under the heading of ‘families and community services’.
As a member of the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs I would like to put on record my concerns: ensuring that the people who are most engaged in this process, by living the experience, continue to be involved; acknowledging that they have genuine input to any change in this legislation; and acknowledging that there is not a political attempt to enhance disadvantage but a genuine attempt to maintain certainty, so that people know that they are able to effectively raise children in our community.",SENATE,"<title>FAMILIES, COMMUNITY SERVICES AND INDIGENOUS AFFAIRS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (CHILD SUPPORT REFORM CONSOLIDATION AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2007</title>",<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,29,1,speech
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2007-06-12,"—The Australian Greens support the need for reform to the Child Support Scheme. The last time we debated the new scheme we indicated our support for it. However, we raised some concerns. The Greens are supportive overall of the intentions of the proposed changes in the Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs Legislation Amendment (Child Support Reform Consolidation and Other Measures) Bill 2007. However, as we have said previously, we have several concerns about this bill in particular and also some ongoing concerns. Firstly, the Greens are concerned about the nature of the amendment to the baby bonus scheme, which I will go to shortly. Secondly, yet again I am raising the issue of principal carers, as I will ad infinitum until the government takes this on board. Thirdly, we are particularly concerned about the development of models to investigate the impact of the changes to the child support arrangements.
The Australian Greens recognise the potential temptation of misuse associated with the lump sum baby bonus payment which led to the proposed amendments in this bill. However, we believe that this issue extends to a wide range of expectant parents, not just to those under the age of 18. We believe that these provisions should apply to all recipients of the baby bonus, not just a subgroup chosen purely because of their age. This is why we recommended in our minority report on the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs inquiry that the provisions relating to periodic payment be extended to all recipients of the baby bonus and not be limited to mothers under the age of 18.
Let us consider for a moment the list of reasons that the government has given for dishing out the baby bonus in fortnightly payments to those under the age of 18. The list I am about to talk about is from the Family Assistance Office website. It came out on 11 January. It actually referred at that time to the changes to process that were made from 1 January 2007 to 1 July 2007 for young people under the age of 17 who applied for maternity payment and to the decision that it would be made in 13 fortnightly instalments.
The reasons that people who are under 17 who apply at the moment have to receive fortnightly payments instead of one lump sum payment include inexperience in handling large sums of money; situations where an applicant may be subject to pressure to use the payment unwisely; a history of experience of domestic or family violence; a history of difficulties in managing finances; situations where an applicant may be vulnerable to exploitation; situations where applicants have gambling problems or substance addiction; situations where applicants are homeless or at risk of becoming homeless; situations where applicants previously had or currently have a child which is subject to child protection; and where applicants have intellectual disability or mental illness. It could be one or all of those reasons.
I ask you to consider this list of reasons. Consider how many of them apply exclusively or particularly to teenage parents and how many we might in fact expect to apply, as much or even more, to an older group of expectant parents. Let us look at inexperience in handling large sums of money. Yes, you would expect that younger people would be more likely to have less experience with large sums of money but by far not exclusively so. Many people over the age of 18 have great difficulty in managing large sums of money. Let us look at situations where applicants may be subject to pressure to use the payment unwisely. There is no reason to expect that a person over 18 may not be pressured to use the money unwisely. It is the same with a history of experience of domestic or family violence. Please, no-one try to tell me that domestic or family violence is restricted to those under the age of 18! Unfortunately, the statistics prove otherwise. It is the same with inexperience in handling large sums of money and a history of difficulties in managing finances. I expect that there are going to be a lot more people with a history of difficulties in managing finances in the over-18 age group. The arguments that are given as reasons that people under 18 should not receive a lump sum apply equally to those over 18.
Whether it is called a baby bonus or a maternity payment or an allowance and whether we are discussing child endowment or paid maternity leave, the tone of these debates, unfortunately, has changed little in nearly 100 years. From the introduction of the maternity allowance in 1912 to the royal commission on the child endowment scheme in 1929 and on to the series of ongoing debates concerning paid maternity leave, we have consistently seen governments questioning the ability of young women, particularly young single mothers, to manage their finances. It is back to the future for the new paternalism. What was paternalistic in the 1920s is equally paternalistic now.
The government, we believe, has failed to make a convincing argument as to why these problems apply to young people but not to older people or to give a rationale for the cut-off age. If we are concerned that handing over large sums of money is a bad idea then we should apply the same reasoning to all. If this is an admission from the government that the baby bonus was not good policy as a lump sum payment for those under 18 years of age, we maintain that it is not good policy for those over 18 years of age. To achieve the objective of the baby bonus—or, as it used to be known, the maternity payment—it would be better to give fortnightly payments to all, not just to those under 18.
The Greens appreciate that there are some circumstances where a large lump sum payment may be appropriate for the one-off purchase of a large item relating to the needs of a new family. Perhaps it would be to help expectant parents to purchase baby furniture and equipment to set themselves up to care for the new child. If you think about it, it is highly likely that it will be the under-18-year-olds that will particularly need help to buy that sort of equipment. Therefore, while we support the intention of moving to periodic payments rather than one lump sum, we think there should be some discretion given to Centrelink to make part of the payment or all of it as a lump sum if the rationale is provided. To this end, the Greens minority report also recommends that the format of the periodic payments should be able to be varied where there is a strong case for a lump sum payment or on the recommendation of a qualified social worker. The Greens will be moving amendments to this effect in the committee stage of the bill.
I come now to the issue of principal carers. I have raised this issue in this place before. As I said, I promise I will keep raising it until this inequity is dealt with. The Australian Greens remain concerned about the potential impact of changes to child support on low-income households, particularly when they are considered in combination with the financial impacts of the changes introduced through Welfare to Work. I will raise some of those issues again shortly.
We raised our concerns first in our additional comments to the report on the child support legislation amendment. In fact, we raised them before that. We raised them again in the minority report on this legislation. We are seeing radical changes to the Family Law Act and to the child support act, and these changes are happening at the same time.
The previous changes to Welfare to Work introduced the concept of a principal carer. What has happened under the Family Law Act, as I have articulated before, is that it is now moving to the concept of equal shared care. We are moving to a model of fifty-fifty shared care as the preferred social model. On the other hand, for the purposes of income support, the government says that there is only one principal carer and that person is responsible for the care of the child. So far as Centrelink is concerned, if you have fifty-fifty shared care, it would essentially be a case of first in, best dressed. If you happen to be nominated as the parent with principal care of the child, you get the benefits under the Welfare to Work legislation. We now have a number of mothers coming forward who nominally have fifty-fifty shared care but are in reality shouldering an unequal part of the parental care burden because they have not been recognised as a shared carer or their shared care has not been recognised through the principal carer provisions of the Welfare to Work provisions. They are suffering and their children are suffering as a result of the inability of the government to make up its mind about which parental care model it advocates: either it is fifty-fifty through the family law process—the legislation for which has now gone through—or it is a matter of favouring one parent and giving that one parent control and giving the benefits of that; but you do not give any benefits to the other parent. If you have fifty-fifty shared care, you cannot possibly expect to choose one parent in the income support system, and not the other, to be the parent that gets the benefit. That leads to inequality in the child’s life.
The central focus needs to be the best care for our children and, also, what is best for the future of our nation. Surely the best would be for a child to grow up with a basic level of income support. This is not what is being provided through the current system of a principal carer. In evidence to the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs on this particular bill, the National Council of Single Mothers and their Children Inc again pointed out the inequity of the principal care process. Ms Taylor said:
On the one hand we have family law and child support law encouraging shared parenting and acknowledging where there is 35 per cent or more of care—between 35 to 65 per cent care is considered shared—but, on the other, on income support policy under social security law, only one parent can be given principal carer status leaving the other parent and the children exceptionally vulnerable.
They said in their submission:
This means that the half-time children in the household of the person who is not deemed under Social Security law to be the Principal Carer will not attract the protections available to Principal Carers in the income support system. The impact of this disjuncture in definitions is most acute for young children whose parents are both dependent on income support and are thus likely to be highly disadvantaged.
This is not just a matter of income but also a matter of the additional benefits and entitlements such as concession cards and access to pharmaceutical benefits and child care.
The Greens believe that urgent reform is needed to address this disparity and inequity. This is an unfair system. That is why we have recommended in our minority report that the income support definition of ‘principal carer’ be aligned with the intent of the family law changes to reflect the concept of shared parenting such that, where parents sharing the care of children each receive income support and the difference in percentage responsibility is 12 per cent or less, both are deemed to be principal carers. It is not too hard to understand the inequity and to fix it. It is not rocket science.
I now move on to the financial impact of this legislation and its intersection with the Welfare to Work system. Senator Moore touched on this. The Greens are concerned that there is no publicly available modelling to estimate the impact of the new system on existing child support recipients and payers. While we are pleased that FaCSIA will be monitoring the impact of the changes following their implementation, we believe that modelling should occur before this implementation in order to assess potential impact. Monitoring after the fact means that many families may have already been adversely affected before we, the community, become aware of the extent of the problem. As there will inevitably be a sufficient time delay before the monitoring data will be available and can be acted upon, families with young children may be suffering for some time before measures can be put in place to rectify these adverse impacts. It is hard enough raising kids at the best of times. I do not know if there are many in this place who truly understand and readily appreciate the additional stress and suffering brought about by the severe financial pressures when you are trying to care for a young family in extremely trying circumstances and on an extremely low income. We should never forget that single parents—and it is largely single mothers—are more often than not very highly overrepresented in the lower income areas. This is why we need to model what these impacts are before implementation. The Greens believe that modelling of the potential impact should be done immediately and that provisions should be put in place to protect low income families, who may lose income and be put under unconscionable financial stress as a result of these changes.
We acknowledge that these changes to child support are important and that the system needs fixing. We are deeply concerned about the unintended consequences for families that are already on low incomes. They may stretch their budgets beyond breaking point. Such protections are critical given the risk of poverty already confronted by many of these families. That is why the Greens recommended in our minority report that an appropriate system be developed to model and investigate the impact of the child support income changes when they are combined with the Welfare to Work changes. Both of these changes will potentially lower the income of some families. We know it will not be all of them, but some families are going to have their incomes lowered.
We need a system that is fair and equitable and that puts the welfare of our kids first. It makes no sense for the government to simultaneously advocate two radically different models of parental care. The contradictions between the notion of equal shared care in child support law and the notion that there is only one principal carer under welfare law must be resolved.
To decide arbitrarily that those under the age of 18 are not capable of handling a lump sum and list the reasons why this is so, which equally apply to those aged 18, is to me also inequitable. The Greens believe that a far better way of delivering, as it is changed in the law, what is now called the baby bonus would be to do so in periodic fortnightly payments.
We take the risk that these changes, particularly those brought by Welfare to Work, the child support changes and the family law changes, may adversely impact on some families and children who are already living in or very near poverty. We should be modelling and looking at these impacts now so that we do not wait until the crisis occurs before taking action.
As I have outlined, the Greens will be moving amendments to this legislation in the committee stage, both amending the principal carers provision and requiring the baby bonus payments to be made in periodic payments with the possibility of variation at the discretion of the secretary of the department.

"McEwen, Sen Anne",ALP,2007-06-12,"—I would like to address a few comments to this important bill, the Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs Legislation Amendment (Child Support Reform Consolidation and Other Measures) Bill 2007, which is the third instalment in a range of child support legislation reform that the Senate has been required to consider over the last year. Although Labor has been critical of some aspects of the child support reform, we have supported the previous two packages of reforms and we will also support this one.
Labor’s main concern is the effect of these laws on low-income families. We do not want to see reforms which disadvantage families who need more support to be able to fully participate in the community. We are, of course, most concerned about the welfare of children, whose futures are intrinsically linked to the economic circumstances of their upbringing. While our concerns have been brought to the attention of the government on numerous occasions, we have not been satisfied with the response of government, and Labor will continue to monitor the outcomes of this legislation and other legislation relating to child support.
Labor has long had an interest in the welfare of children from all types of families. It was, after all, the Whitlam government that introduced the single supporting mothers’ parent pension in 1973, in recognition of the fact that women who were divorced or separated were, in the main, left responsible for the care of children, and often without any security of income. The basis of the current child support scheme was originally drafted by the Hawke Labor government in 1988 and was a model for child support schemes later introduced into other comparable countries. The principle of child support legislation is that after divorce or separation both parents should continue to financially support their children if they are able to do so. It is a principle that seems obvious to us today, but that has not always been the case. While the principle of the legislation must be upheld, we also acknowledge that reforms need to be made to the legislation which is, after all, now almost 20 years old, and many things to do with families have changed in those two decades.
One thing that has not changed is that issues of child support are always contentious. That is evidenced by the fact that all senators and members are continually in receipt of submissions from those families which are either paying family support or are in receipt of child support and who are aggrieved by the system that is in place. Indeed, the Australian Institute of Family Studies found that more than 60 per cent of non-resident fathers and 45 per cent of resident mothers think the current system is not working. Those are disturbing figures, and it is obvious that more reform is needed, although it is unrealistic to think that in such a contentious area we could ever get a system that would satisfy everybody. That said, this reform should not be at the expense of the poorest and most vulnerable people in Australia. Custodial parents and their children are amongst the poorest groups in the community and in Australia there are 1.1 million children in whose name child support is paid. We must ensure that any changes to their circumstances are for the better and do not make life even harder for those already doing it tough.
Getting to the legislative stage of these reforms has been a very lengthy process. When the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs tabled its report Every picture tells a story in 2003, it made 29 recommendations. One of those recommendations was the establishment of the ministerial task force to evaluate the child support scheme. That task force on child support undertook comprehensive research and analysis of the child support arrangements in Australia, as well as collecting statistical information on the cost of raising children. The report of the task force, known as the Parkinson report, made several recommendations, many of which were enacted in the two reform bills previously passed.
The implementation of a new child support scheme, including a new payment formula, was a result of one such recommendation. Those reforms were supported by Labor, but they were not entirely satisfactory to us. Our concerns were raised with the government then and we raise them again now, as we have not been provided with an adequate response. Research has not been conducted by the government into the effect of the new formula on families. Labor’s constant request for information led to the creation of a stakeholder reference group but this group unfortunately has been found to be ineffective and has met, as I understand it, only once. The group and, more importantly, the government, have failed to respond to the serious and pressing concerns of people involved in the issues of child support.
The new child support formula is having an impact on the lives of Australian families, so we need to know whether the formula has been a success or not. If not, we need to change the formula to advantage families and not further disadvantage them. If the government does undertake the research, the changes will of course need to be examined hand in hand with the new Welfare to Work changes because under that legislation some parents will now suffer income reduction as they move from parenting payment onto Newstart allowance. That, along with the child support changes, could dangerously affect the future of children already living in precarious economic circumstances.
While Labor is closely monitoring the impact of the child support legislation and Welfare to Work on families, we ask the government to lift its game on these matters. These children need to be a top priority of the government and their best interests must remain our focus throughout these discussions and reforms. I understand that many groups involved in these issues believe that their rights are paramount in this issue, but it must always be the rights of children and their welfare that are paramount.
As previously indicated, our chief concern is the effect that the new payment formula has on low-income families. The National Council of Single Mothers and their Children, or NCSMC, made a submission to the recent Senate inquiry conducted by the community affairs committee into this bill. That submission echoes some of Labor’s concerns. I would like to thank the NCSMC—a fine Adelaide based organisation with wonderful people who do a lot of good work to support single parents and their families—for their work. In their submission, the council reported that the:
... formula changes will create increased poverty for children aged 0-12 of separated parents in the households where they spend most of their time.
The council also found:
The “credit for care” discount of 24% applicable to non-resident parents who have contact between 14-34% will also result in increased poverty for children aged 0 - 17 in the households where they primarily reside.
Labor agree without hesitation that non-custodial parents should be encouraged to spend time with their children, and we acknowledge that those parents also face financial difficulties. I understand that this is a very complicated area and one that is difficult to get right, as Senator Moore was saying earlier on in her comments on this matter. However, Labor also believe that more effort needs to be made in getting it right, because every time we get it wrong we are further disadvantaging the children we should be trying to assist.
The current formula provides for payments to decrease at a time when, as any family will tell you, the prices of providing the most basic care and support for children are increasing. Today I noticed, for example, that petrol is being sold in Adelaide for $1.31 a litre and in regional South Australia for up to $1.41 a litre. Petrol is of course essential for most families to be able to conduct some semblance of a normal life and to contribute meaningfully in the community.
Late last year I participated in Labor’s Family Watch Task Force, which entailed surveying families in all states and territories in Australia. Consistently the price of basics such as food, petrol and child care, and school and medical expenses were mentioned by parents as something they were increasingly concerned about and often having to adjust the family budget to accommodate. For many families, particularly single parent families, that meant curtailing social and sporting activities, including school excursions, which was a disturbing result for the task force to find.
Labor does not want a system where parents and children are being left with less than they began with. This is particularly the case when looking at low-income households. Ironically, the people who most need our support are receiving the least, according to the studies of the NCSMC. Studies have also been conducted by NATSEM at the request of the ministerial task force. The studies of the NCSMC, a very well regarded research organisation, show that under the new payment system resident parents on annual incomes of $26,000 or less will incur the biggest reduction in child support payments—that is, families with the lowest incomes are going to find themselves with even less money.
According to the NATSEM studies, that formula will make the poor poorer. It is important to realise that that will not be the case for just a handful of families; according to the Child Support Agency, 75 per cent of families receiving child support are on incomes under that amount per year. It is those people that are being hit hardest by the new formula, which of course begs the question: who is the new system really benefiting? Hopefully we will find that out through government research into the true impact of these laws.
I would like to add a few comments on sections of the bill which Labor can more confidently support. It is an unfortunate fact that many people for too long have used any means possible to avoid paying appropriate child support. Many people in the system who should be paying more have been paying the bare minimum of just $5 a week—barely enough, I would think, to buy a kilogram of tomatoes or a jar of pasta sauce. There has also been notorious difficulty in getting people to pay on time. Recent reforms have led to a crackdown on those parents who do not make their payments, particularly by the Australian Taxation Office. I understand over 35,000 parents who have not filed their tax returns to avoid paying child support have been required to make good on an outstanding $13 million in payments. The Child Support Agency and the tax office should be commended for their job in pursuing that money that is due to our nation’s children.
Another section of the legislation which is encouraging to see is the extension of the Child Support Agency’s ability to collect payments. With more persons now earning their income from independent contractor arrangements, it is important to be able to recover child support payments from those individuals. Currently ongoing child support cannot be collected from parents who earn their income under those arrangements, and that means a lot of children are missing out. The legislation before us will change that so that the CSA can issue notices requiring payments to be deducted from the independent contractor parent’s income and that the payments be forwarded to the agencies. Hopefully that arrangement will mean more children are provided with the child support that they need.
I also note that in the second round of reforms those receiving or paying child support were given access to an independent review of Child Support Agency decisions through the Social Security Appeals Tribunal. That has been a useful thing that my office has been able to assist parents to access—parents who would otherwise have faced significant legal bills trying to challenge decisions of the Child Support Agency.
An amendment that Labor proposed and now supports is the change to the payment of the baby bonus to mothers under 18 years of age. Since the introduction of the so-called baby bonus, a number of concerning stories have come to light—for example, of young women who have given birth to a child for the sole purpose of securing the lump sum. I do not think that that is an approach taken by many young women, but it is disturbing to think that anyone should be living in such circumstances that they would contemplate having a child to gain a cash bonus. It has also been reported by domestic violence services that levels of abuse of young mothers rises about six weeks after birth, coinciding with the baby bonus payment, and there are young women with infants who are handing over payments to abusive partners just to get rid of the partner. This is, after all, a payment designed to assist parents in the first few months of parenthood and not to cause additional problems.
So, clearly, the baby bonus has had some undesirable effects in some circumstances. Although those cases are indeed a minority, they are enough to cause concern. Hence, Labor supports these amendments. I am happy to see, then, that the government will be paying the bonus in instalments to all parents under 18. I acknowledge that there are many loving and responsible young parents out there who will be frustrated by this change. But without it we would be leaving many young women, in particular, in a vulnerable situation. And I hope that cases like those I have mentioned will be stopped from occurring in the future through this change.
This is a good time to reflect on why the baby bonus was put in place, whether it is necessary and whether there are any alternatives. The payment was introduced by the government with some thought to increasing the birthrate in Australia. But I would suggest we have to question whether—given the problems the nation is going to face with environmental sustainability and adequate resources such as water—encouraging fertility is the way to go. We also have to acknowledge that the concept of women as baby factories has substantially changed, I hope, and we should not be doing anything to send us backwards to those days.
Australia’s fertility rate has dropped since the early 1900s but we are living in, as I said before, completely different times and it is unlikely that we will go back to having three or four children per woman, as we were in the first decade of the 20th century. Nevertheless, Australia’s fertility rate between 1994 and 2004 has been relatively stable at between 1.73 and 1.85 births. And, even if it were the decision of the nation to increase the fertility rate, it is unlikely that a payment of $5,000 would make much difference when women work and want to work and, increasingly, have to work to support their families. So, while the baby bonus is a useful contribution to the early costs of child-rearing, real assistance to families means much more than a one-off payment.
It is not surprising to note that countries with high birthrates provide a high level of support for families. Australia lags behind comparable countries in the provision of paid parental leave, and it is one of the great failures of this government that it has done nothing to redress that situation. In Canada, mothers receive 50 weeks paid leave, 35 of which can be taken by the mother or the other parent. And in the United Kingdom—again, a comparable country—mothers receive 39 weeks paid leave from their job. Those countries and others also provide quality, accessible, affordable child care—another area in which the Howard government has an appalling record. If the government were serious about increasing our birthrate, it would address these initiatives and endeavour to provide real, ongoing and practical support to families and especially women.
However, we should not expect too much of this government, which is more interested in blowing billions of dollars on advertising its despised workplace relations laws than it is in assisting families, and we should not expect too much of a government that thinks it is okay to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on a jewelled coach for the Queen or on a bigger dining table for the Prime Minister. I had to wonder when I was doing the research for this speech how many of the children and parents affected by this legislation could contemplate spending $8,000 for a few drinks and nibbles with the Prime Minister at Kirribilli. So, while Labor supports the legislation, we deplore the government’s outrageous, out-of-control and reckless spending when the nation’s poorest children and their families are wondering how they are going to pay for the petrol to get to work or school tomorrow.",SENATE,"<title>FAMILIES, COMMUNITY SERVICES AND INDIGENOUS AFFAIRS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (CHILD SUPPORT REFORM CONSOLIDATION AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2007</title>",<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,31,1,speech
"Scullion, Sen Nigel",CLP,2007-06-12,"—Following on from the government’s major 2006 legislation implementing the recommendations of the Ministerial Taskforce on Child Support chaired by Professor Patrick Parkinson, this follow-up bill—the Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs Legislation Amendment (Child Support Reform Consolidation and Other Measures) Bill 2007—consolidates the changes and makes a variety of other minor amendments to Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs portfolio legislation. Most of the consolidation amendments provide administrative and implementation details of the new policies passed by the parliament. Various consequential amendments and minor refinements are needed for the implementation of the new child support formula on 1 July 2008.
With the benefit of a few months’ experience of operation, some of the processes relating to review of child support decisions by the Social Security Appeals Tribunal are being clarified, and the changed arrangements with the courts refined. Child support agreements between parents are being better supported and strengthened, and their interaction with family tax benefit clarified. Technical details, such as how the two child support acts interact, are being addressed, and consequential amendments are being made to taxation legislation.
The new child support formula is being modified in one significant aspect. The task force’s finding of differing costs for children at different ages is being better reflected in situations in which the children are in different houses. In late 2004, the Child Support Legislation Amendment Bill was introduced, containing child support proposals unrelated to the task force reforms. This bill relocates many amendments from the 2004 bill which will now no longer be needed. With appropriate adjustments to reflect the changes made as a result of the task force’s reforms, most of these proposals can now proceed.
The 2004 bill dealt with Australia’s international obligations to certain other countries in assessing and enforcing child support liabilities across jurisdictions. The bill moves the measures from their current location in regulations into the primary child support legislation in satisfaction of an undertaking to do so given when they were enacted. However, after some years of experience with their operation, the opportunity is also taken to refine some of the aspects of the provisions.
The 2004 bill measures also include several amendments applying where one of the parties to a child support case wishes to seek review of any decision about whether one of the parties is a parent of the child. To improve equity in access to court between the two parties, some minor streamlining refinements are also being made to the internal review system for child support decisions generally.
The last of the 2004 bill measures are of a minor policy or technical nature and are generally to address anomalies in the current system or improve aspects of child support administration. For example, in many cases a parent unhappy with a child support decision will seek review of the decision. In circumstances in which the decision will not be changed—for example, because the decision has already been reviewed—the objection will no longer be required to be served on the other parent.
This bill also includes several family assistance amendments, some of them associated with the child support reforms. For example, refinements are made to certain elements of the formula used to work out the notional amount of maintenance income that an individual is taken to have received under a child support agreement or court order where there is an underpayment of child support registered for collection by the Child Support Agency. It is also being clarified that maintenance income received by a payee for one or more children would reduce the payee’s amount of family tax benefit part A above the base rate for those children only. The maintenance income tax provisions for family tax benefit are also being refined. This is partly to reflect the new treatment under the child support reforms of child support agreements and lump sum child support.
Amendments consequential to the child support reforms are also being consolidated in relation to various social security and veterans entitlements payments. In particular, remote area allowance is being extended so that parents with regular care of a child—that is, care of between 14 and 35 per cent—continue to receive the allowance after the 1 July 2008 changes to family tax benefit.
Unrelated amendments to the baby bonus provisions will formally rename the payment as the ‘baby bonus’ rather than the ‘maternity payment’, in line with most people’s understanding. Under-18-year-old claimants will be paid the baby bonus in 13 instalments rather than in a lump sum, and registration of birth as a condition of eligibility for the baby bonus will be introduced.
Under this bill, the usual 13-week period for full payment of family tax benefit while temporarily outside Australia will be extended for members of the Australian Defence Force and certain Australian Federal Police personnel of the International Deployment Group who are deployed overseas as part of their duties and, as a result, remain overseas for longer than 13 weeks.
Recent disasters such as Cyclone Larry have shown that the rebuilding efforts of a disaster affected community are stretched and a year is not long enough to allow complete recovery. The bill will extend the current 12-month principal home temporary absence rules for absences of up to 24 months for people who have suffered loss or damage to their homes due to a disaster. The bill will also assist people who cannot purchase or build a new home within 12 months due to factors beyond their control by extending the asset test exemption of principal home sale proceeds from 12 months to up to 24 months.
The bill will make minor refinements to the operation of the income stream provisions of the social security and veterans’ means tests. Lastly, the claim rules for the new Australian government disaster recovery payment are being adjusted so they work correctly for non-resident citizens.
I will just add a point of clarification. Both Senator Moore and Senator Ursula Stephens provided commentary earlier today in regard to the National Stakeholder Engagement Group. Just for the record, the child support National Stakeholder Engagement Group has met twice this year, not once. The first meeting in 2007 was on 2 March 2007, with the second on 6 June 2007. I understand that a further two meetings are scheduled for August and September 2007.
Question agreed to.
Bill read a second time.",SENATE,"<title>FAMILIES, COMMUNITY SERVICES AND INDIGENOUS AFFAIRS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (CHILD SUPPORT REFORM CONSOLIDATION AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2007</title>",<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,31,1,speech
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2007-06-12,"—We are considering Tax Laws Amendment (2007 Measures No. 3) Bill 2007 and Tax Laws Amendment (Small Business) Bill 2007 in a cognate debate. The measures No. 3 bill contains 10 measures, three of which I would like to concentrate on in my contribution tonight, and in particular schedule 10, which proposes new withholding arrangements for managed fund distributions to foreign residents.
Schedule 1 reduces the punitive impact on certain distributions to entities connected with a private company. Labor supports this measure to reduce compliance costs for private companies and reduce tax penalties, particularly for inadvertent breaches of the ‘deemed dividend’ provisions of the tax law.
Schedule 2 of this bill is a revenue protection measure necessary for the proper implementation of the simplified superannuation reforms. Labor supports this proposal to close a loophole that gives an unfair advantage to certain taxpayers—I believe it is by gifting in order to attempt to circumvent the contribution limits.
Schedule 3 of this bill allows a trustee of a resident testamentary trust to choose to be assessed on capital gains of the trust which would otherwise be assessed to an income beneficiary who cannot receive the benefit of the capital gains. Labor supports this proposal to introduce more fairness in the taxation of testamentary trusts income.
Schedule 4 of this bill makes lump sum superannuation death benefits paid to nondependants of ADF personnel, Australian police force members or Australian Protective Service officers who die in the line of duty tax free. Labor supports this proposal, which recognises the valuable role played by defence personnel and police in maintaining the safety and security of the community.
Schedule 5 of this bill extends the transitional period relating to the application of accounting standards under the thin capitalisation rules. Labor supports this proposal to assist business adjusting to the new accounting standards and their impact on the thin capitalisation.
Schedule 6 repeals the dividend tainting rules. Labor supports this proposal, which comes about as a result of the removal of the intercorporate dividend rebate and the introduction of the consolidation regime.
Schedule 7 of this bill more closely specifies which debt interests are eligible for exemption from interest withholding tax in sections 128F and 128FA of the 1936 Income Tax Assessment Act. Tax is withheld from the payment of interest to nonresidents at a rate of 10 per cent, subject to a number of exceptions. Sections 128F and 128FA of the 1936 act provide an exemption for interest paid by companies on debentures that meet a public offer test. The exemption exists to reduce the cost of Australian companies obtaining capital. The amendments specify that non-debenture debt interests that are non-equity shares and syndicated loans are eligible for exemption from IWT. They also introduce a regulation-making power to prescribe further types of eligible debt interests within the exemption.
The new schedule represents a significant backdown by the current Liberal government. These amendments have an interesting history of change reversal by the current government. It started with legislative amendments in 2005 to extend the exemption from interest on a debenture to interest on a debenture or a debt interest in order to reflect changes to Australia’s debt/equity rules in 2001. The 2005 amendments unintentionally resulted in the exemption being potentially available to all debt interests. The definition of ‘debt interest’ is too broad, and interest on financial instruments not intended to be included may be covered by the exemption.
Amendments to fix this were proposed in schedule 2 to the Tax Laws Amendment (2006 Measures No. 7) Bill 2007. The bill was referred to the Senate Economics Legislation Committee at Labor’s insistence to examine the interest withholding exemption. Labor expressed concerns that the bill created uncertainty and practical problems that could inhibit raising debt finance. The Assistant Treasurer initially stated that he would not refer the bill to the committee. But the next day the Assistant Treasurer backflipped and referred the bill to the Senate Economics Legislation Committee. Submissions to the committee demonstrated the appalling lack of consultation undertaken by the government on this measure in TLAB No. 7. As the Australian Bankers Association noted in its submission, ‘a breakdown occurred in the consultation process in relation to the IWT amendments’, and that is putting it very mildly.
The committee inquiry exposed the substandard legislation that the Assistant Treasurer had put to the parliament. The ABA’s submission stated:
... the bill will unreasonably impede access by borrowers to international debt markets ... the appropriated amendments will prejudice the ability of Australian firms to participate in the syndicated loan market.
Labor senators recommended in their additional remarks to the report on the bill:
as a minimum, the Bill be split with schedule 2 of the Bill to be considered at a later time once the legislation or once the regulations that will accompany the legislation are completed. Further, the Government should amend schedule 2 to give Treasury by regulation, the power to prescribe financial instruments which will not receive the withholding tax exemption rather than those that will.
…            …            …
Schedule 2 be dealt with before the end of the 2006-07 financial year.
Labor is certainly delighted that the Assistant Treasurer finally agreed with the Labor senators’ recommendations from the committee inquiry rather than taking on his own party’s committee members’ recommendation, which was to allow the bill through without alteration. However, I have to say, so that people understand, that in this process the government parties’ committee members I am sure would have been dutifully following the instructions of the Assistant Treasurer. But he appeared to have yet another change of thought and, having already instructed his Senate colleagues to take one line and oppose Labor’s line of recommendation, he changed his mind within 24 hours and totally abandoned his own colleagues. So Labor supports the changes proposed in this schedule to help ensure that Australian business does not face a higher cost of capital due to interest withholding tax.
Schedule 8 of the Tax Laws Amendment (2007 Measures No. 3) Bill 2007 inserts a specific deduction in the tax law to provide that initial investors in a forestry management investment scheme will receive a tax deduction for their contributions. Subsequent investors will receive a tax deduction for their ongoing contributions to forestry schemes provided that at least 70 per cent of the scheme manager’s expenditure under the scheme is direct forestry expenditure. The schedule also provides rules governing the taxation consequences of trading forest scheme interests. This schedule comes about as a result of the ATO revisiting its views on the tax deductability of investors’ contributions to forestry schemes. This bill provides a deduction under a separate statutory provision. This means that it will no longer be necessary for taxpayers to demonstrate that they are carrying on a business in order to access the statutory deduction. The specific deduction provision ensures that initial investors in forestry schemes will receive a tax deduction for their contributions and that secondary investors will receive a tax deduction for their ongoing contributions, provided that there is a reasonable expectation that at least 70 per cent of the scheme manager’s expenditure under the scheme, at arm’s-length prices, is expenditure attributable to direct forestry expenditure.
Schedule 8 of the bill also amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 and the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 to allow secondary investors to obtain deductions for ongoing contributions to forest scheme arrangements. The issue of deductability of forestry MISs has been around for some time now. It has been a matter of considerable public controversy. The 2005-06 budget announced that the government would review the taxation treatment of plantation forestry. That review has not been made public. The arrangements before us today were announced in December 2006. The government also announced in December 2006 that it would consider the issue of taxation arrangements for non-forestry MISs in the new year. In February 2007, the Assistant Treasurer announced that the government would not introduce specific deductability provisions in the tax law for non-forestry MISs as it will do for forestry MISs. The lack of consultation that went into—or, rather, did not go into—the issue of tax deductability of nonforestry is disturbing and fits a pattern of a lack of consultation and general incompetence by the Assistant Treasurer.
My colleague Senator O’Brien moved a motion in the Senate to hold an inquiry into the non-forestry MISs—a motion which the government voted down. However, Labor supports the proposal to provide a specific deduction for forestry MISs. The proposals strike a balance between ensuring that Australia has a sustainable plantation industry while addressing tax integrity issues. Labor recognises the important role that MISs provide in rural and regional areas and in the way of jobs and investment. Importantly, there are a number of downstream jobs such as those in nurseries and of irrigators, fencers et cetera that are reliant on MISs. I note that plantation forestry also plays an important role in sequestering greenhouse gases.
Schedule 9 amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 and the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to ensure that a trustee can be taxed on the net income of the trust in relation to a non-resident trustee beneficiary. This makes the tax treatment of non-resident trustees consistent with the treatment of non-resident company and individual beneficiaries. Labor supports the proposals to close this loophole.
Schedule 10 to this bill proposes to implement a new withholding regime for distribution to foreign residents of net income of managed investment trusts attributable to Australian sources either directly or through certain Australian intermediaries. Income that consists of dividends, interest or royalty outcome is generally excluded from this measure, as are capital gains on assets other than taxable Australian property. This schedule was recently discussed at length at a Senate Standing Committee on Economics inquiry into this bill. Labor proposed a flat and final withholding tax rather than a deductable headline nominal rate, the rate being 15 per cent. Labor believes that imposing a withholding tax of 30 per cent would act as a disincentive to foreign investment in Australian managed funds and Australian property trusts. All of the submissions relating to schedule 10 of the bill argued that the 30 per cent headline rate of taxation is a disincentive for foreign investors and recommended a flat and final rate of 15 per cent or less. Labor’s suggested rate of 15 per cent was based on the expert evidence of a broad range of participants in the financial services market that this rate was consistent with our main competitors for foreign investment in Asia, in centres such as Hong Kong, Singapore and Japan. The submission of the Property Council of Australia stated:
If passed, this legislation will raise significant barriers to Australia’s competitiveness as a manager of global funds. It will also be harder to build on our strengths as a regional financial hub.
Labor does not believe that the cost, estimated by Treasury, of reducing the rate to 15 per cent is accurate. The government’s claim that Labor’s proposal to halve the withholding tax on distributions to overseas residents from Australian managed funds would cost $100 million a year was not supported by evidence presented to the Senate economics committee. The $100 million costing assumed a gearing ratio for investments in Australian managed funds of zero. This contrasts with evidence given to the committee by industry experts, who advised that nearly all foreign institutions looking at investing in Australian managed funds were gearing. Although foreign investors have the option of lodging an Australian tax return and gearing their investment to lower than the 30 per cent headline rate of withholding tax, investors do not wish to engage with the complexity and compliance cost of claiming deductions.
I will be moving a second reading amendment to halve the 30 per cent withholding tax on distributions from Australian managed funds to non-resident investors. This amendment will place Australian fund managers in a much better position to compete to manage the global pool of managed funds. The 30 per cent withholding rate could hamper the potential growth of our funds industry when funds under management in Asia are expected to grow by 14 per cent per year over the medium to long term. Labor’s amendment—and this is acknowledged by industry—will build on the strength of Australia’s funds management industry to make Australia the financial hub for the Asia-Pacific region.
Amazingly, Australia has some $1 trillion in superannuation. By total volume of savings and investment in this vehicle, we are the fourth-largest funds management country in the world. I think the United States, France and Luxembourg are the only three countries that exceed Australia in total funds under management. We have total funds under management in excess of countries like Canada, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and Japan. If you look at our population and economic base compared to those countries, we are a world major league player in funds management, and Labor believes we should be doing more to encourage exports and growth in this regard, particularly into the Asian region.
I turn to the Tax Laws Amendment (Small Business) Bill 2007, which Labor supports. The bill introduces the long-awaited standard eligibility criteria that applies across the small business tax concessions announced in the 2006-07 budget. The bill also implements several other 2006-07 budget announcements relating to small business, all of which enjoy Labor’s support.
Schedule 1 provides a single definition of a small business entity for the purpose of accessing any of the small business tax concessions. The current tax laws provide for a number of small business concessions, including the simplified tax system, the goods and services tax concessions, capital gains tax concessions and fringe benefits tax concessions. Each concession has its own set of eligibility criteria with the definition of small business, which is a source of complexity and unnecessary compliance costs for small businesses. The bill proposes a new small business framework which introduces a single test about the size of the business. The test provides a single definition of turnover and the amount of turnover: $2 million. Entities that satisfy an aggregated turnover test of $2 million per annum are able to utilise the various small business concessions. Small businesses will be able to access these concessions provided they also satisfy any additional criteria that currently apply to each concession that do not relate to determining whether the taxpayer is a small business.
Schedule 7 to the bill extends the rollover relief available under the uniform capital allowance system to small business entities that choose to deduct amounts for depreciating assets under the special rules for capital allowances for small business entities—simplified tax system. This will provide more flexibility for STS taxpayers wishing to restructure their business.
Schedules 2 to 6 and 8 to this bill amend a number of acts to give effect to the 2006-07 budget announcements to increase the capital gains tax maximum net assets threshold from $5 million to $6 million, increase the simplified tax system turnover threshold from $1 million to $2 million, remove the $3 million depreciating assets test from the STS eligibility requirements and increase the goods and services tax cash accounting turnover threshold from $1 million to $2 million. The result of these amendments, together with schedule 1, is that the GST cash accounting threshold will be increased to $2 million. The bill will align the simplified tax system—STS—and GST definitions of turnover for small business.
Speaking of the GST, I note that the coalition adopted Labor’s policy to increase the GST registration turnover threshold to $75,000 for businesses. This Labor policy was announced by the Leader of the Opposition in his address to the Press Club last month and is in line with recommendation 5.38 of Rethinking regulation: report of the taskforce on reducing regulatory burdens on business. Labor welcomes the adoption by the government of Labor policy.
The bill will result in the following changes to the STS. It will increase the STS average annual turnover threshold from $1 million to $2 million, remove the $3 million depreciating assets test from the STS eligibility requirements and give STS taxpayers access to the capital gains tax small business concessions, fringe benefits tax exemption for car parking benefits and the payment of quarterly pay-as-you-go instalments on the basis of gross domestic product adjusted notional tax.
The bill will increase the maximum net asset value for accessing the small business CGT concessions from $5 million to $6 million, and STS taxpayers would have access to the small business CGT concessions. These CGT changes come in addition to the recent amendments to the CGT small business concessions to make the requirements clearer and to lower the bar to qualify for the concessions in Taxation Laws Amendment Act (No. 7). Labor is a strong supporter of such concessions for small business. The bill gives exemption to STS taxpayers’ access to the FBT car parking exemption and STS taxpayers’ access to PAYG instalments based on GDP adjusted notional tax. Labor supports these measures to assist small business. The measures reduced compliance costs and increase the availability of such tax concessions for small business.
In conclusion, I move Labor’s second reading amendment:
At the end of the motion, add:
“but the Senate condemns the Government for its lack of commitment to the Australian managed funds industry and its lack of commitment to ensure Australia becomes an Asian financial services hub and calls on the Government to reduce the withholding rate applied to non dividend, royalty and interest distributions from managed investment funds to non-residents to a flat and final rate of 15 per cent”.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (2007 MEASURES NO. 3) BILL 2007</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,32,1,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2007-06-12,"—The Tax Laws Amendment (2007 Measures No. 3) Bill 2007 brings together a diverse range of matters to amend various pieces of taxation legislation. The bill is an omnibus bill with 10 schedules. It amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936, the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997, the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986, the Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997 and the Taxation Administration Act 1953. Some brave souls periodically recommend overhauling the taxation system completely, but we always go back to piecemeal picking at the edges of the taxation system. Better than leaving well alone, I guess, simply because all is not well.
The Tax Laws Amendment (2007 Measures No. 3) Bill 2007 implements the following changes to Australia’s taxation system in 10 schedules: distributions to entities connected with a private company and related issues, a non-concessional contributions cap during the simplified superannuation transitional period, assessment of capital gains of testamentary trusts, superannuation death benefits of certain defence and police personnel, extension of the transitional period relating to the application of accounting standards under the thin capitalisation rules, repeal of dividend tainting rules, interest withholding tax exemption, investments and disposal of interests in forestry managed investment schemes, Australian trust distributions to non-resident trustees and new withholding arrangements for managed fund distributions to foreign residents.
This bill was referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Economics for report and, as usual, the government gave it a very short time frame in which to receive submissions, to hold a hearing and to prepare a report. Given the short time frame, it was not surprising that only 11 submissions were received which dealt with only a couple of the schedules. This could be evidence that all the other schedules are so wonderful that no-one has a problem with them or it could be evidence that people and organisations very pressed for time and resources were unable to make submissions on time. Be that as it may, and we are unfortunately getting used to these hurried committee timetables, I can only comment on the evidence before me.
I would like to say how grateful I was for the expedition of Hansard in providing us with a record of the hearing. It was in my email inbox by Friday afternoon following a Friday morning hearing. Also the secretariat has to be commended for the swift turnaround of the Senate economics committee draft report. It at least gave those of us interested in writing a minority report time to consider the matter. The chair of the committee is to be thanked for his quick work in clearing his draft. His consideration of other committee members is a welcome change. There was robust debate during the hearings but the chair was courteous, fair and helpful.
Although there are 10 schedules to this bill, I am only going to deal with those which were subject to the committee hearings—in particular, schedule 10, which was the most contentious. I do want to briefly remark on schedule 7, which had been contentious, and the shadow minister has covered his summary of the events which led to schedule 7.
Schedule 7 to this Bill amends sections 128F and 128FA of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (ITAA 1936) to more closely specify those debt interests that are eligible for exemption from interest withholding tax (IWT) ...
These amendments correct an unintended broadening of the exemption that occurred following the New International Tax Arrangements (Managed Fund and Other Measures) Act 2005 (2005 amendments). Closer specification of the range of debt interests eligible for the exemption realigns the exemption to the Government’s policy intent and enhances the integrity of the tax system.
The amendments specify that non-debenture debt interests that are non-equity shares (including those subject to the related scheme rules in Division 974 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 (ITAA 1997)) and syndicated loans are eligible for exemption from IWT. They also introduce a regulation-making power to prescribe further types of eligible debt interests.
Those listening in the Treasury benches will recognise that as a quote from the explanatory memorandum and my compliments to the Treasury officials concerned for correcting that schedule and enabling us all to support it.
According to the explanatory memorandum, schedule 10 amendments are intended to improve the efficiency of the managed funds industry in respect of the collection of tax from distributions to foreign residents. As noted in the committee report, of the 11 submissions that were received, six commented on schedule 10 and they all made the same or a similar point: while the new withholding tax regime was a great improvement, the 30 per cent withholding tax rate proposed in the bill was too high and made Australia uncompetitive internationally. The main contention from those making submissions was that many countries in our region and outside our region only attract a 15 per cent tax rate or less. The committee’s evidence from written submissions and the public hearing supports Labor’s policy of having a flat and final withholding tax rather than a deductible headline nominal rate, and the rate for the withholding tax itself being 15 per cent. The ALP believes that imposing a withholding tax of 30 per cent would act as a disincentive to foreign investment in Australian managed funds and Australian property trusts. I think they are right.
There is no doubt, and this was acknowledged by those giving evidence, that there remains a way to structure the investments so that what is perceived as a high rate is not paid at the end of the day. The committee heard evidence that large institutions and entities—not smaller ones because they do not have the resources—can do just that. That in itself is discriminatory. The evidence was that they can structure the investment through different vehicles and claim deductions to ensure that they are paying, in some cases, no more than a final rate of 12½ per cent. The Treasury indicated that not many do that, from which I conclude that most would rather pay up than go to the trouble and cost of structuring, gearing and putting in annual tax returns and getting their money in a year to 18 months later. It is all too complex, costly and hard. Or they can take their money elsewhere, which is a real and growing option in this fast moving dynamic capital market, especially when our headline rate of 30 per cent stands out as uncompetitive. I take issue with the shadow minister’s remark that in this regard he was in fact referring to Australia’s strength in this area historically. The indications are that the prospect of that strength is unlikely to be maintained unless we adjust the rate.
Mr Speed, chairman of the Speed and Stracey legal firm, criticised the bill not only for the 30 per cent rate but also for the fact that it was a headline rate of tax rather than a final and flat withholding tax rate. He said that when he was on the phone to overseas investors and told them the rate of tax was 30 per cent, the phone metaphorically went dead. He intimated that it stopped people in their tracks and that often overseas investors would then look to similar investment in other countries where the rate was lower. The committee heard that, on the whole, overseas investors are not persuaded to structure their companies differently for a tax benefit in Australia when they can pick up the phone and do a deal with Singapore without going through the hoops of setting up different corporate structures and where they do not have to lodge tax returns to claim back tax paid. If there was a choice of going somewhere where the fixed and final rate was lower and you did not need to jump through administrative hoops and have a year or more delay in getting money issues resolved, I do not know many market participants who would not say, ‘Let’s go with the lower tax rate and the easiest structure.’
The witnesses at the table brought up the point that Australia is currently well regarded in this market. They also said that Australia has the potential to become a financial hub for this style of investment, if the rate is right. But the reality is that countries in our region, like Singapore and Japan, are just as stable as Australia in these terms. They have lower rates and will attract overseas investment at the expense of Australia unless we adjust our regime.
I recognise that the Treasury have said that the market has grown very well over the last couple of years, and they are accurate in saying so. They also said that Australia has done well, and they are accurate in saying that too. But that is in the past; the market is moving on and Australia should continue to move with it. The evidence is that in this bill the Treasury have done a good job of simplifying and streamlining the taxation regime in this area, and they were rightly complimented on that fact.
But, most of all, the rate will determine investment. If we wait—as was suggested in the majority report—and just keep an eye on how things are developing, then there is a chance that we will be left behind. Getting tax relief for investors from particular countries as a result of new double taxation treaties is a very slow process. We all know how long it takes to negotiate a double tax treaty, as was recommended by the majority report. Once the terms of the treaty have been finalised and it has been ratified, there has to be legislation drafted to incorporate the treaty into Australian law. That legislation must then pass through parliament. That is too slow and bureaucratic for a fast-moving capital market. It is too slow, and more agile neighbours will react to the marketplace realities.
I support Labor’s recommendations, firstly, that the rate should be a flat and final rate so that investors do not face the complexity and cost of structuring and gearing and also do not have to wait years while tax returns are processed and, secondly, that the rate should be 15 per cent—which is at the upper end of rates—so that Australia remains competitive in this area of investment. If the government were not willing to accept the 15 per cent rate, then I think they at least should consider a flat and final rate based on the effective tax rate, which they know—or at least have a feeling as to what it is. Of course, we do not have a feeling as to what it is because we were not given the figures.
I now have a few remarks to make on the other schedules. These were either discussed by the committee or submissions were received on them. Schedule 8 streamlines the taxation for forestry managed investment schemes in the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997. It entitles investors to immediate up-front tax deductibility for all expenditure. As the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer has stated, these proposed arrangements will provide greater certainty for investors in forestry, will see the continued expansion of Australia’s plantation estates and will reduce reliance on both native forests and overseas imports. However, as I have said before—and it bears repeating—the policy principle behind the streamlining of these investment incentives should be rational and transparent.
Are these investment incentives—these tax concessions—good for both economic and environmental reasons? Personally I am not so sure. Why do some trees and not others qualify for a tax concession? Why eucalypts but not walnuts? Why pines but not olives? If the Prime Minister wanted to prove his green credentials then maybe investment in all trees, and not simply managed investment forestry schemes, should be supported with taxation concessions. If he wants to prove his economic credentials then maybe investment in all trees, and not simply managed investment forestry schemes, should be supported with taxation concessions.
I have argued in the past that from an economic perspective tax concessions are only appropriate for infant industries that we wish to encourage. They should be time limited unless the industry is of national strategic significance. On environmental grounds, it is possible to argue that forestry is of national significance now. Even the tired, sceptical, climate-warming deniers that constitute some members of our federal government accept that trees are an intrinsic good in this respect. So why not include all trees that are commercially viable? Why just include forestry plantations? If a farmer invests a large amount in planting trees to combat salinity on his property in southern Western Australia, does it not make sense that these tax concessions should be extended to that farmer?
There was only one submission to the committee regarding this schedule. It was a joint submission from the National Association of Forest Industries, Tree Plantations Australia, Treefarm Investment Managers Australia, and the Australian Plantation Products and Paper Industry Council. Needless to say, these entities supported the legislation as it resolved ‘10 years of instability and uncertainty about the future ongoing taxation arrangements for retail forestry’. That, of course, is a virtue of the legislation: it does indeed get rid of the uncertainty which has dogged the industry.
I note that there were no submissions from environmental groups or non-profit sustainability groups or farming groups—not, I guess, because they have nothing to say on the issue but because this committee process was rushed. So the government gets a cheer from those involved in forestry managed investment schemes but it leaves unanswered the questions that I have asked.
As everyone in the Senate knows, I am all for consistency in tax matters. That is why schedule 4 has me puzzled. The schedule applies to police officers and members of the defence forces who die in the line of duty. As was pointed out by the United Firefighters Union of Australia in its submission, firefighters are not included in the categories of persons who can take advantage of this benefit. Yet many would say that they have put their lives on the line in similar ways to defence personnel and police officers, when they are faced with danger. Many emergency workers—paid and voluntary—are at risk at their work. Ambulance drivers are unfortunately often attacked when they attend at nightclub brawls or domestic disputes. All of these people should surely be afforded similar treatment to that given to police officers and defence personnel if the tax concession were to be granted because people may be harmed or die in the line of duty. Perhaps police officers and defence personnel are being given this preferential treatment because they are deployed overseas. But Australian firefighters regularly assist overseas, as do aid workers and many others. There have been some very unfortunate instances of overseas aid workers being killed in the line of duty, and yet they will not get this particular concession. It is totally unclear.
I think that proper and thorough consideration should have been given to this matter and consistency of tax policy applied. There is no evidence that I could see in the explanatory memorandum to satisfactorily explain the reasoning behind this amendment and why it was limited to defence personnel and police officers. All that Treasury said to the hearing was that it was a policy matter on which they could not comment. To put it another way, they were just following orders.
In conclusion, as you know, Madam Deputy President Kirk, this is a cognate debate, with the Tax Laws Amendment (Small Business) Bill 2007 to be considered. I wish to make some remarks and to ask a question on that bill, so I would seek to ensure that there will be a committee stage following the second reading debate. I hope you will ensure that that occurs.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (2007 MEASURES NO. 3) BILL 2007</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,32,1,speech
"Watson, Sen John",LP,2007-06-12,"—The Tax Laws Amendment (2007 Measures No. 3) Bill 2007 is an omnibus bill dealing with 10 issues. However, given the limited time of this debate, I have only the time to discuss three matters about which I have had a close, continuing interest. The first is an amendment to the anti-avoidance measures under division 7A of the Income Tax Assessment Act, an amendment which overcomes some quite punitive provisions which date from 1996. It is indeed very pleasing that the government has recognised the problems faced by a lot of small businesses in often unavoidable situations where there may have been an honest mistake but at the same time with no loss to the revenue, no mischief and no benefit to an individual or to a group of individuals, who were, however, severely penalised.
I therefore wish to take this opportunity, Minister at the table, to express my thanks to the Treasurer, the Treasury, the tax commissioner and the government, because I have been working to rectify these problems for perhaps to 12 to 18 months. The overriding problem with division 7A was often referred to in the profession as the ‘drop dead’ provisions, because there was no commissioner discretion. Therefore, the retrospective amendments dating to 2001-02 are indeed good for many people. In the main, the changes take effect from 1 July 2006. However, the commissioner’s discretion is retrospective and can be utilised in respect of 2001-02 and later years. The fringe benefits tax amendments are from 1 April 2007. The retrospective nature of the amendments is indeed unusual but gratefully received.
Difficulties and issues surrounding division 7A have been numerous, with many accountants facing litigation from their clients arising from the 1996 legislation. Allow me the opportunity of explaining some of those difficulties that previously faced the profession and why they were so keen to get these amendments through. One example is the automatic debiting of a company’s franking credit account where a deemed dividend arises under division 7A. The amendments we are debating today now provide the Commissioner of Taxation with the discretion of disregarding the deemed dividend that has arisen in circumstances of an honest mistake or omission by a taxpayer, providing a greater flexibility in the administration of the process.
Innocent transgressions also often involved intragroup transfers or transactions where there was no economic benefit to the shareholders or associated persons, such as a country bookkeeper drawing from a wrong account or drawing a cheque on advice from a banker to purchase a tractor from what may have been deemed the incorrect account. Quite often such transactions were not detected until the books went to a more sophisticated tax accountant after the year of income when preparing the annual return. There were problems of refinancing shareholders through paying a deemed dividend. For example, a loan from a solicitor being refinanced by a bank could have got caught. In addition, certain shareholder loans could be refinanced without triggering the deemed dividend.
The drafters of the legislation therefore had to navigate some very difficult legal precedents. For example, loans made by private companies to shareholders or associated were caught by division 7A if that loan was not repaid before 30 June of the relevant year or was not the subject of a complying loan agreement entered into before the loan was made. A general principle of taxation is that only economic gains are taxed. However, division 7A imposed the harshest possible tax impact on transactions that had no long-term economic impact—for example, a loan made from a private company to another related entity in June 2003 and repaid in July 2003 in the absence, for example, of a recent loan agreement would suffer an income tax of effectively 48.5 per cent plus a loss of franking credits, which carries a further tax penalty.
An identical transaction undertaken in June 2005, ironically, would have attracted no such tax. Hence the importance of this amendment. Taxpayers without the slightest intention of obtaining a taxation advantage were being levied with substantial taxation imposts without the opportunity or mechanism to undo or correct their situation. Division 7A’s original intent was to ensure that private companies would no longer be able to make tax-free distributions of profits to shareholders in the form of repayment of loans. While this intent was understood and respected, the legislation was interpreted, unfortunately, far wider than its original intent. Here is a warning for future tax legislation.
The second measure that I wish to address tonight in this omnibus bill includes the requirement that investors in forestry plantation schemes meet a 70 per cent direct forestry expenditure test—an initiative strongly supported by the forestry industry, which I am a little bit surprised about. The 70 per cent test will have to be read in relation to a number of other measures, some of which are included in the bill.
There is also another piece of legislation which I refer to as the ‘tax promoters legislation’ that one has to be careful of in navigating this scenario. The schedule also provides for the establishment of a secondary market, which I believe will give original investors the opportunity of selling before harvesting, providing the investment was for at least four years. This measure, I believe, will add a new level of transparency that will ensure costs are contained rather than inflated, which is an important part of this test.
I believe the forestry plantation arrangements that seek to make use of the 70 per cent direct forest expenditure fundraising mechanism—and the emphasis is on ‘direct’—should only be used by those corporations with long experience in forestry and staffed by people with great qualifications, including actuarial qualifications. I issue this warning because I can see many potholes along the life of a project, starting from the initial investment to the harvesting of the plantation, its marketing and final distribution.
Honourable senators would be aware of the 1964 precedent in the Cecil Brothers High Court decision that was decided against the Australian Taxation Office by denying the office the right to substitute a different price to the one actually charged. Cecil Brothers was a shoe retailer which purchased certain stock from a related company at a price higher than the market price charged by the usual suppliers. Legislation therefore had to overcome the possibility of a like situation in the forestry industry, whereby, for example, a box of seedlings that cost $3 by one arm of the promoting company could be sold to another within the corporate structure for a price of $25, or the employment of contractors by an associate company and charged back to the forestry operation at a price grossly exceeding the market price—a mechanism to inflate the value of direct forest expenditure. How did the drafters overcome that? They inserted what was known as an arms-length market price test to overcome the precedent in the Cecil Brothers case.
I believe that the 70 per cent direct forest expenditure is available only for forestry plantations where it is for the long term, for experienced operators and, I also add, the brave. Records have to be kept for the life of the plan plus five years. The problems will occur when the forest company falls short of an ATO audit in four or five years time. Not only do all of the forest corporations incur severe penalties should they breach the 70 per cent test, but the investors will have the indignity of their tax returns being amended by denying the initial deduction for the investment. The mind boggles, Senator Brandis, the minister at the table, at the potential legal ramification for such an event. I ask honourable senators to remember that we are dealing with projected future costs with a seven- or 12-year life, and these costs must be discounted to present values and the records have to be kept for the life of the plan.
Discounting recognises that a dollar today is not the same as a dollar in the future because, even in the absence of inflation, today’s dollar can be invested. Not only does the plantation company have to work out very carefully its direct—not its overhead, not its indirect, but its direct—forestry expenditure, but there are a number of what I call contestable fringe costs that may be subject to challenge in an audit. The company must be familiar with this counter cash flow technique, thus the potential for error could be high for those who are not prepared, those who do not fully understand the costs and ramifications of legislation. Otherwise, they may fall below the 70 per cent limit with all of the dire consequences that I referred to. So I also issue a caution to financial planners therefore to treat such projects with high caution as they may also get caught up in the future legal consequences or ramifications.
I wish to spend the remainder of my available time addressing scheduled 10 of the bill, which concerns the new withholding arrangements for managed fund distributions for foreign residents. The legislation effectively puts into legislative form the Australian tax office’s administrative arrangements, which currently carry different rates from 29 per cent to 47.5 per cent. For example, there is a 30 per cent corporate rate, an individual 29 per cent rate and a 47.5 per cent superannuation noncomplying rate. The measure before us tonight removes the uncertainty and reduces the compliance burden by having to address different types of income and different types of recipients of that income. To put it quite simply: this measure does provide for a high degree of certainty.
Currently, managed investment trusts and their intermediaries have to clarify the nature of the foreign investor as an individual, a company, a trustee or a foreign superannuation fund. So the focus on these amendments is on the foreign residents with Australian sourced income. The Australian sourced income comprises rents, capital gains and some foreign exchange gains, but not interest or dividends because these classes of income are already subject to a separate withholding rule. So trustees will withhold a common 30 per cent from all distributions to foreign residents. However, this is the nub that the Labor Party have not realised: these foreign investors do have the opportunity of lodging an Australian tax return to get a credit for the 30 per cent tax against their tax liability of their net income—that is, the distribution less deductions such as sums borrowed to invest in the property trust. This is in contrast to the ALP’s proposed amendment as a 15 per cent final tax without deductions.
The proposal for a 15 per cent withholding tax has the effect of creating a tax concession to a group of people but which are not available to those who make direct investments. So it is the same income, but if it is made by a person who makes a direct investment they do not get this final 15 per cent. So you have got a situation where there is a breach of a principle of taxation—that is, that taxpayers on the same incomes from the same source should pay the same tax. The ALP amendment does not achieve this outcome. You have got that disparity. We have got enough of these problems that we are trying to correct, and yet the Labor Party wants to perpetuate these sorts of problems. So if a tax rate does result in a greater foreign investment, I believe this is likely to flow to an already mature Australian property market. These are the consequences.
This may have the effect of creating Australian investors out of the Australian property market. Therefore, the ALP’s property owners proposal has potential to further overheat the Australian property market at this time at the expense of ordinary Australian investments and, indirectly—here is the problem—to ordinary homeowners by jacking up the price. Originally, I had some sympathy with a 15 per cent rate. It has simplicity, and this would have had the effect of matching Australia’s withholding tax rate with those of a number of other countries. On the other hand, it would have created an environment of income being taxed differently to direct investment, and I think that is indeed unfortunate. We also have to consider the affordability issue for Australian investors and individuals, because the crowding effect would assist foreign investors to the detriment of Australians.
Questions have been asked about the competitiveness of the Australian property trusts industry. It is one of the most sophisticated in the world and has done very well and is very well managed. But headline rates do not seem to have affected the growth in the Australian listed public trust in recent years. Nor do I believe this legislation will make any change. Evidence suggests that, in recent years, these foreign resident investors in Australian property trusts, which are known in the industry as REITs, have not lodged many tax returns, as they are entitled to do, despite Australia property income having been taxed by withholding the corporate rate of 30 per cent. So the sky is not going to fall in as a result not passing the Labor Party amendments.
The Australian property trust industry is, I believe, one of the world’s largest property trust markets, representing something like 15 per cent of global real estate property trust market capitalisation, and there has been no evidence of a flight in capital, and nor do I believe there will be as a result of this legislation. I know the financial services industry has lobbied strongly in support of the Labor Party amendment, but I have to point out that the industry is a very sophisticated one. It has a very good growth record; it has strong management and strong leadership; and it puts Australia at the forefront in financial services and contributes to Australia being a regional financial centre, particularly in this part of this world and in this time zone, which includes countries like Singapore, Hong Kong and Japan.
In fact, in 2005, 70 per cent of all funds raised were invested offshore and foreign investment in property trusts has also increased to about 15 per cent of the total equity in property trusts—a very good and commendable record. It also must be remembered—and this is the important point—that Australia does not tax the foreign income, only the income derived by the trust in Australia, which is merely a portion of the total. Therefore, this measure is only concerned with Australian sourced income paid to foreign residents. That is the limitation of the bill before us. For example—and I think this will clarify the position—if an Australian property trust invests in both Australian property and New Zealand property and distributes the income to a UK investor, there is no tax on the income from the New Zealand property because Australia only taxes foreign residents on the Australian sourced income.
The government decided not to support the Labor Party amendment to introduce a final flat rate of tax on non-royalty, non-dividend, non-interest overseas payments—I gave the list earlier—because the government regarded this as a measure to protect the revenue. Everybody wants tax concessions for some group or other, but there has to be a limit and a degree of responsibility in managing the budget, and that is why the Howard-Costello team has been so successful in leading Australia through some fairly difficult decisions to the prosperity we now enjoy. The government’s first responsibility is to protect the revenue—and Labor’s amendment would have cost a lot of revenue.
My final comment is associated with accessing financial advice. I support the government’s measure to assist investors to get access to appropriate financial advice—and some very good measures are included in the bill. But there is still some way to go. For example, for some time I have supported the notion of an up-front deduction for fees paid to a financial planner for financial advice. But the irony of the situation is that, while these up-front amounts paid to a financial planner for investment advice are not tax deductible, the trail commissions, many of which not only apply to the initial investment but can trail on for years and years, are tax deductible. So again you have this unequal playing field. I have spent a lot of my time in tax over many years in trying to make sure that we have tax equity. I think this is one area where we can not only create tax equity but help to encourage the concept of paying up-front fees rather than trail commissions, which I know some members of the superannuation committee had some problems with some years ago. I commend the bill to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (2007 MEASURES NO. 3) BILL 2007</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,32,1,speech
"Hurley, Sen Annette",ALP,2007-06-12,"—As outlined by Senator Sherry, the Labor Party supports most of the measures in the Tax Laws Amendment (2007 Measures No. 3) Bill 2007. Schedule 10 deals with taxation of managed investment trusts, and most public comment has been received in that area. For my part, I want to deal exclusively with this area of the bill.
Managed investment trusts as discussed in this bill are funds that are held by an Australian entity and managed by trustees. Most are unit trusts that distribute their income fully and have investments across a wide range of assets such as property, shares and bonds. The funds affected by schedule 10 of this bill are largely listed property funds or real estate investment trusts. The Australian funds are now generally sophisticated and competitive and have attracted offshore investors. These investors are varied but include institutions such as large pension funds and other funds managers.
Until recently, these trusts have largely grown by investing in Australian assets and harnessing Australian funds. Their success attracted overseas investors, but now there is competition from other managed investment trusts in other parts of the world such as Hong Kong and Japan. This is where I would differ from Senator Watson, who says that the market has been very successful in Australia and therefore investors will not be deterred from investing in Australian funds. Other countries have now seen the value and importance of these funds and are doing their best to take over Australia’s share in these kinds of managed investment trusts.
Labor’s view is that the Australian financial sector should be encouraged and that Australia could and should be a financial hub in the Asia-Pacific area. We have the talent, innovation and expertise to make that happen. This is a view shared by the industry, and there is ample room for improvement in the services sector. Australia’s services contribute over 70 per cent of GDP. The contribution to export, on the other hand, is difficult to determine but is around 20 per cent. So there is a great disparity here. With the fast-growing Asian economies, demand over the next decade or so should be strong, and Australia is well placed to provide the high-quality service that these countries require. The growth of the financial services sector in Australia has been exponential in the last 20 years or so. This, of course, was largely to do with the opening up of the financial sector and the financial markets in the 1980s by Treasurer and then Prime Minister Paul Keating. The financial sector now contributes 7.2 per cent, or $68 billion, of GDP.
Initiatives in superannuation—the super guarantee put in place by Mr Keating—have also ensured a strong flow of capital into funds in Australia. This is one policy that Mr Keating—unfortunately, in my view—did not address in his Lateline interview last Friday night when discussing his time as Treasurer and Prime Minister. I believe that this policy and its flow-on effects resulted in a major benefit to Australia’s economic future and to the wellbeing of its citizens, and this will continue for many decades to come. Australia is, therefore, very well poised to be a major financial services provider.
We are now riding well in current economic terms but there will come a time when the terms of trade will decline and we will look to other sectors to cover the reduction in export income from the mining sector. How long have we in this country talked about the need to get away from exporting primary industries? The progress has been slow but we certainly need to put in place now, when the economy is booming from the benefits of the resources industry, the building blocks that will take us through to an equally prosperous future. Continued growth in the financial services sector presents an opportunity for Australia—like the UK, the US, Singapore and Ireland—to deliver substantial gains in economic activity from this area. It will not be easy, of course, because Australia, as I have said, faces strong competition from other aspirants in the region—Japan, Singapore and Hong Kong.
Having expressed its strong support for the financial services sector, the Labor Party announced its policy on taxation of managed investment trusts. Labor’s taxation policy is framed to ensure that Australia will not be competitively disadvantaged compared with other countries that are becoming active in this market. Schedule 10 of the bill represents a measure that will have an important effect on the financial services sector and managed investment trusts in particular. Labor supports the broad change proposed—that is, the introduction of a withholding tax. Previous arrangements meant that foreign investors had to lodge Australian tax returns and pay tax at a variable rate, depending on their investments, of between 29 and 45 per cent. This made the taxation regime difficult and complex. The fact that the investors were based in foreign jurisdictions and sometimes acted through intermediaries meant that compliance was also very difficult.
Payment of a flat withholding tax by the managed trust will simplify and streamline taxation arrangements. Where Labor differs is in the rate at which the withholding tax is set. The Tax Laws Amendment (2007 Measures No. 3) Bill 2007 proposes a 30 per cent tax rate. From evidence given to the Senate Standing Committee on Economics inquiry into this bill, it was clear that the government expects that this is not going to be the effective rate in the end, for two reasons: firstly, that as time goes on reciprocal tax treaties will ensure that this rate is reduced; and, secondly, foreign investors will be able to gear their investments so as to claim deductions and reduce their tax rate.
Most Australians are familiar with the negative gearing allowed for housing where an investor buys a house other than his own home, rents it out and is then allowed to claim the interest as a tax deduction. The same principle applies to foreign investors in Australian real estate trusts. They often deal in large sums like $100 million rather than the couple of hundred thousand dollars that individual investors deal in, but the principle is the same. Those involved in managed trusts indicate that most foreign investors in trusts use this method of getting their effective taxation rate down to 15 per cent or less. Labor says that, if this is the effective rate, why not acknowledge this fact and make the withholding tax a flat and final 15 per cent without any deductions? This would further clarify, simplify and streamline investments in these trusts. Furthermore, it would put Australia in line with its major competitors in this market.
The 30 per cent headline rate of taxation is a disincentive for foreign investors, and it is recommended that the flat and final rate be 15 per cent or less. This is consistent with areas such as Hong Kong, Singapore and Japan, which, at this time, have much lower rates than that. In practice, the need to gear, which I have described, is a disincentive for foreign investors to invest in the Australian market. Mr Robin Speed, a lawyer, explained this to the economics committee. He said:
So, as soon as you say, ‘You’re going to be hit with a 30 per cent withholding tax,’ they say, ‘Gee, that’s a major problem for us. If it was 10 per cent, like Singapore, we can live with it, but we can’t live with 30 per cent.’
…            …            …
As soon as they are faced with a 30 per cent withholding tax, they will not lodge an Australian tax return. You just do not do that ... The great bulk of people out there simply do not do that and simply tune out.
Investors prefer to pay a final tax rate, as they do in other countries. They invest much larger sums in other countries where they do not have to structure their affairs; therefore, they are reluctant to gear the relatively small sums they might invest in the Australian real estate market because it costs money to set up the structure and to claim the gearing that is required. Industry representatives at the committee all argued that the combination of the high headline rate, the absence of a final rate and the perceived administrative difficulties with gearing were enough to cause potential foreign investors in Australia to look elsewhere.
I want to talk briefly about the government’s costing of Labor’s proposal to reduce the rate to 15 per cent. That costing has no credibility attached to it as the Treasury rate for overseas investment in trust does not assume any gearing. We know, from evidence to the committee, that most foreign investors do gear. If they want to claim the interest deduction and get their tax rate down to the return that the government is talking about through gearing, they have to gear. Yet Treasury does not allow any costing for that in its estimates.
—Because very few people put in a tax return.
—Very few people put in a tax return because it is complex and they avoid it, and they will avoid it in future. That is precisely the point that the Labor Party is making—that you are turning off foreign investors by making it too difficult. The 30 per cent withholding rate is one step in advance, but we want two steps in advance to take it to a flat and final rate of taxation which will make us competitive with others in our area. It is a very simple premise and one which should not be too difficult for the government to grasp.
Senator Watson talked about protecting revenue. I think it was pretty much conclusively proven, although Treasury was unable to give us decent figures on this—unable or unwilling, I am not sure which—that the revenue would not be as dramatically affected as the Treasury described, because they do not take into account any gearing. So we know that their figures have to be wrong.
There was also talk about Australian investment in domestic assets now being fairly mature and that many of the funds are now investing offshore, which, of course, is not subject to taxation. But the question is: do we want to put any kind of cap on investment in Australian assets? The answer surely has to be ‘no’. Surely we have to give investors the kind of flexibility they choose and we have to allow the flexibility for capital funds to flow into the Australian investment market. Foreign capital coming in to support our assets and our investments is something that we in Australia have always relied on since we began as a colony.
The critically important fact is that, given the complexity and the compliance costs of the government’s proposed tax regime, Labor counteracts that with a proposal to abolish the need for overseas investors to pay withholding tax or to lodge a tax return and claim debt as a deduction by making the flat tax a final rate. This flat and final rate will remove a significant burden that is threatening to hold back Australia’s funds management industry from capitalising on the growth of funds under management in the region. Australia’s fund management industry is well regarded across the globe and is well placed geographically to become a financial hub for the Asia-Pacific region. A 30 per cent withholding rate could hamper the potential growth of our funds industry and I strongly support the Labor amendment on the issue.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (2007 MEASURES NO. 3) BILL 2007</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,32,1,speech
"Chapman, Sen Grant",LP,2007-06-12,"—This evening in this cognate debate I particularly want to support the Tax Laws Amendment (Small Business) Bill 2007. The main objective of the bill is to make it simpler for small business to determine eligibility for small business tax concessions.
In October 2005 the Prime Minister and the Treasurer announced the appointment of a task force to identify practical options for alleviating the compliance burden on business from Commonwealth government regulation. The task force was to examine ‘those areas in which regulation should be removed or significantly reduced as a matter of priority’. On 7 April last year the task force released its report, and recommendation 5.43 stated:
The Australian Government should take steps to align and/or rationalise different definitions in the tax law including ‘small business’, ‘employee’, ‘salary and wages’ and ‘associate’.
The government’s response agreed in principle with this recommendation.  It noted that the 2006 federal budget increased various thresholds applying to small business tax obligations. On the recommendation of the Selection of Bills Committee, the Senate referred this bill to the Standing Committee on Economics, of which I am a member, for inquiry and report by 6 June this year. Our committee received a submission from the Small Business Development Corporation and I thank the corporation for its input and the committee secretariat for its work in relation to our inquiry on this very important legislation.
In the last decade the Howard government has recognised and supported small business very strongly.  Australia’s small businesses are vital to our economy, accounting for 58 per cent of employment growth over the last six years.  There are more than 1.2 million small businesses in Australia and they employ 3.3 million people. Over the past decade the number of small businesses has grown 3.5 per cent each year on average. This sector generates 30 per cent of our economic production. Forty per cent of all Australian small businesses are in regional areas. That is a very important aspect of small business.
The changes in this bill, together with the new small business entity framework, significantly increase the ability of small businesses in my home state of South Australia to gain access to various small business concessions and to reduce compliance costs, which is a major factor for businesses wishing to access these concessions. While large employers, big businesses, frequently get the majority of media headlines, in reality it is the small business sector which forms the backbone of South Australia’s economy. The mining boom is creating wealth, but small business is the driving force in many regional communities across my home state. Small businesses which employ fewer than 20 people make up more than 96 per cent of South Australian firms and employ 235,000 people—more than half of our state’s workforce. Many of South Australia’s 80,000 small businesses also have growth potential.  The changes that this bill brings about will further increase the size and efficiency of the small business sector in South Australia.
These changes will reduce the compliance costs for many Australian small businesses. They will substantially simplify the tax law to make it easier for small businesses to determine eligibility for a number of concessions, and they are part of this government’s 2006-07 budget announcements.
This bill introduces a standard eligibility criterion that applies across the small business tax concessions. Entities that satisfy an aggregated turnover test of $2 million per annum are able to utilise those concessions that meet their business needs—if they also satisfy any additional conditions, not related to the business size, that currently apply to those particular concessions.
This bill also implements several 2006-07 budget announcements: the increase in the capital gains tax maximum net assets threshold from $5 million to $6 million, the extension of the rollover relief available under the uniform capital allowance system to small business entities, an increase in the simplified tax system—STS—turnover threshold from $1 million to $2 million, the removal of the $3 million depreciating assets test from the STS eligibility requirements, and an increase in the goods and services tax cash accounting turnover threshold from $1 million to $2 million.
The current tax laws contain a number of special arrangements for smaller businesses, defined in a number of ways. In the past, there have been different threshold criteria for determining what is a small business for particular concessions. The differences, albeit sensible when considered individually, have been a source of complexity and unnecessary compliance costs for small businesses. This bill amends the income tax law to create a single definition of ‘small business’, based on aggregated annual turnover of less than $2 million. Entities that do not meet the small business entity definition can still test their eligibility for small business concessions according to existing methods for capital gains tax, fringe benefits tax and pay-as-you-go instalments.
The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry has welcomed the changes, as has the Council of Small Business Organisations of Australia, as the new definition replaces a set of complex and hard to understand rules, with each tax having a different test for small business. I have read out the tests; there was a multiplicity of less than $1 million through to $10 million under the previous regime. They are now all consistent. The Institute of Chartered Accountants, which recently published its own research on the small business definition in tax law, has welcomed the change. The institute has said that these changes would improve access to tax concessions and reduce compliance costs, which will also have flow-on benefits to business.
The new definitions build a strong platform of tax initiatives that this government has delivered for small business. This strong platform includes the entrepreneurs tax discount, which is delivering $1.2 billion in tax cuts for more than 500,000 small businesses, enabling them to reinvest in their business or take a well-earned dividend. The government also has directed the Board of Taxation to inquire into where small business compliance costs can be further cut. So the government is on the job—moving ahead, changing tax law, simplifying the process and requiring the Board of Taxation to make further inquiries where further improvements can be achieved. The board is a consultative board—it is not owned by the Commissioner of Taxation—and it is comprised of people who have a knowledge of small business and can assess whether the changes are beneficial.
There are currently separate eligibility tests for the goods and services tax, the simplified tax system, the capital gains tax, the fringe benefits tax, pay-as-you-go tax instalments and small business concessions. This bill is about making things easier for small businesses in Australia by getting rid of those separate eligibility tests. The bill will standardise the eligibility criteria for small business tax concessions from 1 July this year. It will create just one eligibility test to obtain a range of small business concessions. Any business—subject to satisfying existing eligibility criteria not related to business size—with an aggregated annual turnover of less than $2 million will be eligible. The bill will allow small businesses to choose the concessions that meet their business needs. Businesses will not be obliged to adopt any concessions not suited to their particular requirements.
The concessions include a 15-year asset exemption from capital gains tax, a 50 per cent active asset reduction of capital gains tax, a retirement exemption from capital gains tax, rollover provisions for capital gains tax, simpler depreciation rules and trading stock rules, immediate deductions for certain prepaid business expenses, the choice to account for goods and services tax on a cash basis, and the choice to pay GST by instalments. The concession is also an annual apportionment of input tax credits for acquisitions and importations that are partly creditable. The bill provides for a car-parking exemption from fringe benefits tax, and pay-as-you-go instalments based on notional tax. There will be a two-year amendment period for the implementation of this bill.
The bill includes other elements. The existing eligibility thresholds for accessing capital gains tax, fringe benefits tax and pay-as-you-go instalment concessions will be retained. As I mentioned earlier, the bill will increase the maximum net asset value test for accessing capital gains tax concessions from $5 million to $6 million. And it will extend the rollover relief available under the uniform capital allowance regime to any business with a turnover of less than $2 million that chooses to deduct amounts for depreciating assets. So the bill makes a number of concessions for small business. It demonstrates the government’s continued commitment to reducing red tape and compliance costs for small businesses.
Small business brings great benefits to Australia. Businesses with fewer than 20 employees is the usual definition for ‘small business’, and there are approximately 1,888,000 small businesses in Australia. Ninety-six per cent of all businesses are small businesses with fewer than 20 employees. It is estimated that 39 per cent of Australia’s economic production is generated by the small business sector. Small businesses provide employment for some 3.7 million people—that is, almost half of all private sector employment is in small businesses. Those figures exclude small business employees in the finance and insurance industries, of which there are also large numbers. The growth in small business was approximately 25,700 in 2005-06, so small business is, indeed, on the march.
Since June 2003 the number of employing small businesses has grown by 31.7 per cent. Small business exits are not necessarily due to bankruptcies or problems; a huge number are for positive reasons, and possibly only 2.5 per cent exit due to lack of financial success. This is an excellent result and of course reflects the strong economy resulting from the Howard government’s sound economic management. Small business, as a result of our strong economy and its own initiative, is growing fast, having great success, employing about half of our population and having a positive result on the economy. Interestingly, 96 per cent per cent of small business owners have a computer and 90 per cent are connected to the internet. So there is a high degree of dependence on technology in small business today.
I referred earlier to the economics committee’s examination of this legislation. We received a submission from the Small Business Development Corporation, an independent statutory authority established to assist small businesses in Western Australia. This corporation supported the bill and noted that the single definition of small businesses is consistent with its recommendation to the Commonwealth regulation task force in November 2005. The corporation argued in its submission:
... the proposed amendments will be beneficial overall to many small businesses ...
And:
... it is unlikely that any small businesses would be worse off under the proposed Bill as no additional compliance burden should be created.
Having said that, and having indicated my strong support for the legislation, I also indicate that I am extremely concerned about an issue raised with me in relation to this legislation by a leading national advisory firm. This issue is that land-holding entities leasing a parcel of land to a related entity to conduct a business—which is a relatively common structure, especially in the case of farming enterprises—are not regarded as small business entities in themselves and therefore will not come under the extension of the alignment of the eligibility criteria. I believe this is quite unacceptable. Many farmers hold their land in a separate entity for valid asset protection reasons, while having another entity to conduct their farming enterprise. These entities are all related. There is absolutely no valid reason for excluding the asset-holding entity from the benefits of this legislation.
I believe the government must have another look at this issue. They must extend the new rules to those entities who hold assets that are leased by a related entity to conduct the business and must change the legislation to allow those entities to access these provisions. As I said, this is particularly important to the farming community. Many farmers these days hold their land assets in entities separate from those from which they conduct their farming operations. It is grossly unfair for farmers not to be able to access these concessions simply because of that asset protection provision which they maintain. Having said that, I support the legislation but I strongly urge the government to reconsider this matter and in short order introduce an amendment to allow the issue that I have raised to be solved.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (2007 MEASURES NO. 3) BILL 2007</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,32,1,speech
"O’Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2007-06-12,"—The reason I rise to speak in this debate on the Tax Laws Amendment (2007 Measures No. 3) Bill 2007 and the Tax Laws Amendment (Small Business) Bill 2007 is that the bills contain provisions relating to forestry managed investment schemes, and it is the issues of plantation forestry and MIS, managed investment schemes, that I now wish to discuss. In response to these bills I will touch on Labor’s continued commitment to Australia’s plantation forestry industry and I will go on to discuss the government’s consistent failure to consult on the changes to managed investment schemes and failure to understand what the effect of their decisions have been and will be on rural and regional communities.
One of the most exciting aspects for the forestry industry in the past 10 years has been the growth of plantations. Over the past 10 years, plantation forestry has grown at around 70,000 hectares of new plantation area each year. This has resulted in growth in total production from one million hectares in 1994 to over 1.7 million hectares by 2005. This strong growth has been accompanied by strong investment from the private sector in forestry. Many of us will recall the days when plantation investment was largely a government responsibility. This is no longer the case, and the role of the private sector in the forestry industry, and particularly in plantation forestry, has become critical to future expansion. The private sector has not only brought new investment; it has brought with it new ideas, new varieties of trees, new products, new long-term jobs and the prospect of a long-term forestry industry.
One of the most exciting aspects of the emergence of private sector investment in plantations has been the growth in hardwood plantations. Hardwood plantation production grew from a very low base in the early 1990s to almost three-quarters of a million hectares in 2005. This led to a greater diversification of opportunities within the forestry industry, and particularly in downstream processing. A critical factor to consider in this regard is the balance of trade in paper products. While Australia exports about $2.1 billion worth of wood and paper products, Australia imports around $4.1 billion worth of wood and paper products. This represents a trade deficit of around $2 billion, most of which is paper products. The growth of hardwood and the diversification of species opens the opportunity to increase exports and to increase production in wood and paper products to reduce Australia’s reliance on imports. Our main export markets are Japan, Hong Kong, China and New Zealand. A greater diversity of species and value adding will expand these markets and open up new markets to Australia’s wood products.
In relation to other managed investment schemes, and particularly the non-forestry managed investment schemes, the government has been consistently failing Australia. The government has consistently and deliberately neglected to consult with the industries and the rural and regional communities that will be affected by its changes to managed investment schemes. Firstly, the government attempted to bury its decision to end non-forestry managed investment schemes back in February 2007. The Assistant Treasurer, Mr Dutton, issued a press release announcing the government’s decision at eight minutes to seven on the evening of Tuesday, 6 February this year. If the government was comfortable with this decision on this matter, why would it attempt to hide it by issuing the announcement at eight minutes to seven on a Tuesday night? Maybe the government was hoping no-one would notice and it could sneak this one through without anyone having anything to say about it. Maybe the government just did not fully appreciate the impact of its decision. Or perhaps it just did not care.
The February 2007 decision gave the industry less than five months before it would effectively be put out of business. The government undertook no consultation with the industry and in fact discouraged those who sought consultation, saying ‘it was not time for consultation’. It undertook no consultation with affected communities. Haven’t those communities been around Parliament House making members and senators aware of the drastic effects they have been suffering with that decision?
In February this year at Senate estimates it was revealed that the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry had undertaken no research on the issue and had provided no advice to the minister. When the government made the decision to end non-forestry managed investment schemes they did not know how many jobs would be affected, they did not know how much investment would be lost and they did not know what the effect on Australia’s rural exports would be. The government used its numbers in the Senate to block a Senate inquiry which would have looked into those aspects of the government’s decision. The inquiry proposed by Labor offered the opportunity to determine what the effects of ending non-forestry managed investment schemes would be, but the government did not want to know and did not care. A few senior ministers in the government were determined to get rid of non-forestry managed investment schemes. Regardless of the merits of the decision they were going to end those schemes.
Then we had the spectacle of Minister McGauran blaming investors for the uncertainty and job losses arising from his own government’s inept decision in an article in the Weekly Times. With no consultation and no examination by government of the consequences of their decision, the managed investment scheme industry and rural and regional communities were rightly outraged.
The government has since given a one-year reprieve to non-forestry managed investment schemes after its own back bench revolted at the decision, but it does little to allay the real concerns about job losses and lost investment for rural and regional Australia. Those communities are now dependent on a test case which the industry will take to determine whether the so-called tax ruling, which puts the industry that their livelihoods depend on out of business, is a valid one. One would have thought that there were better ways to deal with the uncertainty created by this decision. Cynics suggest that, if the tax office is beaten in the test case, the government will take further action to close the schemes down. That is not what the government has said, but there is a strong belief that that will be the case in those communities.
I turn back to the government’s response to forestry managed investment schemes in this legislation. The forestry MIS industry received consultation prior to the December 2006 announcement of the changes to the laws regulating those schemes that are now contained in this bill. However, having spoken to the forest industry, I can tell the Senate that the decision announced in December 2006 was not a component of the discussions that they held with the government. The forestry industry was taken by surprise when the government announced that 70 per cent of expenditure must be attributable to establishing, tending and felling trees for harvest.
During the recent budget estimates, neither the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry nor Treasury could indicate where the figure of 70 per cent came from. Indeed, the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry indicated that it did not know if the forestry industry could operate under the 70 per cent requirement. It appears that the 70 per cent requirement was plucked from thin air within the minister’s office and not through any consultation process. Certainly, that is the only conclusion that I can reach on the information that has been given to me by the industry and by the departments through Senate estimates.
Concerns have also been raised with me about the four-year limitation before secondary markets can begin. The opposition welcomes the secondary market approach and is quite prepared to support the concept that there ought to be the opportunity to trade in the products of the managed investment scheme before the investment has reached maturity. It is, of course, quite possible for the market to assess the strength of the investment, the potential future value and put a price on it during the interim stage of the growth of a plantation. With proper information that will actually place a discipline on those who promote the schemes to indicate reliable and reasonable rates of return because, if the investments in those schemes are sought to be marketed after four years, then one would expect a commercial rate of return by that time factored against the long-term return of the investment—just as with any other financial product. If the scheme is not returning a reasonable rate, then the investors are entitled to take the view that they have not been properly advised. That might have consequences not only in relation to the future business of certain advisers but also in a legal sense for some advisers depending on how they have represented themselves and the product that they are promoting in those considerations. We support the concept. However, concerns have been raised with me about the four-year limitation before secondary markets begin as this may act as a disincentive to invest in long-rotation plantations.
Representatives of the forest industry have indicated that a four-year period before secondary markets begin may be too short a time frame. It may not give sufficient time for long-rotation trees to reach a sufficient point of maturity to be assessed. So there are varying views about this, and one would have thought that the government would have had a very rigorous basis for the four-year proposal and for the 70 per cent minimum allocation of the funds invested towards the growing of the trees. But that is not apparent from the material that has been made available to the opposition and, indeed, the public through Senate estimates.
So we have a problem, where there is a lack of confidence in the industry in the regime that the government is proposing—or, if it is not a lack of confidence, then a degree of uncertainty about how the industry will be able to operate for the future with those sorts of arrangements. Clearly the government has some work to do to bring the industry along with it, with the regime that is proposed in this legislation.
From Labor’s point of view, of course, we will continue to pay close attention to the way that the regime in this legislation with respect to forest managed investment schemes plays out. We would like to ensure that, if it is possible, longer term rotation plantations are not disadvantaged, because they may create some significant opportunities for high-value processed timber coming from plantations. Some people said, historically, that we were never going to get sawn timber from plantations. We now know that that view was wrong. Sawn timber is being recovered from the Eucalyptus nitens species at the Forest Enterprises mill in northern Tasmania—a development that some of my colleagues back in the early nineties said would never happen. It is happening now. We need to ensure that there is an incentive for long-term rotation plantations, long-term growth, larger trees, better quality timber and the proper milling and seasoning methods to make sure that we get the highest possible value from those timbers. That is a major concern that we need to have factored into any review of this legislation, and that is the approach that Labor will be taking.
Although there are concerns about the forest managed investment scheme aspects of this bill, Labor believes that these changes do provide a degree of certainty to the forest industry which unfortunately the government has denied to the non-forest managed investment scheme industry and the thousands of people employed by non-forest managed investment schemes. In summary, we can say that we will be supporting this legislation. Indeed, we will be supporting the plantation forest industry into the future. It is important to note that this is in the context where this government continues to fail when it comes to managed investment schemes. It has failed to properly consult with the industry. It certainly has failed to consult with the communities affected. It had no understanding of the impact of the decision that it proposed to make in relation to non-forest managed investment schemes—and probably in relation to forestry managed investment schemes. It refused to permit the Senate to inquire to better inform it in relation to the effect of its decisions in both of those regards, and it has a policy clearly driven by a handful of ministers who had an ideological determination to bring to an end non-forest managed investment schemes.
We will be supporting this legislation in relation to the managed investment scheme provisions. We do think the government could have done a lot better for the people in rural and regional Australia whose livelihoods depend upon these schemes. In the future, a more enlightened view of these schemes will provide a better opportunity for these regional economies to gain the benefit of the significant investment that managed investment schemes deliver, basically to rural and regional Australia. I have to say that many Australians believe that what this government has done in shaking off some of that investment will wreak great harm in rural and regional Australia for many years to come.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (2007 MEASURES NO. 3) BILL 2007</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,32,1,speech
"Webber, Sen Ruth",ALP,2007-06-12,"—I rise to briefly make some remarks—particularly given the hour of the evening—on the Tax Laws Amendment (2007 Measures No. 3) Bill 2007 and the Tax Laws Amendment (Small Business) Bill 2007. I begin firstly by commending to the chamber the minority report signed by those Labor members and the Democrat member of the Senate Standing Committee on Economics, and I support Labor’s second reading amendment. As has been canvassed by other speakers in this debate, our main concerns in this legislation—apart from the contribution of my colleague Senator O’Brien, obviously—go to schedule 10 of the Tax Laws Amendment (2007 Measures No. 3) Bill.
As has been outlined before, Labor supports the framework of a flat rate applying to all types of nonresidents, as this measure provides, as it creates certainty and simplicity. As a result of this measure, there would be one withholding outcome for distributions of income—other than dividend, interest and royalty income—by Australian managed investment trusts and Australian intermediaries: withholding at the company tax rate, regardless of whether the foreign resident is an individual, company, trustee or foreign superannuation fund. However, Labor does not support a 30 per cent rate. Rather, as has been outlined by our leader, Kevin Rudd, Labor supports an amendment to apply a lower flat and final 15 per cent rate.
It is our view that applying a flat rate to all types of beneficiaries of managed investment schemes provides the Australian property trust sector with compliance savings by having a single rate applied to distributions to different types of entities. This reduces compliance costs associated with tracing different types of income and different types of recipients of that income, as is currently the case. A flat rate to all beneficiaries removes the need for managed investment trusts and intermediaries to classify the nature of the foreign investor as individual, company, trustee or foreign superannuation fund. Consequently, the measure will also reduce the uncertainty regarding the obligations of managed investment trusts and intermediaries to withhold amounts from distributions to foreign residents. This in turn would improve Australian property trusts as a destination for foreign capital.
These compliance cost savings and reduced uncertainty would have the effect of increasing the efficiency of the Australian managed funds industry in providing funds management services to foreign residents. This results in the greater ability of the Australian managed funds industry to compete against foreign managed funds industries for the management of the investment of foreign residents’ savings. As has been outlined by my colleague Senator Hurley, this is a sector of our diverse economy where competition is growing. Whilst Australia, as was outlined at the committee hearings, has quite a mature sector, there are other economies that are choosing to follow our lead and diversify. It is therefore beholden on all of us to come up with a regime that maintains our competitive edge whilst restricting any impropriety that may take place in the market.
Labor was disturbed with some of the evidence given at the Senate hearings, particularly from Treasury, about the lack of consideration of gearing when costing Labor’s proposals. Something else that was not given much consideration, when I was having discussions about this with some of the industry, was the role of wholly owned Australian subsidiaries in the market. If company B, which is a wholly owned subsidiary, borrows from company A, the offshore company, to invest in the market, then takes all the income it gets and repays it to company A as interest, it is not caught in the current regime. It will not be paying the 30 per cent flat rate. It is our view that the 30 per cent flat rate encourages that kind of behaviour, whereas a 15 per cent flat rate would make us more competitive and would remove the incentive to behave like that.
I echo Senator Murray’s concerns about some other aspects of the bill. Whilst Labor will support the bill, I am personally concerned about the lack of consultation when it comes to the special recognition that we are giving to police and defence personnel. As with the more generous spirit that Australians these days show in some of the crises that occur in our region, it is not just the AFP and defence that these days governments of all persuasions choose to put in harm’s way. We choose to send other emergency service personnel overseas and aid workers overseas. Australia itself has been the beneficiary of emergency service personnel coming to assist us in our time of need, firefighters being a classic example. We have had US firefighters come here and we have sent ours to other countries. Whilst I do not want in any way to diminish the contribution that our AFP and defence personnel make, it seems to be unnecessarily harsh not to consider the contribution that some of our aid workers and other emergency services personnel make when governments—as I said, governments of all persuasions—choose to send them overseas to risk their lives in line with government decisions. With that brief contribution I commend to the Senate the minority report and Labor’s second reading amendment.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (2007 MEASURES NO. 3) BILL 2007</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,32,1,speech
"Ronaldson, Sen Michael",LP,2007-06-12,"—Could I first let the Opposition Deputy Whip know that there have been some brief discussions about me making some very short comments in line with the comments she made. In my view the majority report very aptly sums up what was a very interesting debate, and I thank Senator Murray for his comments earlier. It was a willing debate but a matter of great importance. With regard to withholding tax, I think the Senate should be aware that the Leader of the Opposition gave a speech in relation to this matter justifying what I think will end up being the opposition’s second reading amendment. In justifying his position he made a very interesting comment in his speech. Talking about Labor’s proposed changes, he said:
Greater investment would also flow into Australia for Australian funds managers to invest globally. For example, a Japanese resident could place their funds for management with an Australian funds manager for investment in an appropriate third country market.
Guess what? There is no tax. In the example that underpinned this issue, the rationale for attracting greater inflow of funds, in the speech of the Leader of the Opposition, there is no tax payable. How could the Leader of the Opposition in relation to a matter he views as important as this give an example of why we should adopt Labor’s position and attract greater inflows by a reduction when there is no tax payable? What extraordinary ignorance of the current situation. As one of my colleagues said, clearly no focus group was involved in this. So if it was not a focus group driving Labor’s policy, who was driving it? Who was advising the Leader of the Opposition to justify a policy change which had no substance? I do not think it was Senator Sherry. I hope it was not. I would be surprised if it were. The Leader of the Opposition, in his desperation to cobble something together for a budget reply speech or the outcome of it, has completely misunderstood the principle of withholding tax. If he cannot be trusted in relation to something as simple as this, how can the Australian people possibly trust him in relation to the running of the economy? This is a tax on domestically generated income. The example given by the Leader of the Opposition is not taxed, will not be taxed and has not been taxed in the past, so the justification for this policy change has fallen at the first hurdle.
It was also a very interesting debate with Treasury. What evidence did we hear during the 3½ to four hours of the committee hearing? We heard that, since 2004 when the commissioner effectively put in a process at 30 per cent, to my recollection, the inflow of funds went from $100 billion to $150 billion. This is a policy that apparently is stopping the inflow of funds into this country and yet it went from $100 billion to $150 billion.
The other issue from a policy point of view that the Labor Party has to address is: why are they prepared to effectively subsidise foreign treasuries to the detriment of the Australian taxpayer? What possible justification can the Australian Labor Party give to the Australian taxpayer for subsidising foreign treasuries to the detriment of the Australian taxpayer? The recommendation of the committee was that, when it suited this country when negotiating double taxation agreements, we could negotiate other rates. Did the US demand during our recent discussions with them that we reduce our rate? No, they did not. They did not demand that we reduce it from 30 to 15.
This is a sovereignty issue. This is a tax issue. The Australian Labor Party is asking this chamber and the Australian people to deny us the right to negotiate a reduction in this tax that suits this country and suits our domestic purposes. By moving this amendment, and by driving forward with the opposition leader’s false premise for a change, they are effectively asking Australian taxpayers to put their hands in their pockets and potentially provide more to foreign treasuries.
I am aware of the hour of the night, but as chair of that committee I did want to make some comments. I am sorry that I do not have another 12 or 15 minutes in which to do so. I thank the chamber most sincerely. There was a difficulty with the speakers list, but I thank the opposition for their indulgence in relation to this matter.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (2007 MEASURES NO. 3) BILL 2007</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,32,1,speech
"Colbeck, Sen Richard",LP,2007-06-12,"—I would like to thank senators who have taken part in the debate. I will hopefully get my comments sorted out before 10 o’clock, although we will be back tomorrow to complete this by the look of things now. I will try to be brief. The Tax Laws Amendment (Small Business) Bill 2007 amends the law to make it simpler for up to two million Australian businesses to determine their eligibility for a wide range of small business tax concessions. The bill also delivers on a number of the government’s 2006-07 budget measures. The measures in this bill demonstrate the government’s ongoing commitment to reducing red tape and compliance costs for small business.
Schedule 1 of the Tax Laws Amendment (2007 Measures No. 3) Bill 2007 amends the tax integrity rules concerning private company distributions to reduce the overly punitive nature of the existing provisions and to reduce the extent to which taxpayers can inadvertently trigger a deemed dividend. Schedule 2 will ensure that certain superannuation contributions made during the period of 8 December 2006 to 30 Jan 2007, such as those made by a friend, are included in the non-concessional contributions cap calculation that covers that period. Schedule 3 will improve the taxation of Australian resident testamentary trusts by ensuring that an income beneficiary of such a trust need not be assessed on capital gains of a trust from which they will not benefit. Schedule 4 will allow nondependants of a member of the Australian Defence Force or any Australian police force or protective service killed in the line of duty to access the same concessional tax treatment for lump sum superannuation death benefits as dependants. Schedule 5 will extend an existing transitional period under the thin capitalisation rules by one year to enable a thorough assessment of the impact of the thin capitalisation rules of adopting Australian equivalents to international financial reporting standards. Schedule 6 of this bill will reduce the compliance costs for companies by repealing the dividend tainting rules, which are no longer necessary following the introduction of the consolidation regime and simplified imputation system. Schedule 7 of this bill clarifies the existing interest withholding tax exemptions by more closely specifying the types of financial instruments that will be eligible for the exemption. Schedule 8 inserts new rules to ensure that investment in forestry managed investment schemes is encouraged to facilitate the continued expansion of our plantation forestry estate. Schedule 9 makes amendments to require Australian trustees to collect tax on trust taxable income payable to the trustee of a foreign trust. Schedule 10 of this bill enables Australian managed funds to collect a non-final withholding at a single rate, the company tax rate, on distributions of Australian source income to nonresidents that are not dividends, interest or royalties.
I commend the comments of the previous speaker on the opposition amendment. I again thank those who have participated in the debate and commend the bill to the Senate.

"Bernardi, Sen Cory",LP,2007-06-12,"—Being a good government is tough. It takes determination, discipline, persistence. It requires conviction and the courage to lead—not simply to be a slave to the latest focus groups.
Under this government, Australia is enjoying prosperity not experienced since World War II. Our unemployment rate is the lowest that it is been for 32 years, with a record 10.4 million people now employed in Australia. Employers are experiencing record low levels of industrial action. This has helped create a more productive economy. Australian employers and employees are getting on with the job. This is boosting wages and increasing productivity across all sectors of the economy. This is bad news for the Labor Party and for the Labor Party’s union bosses, but it is good news for Australia.
The recent federal budget was further proof of the benefits of the Howard government’s experienced economic management—tax cuts, a $500 bonus for pensioners, the superannuation co-contribution scheme, a balanced budget with a strong surplus. All of this was possible through the responsible financial management of this government.
There is another group of people—a rather dysfunctional group of people—purporting to be an alternative government of Australia. It is fronted by Mr Kevin Rudd and is backed by the extreme views of the unionists. Mr Rudd and his team are trying to pull the wool over the eyes of the Australian public. How else can we explain it? Mr Rudd says he is an old-fashioned Christian socialist on one day, and a short time later he denounces socialism as a discredited ideology. I am sure that statement will come as a great disappointment to the socialists on the front bench of the other side. Mr Rudd said that he is an economic conservative but he has voted against every prudent fiscal measure that has delivered such prosperity to our great nation. The Labor Party are happy to rip up AWAs yet profit from common law contracts.
Labor say they are not captive to the union movement, but they are installing their union bosses in their safest seats. The list of contradictions in Labor’s platform, policies and leadership could run for many pages. If we cannot rely on what they say, we can only rely on what they do and what they have done. We know of Labor’s federal history of 17 per cent interest rates, high unemployment, poor productivity, rampant industrial disputes. They gave us the recession we had to have—allegedly. Then there were the business bankruptcies. They gave us a country devoid of hope and optimism. In fact, it was ‘hard Labor’ for Australian families.
Mr Rudd would have us believe that he represents a different Labor Party. For an insight into what this means, we do not have to look any further than at the state Labor governments around Australia. As a proud South Australian, I lament the lack of vision and opportunity afforded to our state by the state Labor government. Labor Premier Mike Rann was part of a previous Labor government that nearly bankrupted South Australia. Now he is at it again. In South Australia net state debt is scheduled to grow tenfold over the next four years. Public sector debt is forecast to top $3.4 billion by 2011. That is still a way short of the last Labor legacy of an $11.6 billion deficit that was left after Labor’s state bank disaster during Premier Rann’s first attempt at being in government. This has been achieved despite receiving billions of dollars in additional revenue courtesy of the economic and tax reform of the federal government. State Labor—not content with their GST income—has seen fit to slug South Australian families with ever-increasing taxes and charges.
It is beyond belief that in these prosperous economic times—with more money than ever before flowing into the state governments, courtesy of this federal government—the Rann Labor government is increasing fares on public transport, increasing water supply charges, increasing motor vehicle registration. In South Australia we have got levies and stamp duty slugs and we have got no coherent plan for managing the future. So where has the money gone? It is a very good question. Quite simply, it has been squandered through appalling financial management and reckless spending. This has happened not just in one area but in all areas of state spending. State Labor budgeted in South Australia for an increase of 1,971 full-time public service positions, yet the actual increase was 12,065. This is not a one-off investment in frontline services—in police or teachers or nurses, which are important roles; this is an additional annual cost of $650 million every year, propping up a paper-shuffling bureaucracy.
This explains why the South Australian Labor government is one of the worst performers when it comes to investing in our state. In fact, the South Australian Minister for Transport, Mr Patrick Conlon, was recently quoted in the South Australian parliament’s Hansard as saying:
We believe one of the best ways to achieve funding for that road may well be to keep it as a local road and get onto one of the special project grants that are rolling out from the Commonwealth at the moment.
While Labor do the Pontius Pilate and wash their hands of their responsibilities—and they have done that for over five years—South Australia has recorded the smallest growth in infrastructure spending of all the mainland states. Over this time, our unfunded WorkCover liability has exploded to more than $1 billion. This is a disaster for injured workers and for South Australian employers, who are forced to pay the highest rate of workforce injury insurance in Australia. What is Mr Rann’s response to this crisis? Alarmingly, it is very much like Mr Rudd’s whenever he is faced with a crisis: he is going to convene a committee or hold a summit, have a review and determine a policy agenda after the federal election.
In South Australia this is going to cost taxpayers another $800,000 simply because the Rann Labor government is not prepared to make a decent decision. So while the federal Liberal government has been paying off Labor’s legacy of debt and putting surplus money away to meet our future liabilities, the state Labor governments are spending at a frightening rate. The real benefit of the economic management of the federal government to Australian families is being hampered by state Labor. In typical Labor fashion, they will leave a mess behind that only the Liberals are capable of clearing up.
South Australia has the highest unemployment rate in mainland Australia. Our growth forecast is the lowest of all mainland states. The Rann government is the highest-taxing government in South Australia’s history. We have underfunded superannuation liabilities of over $6.1 billion. We have a River Murray levy but no state government plan for water security. The Rann Labor government is not providing stamp duty relief for struggling homebuyers. Shamefully, they are the first South Australian government to collect more than $1,000 million in property taxes—land tax and stamp duties. Broken promises—this is Labor’s legacy. It is the same with federal Labor’s legacy. In South Australia the Rann Labor government has had $2.9 billion extra every single year that is being simply wasted.
Who can forget the mess that federal Labor left us after the Hawke-Keating governments finished in 1996—a $96 billion debt, a $10 billion annual deficit and a weakened national credit rating. The current state Labor governments are heading down exactly the same path as their federal and state predecessors. It is clear there is nothing different about the tax-and-spend attitude Labor held during the eighties and nineties and their current tax-and-spend policies. But do not take my word for it. The poor performance of the state Labor governments has even attracted the attention of the Menzies Research Centre, which recently published a report entitled State of the states. The report, by a distinguished international economist, is an examination of the typical Labor fundamentals: overspending, budget blow-outs, public servant salary increases, low productivity, low economic growth and low investment in infrastructure. The states have received record windfalls. Where is it going? There has been no noticeable improvement in service effectiveness. They have increased real expenditure but they have seen a decline in productivity.
According to the report, state taxpayers are getting less bang for their tax buck. But in the rare circumstances where state Labor have actually decided to make a decision to invest, their priorities have been simply wrong and subject to massive cost blow-outs. There is a $100 million blow-out on the Port River Bridge, an extra $25 million on government spin, and the cost of an important hospital redevelopment has exploded from $60 million to $317 million. The list of poor decisions, poor management and poor government from South Australia’s state Labor government is shameful. It is back to ‘hard Labor’ for the people of South Australia.
But let us not forget about how they love to tax. If a Rudd Labor government were elected federally, they could get together with their state comrades and change the level of the GST. Wall-to-wall Labor governments in Australia would make this a real and frightening possibility. We cannot afford a federal Labor government. I say to the good men and women of Australia: do not be fooled by the smokescreen of Mr Rudd; ignore the empty words and the focus group sound bites. Consider Labor on their record. It is a record this country simply cannot afford. (Time expired)
