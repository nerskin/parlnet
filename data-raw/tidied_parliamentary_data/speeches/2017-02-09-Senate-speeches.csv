"McKim, Sen Nicholas",AG,2017-02-09,"



Senator McKIM
 (Tasmania) (09:31):  In lieu of immediately moving to suspend standing orders, I seek leave to make a five-minute statement regarding the forced deportations from Manus Island that are currently underway.



The PRESIDENT:  Is leave granted?




Senator Fifield:
  Can he do that after we have called on legislation?



The PRESIDENT:  Senator Fifield, in consultation with the Clerk, I am thinking about what you have just interjected to Senator McKim. The appropriate time would have been before we called upon business. I am in the hands of the Senate. If the Senate does not wish for you to be heard in the manner that you have been heard, then we will proceed with business. If the Senate wishes for you to be availed of the opportunity to seek leave, I am in the hands of the Senate. 




Senator Brandis:
  As the Manager of Government Business has pointed out, we have now embarked upon the consideration of the National Integrity Commission Bill 2013. This is not really a question of seeking to suspend standing orders, because we are embarked upon the consideration of a particular listed item of business. If Senator McKim wanted to seek leave to make a statement, he should have sought leave before we had embarked upon the business. We have now embarked upon the business. When that business is concluded in the orderly conduct of the Senate, that is the time for Senator McKim to seek leave to make a statement.



The PRESIDENT:  Thank you. I concur, Senator Brandis.




Senator McKim:
  Could I seek your guidance, please, Mr President. I accept your ruling, obviously, on this matter. Could you advise me whether I can now move to suspend standing orders, or do I have an option to ask that the consideration of private members business be put aside in order that I can either seek leave or move to suspend standing orders?



The PRESIDENT:  I understand what you are asking, Senator McKim. No, you cannot. You can do things between items of business, but we have embarked upon an item of business and clearly you did not rise in your seat until after I had called upon the Clerk to call on business. There was opportunity prior to that for you to do that. But at other times during the day there will be junctures where you could take that course of action and seek leave to make a comment or statements. What course of action you take, whether that leave is granted or not, is a matter for you. I have called the Clerk, we have moved on to business and I call the first speaker.

"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2017-02-09,"



Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia—Co-Deputy Leader of the Australian Greens) (09:34):  I thank Senator Rhiannon for bringing this bill forward. It is entirely appropriate given what happened over the summer recess and the incredible series of indignities that the public has been exposed to. This is an incredibly important issue. We are all aware, no matter what side of politics we are on—but we are keenly aware of it up here, on the crossbench—that public confidence in parliament and parliamentarians is at an all time low. Certainly, I have been working in this building for a little over 10 years and I have never known a time when contempt for the conduct of MPs at a state and federal level has been higher. That is something that everybody who works in this building needs to bear a measure of responsibility for. We in the Australian Greens are aware that there are things that we can do to lead by example that can help restore a measure of confidence. One of those things that the Greens have been pursuing essentially for as long as we have been a political party is a national anti-corruption commission.


I want to talk a little bit about the Western Australian context in a moment, but firstly I want to go through a little bit of the history and remind senators of how long this issue has been running for. In 2010, Greens Senator Bob Brown introduced the National Integrity Commissioner Bill. In 2012 our member for Melbourne, Adam Bandt, introduced a similar bill into the House of Representatives. In 2013 Senator Christine Milne introduced a National Integrity Commission Bill. In 2015 Senator Rhiannon introduced a motion calling for a national anti-corruption body and political donations reform. I can remember sitting here on the crossbench and having that motion voted down by the Labor Party and the Liberal Party. If my memory serves me, a substantial number of crossbenchers supported the Greens and of course the major parties did not. In 2016 Senator Rhiannon reintroduced the National Integrity Commission Bill. How long is this debate going to need to run for? We have been prosecuting this case in here for more than a decade. The public support for a measure of this sort has never been higher. We are elected in here to represent the public interest, not to line our own pockets and not to set up future career paths in the mining industry, the banking sector or the gambling industry. We are here to serve the public interest. There would probably be a substantial number of people listening to this broadcast or checking in online who are choking over their coffee at the idea that that is what politicians come in here to do. What better way to begin to restore confidence in the work that is done in here than a national anticorruption commission?


I will take an interjection from Senator Rhiannon if she is able to remind me how many New South Wales politicians were eventually prosecuted or went to jail.




Senator Rhiannon:
  It is very hard to count, but 11 Liberal MPs.




Senator LUDLAM:
  Eleven Liberal MPs! I will take that interjection, Senator Rhiannon.



The PRESIDENT:  That is a little bit disorderly and cheeky, Senator Ludlam. Interjections are disorderly.




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  You might talk about all the Labor people in jail for worse than corruption, Senator Ludlam.




Senator LUDLAM:
  Hit a bit of a nerve, have we, Senator Macdonald? I've missed you so much!



Senator Ian Macdonald interjecting—




Senator LUDLAM:
  Yes, that is right.



The PRESIDENT:  To the chair, Senator Ludlam.




Senator LUDLAM:
  Through you, Mr President—



The PRESIDENT:  To me, not through me.




Senator LUDLAM:
  Yes, senior Labor MPs—ministers. Senator Macdonald is quite right: there is mud on both sides.




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  And on your own team.




Senator LUDLAM:
  I do not actually believe any Greens MP at any level of parliament or local government, state or federal, has ever suffered the kind of indignity and accusations of corruption that your side of politics, Senator Macdonald, and the Labor side of politics have been subjected to.




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  What about the last Senate election in Western Australia, where you weren't elected?




Senator LUDLAM:
  Let's talk about Western Australia.




Senator Siewert:
  I beg your pardon!



Senator Ian Macdonald interjecting—



The PRESIDENT:  Order! Senator Macdonald and Senator Siewert, order!



Senator Siewert interjecting—



The PRESIDENT:  Order, Senator Siewert! Senators, if you wish to have a discussion about this across the chamber, leave the chamber and do it outside. Senator Ludlam has the call. Senator Ludlam, you may continue.




Senator LUDLAM:
  Thanks, President. Going to Western Australia, a little bit before my time in politics, WA Inc is a name that probably lives on in infamy, when the stench of corruption in the state Labor government, going back into the 1980s and 1990s, became impossible to ignore. The government was eventually rolled out of office on that basis.


I acknowledge that the practice of anticorruption commissions at a state level is extremely uneven and there is not really consistency in the way that these commissions operate, but we know that a major missing piece of the architecture is that no such thing exists at a federal level. The Australian Greens' proposal has been on the Hansard for more than 10 years, if senators would care to go back and analyse what it is that we have been proposing, but I will just remind senators—



Senator Jacinta Collins interjecting—




Senator LUDLAM:
  I am sorry, Senator Collins? People are so rowdy this morning, President. I do not know if I am being unusually provocative.



The PRESIDENT:  Ignore the interjections, Senator Ludlam. Senators, do not interject.




Senator LUDLAM:
  I am doing my best here. The proposal that the Greens have put forward and that Senator Rhiannon has put on the Notice Paper today is effectively a threefold body: a law enforcement integrity commissioner—so effectively taking the existing Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity and rolling it into a body that will then incorporate a national integrity commissioner and an independent parliamentary adviser. The independent parliamentary adviser, you would imagine, would be the sort of person who would advise—before the fact rather than after—on helicopter charters, for example, or trips to polo matches, or taxpayer funded trips to weddings in India, or the various other disgraceful activities through which MPs in this building have eventually had their careers terminated—not through any kind of due process but effectively by public outrage. We saw it happen with the health minister over the summer break: pad out your investment portfolio with spontaneous purchases of investment properties on the Gold Coast—a brilliant idea!—and then have the taxpayer pick up the tab for the flights, the Comcars and whatever else.


These are the sorts of activities that MPs can avoid finding themselves enmeshed in if you have an independent parliamentary adviser. I do not believe the helicopter charters from Mrs Bishop or the taxpayer funded investment property splurge are grey areas at all, but anybody who has spent any time in here would be aware that there are grey areas around the use of entitlements, or the fact that they are even called entitlements at all. All of us from time to time could use somebody—an independent umpire on the end of the phone line—to ring up and say, 'I don't know about this; is this within the rules or not?' So an independent parliamentary adviser is a really important part of this.


The third body, obviously, is a national integrity commissioner. That is where the rubber hits the road. That is where you discover the kind of activities that destroyed a Labor government in WA and that have so disfigured politics in New South Wales. I think probably all of us representing the states and territories around the country would be very well aware that there is no level of government that has not from time to time been tainted with a hint—or a lot more than a hint—of corruption. Why would we imagine, as a government senator—I forget exactly who it was—tried to put to us yesterday, that at the Commonwealth tier of government, dealing with enormous sums of money and with very close contacts between ministers and industry and diaries that are not released into the public domain, we would be somehow magically immune? I think it is absolutely essential that we have this final—or not final but important—piece of institutional architecture, a corruption oversight body looking after what goes on in this chamber and in the other place just across the building.


I want to come to a couple of examples that are much closer to home. It was rather extraordinary again to hear a government spokesperson yesterday tell us we do not need a national anticorruption watchdog and it is better if this sort of thing is diffused throughout the Public Service. The minister is effectively saying, 'We'd rather nobody was in charge; we'd rather there was nobody where the buck stopped to keep an eye on this, unearth corruption, be able to take evidence and be able to be the person where the buck stops.' They would rather that that be diffused and that it not really be anybody's responsibility. I do not know if it is the first time that that form of argument has been run, but I found it peculiar and entirely unconvincing.


An example of where I think we could use this kind of body is in the Western Australian context. You will be aware, because Senator Siewert and I have been raising this matter for many years—as have Senator Lines and Senator Sterle—of the matter of the Perth Freight Link, the so-called Roe 8 extension back in Western Australia. It was announced very suddenly by the Liberal government right before the 2013 federal election. It is one of these dead dogs of a policy from former Prime Minister Tony Abbott that is still stinking up the place. There is WestConnex, there is the East West Link and there is Roe Highway. It is one of those kinds of zombie policies, a tremendously expensive one, that refuses to fall over. That was $1.2 billion of Australian taxpayers' money committed on a whim, effectively signed off on the back of an envelope by former Prime Minister Tony Abbott, with no business case and no public cost-benefit analysis. 


And, what do you know, the contract has been awarded—by the state government, I should say, not the Commonwealth—to a consortium of companies led by Leighton Holdings. I do not know if this was anything to do with brand damage, but they renamed themselves CIMIC a little while ago. They are a massive donor to the Liberal Party. Leighton have donated nearly $700,000 to the WA Liberal and National parties. That buys a lot of TV time, doesn't it? That buys a lot of access. That buys a lot of quiet conversations. These old private-school networks, old boys clubs, are greased by a $700,000 political donation—all above board, nothing illegal. That is $700,000 to the Liberal and National parties.


This is a corporation that is bidding for a massive government contract. So, for your $700,000—entirely above board—you can go in to bid for a $1.2 billion engineering and construction contracts. That is a clear conflict of interest. No wonder trust in the institutions, with that queasy interface between commerce and politics, is at an all-time low.


We think that it is time to ban political donations from for-profit corporations. I know that is going to cause a degree of hyperventilation from the other end of the chamber because it is that money that helped put you here, but we think that these things should be banned. Leighton is a $6.3 billion company; it runs mining, construction and engineering projects all around the globe; and it has been described as company where corrupt practices were absolutely endemic. Highly paid senior executives used a range of bribery techniques, including kickbacks to subcontractors, special payments to procure contracts, and facilitation payments. So, while these bribery incidents occurred overseas, Leighton's involvement with Australian government funded projects has been questioned. Who would you put these kinds of questions to? At the moment, there is nobody. There is nobody that you can put these kinds of questions to.


As I said, Leighton now operate under the name of CIMIC, after corruption allegations came to light in 2013. So that's fine—just change the name! We do not know whether those practices have changed, whether the corporate culture has changed or whether these kinds of under-the-table activities are occurring here in Australia, because there is nobody tasked to find out. 


In 2013, The Sydney Morning Herald reported 'Building giant Leighton rife with corruption', and they disclosed evidence of massive bribery and corruption in the way that contracts were being won around the world—most notoriously, the multimillion-dollar kickbacks paid to win contracts in Iraq, which were later investigated by the Australian Federal Police. As recently as 31 January of this year, the Herald reported 'Building giant Leighton rife with corruption', and I want to quote from that article:


In revelations that will cause international embarrassment for Australia and raise questions about the role of the nation's corporate watchdog, the files expose plans to pay alleged multimillion-dollar kickbacks in Iraq, Indonesia, Malaysia and elsewhere, along with other serious corporate misconduct.


Hundreds of confidential company documents, obtained during a six-month Fairfax Media investigation, also reveal a culture of rewarding corruption or incompetence, and abysmal corporate governance in what looms as the worst recent case of corporate corruption involving a major Australian firm.


So they can throw down $700,000 here in Australia and, as if by magic, through some black-box tendering process that is shrouded in commercial-in-confidence—this parliament has not been able to assess exactly why that contract was won or whether the contract represents value for money—they nailed down a $1.2 billion construction contract for a completely pointless road, a freight highway through an important wetland area, an area of enormous significance to Aboriginal people, an area of very high neighbourhood amenity, an area that has being dubbed the Kings Park of the south. Anybody from Western Australia will know that this is an area of extraordinary biodiversity and of extraordinary value to the community, and it is being torn in half, effectively, by this project.


I want to acknowledge Senator Rhiannon's work, particularly on the Democracy for Sale site. In many ways, our New South Wales colleagues are a bit ahead of the curve, presumably because—knowing a little bit about the way politics have worked in New South Wales in the past—it has been essential that the New South Wales Greens have held the major parties to account, partly because the institutions have not really been there to do so. The Greens have been a really important part, in New South Wales and elsewhere around the country, of holding the major parties to account and trying to throw some sunlight on that interface between corporations, commerce and the political tier.


This weekend, the launch of the Greens WA state election campaign is underway, and I am very proud to foreshadow an announcement that my colleagues will be making on integrity in government—




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  Is that what this is all about—a bit short of votes, are you?




Senator LUDLAM:
  because in WA we know that vested interest groups and wealthy powerbrokers have been able to undermine and influence our democratic system. It is one of the reasons people are fleeing the major parties in droves, including your party, Senator Macdonald. I do not know whether you snoozed through that part of the memo, but you lot are really on the nose, and confidence in government, confidence in the Liberal and National parties, is at an all-time low.


For example, there is the aggressive attack that the mining lobby has thrown into the field against the proposal to increase royalties in Western Australia. The mining industry wields extraordinary power. We saw that in the way that they damaged and ultimately destroyed the prime ministership of former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd. Meanwhile, the government are abusing freedom-of-information requests; they hide behind commercial-in-confidence excuses to keep out of the public eye these slimy deals that they make. 


The Greens believe that a resilient democracy depends on all levels of government being transparent about how these decisions are made. That includes this tier of government. I am looking forward to coalition spokespeople standing up to tell us why there is nothing to see here and why they do not feel the need for an anticorruption watchdog at a Commonwealth level. I am really looking forward to that. Please go ahead, those on the coalition side—because I understand that, after 20 years of campaigning by the Australian Greens, the Labor Party ship, like that oil tanker at sea, may be slowly turning. 


I remember being told by the coalition side when we were debating mandatory data retention that, if you have nothing to hide, you have nothing to fear. Do you remember that? Anybody complaining about overwhelmingly intrusive government surveillance was told, 'If you have nothing to hide, you have nothing to fear.' I think at a personal level, as far as personal privacy is concerned, that argument is completely hollow but, in terms of powerful institutions and in terms of governments writing cheques for billions of dollars at a time to their mates in the construction industry, to oil and gas companies, to engineering companies and to developers, what is it that you have to fear?


I am reasonably sure that when you stand up and try to run counterarguments to this incredibly sensible and longstanding proposal by Senator Rhiannon you are going to tell us that you have nothing to hide. Well then let us see. Let us get these cards on the table. Let us have a national anticorruption watchdog to do the kind of job that is being done in New South Wales and has done so much good, not necessarily to restore confidence in politics and the rule of law but at least to raise the bar to corruption and to increase transparency so that people doing these slimy deals behind closed doors are aware that there may be some consequences. It is about time that those consequences fell due at a Commonwealth level.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2017-02-09,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (09:53):  My contempt knows no end for parliamentarians who use this cowards' castle to play the populist game to further their own careers by innuendo, making claims against individual Australians, corporations and colleagues in this place. We have just heard such a speech. It would be very easy for me to join the populist bandwagon and refer, as some of the lazy media did, to Senator Siewert's travel expenses. I was the first to defend Senator Siewert because she, after me, is one of the hardest-working parliamentarians in this place. She is the chair or the deputy chair of several committees. Her travel expenses are large, but, hang on, she happens to live in Perth and represent Western Australia. Of course, to get to Canberra she has to fly a lot. I know I rarely agree with Senator Siewert, but I do acknowledge she is one of the most committed and hardworking politicians here.


One of the others who were attacked by the populist press—and supported by people like Senator Ludlam, no doubt—was the member for Lingiari. His travel expenses are high. Well, what a surprise. He lives in Darwin. He represents the Cocos (Keeling) Islands. He comes to Canberra half of the year to do what he is paid to do. Of course his travel expenses are high.


It is easy for politicians and lazy journalists to make these complaints by innuendo. I challenge Senator Ludlam. He spent 20 minutes denigrating Australian citizens, Australian corporations and politicians. If he has one skerrick, one iota, one little bit, of evidence, please refer it to the existing watchdog. Jason Clare, a Labor member of parliament, said in 2012:


ACLEI has the powers of a standing Royal Commission. It has the power to coerce people to give evidence, to hold public hearings, to execute search warrants, to tap phones and to conduct digital and physical surveillance and it has used these powers in this case—


in the case he was talking about. If Senator Ludlam has just one skerrick of evidence to back up the disgraceful, dishonest speech that he has just made, he should go and see ACLEI. If he is too stupid to find their phone number, I will give it to him. I will text it to him.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Macdonald, it is not very pleasant to refer to Senator Ludlam in that way. If you could withdraw, thank you.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  I withdraw 'stupid'. If he is so base that he cannot find the phone number of ACLEI, I will text it to him. Australia already has zero tolerance to corruption in all of its forms and so does particularly this government. We do not support the Craig Thomsons of this world. We are determined to have zero tolerance to corruption. 


We have strong laws and a robust, multiagency approach to combating corruption. A range of agencies play a role in preventing, detecting and responding to corruption. We have ACLEI, the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity, which I have already mentioned. The AFP-hosted fraud and anticorruption centre brings together a range of Commonwealth agencies to respond to serious fraud and corruption matters, including government services, programs and employees. The Commonwealth provided an additional $15 million to that centre in April last year under the coalition government. This framework provides significant coverage of fraud and corruption across Australian government agencies, with particular focus on areas of high corruption risk.


I do not cast aspersions or innuendos on anyone, but in the exchange I had with Senator Siewert earlier I raised the issue of the missing bundle of votes in Western Australia from the last Senate election. What happened to them? I know you do not know, Mr Acting Deputy President Sterle, neither, unfortunately, do the Australian Federal Police, although in their evidence to the electoral matters committee—




Senator Siewert:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. Senator Macdonald is going into I think very dangerous territory. He is about to make certain accusations. It is unparliamentary and I ask you to ask him not to go there.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Sterle
):  Senator Siewert, I have just walked in and sat in the chair. I have heard about two sentences from Senator Macdonald. I can consult with the clerks, but at this stage I am not going to. I am going to give Senator Macdonald the call and I will take it from there.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  That was the most curious point of order I have ever heard. Senator Siewert was interpreting what I am going to say next.



Senator Siewert interjecting—




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  You are making a point of order on something that you think, in your funny mind, I might be about to say. I had finished my comments on the 2013 election. All I will say is that the Federal Police indicated to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters that there was certainly something wrong but they were unable to find out why. I might say, Senator Siewert, after defending you—and I will continue to defend you because I know you are honest and I know you work incredibly hard—that you will never find me taking a cheap shot at you over that. I will take a shot at some of your hypocritical policies, yes, but not—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Macdonald, I ask that you direct your comments through the chair. Senator Ludlam, on a point of order?




Senator Ludlam:
  That was my point of order. Senator Macdonald has been in here for hundreds of years. He knows that he needs to direct his comments through you, Mr Acting Deputy President.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  You always know when you are making a point that the Greens are embarrassed about, because they will make those ridiculous points of order simply to curtail me. I will not go into the matter of the largest single donation to any political party in the history of Australia.





Senator Cash:
  Please do.



Senator Ludlam interjecting—



Senator Siewert interjecting—




Senator Jacinta Collins:
  Malcolm's is bigger now.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Hang on—Malcolm Turnbull puts his own money in his own re-election. I did not want to mention Mr Wood's name, but the biggest single donation to a political party ever in Australian history went to the Greens political party. I happen to be on a committee where the then Greens leader sought to get an exemption from some form of Commonwealth tax for those who might want to set up an online newspaper. I am not going to join the dots together on which person it was that was trying to do that. I will just say that I wish ACLEI had been around at the time.


So we have these holier-than-thou people come here, casting aspersions by innuendo, but can I tell them I have good news for them. The government has announced a bill coming forward shortly to set up an authority to oversee parliamentary allowances. I am sure the Greens will support the amendment that I will be moving to that bill. I, not the government, will be moving the amendment to that bill to include public servants in the same authority.


I very rarely read The Canberra Times, but I saw an editorial in The Canberra Times. It was published just the other day, but it was referring to editorial from last month. It is called 'Time to expose bureaucrats' wayward spending, too?' and it has the subheading 'Transparency'. I make the point that I have found every Commonwealth bureaucrat that I have ever had dealings with—and I had some very close dealings when I was a minister, and in estimates since—to be incredibly dedicated, incredibly honest, very transparent and great servants of the Australian people. But the bureaucracy is enormous, and you only have to read this article in The Canberra Times to realise that there should be, perhaps, the same accountability and openness for the hundreds of thousands, certainly tens of thousands, of Commonwealth bureaucrats who help govern Australia. There are infinitely more than there are politicians in this chamber, most of whom have infinitely more power and spending capability than anyone in Parliament House. So I would think that it is time to widen the net—perhaps to the judiciary as well, perhaps to some of these tribunals and perhaps to institutions and statutory authorities like the Human Rights Commission. Maybe we should have the same transparency from them, but we never hear from the Greens. We never hear that too often from the Labor Party either, I might say, but what a good idea.


I am quite certain, after hearing Senator Ludlam, that he will be seconding my amendment when I bring it to this chamber. I suspect there are not going to be too many on my side to second it, but I am sure after that rousing speech by Senator Ludlam that he and his party will be supporting the extension of this parliamentarians oversight committee to the Public Service. I notice Senator Ludlam and the Greens are all of a sudden finding something very important to talk about and will not listen to this, but let me have your assurance that I will have your support in moving this amendment.


Australia has consistently been ranked by Transparency International‎ as one of the least corrupt countries in the world. That is because we have these institutions. We have accountability and openness among parliamentarians that, quite frankly, is beyond understanding. There is even this great battle, which the shadow Attorney-General seems to be fixated on, about wanting parliamentarians to indicate to the world who they see, what they see, when they see them, where they are going to be and where they have been. It is great news for a would-be criminal or someone who is intent on criminal activity against parliamentarians, under the guise of accountability. This parliament is where you call ministers to account. This parliament is where you ask them what they have been doing or where they have been doing it. The shadow Attorney-General seems fixated—dare I use that terminology—on exposing the activities of the Attorney-General. Mind you, the Attorney-General is the minister in charge of security in this nation, and the shadow Attorney-General wants his diary to be made public. I guess it will not be long before mine is asked for too—although you do not have to worry about mine; I put on Facebook where I am going to be all the time. That is no secret.


This Greens bill is again an action by a party that is falling in the polls. Those of us who have been around a long time have seen the Democrats come and go; we have seen One Nation come and go and come back, and it will go again; and we have seen the Greens come and I predicted sometime ago that they would go in Europe, and they are going, and I predicted sometime ago that they would go in Australia, and they are on the downward climb now. They used to attract a bit of a protest vote from those who did not like the government, who did not like the Labor Party, but I am sorry, guys in the Greens—through you, Mr Acting Deputy President—that protest vote is now going to One Nation and we will, fortunately, see the end of the hypocrisy in a policy sense of the Greens political party. Australia will be a better place for that.


The Greens are trying to maintain what little support they hold around Australia—around eight per cent at last call, and going southwards—by jumping on the populist bandwagon: every politician, and particularly the Liberal politicians in the Western Australian government, are all bad. Senator Ludlam, who is really the far left extension of the Labor Party—I pity the Labor Party for that; I am sorry you have to bow to their wishes—forgot to mention all the Labor politicians in jail for very serious offences. But that is the Greens way. You will never hear Senator Rhiannon attack Labor Party politicians, even though in her state there are enormous numbers she could be attacking. Your own political leaning, and your own populist approach to matters, prevents you from doing that, and it shows the dishonesty of the argument of the Greens political party.




Senator Ludlam:
  You're on broadcast.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Good heavens, I would not have guessed that without hearing Senator Ludlam's first speech—always there for broadcast day, always there when he thinks he might be able to resurrect or retain some of the few people who vote for the Greens political party. I think Australians are waking up to the absolute hypocrisy of the Greens, and they now see the Greens under pressure. The Labor Party I think are at last understanding that they really have to separate themselves from the Greens, otherwise the Greens will take over their dwindling support on the left—it still will not save the Greens; it will just take the Greens and the Labor Party down at the same time. These populist parties, who do extract people who say 'a pox on all your houses', have left the Greens and gone elsewhere.


As I said in our party room the other day—I do not want to indicate what was said in the party room but these are my own thoughts, not the party room's thoughts especially—it is about time our leaders—all of our leaders, and Senator Di Natale would be a good start—started emphasising how much work politicians do, how much commitment most of the people who sit in this parliament—most, I might add—have. They are here because they believe in Australia and they believe that they can make a contribution to Australia. By the standards in the community they do not get particularly well-paid, and there are hundreds of examples of that. Someone has to stand up, rather than just Senator Ludlam joining the populist theme and denigrating by innuendo everybody in this chamber and the other chamber, and start arguing for politicians, arguing for parliamentarians, saying why they are there. Most parliamentarians—or those on this side—would have done infinitely better financially staying in their legal practice, staying in their business, staying in their veterinary practice, staying in the jobs they had before. That is not why they have come into this chamber. I will be talking on this again in another bill coming up, and I will be opposing my government and again moving amendments. If the Greens were true to their cause, they would be supporting me too. They might on the authority one, but they will not on the other one. They are without value, without any semblance of directness and honesty, when it comes to policy matters.


We do in Australia at the moment have all of the elements to ensure that Australia, its government, its institutions and its businesses are as corruption free as possible, and certainly we are as good as anyone else in the world. In December last year the government released its first National Action Plan under the Open Government Partnership. This consisted of a number of commitments to advanced transparency, accountability, public participation and technical innovation in Australia over the next two years. As I have foreshadowed, I have a couple of amendments to government bills that, if adopted by the parliament, would add to the role of that plan. I will be seeking the support of other senators—not with a great deal of confidence, I might say, but I will seek that support—and we will see then the rhetoric of the Greens, their nontransparency, their appeal to the populists—those who are leaving the Greens in droves. We will see how they carry on. Australia is not perfect, but we are as good as any other country in the world. We are as good as you possibly can be in a democracy and in a large business operation like the governance of Australia. I will certainly oppose this bill.

Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria) (10:14):  I do not intend to continue the slanging match that has been an unfortunate element of the discussion so far here this morning. But, as Senator Ludlam pointed out, we have dealt with the National Integrity Commission Bill 2013 in several different iterations over some time. I went back to the 2010 Bob Brown version of the bill. I am not sure if there was one earlier than that that I have missed, Senator Ludlam. We have had several discussions around this bill, but, in its last iteration, I did not have the opportunity to contribute. As I understand it, we will be moving on to the next matter fairly soon, but I do appreciate the opportunity to deal with some of the substance around how we might deal with issues around integrity and corruption.


Let me say it from the outset: I want to make it clear that Labor stand for integrity and transparency in government, and we have zero tolerance for corruption. But, as we all know, corruption does occur. We cannot pretend that it does not occur at a federal level. Further to Senator Macdonald's comments a moment ago, I seem to recall a recent indication from Transparency International that Australia had actually slipped in their index, and, if that is the case, that is obviously a concern.


I also want to make it clear at the outset that Labor's position in relation to this Greens party bill is that unfortunately it is stale, out of date and, in some respects, obsolete. Had Senator Ludlam—and, I should say, I welcome back Senator Ludlam, and it is great to see him back here in good health—been with us in the last little while, perhaps he might have addressed some of the issues where matters have moved on. I will outline some of those.


As I said, Labor has always fostered and will continue to foster a culture of integrity within Commonwealth public institutions. That is why Labor supports the Australian National Audit Office, the Australian Public Service Commission, the Commonwealth Ombudsman, the Australian Federal Police, the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission and other law enforcement and accountability measures which together help to create a culture of integrity in the public sector. Looking at what has moved on with respect to this bill, one further element that Senator Macdonald touched on is, of course, that Labor in 2012 strengthened ACLEI, and that is part of our broader integrity framework.


There have been periodic calls for some form of a federal anticorruption commission over recent years, including in this private senator's bill. While Labor have zero tolerance for corruption, we believe that the best way to proceed is with the re-establishment of the Senate Select Committee on the establishment of a National Integrity Commission to continue its important inquiry and produce a final report. I recommend to the Senate the interim report, which was tabled back in May of last year, which is a good indicator of the further work that the committee that was established yesterday will conduct.


Labor does not rule out that in the future a dedicated federal anticorruption body may be required. However, our final position on the value and merits of establishing a national integrity commission should not be considered until the completion of this inquiry. That is a considered and sensible approach to take, unlike simply, as Senator Macdonald was suggesting, taking the populist path of rehashing an old proposal that is not even up to date in terms of the current frameworks in place, moving formal motions yesterday and giving this bill yet another consideration today. Some of it is, as I have said, out of date, and it is simply a rehash of many past discussions rather than a means of moving matters forward.


Let us take a closer look at what the Greens are proposing and why the bill is stale and obsolete. It is clear the Greens are behind the game and need to catch up on some significant recent developments, including that just yesterday, as I said, the Senate determined to re-establish the Senate Select Committee on the establishment of a National Integrity Commission. In part, this was a response to recent community frustration and controversy around the entitlement matters that other senators have referred to, culminating in the resignation of disgraced former health minister Sussan Ley.


Another recent and significant development is the government's plan to establish an independent parliamentary expenses authority to advise on and regulate parliamentary expenses. In his address to the National Press Club last Tuesday, Labor leader Bill Shorten made it clear that the opposition agreed in principle with the proposal in an attempt to begin to restore public confidence in the political process. Perhaps, rather than just moving forward this proposed threefold body, if we are to address this matter again, we should improve its currency and address the way in which it is proposed to move forward in relation to the parliamentary entitlements element of this current bill.


As I said, at the moment it represents the same bill that Bob Brown first introduced in 2010 and Christine Milne regurgitated in 2013, and now there is this current version. As I said, I do not think I will address the slanging match issues around political donations, but it is an interesting question about how a body such as this may, and whether the model proposed will, address some of the debate and indeed posturing around political donations.


The Senate Select Committee on the establishment of a National Integrity Commission was established on 24 February last year with Labor's support to inquire into whether a national integrity commission should be set up to address institutional, organisational, political, electoral and individual corruption and misconduct, and I was the deputy chair of that inquiry. The committee, as I have mentioned, published an interim report in May 2016, prior to the dissolution of the parliament for the July election. The interim report includes a discussion about the existing national anticorruption framework and the potential benefits and drawbacks of creating a national anticorruption commissioner. It is worth briefly examining some of the committee's findings and its one recommendation, but it is also important to remember that the committee was unable to complete its work and issue a final report.


The Senate select committee had, as I said, one recommendation:


… that the Australian Government support current and sound future research into potential anti-corruption systems appropriate for Australia …


Griffith University and other partners were looking at conducting that work, and I look forward to an update on what has occurred since the former committee looked at these issues. That was a wise recommendation. The committee was unable to complete its work and it is clear that there is a lot more work still to do before serious consideration can be given to whether some form of anticorruption commission should be established at a federal level to complement existing anticorruption and integrity bodies and, if so, how such a body should operate.


The committee's interim report is a good document and raises some of the key issues for further examination. It lists arguments in favour of a national anticorruption framework, the top of the list being the discovery and investigation of corruption. But the report says:


… a NAC may also improve policy co-ordination, provide leadership and education services, reduce potential jurisdictional gaps, increase administrative efficiency, send an unambiguous signal that the issue of corruption is being taken seriously, and provide confidence to the public that corruption is minimised at the highest level of government.


All states now have broad based anticorruption agencies. The Senate select committee looked at the effectiveness of such bodies. The most recent report into the New South Wales ICAC, published in 2013, found that:


More than two-thirds indicated that the ICAC had been successful at exposing corruption and more than half indicated that the ICAC had been successful at reducing corruption.


Then in October 2015, the outgoing Tasmanian Integrity Commissioner spoke to the ABC about the early years there with an integrity commission. She said:


""I think it's been a bit of a surprise to people that the Integrity Commission's been so effective …


""Often when I speak to senior people across the public sector I don't think they expected that the Integrity Commission would be as public and as resolute in pursuing its agenda as it has been.


Let's look at the arguments against a national integrity commission, because we should understand that there are groups—sections of the media and academia, the public sector and many elected officials—who, while not in any way arguing that corruption should be ignored or underplayed, do not believe that a national anticorruption body is the best means to deal with problems of corruption that may exist.


The Senate select committee report found that the arguments put forward by those opposed to a national integrity commission could be put into two broad categories. The first was the argument that a lower risk, and a lower level, of corruption at the federal level reduces the need for an overarching anticorruption body. This is an argument that requires further investigation, in my view. The second argument was that there is already a strong anticorruption framework in place that has proved successful at preventing and revealing corruption in the limited cases where it has occurred. This too, I think, warrants more detailed consideration.


In conclusion, the task of the re-established Senate select committee is to examine whether a new national anticorruption commission would strengthen and improve our current integrity framework and, if so, to examine the pros and cons of the various models for such a body, taking into account the lessons learned from the experiences of existing state anticorruption bodies. If a new body is recommended, there are two broad models on which such a national integrity commission could be based—a statutory agency within the Attorney-General's Department or a standalone national integrity commission with the powers of a standing royal commission.


Another key issue to be examined by the re-established Senate Select Committee would be the extent to which the proceedings of a national integrity commission would be public. Other important matters to be discussed could include questions such as: who would be covered by a national integrity commission? That is a point that Senator Macdonald was, in his way, raising. Another question could be: who would oversee a national integrity commission?


As I have already said, the Senate select committee did not complete its work prior to the last election, which is why Labor strongly supports yesterday's Senate determination to re-establish the committee to build on the work already done. Its primary function will be to carefully consider the pros and cons of the establishment of a national integrity commission and the various models that have been proposed. That is work which has not really been part of the discussion that has occurred while this bill has been addressed. Labor is open to the idea that a dedicated federal anticorruption body may be required but, at this stage, a case for one has not been made and it definitely has not been made through the discussions on this bill.

"Roberts, Sen Malcolm",PHON,2017-02-09,"



Senator ROBERTS
 (Queensland) (10:29):  As a servant to the people of Queensland and Australia, I have to express that I am staggered yet not surprised by the Greens' motion. We oppose this window-dressing that is merely the ghost of Senator Milne. We have all we need to do our jobs in this parliament. Yet clearly, in listening to the people of Queensland, people think parliament is not doing its job. We know that. This is now an admission by the Greens that they are not doing their job. Instead of speaking to sell, why don't the Green start to listen to learn?


Accountability in this parliament, as I have said very often, is almost nonexistent in some areas. So let's consider a key area of concern to the Greens—climate. On that area they contradict empirical scientific evidence and fabricate claims. On their claims, this parliament has been railroaded into wasting tens of billions of dollars of taxpayer money. That is not accountability. It is all based on a lie. The renewable policy right now is killing South Australian manufacturing. It is a deindustrialisation policy that the Greens are submitting this country too. It is a deindustrialisation policy that is being ignored by the government of South Australia and by the Xenophon Team and others in this parliament. Now we have the Western Australian Liberals wanting to take up a 50 per cent renewable energy target. Yet there is no evidence anywhere for this—none at all. The only evidence we have is that it is doing enormous damage. The accountability is low, and the Greens are leading this destruction and industrialisation of our country. 


We need, and we have been talking about requesting, an inquiry into climate science and fraud, but the Greens run whenever we mention that. The Greens, yet again, want to spend more money, raise more money and raise more taxes to spend on yet another body that is superfluous. That is so typical of the Greens: red tape, green tape and blue tape from the UN. The Greens are tying up this country, deindustrialising this country, when what we need is to reindustrialise and get on the reindustrialisation highway. 


To do that, what we are proposing is a transparency portal. This will solve the issue of low accountability. It can all work within the parliament and the government. I made an announcement to this effect in Bundaberg in December. It was very well received. What it means is that in real time expenses are put up for public access on a website of the federal government and each of the state governments, and that reveals everyone's spending, including the Greens' travel. That has led to immediate savings of millions of dollars in the states of the United States that have adopted that. If you do not want to call it a transparency portal, make it the integrity portal. 


The last point I wish to make in opposing this bill from Senator Ludlam is that this is yet another example of control versus freedom. In a free environment in this parliament and in the public domain the Greens use lies, smears and labels to suppress debate. In a free environment they go straight to control. What do they want to do? They want to bring in a body that can be corrupted, as it has become in New South Wales, and they want to use that as a masquerade, supposedly to increase accountability. This is just more window-dressing. The Greens are very good at window-dressing. Instead of this excursion, this detour, we need to get back to fundamental accountability and run this parliament in a way that is in accordance with our constitution to restore accountability. I oppose this Greens bill.

"Rice, Sen Janet",AG,2017-02-09,"



Senator RICE
 (Victoria) (10:32):  I rise to speak on the National Integrity Commission Bill 2013. The Greens' position on supporting a national anticorruption agency is longstanding and based on the need to be shining a light on the murkiness that lies beneath a lot of what goes on in Australian politics and business. We have Senator Roberts over here off on his flights of fancy, which are so much more based on his narcissism and his focus that everything that he is says is right, ignoring the reality of the science of climate change, which, as we know, is accepted by 97 per cent or more of the world's scientists. We currently have the Australian Meteorological and Oceanographic Society having their conference in Canberra this week. We have just had Canberra having its hottest year on record. We have just had climate records smashed around the world. Scientists have moved on from discussing climate change to recognising the seriousness of it. Yet Senator Roberts and his One Nation crew are off on their flights of fancy that bear no relationship at all to reality and certainly no relationship to science. If we are to have an inquiry into climate change we may as well have an inquiry into gravity. We have the basic laws of physics and chemistry. Climate change is real. Dangerous global warming is happening.


Clearly the issue of corruption and the need for an integrity commission or an anticorruption commission strikes a raw nerve, because people do not want to believe it is happening. The Labor Party for a long time have been very reluctant and resistant to supporting the Greens' call. Since Bob Brown introduced the Greens' National Integrity Commissioner Bill in 2010 there have been seven years in this parliament. But we are pleased that finally, in the last weeks, they have recognised that this is something that the community see as important and that people want to have happening; they want to have that light shone on the murky world of donations and potential corruption. So we are pleased that they have come on board with their support for an inquiry into the need for a anticorruption body. But we believe the evidence is there. We believe that there is strong evidence that an anticorruption body is really needed. We do not think that it is necessary to go off to an inquiry. Of course, if this inquiry happens we will participate, and we believe that the evidence that will come out of that inquiry will be very strong and will show that there is a need for a really thorough, well resourced, expansive anticorruption agency at the national level, just as there is at state level in the states that already have one.


Senator Macdonald's contribution was amusing, basically. He said, 'Don't worry; not a problem.' The issue is that if you are in the dark, you cannot see that there is a problem. I think that is where the current government is at. I heard the government get up yesterday and say, 'No, not a problem; we don't need one; there is no evidence of corruption so therefore it's not happening.' Senator Macdonald based a lot of his speech on the fact that we already have an agency—the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity. When he was speaking I thought, let's have a look at what people feel about how comprehensive and suitable and well-resourced, how capable of dealing with these issues ACLEI is. I pulled up an article from The Sydney Morning Herald in May last year. I think the heading of that article tells you a lot. It really summarises the issue with ACLEI. The headline was, 'The mouse versus the dragon: law enforcement struggles against alleged customs drug network.' This article documented the issues of the underresourcing and lack of powers that ACLEI has to deal with the issue of drug smuggling across our borders.


This article notes that ACLEI is far smaller than most of its state anti-corruption counterparts and is also reliant on the resources of the agencies it is meant to oversee to run complex operations. In particular, it is reliant upon the Australian Federal Police. So when this issue of drug smuggling was finally passed to the Federal Police, a senior AFP officer initially deemed the evidence insufficient to begin a probe. So, yet, more drugs passed through the border. Time after time, there is evidence to show that the resources and the extent of the powers available to ACLEI are just insufficient. ACLEI's ability to investigate serious corruption was expressed as 'woeful' during a probe at Sydney airport. One security source quoted in this article said that, basically, to fight this threat to the nation's borders 'ACLEI needs to be ten-dupled in size'. The article said:


Says another anti-corruption fighter who has worked alongside ACLEI on highly sensitive jobs: ""They are heavily reliant on the AFP. The trouble is when you are that reliant, it infects the sort of jobs ACLEI will take on.""


This source also has concerns about ACLEI's decision to avoid public hearings into corruption, despite having the power to hold them. ACLEI is also reluctant to engage with the media about its operations, meaning the public rarely finds out about the true extent of corruption, cultural problems and management failures in the nation's border security agencies.


Clearly, ACLEI is doing what it can with resources and powers available to it. But it is not sufficient. It is not a substitute for a broad, wide-ranging integrity commission, which is what the Greens have been calling for now for seven years.


Senator Macdonald also said that there was no evidence, and said hat we have good global ratings for having clean politics. He quoted that Transparency International was not concerned about us. In fact, Transparency International twice in the last 10 years has expressed concern. There was a joint study by Griffith University and Transparency International in 2005 that recommended that a new independent statutory authority be tasked as a comprehensive lead agency for investigation and prevention of official corruption, criminal activity and serious misconduct involving Commonwealth officials. Then, as recently as 2013, Transparency International Australia called for a federal anti-corruption body to be established following reports about Centrelink tenancy leases. There is a clear case that has been established over many years for the need for an integrity commission of the type that the Greens have been calling for.


In particular, the issue which seems to really strike a raw nerve is the issue of the influence of political donations. Our donation system in Australia operates like the downstream waters of Melbourne's Yarra River. Upstream of Melbourne, the river is pure and clean, and a place that we can be proud of. But the further we go down the river the muddier it gets. No-one would want to drink that water. And this is the problem.


As recently as this morning, there was an article on the ABC website with information about political donations. They begin the article by saying:


Companies, organisations and individuals arguably make political donations for one reason only: to influence Australian politics.


They outline a dataset of where the donations have flowed 'to reveal the industries,' as they say, 'and people using their riches in a bid to buy influence.' The influence of political donations is corrupting Australian politics. Exactly how and where and which companies—we do not know because we do not have the tools to investigate it. All we know is it is extremely murky. We do not have the information to actually be able to pinpoint and do the investigation to find out which of these resource companies have actually been unduly using their influence and which decisions have been unduly influenced by those donations that of been made. But what we do know is that a huge amount of money is being handed over by donors—and, as the ABC said, for one reason only: to influence Australian politics. In 2016, there was: $6½ million from individuals; $3½ million from property and construction businesses; $1.8 million from resources; $1.7 million from unions; $1.2 million from pharmaceutical and health companies. This level of donation really shows that there is a reason why these companies are making donations. We can see exactly the influence it has. It becomes very, very murky. Whether it is gambling or pokies, cigarettes or alcohol, property development, the big roads lobby, or fossil fuels—decisions are being made that are not in the public interest. 




Senator O'Sullivan:
  You people got the biggest donation. You got $1.5 million.




Senator RICE:
   Or worse—they are completely destructive.




Senator O'Sullivan:
  Why don't you talk about the $1.5 million you got?




Senator RICE:
  I will take that interjection from Senator O'Sullivan. Yes, there was a donation made by Graeme Wood to the Greens. It is no longer the biggest individual donation to a party. That was surpassed during the last election. But, yes, Graeme Wood was very, very concerned about climate change. He wanted to see action; he knew that the future of the world depends upon us taking serious, urgent, dramatic action on climate change, and he saw that the Greens were a vehicle to get more action on climate change. We know the seriousness of climate change. We know that both the Liberal and Labor parties are not taking that action. And he saw that, too. The people of Australia saw that, too.




Senator O'Sullivan:
  What do you get for $1.5 million?




Senator RICE:
  What he got was: he supported the Greens in being able to run a strong campaign focused upon needing to take urgent action to set up the framework that we could be taking action—the whole clean energy framework.




Senator O'Sullivan:
  You are hypocrites!




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Ketter
):  Order! Senators are entitled to be heard in silence without interjection.




Senator RICE:
  In fact, the level of resources helped the Greens run a very successful campaign and ended up helping to give us the balance of power in the lower house and the balance of power in the Senate in that 2010 election. Together with the Labor Party, we put in place a framework for tackling climate change that we are very proud of. It has been ripped apart by your government in the years since, doing huge damage to our ability to take serious action on climate change and basically making Australia complicit in actions around the world that are seriously putting the future of our planet at risk. I am very proud of the fact that we have run a very strong campaign and that people want to support us—from Graeme Wood to the hundreds of thousands of people who support the Greens by giving small amounts like $20 in a very transparent, accountable way—to get action that serves the interests of a sustainable future for us all.


But look at the murkiness of other donations where we are not so clear about what the outcomes are. Look at the influence of Transurban on Victorian roads policy at the moment. I have no evidence that there is corruption there, and I am not claiming that there is corruption there, but there is not transparency and there is not accountability. What we know is that Transurban put to the Victorian government a market-led proposal to build the Western Distributor. We know that the Victorian government, at the time of the last election, suddenly changed their direction from having a different road to aiming to build this road that Transurban are proposing. There is huge amount of concern about the benefit that Transurban are going to get out of this and about the influence that they had on the Victorian government. It is not just the Greens who are concerned about this; in fact, there was considerable concern about it in the HeraldSun this morning. Conservative columnist Terry McCrann—somebody who I very rarely agree with—said:


It's also been far too easy for governments — especially Labor ones — to do deals with Transurban. Transurban pays the upfront bill; the government doesn't have to borrow.


We all get a new or bigger road. You just let the meter run a few years more.


That means that it is just a few more years of huge profits being made by Transurban, which, on the face of it, is not in the public interest. People think, 'Well, the government doesn't need to borrow,' but that money is being paid by communities, paid by the people who have to pay those tolls. They have no option but to pay those tolls. There will be a massive increase in the tolls being paid to Transurban and a massive impact on ordinary people because of the influence that Transurban have had upon the Victorian government.


We have the ongoing issue of those private sector interests—the roads lobby and the influence they are having—but there is also the issue of the broader influence of the fossil fuel companies and the millions of dollars in donations that they make. That is happening across the world. We are seeing that in the United States, with President Trump doing the bidding of those who want to pollute the planet, speeding up catastrophic global warming just for their own selfish, short-term greed. They want to keep on polluting, and they have a lot of money to be able influence governments to keep on polluting to serve their interests. They will keep on doing it for as long as they can get away with it.


Meanwhile, the planet is in a desperate state. We know that we need to pull back from fossil fuels being emitted. We know we have to transition to renewable energy. Everyone knows that that is the direction we need to head in—at least anyone who has any sense and any skerrick of a scientific understanding—and yet, because of the influence of the fossil fuel lobby, we are continuing to pollute in massive, unacceptable ways.


And now we have a government that is saying that suddenly coal is the new black again and that we are talking about clean coal. There is no such thing as clean coal. We get told that clean coal is clean because it is 30 per cent less polluting than other coal. I tell you: if we are going to protect the planet from dangerous climate change and if we going to protect ordinary people and our agricultural systems from climate change, 30 per cent cleaner is not good enough. We have to get down to zero carbon pollution as quickly as possible, so clean coal does not cut it.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  A point of order, Senator Bushby?




Senator Bushby:
  I understand that Senator Rice is very passionate about climate change, but we are here to discuss the National Integrity Commission Bill. I understand the path that led her to where she is, but I think she is off topic now.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Senator Bushby. It is a wide-ranging debate, and we do canvass a range of issues, but I ask you, Senator Rice, to try to remain as relevant as possible to the matter at hand.




Senator RICE:
  I am happy to respond to Senator Bushby because in fact it is absolutely germane to this debate. We are continuing to pollute the planet in the way we are because of the influence of those fossil fuel companies corrupting the political system.


The Greens want to shine a light. We need to clean up that river because at the moment the waters of where those donations are going and what influence they are having are just too murky. We want to see a national anticorruption commission, an independent statutory agency that we would be able to rely upon to shine a light on what is going on. With that, I seek leave to continue my remarks later.


Leave granted; debate adjourned.

The PRESIDENT:  Is leave granted?




Senator Fifield:
  Can he do that after we have called on legislation?



The PRESIDENT:  Senator Fifield, in consultation with the Clerk, I am thinking about what you have just interjected to Senator McKim. The appropriate time would have been before we called upon business. I am in the hands of the Senate. If the Senate does not wish for you to be heard in the manner that you have been heard, then we will proceed with business. If the Senate wishes for you to be availed of the opportunity to seek leave, I am in the hands of the Senate. 




Senator Brandis:
  As the Manager of Government Business has pointed out, we have now embarked upon the consideration of the National Integrity Commission Bill 2013. This is not really a question of seeking to suspend standing orders, because we are embarked upon the consideration of a particular listed item of business. If Senator McKim wanted to seek leave to make a statement, he should have sought leave before we had embarked upon the business. We have now embarked upon the business. When that business is concluded in the orderly conduct of the Senate, that is the time for Senator McKim to seek leave to make a statement.



The PRESIDENT:  Thank you. I concur, Senator Brandis.




Senator McKim:
  Could I seek your guidance, please, Mr President. I accept your ruling, obviously, on this matter. Could you advise me whether I can now move to suspend standing orders, or do I have an option to ask that the consideration of private members business be put aside in order that I can either seek leave or move to suspend standing orders?



The PRESIDENT:  I understand what you are asking, Senator McKim. No, you cannot. You can do things between items of business, but we have embarked upon an item of business and clearly you did not rise in your seat until after I had called upon the Clerk to call on business. There was opportunity prior to that for you to do that. But at other times during the day there will be junctures where you could take that course of action and seek leave to make a comment or statements. What course of action you take, whether that leave is granted or not, is a matter for you. I have called the Clerk, we have moved on to business and I call the first speaker.

"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2017-02-09,"



Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia—Co-Deputy Leader of the Australian Greens) (09:34):  I thank Senator Rhiannon for bringing this bill forward. It is entirely appropriate given what happened over the summer recess and the incredible series of indignities that the public has been exposed to. This is an incredibly important issue. We are all aware, no matter what side of politics we are on—but we are keenly aware of it up here, on the crossbench—that public confidence in parliament and parliamentarians is at an all time low. Certainly, I have been working in this building for a little over 10 years and I have never known a time when contempt for the conduct of MPs at a state and federal level has been higher. That is something that everybody who works in this building needs to bear a measure of responsibility for. We in the Australian Greens are aware that there are things that we can do to lead by example that can help restore a measure of confidence. One of those things that the Greens have been pursuing essentially for as long as we have been a political party is a national anti-corruption commission.


I want to talk a little bit about the Western Australian context in a moment, but firstly I want to go through a little bit of the history and remind senators of how long this issue has been running for. In 2010, Greens Senator Bob Brown introduced the National Integrity Commissioner Bill. In 2012 our member for Melbourne, Adam Bandt, introduced a similar bill into the House of Representatives. In 2013 Senator Christine Milne introduced a National Integrity Commission Bill. In 2015 Senator Rhiannon introduced a motion calling for a national anti-corruption body and political donations reform. I can remember sitting here on the crossbench and having that motion voted down by the Labor Party and the Liberal Party. If my memory serves me, a substantial number of crossbenchers supported the Greens and of course the major parties did not. In 2016 Senator Rhiannon reintroduced the National Integrity Commission Bill. How long is this debate going to need to run for? We have been prosecuting this case in here for more than a decade. The public support for a measure of this sort has never been higher. We are elected in here to represent the public interest, not to line our own pockets and not to set up future career paths in the mining industry, the banking sector or the gambling industry. We are here to serve the public interest. There would probably be a substantial number of people listening to this broadcast or checking in online who are choking over their coffee at the idea that that is what politicians come in here to do. What better way to begin to restore confidence in the work that is done in here than a national anticorruption commission?


I will take an interjection from Senator Rhiannon if she is able to remind me how many New South Wales politicians were eventually prosecuted or went to jail.




Senator Rhiannon:
  It is very hard to count, but 11 Liberal MPs.




Senator LUDLAM:
  Eleven Liberal MPs! I will take that interjection, Senator Rhiannon.



The PRESIDENT:  That is a little bit disorderly and cheeky, Senator Ludlam. Interjections are disorderly.




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  You might talk about all the Labor people in jail for worse than corruption, Senator Ludlam.




Senator LUDLAM:
  Hit a bit of a nerve, have we, Senator Macdonald? I've missed you so much!



Senator Ian Macdonald interjecting—




Senator LUDLAM:
  Yes, that is right.



The PRESIDENT:  To the chair, Senator Ludlam.




Senator LUDLAM:
  Through you, Mr President—



The PRESIDENT:  To me, not through me.




Senator LUDLAM:
  Yes, senior Labor MPs—ministers. Senator Macdonald is quite right: there is mud on both sides.




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  And on your own team.




Senator LUDLAM:
  I do not actually believe any Greens MP at any level of parliament or local government, state or federal, has ever suffered the kind of indignity and accusations of corruption that your side of politics, Senator Macdonald, and the Labor side of politics have been subjected to.




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  What about the last Senate election in Western Australia, where you weren't elected?




Senator LUDLAM:
  Let's talk about Western Australia.




Senator Siewert:
  I beg your pardon!



Senator Ian Macdonald interjecting—



The PRESIDENT:  Order! Senator Macdonald and Senator Siewert, order!



Senator Siewert interjecting—



The PRESIDENT:  Order, Senator Siewert! Senators, if you wish to have a discussion about this across the chamber, leave the chamber and do it outside. Senator Ludlam has the call. Senator Ludlam, you may continue.




Senator LUDLAM:
  Thanks, President. Going to Western Australia, a little bit before my time in politics, WA Inc is a name that probably lives on in infamy, when the stench of corruption in the state Labor government, going back into the 1980s and 1990s, became impossible to ignore. The government was eventually rolled out of office on that basis.


I acknowledge that the practice of anticorruption commissions at a state level is extremely uneven and there is not really consistency in the way that these commissions operate, but we know that a major missing piece of the architecture is that no such thing exists at a federal level. The Australian Greens' proposal has been on the Hansard for more than 10 years, if senators would care to go back and analyse what it is that we have been proposing, but I will just remind senators—



Senator Jacinta Collins interjecting—




Senator LUDLAM:
  I am sorry, Senator Collins? People are so rowdy this morning, President. I do not know if I am being unusually provocative.



The PRESIDENT:  Ignore the interjections, Senator Ludlam. Senators, do not interject.




Senator LUDLAM:
  I am doing my best here. The proposal that the Greens have put forward and that Senator Rhiannon has put on the Notice Paper today is effectively a threefold body: a law enforcement integrity commissioner—so effectively taking the existing Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity and rolling it into a body that will then incorporate a national integrity commissioner and an independent parliamentary adviser. The independent parliamentary adviser, you would imagine, would be the sort of person who would advise—before the fact rather than after—on helicopter charters, for example, or trips to polo matches, or taxpayer funded trips to weddings in India, or the various other disgraceful activities through which MPs in this building have eventually had their careers terminated—not through any kind of due process but effectively by public outrage. We saw it happen with the health minister over the summer break: pad out your investment portfolio with spontaneous purchases of investment properties on the Gold Coast—a brilliant idea!—and then have the taxpayer pick up the tab for the flights, the Comcars and whatever else.


These are the sorts of activities that MPs can avoid finding themselves enmeshed in if you have an independent parliamentary adviser. I do not believe the helicopter charters from Mrs Bishop or the taxpayer funded investment property splurge are grey areas at all, but anybody who has spent any time in here would be aware that there are grey areas around the use of entitlements, or the fact that they are even called entitlements at all. All of us from time to time could use somebody—an independent umpire on the end of the phone line—to ring up and say, 'I don't know about this; is this within the rules or not?' So an independent parliamentary adviser is a really important part of this.


The third body, obviously, is a national integrity commissioner. That is where the rubber hits the road. That is where you discover the kind of activities that destroyed a Labor government in WA and that have so disfigured politics in New South Wales. I think probably all of us representing the states and territories around the country would be very well aware that there is no level of government that has not from time to time been tainted with a hint—or a lot more than a hint—of corruption. Why would we imagine, as a government senator—I forget exactly who it was—tried to put to us yesterday, that at the Commonwealth tier of government, dealing with enormous sums of money and with very close contacts between ministers and industry and diaries that are not released into the public domain, we would be somehow magically immune? I think it is absolutely essential that we have this final—or not final but important—piece of institutional architecture, a corruption oversight body looking after what goes on in this chamber and in the other place just across the building.


I want to come to a couple of examples that are much closer to home. It was rather extraordinary again to hear a government spokesperson yesterday tell us we do not need a national anticorruption watchdog and it is better if this sort of thing is diffused throughout the Public Service. The minister is effectively saying, 'We'd rather nobody was in charge; we'd rather there was nobody where the buck stopped to keep an eye on this, unearth corruption, be able to take evidence and be able to be the person where the buck stops.' They would rather that that be diffused and that it not really be anybody's responsibility. I do not know if it is the first time that that form of argument has been run, but I found it peculiar and entirely unconvincing.


An example of where I think we could use this kind of body is in the Western Australian context. You will be aware, because Senator Siewert and I have been raising this matter for many years—as have Senator Lines and Senator Sterle—of the matter of the Perth Freight Link, the so-called Roe 8 extension back in Western Australia. It was announced very suddenly by the Liberal government right before the 2013 federal election. It is one of these dead dogs of a policy from former Prime Minister Tony Abbott that is still stinking up the place. There is WestConnex, there is the East West Link and there is Roe Highway. It is one of those kinds of zombie policies, a tremendously expensive one, that refuses to fall over. That was $1.2 billion of Australian taxpayers' money committed on a whim, effectively signed off on the back of an envelope by former Prime Minister Tony Abbott, with no business case and no public cost-benefit analysis. 


And, what do you know, the contract has been awarded—by the state government, I should say, not the Commonwealth—to a consortium of companies led by Leighton Holdings. I do not know if this was anything to do with brand damage, but they renamed themselves CIMIC a little while ago. They are a massive donor to the Liberal Party. Leighton have donated nearly $700,000 to the WA Liberal and National parties. That buys a lot of TV time, doesn't it? That buys a lot of access. That buys a lot of quiet conversations. These old private-school networks, old boys clubs, are greased by a $700,000 political donation—all above board, nothing illegal. That is $700,000 to the Liberal and National parties.


This is a corporation that is bidding for a massive government contract. So, for your $700,000—entirely above board—you can go in to bid for a $1.2 billion engineering and construction contracts. That is a clear conflict of interest. No wonder trust in the institutions, with that queasy interface between commerce and politics, is at an all-time low.


We think that it is time to ban political donations from for-profit corporations. I know that is going to cause a degree of hyperventilation from the other end of the chamber because it is that money that helped put you here, but we think that these things should be banned. Leighton is a $6.3 billion company; it runs mining, construction and engineering projects all around the globe; and it has been described as company where corrupt practices were absolutely endemic. Highly paid senior executives used a range of bribery techniques, including kickbacks to subcontractors, special payments to procure contracts, and facilitation payments. So, while these bribery incidents occurred overseas, Leighton's involvement with Australian government funded projects has been questioned. Who would you put these kinds of questions to? At the moment, there is nobody. There is nobody that you can put these kinds of questions to.


As I said, Leighton now operate under the name of CIMIC, after corruption allegations came to light in 2013. So that's fine—just change the name! We do not know whether those practices have changed, whether the corporate culture has changed or whether these kinds of under-the-table activities are occurring here in Australia, because there is nobody tasked to find out. 


In 2013, The Sydney Morning Herald reported 'Building giant Leighton rife with corruption', and they disclosed evidence of massive bribery and corruption in the way that contracts were being won around the world—most notoriously, the multimillion-dollar kickbacks paid to win contracts in Iraq, which were later investigated by the Australian Federal Police. As recently as 31 January of this year, the Herald reported 'Building giant Leighton rife with corruption', and I want to quote from that article:


In revelations that will cause international embarrassment for Australia and raise questions about the role of the nation's corporate watchdog, the files expose plans to pay alleged multimillion-dollar kickbacks in Iraq, Indonesia, Malaysia and elsewhere, along with other serious corporate misconduct.


Hundreds of confidential company documents, obtained during a six-month Fairfax Media investigation, also reveal a culture of rewarding corruption or incompetence, and abysmal corporate governance in what looms as the worst recent case of corporate corruption involving a major Australian firm.


So they can throw down $700,000 here in Australia and, as if by magic, through some black-box tendering process that is shrouded in commercial-in-confidence—this parliament has not been able to assess exactly why that contract was won or whether the contract represents value for money—they nailed down a $1.2 billion construction contract for a completely pointless road, a freight highway through an important wetland area, an area of enormous significance to Aboriginal people, an area of very high neighbourhood amenity, an area that has being dubbed the Kings Park of the south. Anybody from Western Australia will know that this is an area of extraordinary biodiversity and of extraordinary value to the community, and it is being torn in half, effectively, by this project.


I want to acknowledge Senator Rhiannon's work, particularly on the Democracy for Sale site. In many ways, our New South Wales colleagues are a bit ahead of the curve, presumably because—knowing a little bit about the way politics have worked in New South Wales in the past—it has been essential that the New South Wales Greens have held the major parties to account, partly because the institutions have not really been there to do so. The Greens have been a really important part, in New South Wales and elsewhere around the country, of holding the major parties to account and trying to throw some sunlight on that interface between corporations, commerce and the political tier.


This weekend, the launch of the Greens WA state election campaign is underway, and I am very proud to foreshadow an announcement that my colleagues will be making on integrity in government—




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  Is that what this is all about—a bit short of votes, are you?




Senator LUDLAM:
  because in WA we know that vested interest groups and wealthy powerbrokers have been able to undermine and influence our democratic system. It is one of the reasons people are fleeing the major parties in droves, including your party, Senator Macdonald. I do not know whether you snoozed through that part of the memo, but you lot are really on the nose, and confidence in government, confidence in the Liberal and National parties, is at an all-time low.


For example, there is the aggressive attack that the mining lobby has thrown into the field against the proposal to increase royalties in Western Australia. The mining industry wields extraordinary power. We saw that in the way that they damaged and ultimately destroyed the prime ministership of former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd. Meanwhile, the government are abusing freedom-of-information requests; they hide behind commercial-in-confidence excuses to keep out of the public eye these slimy deals that they make. 


The Greens believe that a resilient democracy depends on all levels of government being transparent about how these decisions are made. That includes this tier of government. I am looking forward to coalition spokespeople standing up to tell us why there is nothing to see here and why they do not feel the need for an anticorruption watchdog at a Commonwealth level. I am really looking forward to that. Please go ahead, those on the coalition side—because I understand that, after 20 years of campaigning by the Australian Greens, the Labor Party ship, like that oil tanker at sea, may be slowly turning. 


I remember being told by the coalition side when we were debating mandatory data retention that, if you have nothing to hide, you have nothing to fear. Do you remember that? Anybody complaining about overwhelmingly intrusive government surveillance was told, 'If you have nothing to hide, you have nothing to fear.' I think at a personal level, as far as personal privacy is concerned, that argument is completely hollow but, in terms of powerful institutions and in terms of governments writing cheques for billions of dollars at a time to their mates in the construction industry, to oil and gas companies, to engineering companies and to developers, what is it that you have to fear?


I am reasonably sure that when you stand up and try to run counterarguments to this incredibly sensible and longstanding proposal by Senator Rhiannon you are going to tell us that you have nothing to hide. Well then let us see. Let us get these cards on the table. Let us have a national anticorruption watchdog to do the kind of job that is being done in New South Wales and has done so much good, not necessarily to restore confidence in politics and the rule of law but at least to raise the bar to corruption and to increase transparency so that people doing these slimy deals behind closed doors are aware that there may be some consequences. It is about time that those consequences fell due at a Commonwealth level.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2017-02-09,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (09:53):  My contempt knows no end for parliamentarians who use this cowards' castle to play the populist game to further their own careers by innuendo, making claims against individual Australians, corporations and colleagues in this place. We have just heard such a speech. It would be very easy for me to join the populist bandwagon and refer, as some of the lazy media did, to Senator Siewert's travel expenses. I was the first to defend Senator Siewert because she, after me, is one of the hardest-working parliamentarians in this place. She is the chair or the deputy chair of several committees. Her travel expenses are large, but, hang on, she happens to live in Perth and represent Western Australia. Of course, to get to Canberra she has to fly a lot. I know I rarely agree with Senator Siewert, but I do acknowledge she is one of the most committed and hardworking politicians here.


One of the others who were attacked by the populist press—and supported by people like Senator Ludlam, no doubt—was the member for Lingiari. His travel expenses are high. Well, what a surprise. He lives in Darwin. He represents the Cocos (Keeling) Islands. He comes to Canberra half of the year to do what he is paid to do. Of course his travel expenses are high.


It is easy for politicians and lazy journalists to make these complaints by innuendo. I challenge Senator Ludlam. He spent 20 minutes denigrating Australian citizens, Australian corporations and politicians. If he has one skerrick, one iota, one little bit, of evidence, please refer it to the existing watchdog. Jason Clare, a Labor member of parliament, said in 2012:


ACLEI has the powers of a standing Royal Commission. It has the power to coerce people to give evidence, to hold public hearings, to execute search warrants, to tap phones and to conduct digital and physical surveillance and it has used these powers in this case—


in the case he was talking about. If Senator Ludlam has just one skerrick of evidence to back up the disgraceful, dishonest speech that he has just made, he should go and see ACLEI. If he is too stupid to find their phone number, I will give it to him. I will text it to him.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Macdonald, it is not very pleasant to refer to Senator Ludlam in that way. If you could withdraw, thank you.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  I withdraw 'stupid'. If he is so base that he cannot find the phone number of ACLEI, I will text it to him. Australia already has zero tolerance to corruption in all of its forms and so does particularly this government. We do not support the Craig Thomsons of this world. We are determined to have zero tolerance to corruption. 


We have strong laws and a robust, multiagency approach to combating corruption. A range of agencies play a role in preventing, detecting and responding to corruption. We have ACLEI, the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity, which I have already mentioned. The AFP-hosted fraud and anticorruption centre brings together a range of Commonwealth agencies to respond to serious fraud and corruption matters, including government services, programs and employees. The Commonwealth provided an additional $15 million to that centre in April last year under the coalition government. This framework provides significant coverage of fraud and corruption across Australian government agencies, with particular focus on areas of high corruption risk.


I do not cast aspersions or innuendos on anyone, but in the exchange I had with Senator Siewert earlier I raised the issue of the missing bundle of votes in Western Australia from the last Senate election. What happened to them? I know you do not know, Mr Acting Deputy President Sterle, neither, unfortunately, do the Australian Federal Police, although in their evidence to the electoral matters committee—




Senator Siewert:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. Senator Macdonald is going into I think very dangerous territory. He is about to make certain accusations. It is unparliamentary and I ask you to ask him not to go there.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Sterle
):  Senator Siewert, I have just walked in and sat in the chair. I have heard about two sentences from Senator Macdonald. I can consult with the clerks, but at this stage I am not going to. I am going to give Senator Macdonald the call and I will take it from there.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  That was the most curious point of order I have ever heard. Senator Siewert was interpreting what I am going to say next.



Senator Siewert interjecting—




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  You are making a point of order on something that you think, in your funny mind, I might be about to say. I had finished my comments on the 2013 election. All I will say is that the Federal Police indicated to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters that there was certainly something wrong but they were unable to find out why. I might say, Senator Siewert, after defending you—and I will continue to defend you because I know you are honest and I know you work incredibly hard—that you will never find me taking a cheap shot at you over that. I will take a shot at some of your hypocritical policies, yes, but not—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Macdonald, I ask that you direct your comments through the chair. Senator Ludlam, on a point of order?




Senator Ludlam:
  That was my point of order. Senator Macdonald has been in here for hundreds of years. He knows that he needs to direct his comments through you, Mr Acting Deputy President.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  You always know when you are making a point that the Greens are embarrassed about, because they will make those ridiculous points of order simply to curtail me. I will not go into the matter of the largest single donation to any political party in the history of Australia.





Senator Cash:
  Please do.



Senator Ludlam interjecting—



Senator Siewert interjecting—




Senator Jacinta Collins:
  Malcolm's is bigger now.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Hang on—Malcolm Turnbull puts his own money in his own re-election. I did not want to mention Mr Wood's name, but the biggest single donation to a political party ever in Australian history went to the Greens political party. I happen to be on a committee where the then Greens leader sought to get an exemption from some form of Commonwealth tax for those who might want to set up an online newspaper. I am not going to join the dots together on which person it was that was trying to do that. I will just say that I wish ACLEI had been around at the time.


So we have these holier-than-thou people come here, casting aspersions by innuendo, but can I tell them I have good news for them. The government has announced a bill coming forward shortly to set up an authority to oversee parliamentary allowances. I am sure the Greens will support the amendment that I will be moving to that bill. I, not the government, will be moving the amendment to that bill to include public servants in the same authority.


I very rarely read The Canberra Times, but I saw an editorial in The Canberra Times. It was published just the other day, but it was referring to editorial from last month. It is called 'Time to expose bureaucrats' wayward spending, too?' and it has the subheading 'Transparency'. I make the point that I have found every Commonwealth bureaucrat that I have ever had dealings with—and I had some very close dealings when I was a minister, and in estimates since—to be incredibly dedicated, incredibly honest, very transparent and great servants of the Australian people. But the bureaucracy is enormous, and you only have to read this article in The Canberra Times to realise that there should be, perhaps, the same accountability and openness for the hundreds of thousands, certainly tens of thousands, of Commonwealth bureaucrats who help govern Australia. There are infinitely more than there are politicians in this chamber, most of whom have infinitely more power and spending capability than anyone in Parliament House. So I would think that it is time to widen the net—perhaps to the judiciary as well, perhaps to some of these tribunals and perhaps to institutions and statutory authorities like the Human Rights Commission. Maybe we should have the same transparency from them, but we never hear from the Greens. We never hear that too often from the Labor Party either, I might say, but what a good idea.


I am quite certain, after hearing Senator Ludlam, that he will be seconding my amendment when I bring it to this chamber. I suspect there are not going to be too many on my side to second it, but I am sure after that rousing speech by Senator Ludlam that he and his party will be supporting the extension of this parliamentarians oversight committee to the Public Service. I notice Senator Ludlam and the Greens are all of a sudden finding something very important to talk about and will not listen to this, but let me have your assurance that I will have your support in moving this amendment.


Australia has consistently been ranked by Transparency International‎ as one of the least corrupt countries in the world. That is because we have these institutions. We have accountability and openness among parliamentarians that, quite frankly, is beyond understanding. There is even this great battle, which the shadow Attorney-General seems to be fixated on, about wanting parliamentarians to indicate to the world who they see, what they see, when they see them, where they are going to be and where they have been. It is great news for a would-be criminal or someone who is intent on criminal activity against parliamentarians, under the guise of accountability. This parliament is where you call ministers to account. This parliament is where you ask them what they have been doing or where they have been doing it. The shadow Attorney-General seems fixated—dare I use that terminology—on exposing the activities of the Attorney-General. Mind you, the Attorney-General is the minister in charge of security in this nation, and the shadow Attorney-General wants his diary to be made public. I guess it will not be long before mine is asked for too—although you do not have to worry about mine; I put on Facebook where I am going to be all the time. That is no secret.


This Greens bill is again an action by a party that is falling in the polls. Those of us who have been around a long time have seen the Democrats come and go; we have seen One Nation come and go and come back, and it will go again; and we have seen the Greens come and I predicted sometime ago that they would go in Europe, and they are going, and I predicted sometime ago that they would go in Australia, and they are on the downward climb now. They used to attract a bit of a protest vote from those who did not like the government, who did not like the Labor Party, but I am sorry, guys in the Greens—through you, Mr Acting Deputy President—that protest vote is now going to One Nation and we will, fortunately, see the end of the hypocrisy in a policy sense of the Greens political party. Australia will be a better place for that.


The Greens are trying to maintain what little support they hold around Australia—around eight per cent at last call, and going southwards—by jumping on the populist bandwagon: every politician, and particularly the Liberal politicians in the Western Australian government, are all bad. Senator Ludlam, who is really the far left extension of the Labor Party—I pity the Labor Party for that; I am sorry you have to bow to their wishes—forgot to mention all the Labor politicians in jail for very serious offences. But that is the Greens way. You will never hear Senator Rhiannon attack Labor Party politicians, even though in her state there are enormous numbers she could be attacking. Your own political leaning, and your own populist approach to matters, prevents you from doing that, and it shows the dishonesty of the argument of the Greens political party.




Senator Ludlam:
  You're on broadcast.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Good heavens, I would not have guessed that without hearing Senator Ludlam's first speech—always there for broadcast day, always there when he thinks he might be able to resurrect or retain some of the few people who vote for the Greens political party. I think Australians are waking up to the absolute hypocrisy of the Greens, and they now see the Greens under pressure. The Labor Party I think are at last understanding that they really have to separate themselves from the Greens, otherwise the Greens will take over their dwindling support on the left—it still will not save the Greens; it will just take the Greens and the Labor Party down at the same time. These populist parties, who do extract people who say 'a pox on all your houses', have left the Greens and gone elsewhere.


As I said in our party room the other day—I do not want to indicate what was said in the party room but these are my own thoughts, not the party room's thoughts especially—it is about time our leaders—all of our leaders, and Senator Di Natale would be a good start—started emphasising how much work politicians do, how much commitment most of the people who sit in this parliament—most, I might add—have. They are here because they believe in Australia and they believe that they can make a contribution to Australia. By the standards in the community they do not get particularly well-paid, and there are hundreds of examples of that. Someone has to stand up, rather than just Senator Ludlam joining the populist theme and denigrating by innuendo everybody in this chamber and the other chamber, and start arguing for politicians, arguing for parliamentarians, saying why they are there. Most parliamentarians—or those on this side—would have done infinitely better financially staying in their legal practice, staying in their business, staying in their veterinary practice, staying in the jobs they had before. That is not why they have come into this chamber. I will be talking on this again in another bill coming up, and I will be opposing my government and again moving amendments. If the Greens were true to their cause, they would be supporting me too. They might on the authority one, but they will not on the other one. They are without value, without any semblance of directness and honesty, when it comes to policy matters.


We do in Australia at the moment have all of the elements to ensure that Australia, its government, its institutions and its businesses are as corruption free as possible, and certainly we are as good as anyone else in the world. In December last year the government released its first National Action Plan under the Open Government Partnership. This consisted of a number of commitments to advanced transparency, accountability, public participation and technical innovation in Australia over the next two years. As I have foreshadowed, I have a couple of amendments to government bills that, if adopted by the parliament, would add to the role of that plan. I will be seeking the support of other senators—not with a great deal of confidence, I might say, but I will seek that support—and we will see then the rhetoric of the Greens, their nontransparency, their appeal to the populists—those who are leaving the Greens in droves. We will see how they carry on. Australia is not perfect, but we are as good as any other country in the world. We are as good as you possibly can be in a democracy and in a large business operation like the governance of Australia. I will certainly oppose this bill.

"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2017-02-09,"



Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria) (10:14):  I do not intend to continue the slanging match that has been an unfortunate element of the discussion so far here this morning. But, as Senator Ludlam pointed out, we have dealt with the National Integrity Commission Bill 2013 in several different iterations over some time. I went back to the 2010 Bob Brown version of the bill. I am not sure if there was one earlier than that that I have missed, Senator Ludlam. We have had several discussions around this bill, but, in its last iteration, I did not have the opportunity to contribute. As I understand it, we will be moving on to the next matter fairly soon, but I do appreciate the opportunity to deal with some of the substance around how we might deal with issues around integrity and corruption.


Let me say it from the outset: I want to make it clear that Labor stand for integrity and transparency in government, and we have zero tolerance for corruption. But, as we all know, corruption does occur. We cannot pretend that it does not occur at a federal level. Further to Senator Macdonald's comments a moment ago, I seem to recall a recent indication from Transparency International that Australia had actually slipped in their index, and, if that is the case, that is obviously a concern.


I also want to make it clear at the outset that Labor's position in relation to this Greens party bill is that unfortunately it is stale, out of date and, in some respects, obsolete. Had Senator Ludlam—and, I should say, I welcome back Senator Ludlam, and it is great to see him back here in good health—been with us in the last little while, perhaps he might have addressed some of the issues where matters have moved on. I will outline some of those.


As I said, Labor has always fostered and will continue to foster a culture of integrity within Commonwealth public institutions. That is why Labor supports the Australian National Audit Office, the Australian Public Service Commission, the Commonwealth Ombudsman, the Australian Federal Police, the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission and other law enforcement and accountability measures which together help to create a culture of integrity in the public sector. Looking at what has moved on with respect to this bill, one further element that Senator Macdonald touched on is, of course, that Labor in 2012 strengthened ACLEI, and that is part of our broader integrity framework.


There have been periodic calls for some form of a federal anticorruption commission over recent years, including in this private senator's bill. While Labor have zero tolerance for corruption, we believe that the best way to proceed is with the re-establishment of the Senate Select Committee on the establishment of a National Integrity Commission to continue its important inquiry and produce a final report. I recommend to the Senate the interim report, which was tabled back in May of last year, which is a good indicator of the further work that the committee that was established yesterday will conduct.


Labor does not rule out that in the future a dedicated federal anticorruption body may be required. However, our final position on the value and merits of establishing a national integrity commission should not be considered until the completion of this inquiry. That is a considered and sensible approach to take, unlike simply, as Senator Macdonald was suggesting, taking the populist path of rehashing an old proposal that is not even up to date in terms of the current frameworks in place, moving formal motions yesterday and giving this bill yet another consideration today. Some of it is, as I have said, out of date, and it is simply a rehash of many past discussions rather than a means of moving matters forward.


Let us take a closer look at what the Greens are proposing and why the bill is stale and obsolete. It is clear the Greens are behind the game and need to catch up on some significant recent developments, including that just yesterday, as I said, the Senate determined to re-establish the Senate Select Committee on the establishment of a National Integrity Commission. In part, this was a response to recent community frustration and controversy around the entitlement matters that other senators have referred to, culminating in the resignation of disgraced former health minister Sussan Ley.


Another recent and significant development is the government's plan to establish an independent parliamentary expenses authority to advise on and regulate parliamentary expenses. In his address to the National Press Club last Tuesday, Labor leader Bill Shorten made it clear that the opposition agreed in principle with the proposal in an attempt to begin to restore public confidence in the political process. Perhaps, rather than just moving forward this proposed threefold body, if we are to address this matter again, we should improve its currency and address the way in which it is proposed to move forward in relation to the parliamentary entitlements element of this current bill.


As I said, at the moment it represents the same bill that Bob Brown first introduced in 2010 and Christine Milne regurgitated in 2013, and now there is this current version. As I said, I do not think I will address the slanging match issues around political donations, but it is an interesting question about how a body such as this may, and whether the model proposed will, address some of the debate and indeed posturing around political donations.


The Senate Select Committee on the establishment of a National Integrity Commission was established on 24 February last year with Labor's support to inquire into whether a national integrity commission should be set up to address institutional, organisational, political, electoral and individual corruption and misconduct, and I was the deputy chair of that inquiry. The committee, as I have mentioned, published an interim report in May 2016, prior to the dissolution of the parliament for the July election. The interim report includes a discussion about the existing national anticorruption framework and the potential benefits and drawbacks of creating a national anticorruption commissioner. It is worth briefly examining some of the committee's findings and its one recommendation, but it is also important to remember that the committee was unable to complete its work and issue a final report.


The Senate select committee had, as I said, one recommendation:


… that the Australian Government support current and sound future research into potential anti-corruption systems appropriate for Australia …


Griffith University and other partners were looking at conducting that work, and I look forward to an update on what has occurred since the former committee looked at these issues. That was a wise recommendation. The committee was unable to complete its work and it is clear that there is a lot more work still to do before serious consideration can be given to whether some form of anticorruption commission should be established at a federal level to complement existing anticorruption and integrity bodies and, if so, how such a body should operate.


The committee's interim report is a good document and raises some of the key issues for further examination. It lists arguments in favour of a national anticorruption framework, the top of the list being the discovery and investigation of corruption. But the report says:


… a NAC may also improve policy co-ordination, provide leadership and education services, reduce potential jurisdictional gaps, increase administrative efficiency, send an unambiguous signal that the issue of corruption is being taken seriously, and provide confidence to the public that corruption is minimised at the highest level of government.


All states now have broad based anticorruption agencies. The Senate select committee looked at the effectiveness of such bodies. The most recent report into the New South Wales ICAC, published in 2013, found that:


More than two-thirds indicated that the ICAC had been successful at exposing corruption and more than half indicated that the ICAC had been successful at reducing corruption.


Then in October 2015, the outgoing Tasmanian Integrity Commissioner spoke to the ABC about the early years there with an integrity commission. She said:


""I think it's been a bit of a surprise to people that the Integrity Commission's been so effective …


""Often when I speak to senior people across the public sector I don't think they expected that the Integrity Commission would be as public and as resolute in pursuing its agenda as it has been.


Let's look at the arguments against a national integrity commission, because we should understand that there are groups—sections of the media and academia, the public sector and many elected officials—who, while not in any way arguing that corruption should be ignored or underplayed, do not believe that a national anticorruption body is the best means to deal with problems of corruption that may exist.


The Senate select committee report found that the arguments put forward by those opposed to a national integrity commission could be put into two broad categories. The first was the argument that a lower risk, and a lower level, of corruption at the federal level reduces the need for an overarching anticorruption body. This is an argument that requires further investigation, in my view. The second argument was that there is already a strong anticorruption framework in place that has proved successful at preventing and revealing corruption in the limited cases where it has occurred. This too, I think, warrants more detailed consideration.


In conclusion, the task of the re-established Senate select committee is to examine whether a new national anticorruption commission would strengthen and improve our current integrity framework and, if so, to examine the pros and cons of the various models for such a body, taking into account the lessons learned from the experiences of existing state anticorruption bodies. If a new body is recommended, there are two broad models on which such a national integrity commission could be based—a statutory agency within the Attorney-General's Department or a standalone national integrity commission with the powers of a standing royal commission.


Another key issue to be examined by the re-established Senate Select Committee would be the extent to which the proceedings of a national integrity commission would be public. Other important matters to be discussed could include questions such as: who would be covered by a national integrity commission? That is a point that Senator Macdonald was, in his way, raising. Another question could be: who would oversee a national integrity commission?


As I have already said, the Senate select committee did not complete its work prior to the last election, which is why Labor strongly supports yesterday's Senate determination to re-establish the committee to build on the work already done. Its primary function will be to carefully consider the pros and cons of the establishment of a national integrity commission and the various models that have been proposed. That is work which has not really been part of the discussion that has occurred while this bill has been addressed. Labor is open to the idea that a dedicated federal anticorruption body may be required but, at this stage, a case for one has not been made and it definitely has not been made through the discussions on this bill.

"Roberts, Sen Malcolm",PHON,2017-02-09,"



Senator ROBERTS
 (Queensland) (10:29):  As a servant to the people of Queensland and Australia, I have to express that I am staggered yet not surprised by the Greens' motion. We oppose this window-dressing that is merely the ghost of Senator Milne. We have all we need to do our jobs in this parliament. Yet clearly, in listening to the people of Queensland, people think parliament is not doing its job. We know that. This is now an admission by the Greens that they are not doing their job. Instead of speaking to sell, why don't the Green start to listen to learn?


Accountability in this parliament, as I have said very often, is almost nonexistent in some areas. So let's consider a key area of concern to the Greens—climate. On that area they contradict empirical scientific evidence and fabricate claims. On their claims, this parliament has been railroaded into wasting tens of billions of dollars of taxpayer money. That is not accountability. It is all based on a lie. The renewable policy right now is killing South Australian manufacturing. It is a deindustrialisation policy that the Greens are submitting this country too. It is a deindustrialisation policy that is being ignored by the government of South Australia and by the Xenophon Team and others in this parliament. Now we have the Western Australian Liberals wanting to take up a 50 per cent renewable energy target. Yet there is no evidence anywhere for this—none at all. The only evidence we have is that it is doing enormous damage. The accountability is low, and the Greens are leading this destruction and industrialisation of our country. 


We need, and we have been talking about requesting, an inquiry into climate science and fraud, but the Greens run whenever we mention that. The Greens, yet again, want to spend more money, raise more money and raise more taxes to spend on yet another body that is superfluous. That is so typical of the Greens: red tape, green tape and blue tape from the UN. The Greens are tying up this country, deindustrialising this country, when what we need is to reindustrialise and get on the reindustrialisation highway. 


To do that, what we are proposing is a transparency portal. This will solve the issue of low accountability. It can all work within the parliament and the government. I made an announcement to this effect in Bundaberg in December. It was very well received. What it means is that in real time expenses are put up for public access on a website of the federal government and each of the state governments, and that reveals everyone's spending, including the Greens' travel. That has led to immediate savings of millions of dollars in the states of the United States that have adopted that. If you do not want to call it a transparency portal, make it the integrity portal. 


The last point I wish to make in opposing this bill from Senator Ludlam is that this is yet another example of control versus freedom. In a free environment in this parliament and in the public domain the Greens use lies, smears and labels to suppress debate. In a free environment they go straight to control. What do they want to do? They want to bring in a body that can be corrupted, as it has become in New South Wales, and they want to use that as a masquerade, supposedly to increase accountability. This is just more window-dressing. The Greens are very good at window-dressing. Instead of this excursion, this detour, we need to get back to fundamental accountability and run this parliament in a way that is in accordance with our constitution to restore accountability. I oppose this Greens bill.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,2,2
"Rice, Sen Janet",AG,2017-02-09,"



Senator RICE
 (Victoria) (10:32):  I rise to speak on the National Integrity Commission Bill 2013. The Greens' position on supporting a national anticorruption agency is longstanding and based on the need to be shining a light on the murkiness that lies beneath a lot of what goes on in Australian politics and business. We have Senator Roberts over here off on his flights of fancy, which are so much more based on his narcissism and his focus that everything that he is says is right, ignoring the reality of the science of climate change, which, as we know, is accepted by 97 per cent or more of the world's scientists. We currently have the Australian Meteorological and Oceanographic Society having their conference in Canberra this week. We have just had Canberra having its hottest year on record. We have just had climate records smashed around the world. Scientists have moved on from discussing climate change to recognising the seriousness of it. Yet Senator Roberts and his One Nation crew are off on their flights of fancy that bear no relationship at all to reality and certainly no relationship to science. If we are to have an inquiry into climate change we may as well have an inquiry into gravity. We have the basic laws of physics and chemistry. Climate change is real. Dangerous global warming is happening.


Clearly the issue of corruption and the need for an integrity commission or an anticorruption commission strikes a raw nerve, because people do not want to believe it is happening. The Labor Party for a long time have been very reluctant and resistant to supporting the Greens' call. Since Bob Brown introduced the Greens' National Integrity Commissioner Bill in 2010 there have been seven years in this parliament. But we are pleased that finally, in the last weeks, they have recognised that this is something that the community see as important and that people want to have happening; they want to have that light shone on the murky world of donations and potential corruption. So we are pleased that they have come on board with their support for an inquiry into the need for a anticorruption body. But we believe the evidence is there. We believe that there is strong evidence that an anticorruption body is really needed. We do not think that it is necessary to go off to an inquiry. Of course, if this inquiry happens we will participate, and we believe that the evidence that will come out of that inquiry will be very strong and will show that there is a need for a really thorough, well resourced, expansive anticorruption agency at the national level, just as there is at state level in the states that already have one.


Senator Macdonald's contribution was amusing, basically. He said, 'Don't worry; not a problem.' The issue is that if you are in the dark, you cannot see that there is a problem. I think that is where the current government is at. I heard the government get up yesterday and say, 'No, not a problem; we don't need one; there is no evidence of corruption so therefore it's not happening.' Senator Macdonald based a lot of his speech on the fact that we already have an agency—the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity. When he was speaking I thought, let's have a look at what people feel about how comprehensive and suitable and well-resourced, how capable of dealing with these issues ACLEI is. I pulled up an article from The Sydney Morning Herald in May last year. I think the heading of that article tells you a lot. It really summarises the issue with ACLEI. The headline was, 'The mouse versus the dragon: law enforcement struggles against alleged customs drug network.' This article documented the issues of the underresourcing and lack of powers that ACLEI has to deal with the issue of drug smuggling across our borders.


This article notes that ACLEI is far smaller than most of its state anti-corruption counterparts and is also reliant on the resources of the agencies it is meant to oversee to run complex operations. In particular, it is reliant upon the Australian Federal Police. So when this issue of drug smuggling was finally passed to the Federal Police, a senior AFP officer initially deemed the evidence insufficient to begin a probe. So, yet, more drugs passed through the border. Time after time, there is evidence to show that the resources and the extent of the powers available to ACLEI are just insufficient. ACLEI's ability to investigate serious corruption was expressed as 'woeful' during a probe at Sydney airport. One security source quoted in this article said that, basically, to fight this threat to the nation's borders 'ACLEI needs to be ten-dupled in size'. The article said:


Says another anti-corruption fighter who has worked alongside ACLEI on highly sensitive jobs: ""They are heavily reliant on the AFP. The trouble is when you are that reliant, it infects the sort of jobs ACLEI will take on.""


This source also has concerns about ACLEI's decision to avoid public hearings into corruption, despite having the power to hold them. ACLEI is also reluctant to engage with the media about its operations, meaning the public rarely finds out about the true extent of corruption, cultural problems and management failures in the nation's border security agencies.


Clearly, ACLEI is doing what it can with resources and powers available to it. But it is not sufficient. It is not a substitute for a broad, wide-ranging integrity commission, which is what the Greens have been calling for now for seven years.


Senator Macdonald also said that there was no evidence, and said hat we have good global ratings for having clean politics. He quoted that Transparency International was not concerned about us. In fact, Transparency International twice in the last 10 years has expressed concern. There was a joint study by Griffith University and Transparency International in 2005 that recommended that a new independent statutory authority be tasked as a comprehensive lead agency for investigation and prevention of official corruption, criminal activity and serious misconduct involving Commonwealth officials. Then, as recently as 2013, Transparency International Australia called for a federal anti-corruption body to be established following reports about Centrelink tenancy leases. There is a clear case that has been established over many years for the need for an integrity commission of the type that the Greens have been calling for.


In particular, the issue which seems to really strike a raw nerve is the issue of the influence of political donations. Our donation system in Australia operates like the downstream waters of Melbourne's Yarra River. Upstream of Melbourne, the river is pure and clean, and a place that we can be proud of. But the further we go down the river the muddier it gets. No-one would want to drink that water. And this is the problem.


As recently as this morning, there was an article on the ABC website with information about political donations. They begin the article by saying:


Companies, organisations and individuals arguably make political donations for one reason only: to influence Australian politics.


They outline a dataset of where the donations have flowed 'to reveal the industries,' as they say, 'and people using their riches in a bid to buy influence.' The influence of political donations is corrupting Australian politics. Exactly how and where and which companies—we do not know because we do not have the tools to investigate it. All we know is it is extremely murky. We do not have the information to actually be able to pinpoint and do the investigation to find out which of these resource companies have actually been unduly using their influence and which decisions have been unduly influenced by those donations that of been made. But what we do know is that a huge amount of money is being handed over by donors—and, as the ABC said, for one reason only: to influence Australian politics. In 2016, there was: $6½ million from individuals; $3½ million from property and construction businesses; $1.8 million from resources; $1.7 million from unions; $1.2 million from pharmaceutical and health companies. This level of donation really shows that there is a reason why these companies are making donations. We can see exactly the influence it has. It becomes very, very murky. Whether it is gambling or pokies, cigarettes or alcohol, property development, the big roads lobby, or fossil fuels—decisions are being made that are not in the public interest. 




Senator O'Sullivan:
  You people got the biggest donation. You got $1.5 million.




Senator RICE:
   Or worse—they are completely destructive.




Senator O'Sullivan:
  Why don't you talk about the $1.5 million you got?




Senator RICE:
  I will take that interjection from Senator O'Sullivan. Yes, there was a donation made by Graeme Wood to the Greens. It is no longer the biggest individual donation to a party. That was surpassed during the last election. But, yes, Graeme Wood was very, very concerned about climate change. He wanted to see action; he knew that the future of the world depends upon us taking serious, urgent, dramatic action on climate change, and he saw that the Greens were a vehicle to get more action on climate change. We know the seriousness of climate change. We know that both the Liberal and Labor parties are not taking that action. And he saw that, too. The people of Australia saw that, too.




Senator O'Sullivan:
  What do you get for $1.5 million?




Senator RICE:
  What he got was: he supported the Greens in being able to run a strong campaign focused upon needing to take urgent action to set up the framework that we could be taking action—the whole clean energy framework.




Senator O'Sullivan:
  You are hypocrites!




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Ketter
):  Order! Senators are entitled to be heard in silence without interjection.




Senator RICE:
  In fact, the level of resources helped the Greens run a very successful campaign and ended up helping to give us the balance of power in the lower house and the balance of power in the Senate in that 2010 election. Together with the Labor Party, we put in place a framework for tackling climate change that we are very proud of. It has been ripped apart by your government in the years since, doing huge damage to our ability to take serious action on climate change and basically making Australia complicit in actions around the world that are seriously putting the future of our planet at risk. I am very proud of the fact that we have run a very strong campaign and that people want to support us—from Graeme Wood to the hundreds of thousands of people who support the Greens by giving small amounts like $20 in a very transparent, accountable way—to get action that serves the interests of a sustainable future for us all.


But look at the murkiness of other donations where we are not so clear about what the outcomes are. Look at the influence of Transurban on Victorian roads policy at the moment. I have no evidence that there is corruption there, and I am not claiming that there is corruption there, but there is not transparency and there is not accountability. What we know is that Transurban put to the Victorian government a market-led proposal to build the Western Distributor. We know that the Victorian government, at the time of the last election, suddenly changed their direction from having a different road to aiming to build this road that Transurban are proposing. There is huge amount of concern about the benefit that Transurban are going to get out of this and about the influence that they had on the Victorian government. It is not just the Greens who are concerned about this; in fact, there was considerable concern about it in the HeraldSun this morning. Conservative columnist Terry McCrann—somebody who I very rarely agree with—said:


It's also been far too easy for governments — especially Labor ones — to do deals with Transurban. Transurban pays the upfront bill; the government doesn't have to borrow.


We all get a new or bigger road. You just let the meter run a few years more.


That means that it is just a few more years of huge profits being made by Transurban, which, on the face of it, is not in the public interest. People think, 'Well, the government doesn't need to borrow,' but that money is being paid by communities, paid by the people who have to pay those tolls. They have no option but to pay those tolls. There will be a massive increase in the tolls being paid to Transurban and a massive impact on ordinary people because of the influence that Transurban have had upon the Victorian government.


We have the ongoing issue of those private sector interests—the roads lobby and the influence they are having—but there is also the issue of the broader influence of the fossil fuel companies and the millions of dollars in donations that they make. That is happening across the world. We are seeing that in the United States, with President Trump doing the bidding of those who want to pollute the planet, speeding up catastrophic global warming just for their own selfish, short-term greed. They want to keep on polluting, and they have a lot of money to be able influence governments to keep on polluting to serve their interests. They will keep on doing it for as long as they can get away with it.


Meanwhile, the planet is in a desperate state. We know that we need to pull back from fossil fuels being emitted. We know we have to transition to renewable energy. Everyone knows that that is the direction we need to head in—at least anyone who has any sense and any skerrick of a scientific understanding—and yet, because of the influence of the fossil fuel lobby, we are continuing to pollute in massive, unacceptable ways.


And now we have a government that is saying that suddenly coal is the new black again and that we are talking about clean coal. There is no such thing as clean coal. We get told that clean coal is clean because it is 30 per cent less polluting than other coal. I tell you: if we are going to protect the planet from dangerous climate change and if we going to protect ordinary people and our agricultural systems from climate change, 30 per cent cleaner is not good enough. We have to get down to zero carbon pollution as quickly as possible, so clean coal does not cut it.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  A point of order, Senator Bushby?




Senator Bushby:
  I understand that Senator Rice is very passionate about climate change, but we are here to discuss the National Integrity Commission Bill. I understand the path that led her to where she is, but I think she is off topic now.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Senator Bushby. It is a wide-ranging debate, and we do canvass a range of issues, but I ask you, Senator Rice, to try to remain as relevant as possible to the matter at hand.




Senator RICE:
  I am happy to respond to Senator Bushby because in fact it is absolutely germane to this debate. We are continuing to pollute the planet in the way we are because of the influence of those fossil fuel companies corrupting the political system.


The Greens want to shine a light. We need to clean up that river because at the moment the waters of where those donations are going and what influence they are having are just too murky. We want to see a national anticorruption commission, an independent statutory agency that we would be able to rely upon to shine a light on what is going on. With that, I seek leave to continue my remarks later.


Leave granted; debate adjourned.

Senator McKIM
 (Tasmania) (11:52):  I seek leave to make a two-minute statement with regard to the forced deportations of detainees on Manus Island that are currently underway.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Leave is granted.




Senator McKIM:
  At five o'clock this morning, under the cover of darkness on Manus Island at the Lombrum detention centre, Papua New Guinea police and private security guards stormed the centre and began the forced deportation that was the subject of my questions to Senator Brandis yesterday. In doing so, they have trashed the human rights of detainees, who remain Australia's moral and legal responsibility in the context of international law. We have seen at least one detainee frogmarched out of the detention centre and allegedly private guards threatened other detainees that they would be back to take them out later.


This is a situation that has inflamed tensions which already were at very high levels. I want to say very clearly that the Australian government needs to intervene here with the Papua New Guinea government, ensure that detainees have all opportunity to exhaust legal remedies before they are forcibly deported from Papua New Guinea and ensure that actions taken by Papua New Guinea police and private security guards do not, as we have heard this morning, unnecessarily inflame tensions. We do not want to see violence in these centres. But I do have to say that tensions are running very hot in the Lombrum centre and I urge the Attorney-General to uphold the law and use all available opportunities to make sure that things are done properly and in accordance with international law.

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Attorney-General, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (11:54):  I seek leave to make a two-minute statement.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Leave is granted.




Senator BRANDIS:
  What Senator McKim failed to inform the Senate of was that the people who were the subject of this action today are not refugees. They are not refugees. He chose his words carefully by describing them as 'detainees'. I am advised that every single individual the subject of these removal proceedings is a person whose claim to refugee status has been processed and rejected. It is quite wrong, therefore, for Senator McKim to claim as he does that rights are being violated. When a person claims to be a refugee and then their claim to refugee status is rejected, the country to which they have made that claim has every right in international law to return them to their country of origin in accordance with its own domestic laws. That is what the New Guinean authorities are doing.


When we speak of Manus Island, we should remember two things. The Manus Island detention centre was created by the government of New Guinea as a result of an agreement entered into between that government and the government of Mr Kevin Rudd. The other thing is that every person in the Manus Island detention centre, whether they have been assessed to be a refugee or, as in this case, their refugee claim has been refused, was put there by the Labor Party. The second thing we should remember is that under this government we have attempted to empty those centres, most recently by entering into an agreement with the administration of the United States of America.

Senator GALLAGHER
 (Australian Capital Territory—Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate) (11:58):  I move:


At the end of the motion, add, ""but,


(a)   in respect of the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Omnibus Savings and Child Care Reform) Bill 2017 the provisions of the bill be referred immediately to Community Affairs Legislation Committee for inquiry and report by 20 March 2017; and


(b)   in respect of the provisions of the Building and Construction Industry (Improving Productivity) Amendment Bill 2017, the Education and Employment Legislation Committee report by 27 March 2017.""


I also foreshadow that I will ask that the question on the two referrals as part of that amendment be put separately. The amendment I have moved seeks to refer two important pieces of legislation to committee inquiries. The first is the government's recently introduced omnibus bill. We are seeking a short inquiry to look at that. There are very significant matters to be explored as part of that bill. Some of them have been looked at in other inquiries, but there have been further changes to family tax benefits that will impact on a million families around Australia. There have been further changes and cuts to the paid parental leave scheme which, again, will impact around 70,000 new mums negatively. It includes the scrapping of the energy supplement, again affecting pensioners, people with a disability and Newstart recipients. There are cuts to payments to young people between the ages of 20 and 24 by pushing them onto the youth allowance, scrapping the pensioner education supplement and education entry payment, and cutting the pension to migrant pensioners who spend more than six weeks overseas.


Importantly, we need to understand the combined effect on families from some of the revised changes that the government has introduced in this bill. They are significant changes. They are affecting vulnerable and low-income households. It is only right that the Senate, performing its job as the chamber of scrutiny, is allowed access to departmental officials through a committee inquiry process to explore the combined impact of these measures prior to debate in this chamber, which I understand is being sought during the March setting. So I urge other senators to consider supporting that. It is still a very compressed time frame, when you are looking at the savings that are being supported by the omnibus bill—around $8 billion in savings. These are significant changes to the way people are receiving income support that they have made plans around. It is only right that the Senate, prior to debate, has full understanding and access to departmental officials to question them on how these changes are going to impact on these households.


In terms of the second part of my amendment, again this is to refer to committees so that we can understand the agreement that has been reached over summer by the government with members of the crossbench. Again, this is a highly contentious piece of legislation. There were many hours of debate late last year. My understanding, in my discussions with people who work in this industry, is that they have put time and effort into understanding the legislation that was passed in December and how that was going to impact on their businesses and agreements that they have in place with their workers. Now they are being told that this is changing again. I have certainly received quite a bit of feedback that these further changes will cause chaos in the building and construction industry and that it will impact on things like apprentice numbers at a time when we are already seeing low apprentice numbers and workforce shortages in certain areas. So again I would urge senators to consider that. It is a reasonable time frame. It is not a length inquiry. It is only right that we are fully briefed, because we have certainly not been briefed over the summer about the changes that have been negotiated. We would like a full understanding of them prior to debate in this chamber.

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate, Minister for Communications and Minister for the Arts) (12:02):  I thank the Manager of Opposition Business for revising her amendment to bring forward the date for reporting on the omnibus savings and child care reform bill. That will enable early consideration of that legislation by this chamber. I advise Senator Gallagher that we will part ways on the second amendment that she has proposed in relation to the ABCC.

"Di Natale, Sen Richard",AG,2017-02-09,"



Senator DI NATALE
 (Victoria—Leader of the Australian Greens) (12:03):  I would like to say a few words about this omnibus bill. This has become a familiar tactic. It is one that has been adopted from the USA. It is one that I suspect we will continue to see in this place. This bill combines a whole range of unrelated measures, usually quite nasty things that the government does not want to see any scrutiny or debate over. It rolls them into a bill with many, many schedules. It calls it an omnibus bill. People do not know what that means. It is hard to understand it until you get into the details, but what you can be sure of is that in a bill like this there will be cuts to essential services and supports for ordinary people that the government is trying to hide.


For this tactic to succeed they obviously have to be sure that they have people in the chamber whose support they have. I have to say it is very disappointing to see my colleague Senator Xenophon and, indeed, the One Nation party helping the government pursue an agenda of cutting support for ordinary people and ensuring that it is rolled into an all-encompassing bill with so many schedules that it will not get the scrutiny it deserves.


The reason it is so critical that the Senate does its job in this chamber and that we have the opportunity to scrutinise this legislation is that there are so many hidden nasties in this bill. We are only starting to become familiar with them. For young people who need access to income support, who cannot find a job, it forces them to wait for a month before they are able to access that support. That is absolutely remarkable. These are the Tony Abbott measures of the 2014 budget, those zombie measures, coming back to life. It is only through the scrutiny of the Senate committee process, through the peak bodies who understand the details of the individual schedules, through the experts and stakeholders, that you get to understand exactly how far-reaching this legislation is. It is really a betrayal of well-worn and well-established democratic principles. If you want to slash income support for young people, have the guts to stand up and say that is what you are doing. If you want to remove support for ordinary families, stand up and say that is what you are doing. Do not roll it all up into this bill, an omnibus bill with a boring name but really, really nasty.


The truth is that this bill, in its design, is intended to disguise its intended purpose. This government does not want the parliament to know what is going on, does not want ordinary people to know what is going on and does not want the scrutiny of a media that moves from issue to issue with the attention span of a goldfish. It certainly does not want the public to know what is going on. It was only in the latest Senate estimates that we found out that the government has not even told those 1.2 million families that they will lose their family benefit supplements in July. The department said it would let them know in May. So it is an attack on people who are doing it tough.


I do not expect really anything from One Nation on this. They purport to represent battlers, and here they are—young people are being shafted and we have the removal of supports for family tax benefit payments. It is going to slash payments for people under 25 by $90 a fortnight. Those people under 25 will not get access to Newstart now; they will have to go on to youth allowance, a payment which is $45 per week less. Of course, there are concerns here that we also have the clean energy supplement rolled into this piece of legislation. So, as I said, One Nation, the party that represents battlers, again, selling them out and demonstrating that their only relevance in this place is to turn Australian against Australian.


Again, I am disappointed in Senator Xenophon that he would engage in negotiations with the government that would support some of these changes. But, be very clear—



Senator Leyonhjelm interjecting—




Senator DI NATALE:
  No, no. I am not disappointed in you, Senator Leyonhjelm, because you never fail to disappoint! You are nothing other than consistent. What I would say is: we need to have this legislation given the scrutiny it deserves. That is why the Greens will be doing that through an extended Senate committee process. (Time expired)

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",NXT,2017-02-09,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (12:08):  Can I indicate that Senator Di Natale has, unfortunately, either misunderstood or misrepresented my position and that of my colleagues both here and in the House of Representatives. We are still in negotiation with the government. We have serious concerns about a number of these measures. We believe in having an appropriate inquiry to thoroughly look at these measures, and the interaction between them ought to be undertaken. We have no concluded position. We are still talking to the government. But, also, key stakeholders are very concerned about these measures. Respectively to Di Natale, I think he may well have jumped the gun in terms of what he says our position will be. We think a Senate inquiry in respect of the omnibus bill is most appropriate. And it ought to be a thorough inquiry between now and 20 March.


In relation to the ABCC legislation, this relates to an important amendment as to one specific part of the bill. That ought to go to committee. But to have a full-blown four- or five-week inquiry when, in fact, there are two or three discrete issues that need to be dealt with, I believe it can be dealt with with a relatively short hearing and a short reporting date because these matters have previously been canvassed in the context of the ABCC legislation that has been dealt with. Of course, I do have some concerns about some aspects of this bill that, I believe, ought to be ventilated in the context of a Senate inquiry.

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2017-02-09,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (12:10):  Just to make the Greens' position clear: we will be supporting this motion, understanding that each clause will be put separately. In terms of the ABCC, we referred the ABCC bill amendments to committee through the selection of bills process. As everybody in the chamber is aware, there could not be agreement on the date. We, in fact, wanted it even later than March. But we will agree to the date of 27 March. We believe there are significant issues that do need to be ventilated. We disagree with Senator Xenophon that 15 February—the date that the government wants and as is currently in the selection of bills report—is far too short for these very significant issues. They are important issues to the operation of the ABCC. This legislation is clearly aimed at getting at workers. We think those issues need to be properly ventilated. And a couple of days—let's face it: today is Thursday; they want to report on 15 February. If you take out the weekend, that is very little time to look at the significant issues that arise out of the backflip that has happened here and the impact on Australian workers.


In terms of the omnibus bill—or, as many people now call it, the 'omni-cuts bill'—there are 18 clauses that need to be looked at. They need to be looked at in a cumulative manner in terms of the cumulative impacts on families, on age pensioners, on young people—these need to be looked at. On parents, the government is trying to impose the ordinary waiting period here on parenting payments. These are parents that will need access to this funding very quickly. So what they are saying is: 'You and your kids can go without a payment for a week.' These are parents that, by the very nature of them applying, have very little resources to support their families. It is cruel; it is mean; it is harsh. The government will say there are exemptions. But you have to go through the process of applying for the exemption. In the meantime, if you are in the position where you have to apply for an exemption, you have come out of a situation that is urgent—domestic violence may be involved—and you have to then turn around and go through the bureaucratic process of applying for an exemption in order to get money to feed your kids. It is ridiculous. It is the same with your energy supplement. Again, I will pre-empt the government—'This is an extra payment.' This is the payment that people have come to rely on. One of the other measures in this bill freezes indexation, which means frozen indexation on the income that you can earn. This means fewer and fewer people will be able to access Newstart.


There is a measure called, 'Schedule 11: The automation'—start getting worried folks because it says 'automation'—'of income stream review processes'. Yes—that is right: on the back of the debacle over Christmas of the Centrelink automated debt recovery process the government, under the guise of this bill, wants to ram a new measure through. This measure is a MYEFO measure. It has not been considered before. So let's slip that in to the omnibus amendment where we are talking about childcare and paid parental leave! Let's slip that in and see if we can sneak that through so that we can build on the debacle for which, yesterday, we established a Senate inquiry into! So that needs to be looked at so that we get a thorough understanding about what that means.



And, of course, they have slipped into the omnibus bill the bill that cuts portability for age pensioners when they are going overseas. But, also, they are stopping the payment of the pension supplement after six weeks for pensioners overseas. This bill will have a significant impact on Australians. And, of course, we have the issues around the little bit of extra family tax benefit that people will get, but that is actually a change to the bill that we dealt with previously in this place, and it means that people will still be worse off under these cuts. Then, of course, there are the young people that they want to kick off income support for what will then be five weeks—four weeks on top of the ordinary waiting week. This will have a significant impact on young Australians and comes directly from the Abbott zombie cuts of 2014, where they tried to kick people off for six months. The Senate said, 'No, we're not wearing that,' and the Senate has also said, 'No, we're not going to wear the four weeks.' The Senate needs time to consider this in total again. That is why we will be supporting this. (Time expired)



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  I remind senators that this amendment has been split into two. We will first be looking at paragraph (a), which has the revised reporting date of 20 March. The question is that that motion, as moved by Senator Gallagher, be agreed to.


Question agreed to.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  We now move to the second part of the motion, paragraph (b), which seeks a reporting date of 27 March for the inquiry into the ABCC bill. The question is that the motion moved by Senator Gallagher described as motion (b) be agreed to.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2017-02-09,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (12:24):  I move:


At the end of the motion, add: 


“and in respect of the Parliamentary Entitlements Legislation Amendment Bill 2017, the provisions of the bill be referred immediately to the Finance and Public Administration Legislation Committee for inquiry and report by 28 February 2017”.


In speaking to this motion, I do think that we should give those impacted by this legislation the right to be heard. This does not affect many people. Can I just say to those in the media who will misinterpret my comments—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Macdonald, please resume your seat for a moment. Senators, it is a bit difficult to see who wants the call, so if you wish to remain in the chamber, please take your seat. Senator McAllister on a point of order?




Senator McAllister:
  Madam Deputy President, I am just looking for some clarification on the legislation that Senator Macdonald is referring to. I could not hear what he said at the beginning of his address.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Macdonald is seeking to amend the motion in relation to the life gold pass bill. Senator Macdonald.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  I am sorry people have left the chamber, because I have not been able to speak to colleagues, but I had hoped they would stay and listen to the argument. Can I say to the media, who will misinterpret my motives: I will probably leave this place in a box, so this will not relate to me. If I do not, the last thing I want to do ever again, after 27 years of flying from Townsville to Canberra to do my job here, is sit on a plane. But there are a group of people for whom the Life Gold Pass was part of their arrangement when they served in this place, on far fewer conditions and less remunerations than any of those who serve now. This was part of the deal. There are only a couple of dozen, perhaps a couple of hundred, elderly former parliamentarians who would be affected. So none of you would care too much about this. But they should at least be given the chance to voice their views by appearing at a parliamentary committee. It would also allow the Law Society and all of those others who continually make submissions about retrospective legislation to come in and give advice and evidence to a parliamentary committee about the ills of retrospective legislation—and that is what this is.


We know the public hate all of you—and you bring it upon yourself, because you continually denigrate yourselves. But at least let these people who are affected come in and have their say, importantly, on the ills of any sort of retrospective legislation—even legislation that does something for a group of people as unpopular as former politicians and former prime ministers. Let the Law Society again confirm to us how bad any retrospective legislation is. You may not like this. The public will hate it. Former prime ministers and parliamentarians are the lowest, in their view. But these people are entitled to what was agreed upon in legislation 20 and 30 years ago, and it should not be taken from them. No legislation that is retrospective should ever be adopted this parliament. 


We will debate the issue later on, but I ask the parliament at this stage to at least give those affected the opportunity of having their voices heard, because that has not happened so far. Let us further consider the ills of any form of legislation that is retrospective. (Time expired)



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  The time for this debate has expired. To be clear, Senator Macdonald wishes to amend the motion put by Senator Bushby. The question is that the amendment moved by Senator Macdonald be agreed to.


Question negatived.

It is really a betrayal of well-worn and well-established democratic principles. If you want to slash income support for young people, have the guts to stand up and say that is what you are doing. If you want to remove support for ordinary families, stand up and say that is what you are doing. Do not roll it all up into this bill, an omnibus bill with a boring name but really, really nasty.


The truth is that this bill, in its design, is intended to disguise its intended purpose. This government does not want the parliament to know what is going on, does not want ordinary people to know what is going on and does not want the scrutiny of a media that moves from issue to issue with the attention span of a goldfish. It certainly does not want the public to know what is going on. It was only in the latest Senate estimates that we found out that the government has not even told those 1.2 million families that they will lose their family benefit supplements in July. The department said it would let them know in May. So it is an attack on people who are doing it tough.


I do not expect really anything from One Nation on this. They purport to represent battlers, and here they are—young people are being shafted and we have the removal of supports for family tax benefit payments. It is going to slash payments for people under 25 by $90 a fortnight. Those people under 25 will not get access to Newstart now; they will have to go on to youth allowance, a payment which is $45 per week less. Of course, there are concerns here that we also have the clean energy supplement rolled into this piece of legislation. So, as I said, One Nation, the party that represents battlers, again, selling them out and demonstrating that their only relevance in this place is to turn Australian against Australian.


Again, I am disappointed in Senator Xenophon that he would engage in negotiations with the government that would support some of these changes. But, be very clear—



Senator Leyonhjelm interjecting—




Senator DI NATALE:
  No, no. I am not disappointed in you, Senator Leyonhjelm, because you never fail to disappoint! You are nothing other than consistent. What I would say is: we need to have this legislation given the scrutiny it deserves. That is why the Greens will be doing that through an extended Senate committee process. (Time expired)

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (12:08):  Can I indicate that Senator Di Natale has, unfortunately, either misunderstood or misrepresented my position and that of my colleagues both here and in the House of Representatives. We are still in negotiation with the government. We have serious concerns about a number of these measures. We believe in having an appropriate inquiry to thoroughly look at these measures, and the interaction between them ought to be undertaken. We have no concluded position. We are still talking to the government. But, also, key stakeholders are very concerned about these measures. Respectively to Di Natale, I think he may well have jumped the gun in terms of what he says our position will be. We think a Senate inquiry in respect of the omnibus bill is most appropriate. And it ought to be a thorough inquiry between now and 20 March.


In relation to the ABCC legislation, this relates to an important amendment as to one specific part of the bill. That ought to go to committee. But to have a full-blown four- or five-week inquiry when, in fact, there are two or three discrete issues that need to be dealt with, I believe it can be dealt with with a relatively short hearing and a short reporting date because these matters have previously been canvassed in the context of the ABCC legislation that has been dealt with. Of course, I do have some concerns about some aspects of this bill that, I believe, ought to be ventilated in the context of a Senate inquiry.

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2017-02-09,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (12:10):  Just to make the Greens' position clear: we will be supporting this motion, understanding that each clause will be put separately. In terms of the ABCC, we referred the ABCC bill amendments to committee through the selection of bills process. As everybody in the chamber is aware, there could not be agreement on the date. We, in fact, wanted it even later than March. But we will agree to the date of 27 March. We believe there are significant issues that do need to be ventilated. We disagree with Senator Xenophon that 15 February—the date that the government wants and as is currently in the selection of bills report—is far too short for these very significant issues. They are important issues to the operation of the ABCC. This legislation is clearly aimed at getting at workers. We think those issues need to be properly ventilated. And a couple of days—let's face it: today is Thursday; they want to report on 15 February. If you take out the weekend, that is very little time to look at the significant issues that arise out of the backflip that has happened here and the impact on Australian workers.


In terms of the omnibus bill—or, as many people now call it, the 'omni-cuts bill'—there are 18 clauses that need to be looked at. They need to be looked at in a cumulative manner in terms of the cumulative impacts on families, on age pensioners, on young people—these need to be looked at. On parents, the government is trying to impose the ordinary waiting period here on parenting payments. These are parents that will need access to this funding very quickly. So what they are saying is: 'You and your kids can go without a payment for a week.' These are parents that, by the very nature of them applying, have very little resources to support their families. It is cruel; it is mean; it is harsh. The government will say there are exemptions. But you have to go through the process of applying for the exemption. In the meantime, if you are in the position where you have to apply for an exemption, you have come out of a situation that is urgent—domestic violence may be involved—and you have to then turn around and go through the bureaucratic process of applying for an exemption in order to get money to feed your kids. It is ridiculous. It is the same with your energy supplement. Again, I will pre-empt the government—'This is an extra payment.' This is the payment that people have come to rely on. One of the other measures in this bill freezes indexation, which means frozen indexation on the income that you can earn. This means fewer and fewer people will be able to access Newstart.


There is a measure called, 'Schedule 11: The automation'—start getting worried folks because it says 'automation'—'of income stream review processes'. Yes—that is right: on the back of the debacle over Christmas of the Centrelink automated debt recovery process the government, under the guise of this bill, wants to ram a new measure through. This measure is a MYEFO measure. It has not been considered before. So let's slip that in to the omnibus amendment where we are talking about childcare and paid parental leave! Let's slip that in and see if we can sneak that through so that we can build on the debacle for which, yesterday, we established a Senate inquiry into! So that needs to be looked at so that we get a thorough understanding about what that means.



And, of course, they have slipped into the omnibus bill the bill that cuts portability for age pensioners when they are going overseas. But, also, they are stopping the payment of the pension supplement after six weeks for pensioners overseas. This bill will have a significant impact on Australians. And, of course, we have the issues around the little bit of extra family tax benefit that people will get, but that is actually a change to the bill that we dealt with previously in this place, and it means that people will still be worse off under these cuts. Then, of course, there are the young people that they want to kick off income support for what will then be five weeks—four weeks on top of the ordinary waiting week. This will have a significant impact on young Australians and comes directly from the Abbott zombie cuts of 2014, where they tried to kick people off for six months. The Senate said, 'No, we're not wearing that,' and the Senate has also said, 'No, we're not going to wear the four weeks.' The Senate needs time to consider this in total again. That is why we will be supporting this. (Time expired)

At the end of the motion, add: 


“and in respect of the Parliamentary Entitlements Legislation Amendment Bill 2017, the provisions of the bill be referred immediately to the Finance and Public Administration Legislation Committee for inquiry and report by 28 February 2017”.


In speaking to this motion, I do think that we should give those impacted by this legislation the right to be heard. This does not affect many people. Can I just say to those in the media who will misinterpret my comments—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Macdonald, please resume your seat for a moment. Senators, it is a bit difficult to see who wants the call, so if you wish to remain in the chamber, please take your seat. Senator McAllister on a point of order?




Senator McAllister:
  Madam Deputy President, I am just looking for some clarification on the legislation that Senator Macdonald is referring to. I could not hear what he said at the beginning of his address.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Macdonald is seeking to amend the motion in relation to the life gold pass bill. Senator Macdonald.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  I am sorry people have left the chamber, because I have not been able to speak to colleagues, but I had hoped they would stay and listen to the argument. Can I say to the media, who will misinterpret my motives: I will probably leave this place in a box, so this will not relate to me. If I do not, the last thing I want to do ever again, after 27 years of flying from Townsville to Canberra to do my job here, is sit on a plane. But there are a group of people for whom the Life Gold Pass was part of their arrangement when they served in this place, on far fewer conditions and less remunerations than any of those who serve now. This was part of the deal. There are only a couple of dozen, perhaps a couple of hundred, elderly former parliamentarians who would be affected. So none of you would care too much about this. But they should at least be given the chance to voice their views by appearing at a parliamentary committee. It would also allow the Law Society and all of those others who continually make submissions about retrospective legislation to come in and give advice and evidence to a parliamentary committee about the ills of retrospective legislation—and that is what this is.


We know the public hate all of you—and you bring it upon yourself, because you continually denigrate yourselves. But at least let these people who are affected come in and have their say, importantly, on the ills of any sort of retrospective legislation—even legislation that does something for a group of people as unpopular as former politicians and former prime ministers. Let the Law Society again confirm to us how bad any retrospective legislation is. You may not like this. The public will hate it. Former prime ministers and parliamentarians are the lowest, in their view. But these people are entitled to what was agreed upon in legislation 20 and 30 years ago, and it should not be taken from them. No legislation that is retrospective should ever be adopted this parliament. 


We will debate the issue later on, but I ask the parliament at this stage to at least give those affected the opportunity of having their voices heard, because that has not happened so far. Let us further consider the ills of any form of legislation that is retrospective. (Time expired)

"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2017-02-09,"



Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria) (12:45):  Australians use life insurance to financially protect themselves and those close to them. Many Australians take out life insurance for the peace of mind that, if the worst happens, there will at least be some level of financial protection for themselves and their families. Life insurance can provide essential funds and income in times when Australians are beset by illness, injury, disability or the death of a close family member.


Good financial advice can look at an individual's personal circumstances and help to make sure that they get a life insurance product that is suited to their needs. Good financial advice also ensures that Australians get good value for money when buying life insurance. Good financial advice helps to ensure that, if the worst happens, the customer receives the payments and income support that they expected when they took out the policy. However, for financial advice to deliver these outcomes, advisers must be motivated primarily by the interests of their clients and their clients need to be confident that this is the case.


Labor will support passage of the modest reforms to adviser remuneration in the Corporations Amendment (Life Insurance Remuneration Arrangements) Bill 2016. We do so because they represent steps to improve the quality of financial advice in relation to life insurance products. They represent steps to better align the interests of those providing financial advice with the interests of consumers. They also address concerns about advisers churning clients through products. These concerns are about advisers being driven by commissions to advise clients to replace their existing life insurance product with a new one.


Recent reviews have suggested a number of different ways in which conflicted remuneration should be limited in relation to life insurance products. ASIC's 2014 Review of retail life insurance advice report found that 37 per cent of consumers in its sample received life insurance advice that failed to comply with the law. It found that, where there was an upfront commission involved, 45 per cent of advice failed to comply with the law. This included the obligation for advisers to give priority to their client's interests over their own.


While we have noted the criticisms of some stakeholders about ASIC's sample, those findings are concerning. According to ASIC:


… many advisers giving post-FOFA advice may prioritise their own interests in earning commissions income ahead of the interests of the client in getting good quality advice.


The Financial System Inquiry also looked into life insurance. It made a number of recommendations in relation to life insurance, including the implementation of a level commission structure. Under a level commission structure, instead of being front loaded, the commission would be the same for each year that the policy continued.


The Life Insurance Advice Working Group also looked into the issue of commissions and life insurance, and it released the Trowbridge review in March 2015. The review noted the need to:


… balance improving the quality of advice and consumer understanding of remuneration arrangements, along with removing misaligned incentives, with sustaining a viable and competitive retail life insurance industry.


The Trowbridge review also recommended a move to level commissions. This would have been supplemented by an initial advice payment available at the first policy inception and then no more often than every five years.


The government's package stops short of the recommendations of the FSI and the Trowbridge review to remove upfront commissions. First, the package still allows for upfront commissions but caps them. Although the cap is for an instrument made by ASIC, the government has indicated that the cap will initially be set at 80 per cent of the cost of the first year premium. It will go to 70 per cent in the second year to which the bill applies, before settling at 60 per cent of the cost of the first year premium for upfront commissions. The package also caps ongoing commissions at 20 per cent.


Unfortunately, because the start date has been pushed back from 1 July 2016 to 1 January 2018, it appears that the 60 per cent cap will now not be reached until 2020. We consider this a long time for the introduction of a modest reform, particularly one that was first agreed to by industry in 2015. Labor supported this bill when it was first introduced into the House in February last year. We supported the bill's passage through the House on 3 March 2016. Although it grandfathered arrangements under existing enterprise agreements, the bill as initially introduced had a start date of 1 July 2016. Had the government decided to progress it, this bill could have been law well in advance of 1 July 2016.


In addition to the limits on the quantum of upfront commissions, the package introduces a two-year clawback of upfront commissions. This means that upfront commissions will have to paid back to the life insurer by the financial adviser in the event that the policy lapses. The repayment amount is for an instrument made by ASIC. However, the government has indicated that they expect the amounts to be as follows: if the policy lapses in the first year, the adviser will have to repay 100 per cent of the upfront commission; and if the policy lapses in the second year, they will have to repay 60 per cent. This is subject to exceptions set out in the exposure draft regulations—for example, if the policy lapses because it is paid out.


The legal means by which the bill imposes these limits on up-front commissions is by extending the ban on conflicted remuneration in the Corporations Act. A key tenet of the Future of Financial Advice reforms was the banning of many forms of conflicted remuneration for financial advisers. This included barring conflicted remuneration for life insurance policies held inside superannuation. This bill extends the ban on conflicted remuneration to life insurance products more broadly. It does so with an exception for circumstances where remuneration is within the caps allowed by ASIC's instrument. We welcome the implicit endorsement of the FoFA framework from those opposite that this bill represents.


While supporting this bill, we note the reservations that have been expressed by consumer groups that the bill does not go far enough. The clawback period in the bill is one year less than the three-year clawback period in the industry proposal announced by the government on 25 June 2015. We would not want to see financial advisers pressure customers to unnecessarily change their life insurance policy after two years as a result of these changes. The ASIC review of these reforms, now planned for 2021, should provide insight into the effect of the revised framework on churn. We also note the concerns of some financial advisers who feel, rightly or wrongly, that their voice has not been heard in the policy development process.


The ASIC review will provide an opportunity to check whether the bill is operating as intended, to further the interests of consumers. We should also keep in mind the importance of the administration of the clawback arrangements in the bill. These clawback arrangements are designed to reduce the incentives for advisers to unnecessarily move their clients to new policies. However, there is a side benefit to insurers of the clawback arrangements. The insurers get to take back the commissions that are paid to the financial advisers. We welcome the fact that the bill and exposure draft regulations provide detail of when payments should and should not be clawed back. For example, payments are not clawed back where a policy ends because a claim is made under it or because the insured person dies. However, it is important that these clawback arrangements are properly administered, and the 2021 review should look at this.


So that the allowable commissions can be worked out, the bill introduces a concept of policy cost for life insurance products. This is the cost on which commissions may be paid. The bill provides for regulations to prescribe amounts that are not to be included in the policy cost. The government has released exposure draft regulations that state that taxes on insurance are not included in the policy costs.


Some states and territories have abolished stamp duties on life insurance policies. This includes the ACT, which I can say is at the forefront of this tax reform. However, these taxes remain in some other jurisdictions. The former Labor spokesperson for financial services, the member for Rankin, raised this issue when he spoke on the bill earlier last year. Labor's position is that taxes on insurance, such as stamp duties, should not be included in the amount of the premium on which the calculations of the allowable commissions are based. Allowing commissions on taxes would set a concerning precedent.


Given that these reforms have been delayed to 2018, there is no longer a need for transitional arrangements while the industry updates its systems to accommodate the exclusion of tax from the amount on which the commission is based. The latest exposure draft regulations indicate that taxes on insurance are excluded from the policy cost on which the maximum allowable commissions are calculated. We are pleased that these draft regulations address this concern. We will be looking at the final regulations to make sure that this remains the case.


Having spoken about what the bill does, it is worth noting what the bill does not do. First of all, this bill does not guarantee that these new standards will be enforced. As mentioned earlier, ASIC's review of retail life insurance found a striking lack of compliance in this space. We support ASIC in the steps it takes to ensure that advisers abide by these laws.


Secondly, this bill does not address concerns that have been raised about the way parts of the life insurance industry handle claims. The bill does something in relation to conflicted remuneration for financial advisers selling life insurance products but it does not address the issue of conflicted remuneration for claims handlers. Claims handlers are charged with making fair decisions on the merits of life insurance claims. It was very concerning that ASIC's recent report, Life insurance claims: an industry review, showed that at least two life insurers are still paying remuneration that includes incentives in relation to claims handling.


Finally, the bill does not address the broader cultural and systemic issues that have come to light within the banking and financial services sector. This includes very serious concerns about the life insurance industry, such as high claims-denial rates, delays in processing claims and insurers hiding behind outdated medical definitions to deny claims. These are very serious issues for an industry that many Australians turn to in the darkest moments of their lives—an industry that they rely on in these moments to do the right thing.


So, we support these modest reforms in this bill in the hope that they will improve consumer confidence in the quality of financial advice on life insurance. However, they go only so far. We will not ignore the broader issues that have been raised in relation to the banking and financial services sector. A strong banking and financial services sector depends on Australians having confidence in that sector. That is why we need to get to the bottom of the culture and practices that have allowed repeated instances of misconduct to occur. This issue was illustrated recently when Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman Kate Carnell said:


We've had a look at 17 inquiries over quite a number of years with the banks saying 'yeah, yeah, yeah, we're going to change' and then they don't. And then they find a way to have another inquiry and kick the can down the road to find another reason why they won't change.


Ms Carnell also said:


I think though what we've got is a banking industry in Australia, particularly the big four banks, that believe for whatever reason that they can continue with business as usual and they don't have to change.


Labor believes that the only investigation that can to get to the bottom of these issues is a royal commission, and that is why we will continue to argue for one. Labor believes that any systemic issues need to be ventilated and investigated in a thorough and transparent way. We need to give victims a chance to be heard, and we need to give Australians the confidence that these repeated scandals will not continue to occur.

We also note the concerns of some financial advisers who feel, rightly or wrongly, that their voice has not been heard in the policy development process.


The ASIC review will provide an opportunity to check whether the bill is operating as intended, to further the interests of consumers. We should also keep in mind the importance of the administration of the clawback arrangements in the bill. These clawback arrangements are designed to reduce the incentives for advisers to unnecessarily move their clients to new policies. However, there is a side benefit to insurers of the clawback arrangements. The insurers get to take back the commissions that are paid to the financial advisers. We welcome the fact that the bill and exposure draft regulations provide detail of when payments should and should not be clawed back. For example, payments are not clawed back where a policy ends because a claim is made under it or because the insured person dies. However, it is important that these clawback arrangements are properly administered, and the 2021 review should look at this.


So that the allowable commissions can be worked out, the bill introduces a concept of policy cost for life insurance products. This is the cost on which commissions may be paid. The bill provides for regulations to prescribe amounts that are not to be included in the policy cost. The government has released exposure draft regulations that state that taxes on insurance are not included in the policy costs.


Some states and territories have abolished stamp duties on life insurance policies. This includes the ACT, which I can say is at the forefront of this tax reform. However, these taxes remain in some other jurisdictions. The former Labor spokesperson for financial services, the member for Rankin, raised this issue when he spoke on the bill earlier last year. Labor's position is that taxes on insurance, such as stamp duties, should not be included in the amount of the premium on which the calculations of the allowable commissions are based. Allowing commissions on taxes would set a concerning precedent.


Given that these reforms have been delayed to 2018, there is no longer a need for transitional arrangements while the industry updates its systems to accommodate the exclusion of tax from the amount on which the commission is based. The latest exposure draft regulations indicate that taxes on insurance are excluded from the policy cost on which the maximum allowable commissions are calculated. We are pleased that these draft regulations address this concern. We will be looking at the final regulations to make sure that this remains the case.


Having spoken about what the bill does, it is worth noting what the bill does not do. First of all, this bill does not guarantee that these new standards will be enforced. As mentioned earlier, ASIC's review of retail life insurance found a striking lack of compliance in this space. We support ASIC in the steps it takes to ensure that advisers abide by these laws.


Secondly, this bill does not address concerns that have been raised about the way parts of the life insurance industry handle claims. The bill does something in relation to conflicted remuneration for financial advisers selling life insurance products but it does not address the issue of conflicted remuneration for claims handlers. Claims handlers are charged with making fair decisions on the merits of life insurance claims. It was very concerning that ASIC's recent report, Life insurance claims: an industry review, showed that at least two life insurers are still paying remuneration that includes incentives in relation to claims handling.


Finally, the bill does not address the broader cultural and systemic issues that have come to light within the banking and financial services sector. This includes very serious concerns about the life insurance industry, such as high claims-denial rates, delays in processing claims and insurers hiding behind outdated medical definitions to deny claims. These are very serious issues for an industry that many Australians turn to in the darkest moments of their lives—an industry that they rely on in these moments to do the right thing.


So, we support these modest reforms in this bill in the hope that they will improve consumer confidence in the quality of financial advice on life insurance. However, they go only so far. We will not ignore the broader issues that have been raised in relation to the banking and financial services sector. A strong banking and financial services sector depends on Australians having confidence in that sector. That is why we need to get to the bottom of the culture and practices that have allowed repeated instances of misconduct to occur. This issue was illustrated recently when Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman Kate Carnell said:


We've had a look at 17 inquiries over quite a number of years with the banks saying 'yeah, yeah, yeah, we're going to change' and then they don't. And then they find a way to have another inquiry and kick the can down the road to find another reason why they won't change.


Ms Carnell also said:


I think though what we've got is a banking industry in Australia, particularly the big four banks, that believe for whatever reason that they can continue with business as usual and they don't have to change.


Labor believes that the only investigation that can to get to the bottom of these issues is a royal commission, and that is why we will continue to argue for one. Labor believes that any systemic issues need to be ventilated and investigated in a thorough and transparent way. We need to give victims a chance to be heard, and we need to give Australians the confidence that these repeated scandals will not continue to occur.

Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (15:01):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answers provided by Senator Brandis to the questions without notice asked today by Senators Cameron and Singh.


I noticed in one of the weekend papers that they had a scorecard for senators opposite. I think it might have been in the South Australian press. Senator Brandis was holding the rest of them up. I think he got a four out of 10. I have got to tell you, if the press had seen this performance today, it would have been even less than four out of 10. They might have even hit the minus button on his performance today.


Here we are, with the Attorney-General having absolutely no idea about the issues facing families on housing. He is dismissing negative gearing and capital gains tax reforms simply because it benefits those who vote Liberal more than anyone else. Liberal electorates are the ones that are doing most of the negative gearing and the capital gains tax assessments; they get more money out of it than anyone else. Yet ordinary Australians are out there, trying to buy a house. First homebuyers are absolutely struggling and this government—this mob, this rabble of a government, this divided government and this government that cannot even hold its own members in the government itself—has not got a clue about the issues on capital gains tax and negative gearing.


Senator Brandis says Labor's policies will push up prices. The Treasurer says there will be higher home prices under Labor's policies. The Assistant Treasurer says it would increase the cost of housing for all Australians, and yet the Prime Minister says:


Bill Shorten's policy is calculated to reduce the value of your home.


This mob does not have a clue. Go out to Parramatta, where many young families have gone out to establish a home. But unless you have got about $1.6 million, do not try to buy a house in Parramatta because you will never be able to get it. Go to Penrith, go to the lower Blue Mountains: homes there are now worth over a million dollars.


Yet the answer of former Senator Joyce, now the Deputy Prime Minister, is for young people in the Sydney metropolitan area to go bush. His answer is, 'Go bush, and everything will be okay! You can buy a cheap house out there. Abandon your family, abandon your community and abandon your job. Go to Toowoomba. Everything will be okay!' That is the answer this rabble of a government have for people. Yet Mr John Alexander is clear about the issue. Mr Alexander—Liberal member in the lower House and chair of the committee on housing costs until he was sacked by the government—has said:


We have been told time and time again that supply is the answer.


That is what Senator Brandis said today. Mr Alexander said:


But it's no good creating cities in the southern highlands and outside of Goulburn and outside of Shepparton if the same game is played ... where the investor will have an enormous advantage over the homebuyer and then dominate that market.


How many young homebuyers lob up to have a look at a house in Sydney and are asked, 'Are you here to invest or are you actually buying?' The investors have got all the cards in their back pocket. The investors are the ones who are going to make the gains. The investors are the ones who are going to buy that house. Young people are getting pushed out. Yet this government will not accept what economists are telling people all over the country, which is, 'You must get rid of negative gearing and capital gains tax to try to level the playing field for young Australians who are trying to get into the housing market.'


Yes, Wayne Swan, the former Treasurer, might have said something a few years ago. But I know Wayne Swan, and I know what Keynes said:


When the facts change, I change my mind.


That is what Wayne Swan has done. He has looked at the facts, something that this mob will not do. It is not right for Senator Brandis to laugh. Senator Brandis is going to be in London shortly, so it will not matter about the house prices! He is gone! (Time expired)

"Hume, Sen Jane",LP,2017-02-09,"



Senator HUME
 (Victoria) (15:06):  I am very pleased to get an opportunity to speak on the particular issue of housing affordability, because it is an issue that I have a personal interest in. Actually quite recently, I have been trying to buy my own house. Now, for those of you who are not aware, I am a single mother and I have three children. I am trying to find a house that is affordable and that is in a reasonable position—




Senator Cameron:
  That is on a base salary of $200,000, so you are not doing too bad.




Senator HUME:
  As you said, I am on a parliamentarian's salary. But it is a tough gig, trying to find somewhere that is appropriate for your children—schools—and trying to find somewhere that is near elderly parents. This is tough for me, so I can only imagine how tough it is for those who are not as well off as we are.


Housing affordability is not a problem that can be solved with a blunt instrument. It is not a problem that can be solved with a simple solution of changing negative gearing or changing capital gains tax. There is so much more to this problem. It is highly nuanced. We have already discussed the issue of supply. We have discussed that over and over again today, and surely, logically, this is one of the answers. Opening up supply, not just in our cities but on the outskirts of our cities, is vitally important. Demand and supply are so interconnected in this particular issue. And this is something that the federal government is looking at right now. But it is not just a federal government issue; we need state government to buy in, and we need Labor state governments to buy into this issue. It cannot be directed solely at the federal government. We need a bipartisan approach to housing supply issues.


But beyond that, we need to take the next step, into regional development. This is something that the coalition government has been committed to for a long time now. We have been trying to decentralise Australia's urban population with things like the Building Better Regions fund, which is $297 million over four years, and with things like the Roads to Recovery program—$3.2 billion. These are the programs that will encourage people to look beyond our major cities, to look beyond the east coast to establish their lives elsewhere, places where there is housing affordability, because it is not an Australia-wide problem; this is definitely east coast, and it is definitely centred on major cities.


That said, there are other things that we can do. It is not just a matter of moving to Toowoomba or moving to Townsville. There are microreforms that state governments can take part in, and the federal government will also be considering those issues—things like stamp duty, if you look at some of the changes that the ACT government has recently implemented. It will be interesting to see how they play out. But certainly stamp duty is one of the great inhibitors of housing affordability. And that really is a state government issue. Beyond that—and this is something that I am particularly excited about—is not just the issue of housing affordability but affordable housing. And I know that Treasurer Scott Morrison has taken this particular issue and made it his own—and the appointment of the Assistant Minister to the Treasurer, Michael Sukkar, a fantastic fellow and very, very well qualified to be dealing with this particular issue and working in this space. He has been canvassing a number of coalition MPs and also undergoing a lot of research into this particular issue. I know that the Treasurer has recently come back from the UK, where he spoke to the UK's Housing Finance Corporation about social investment in housing. That is an absolutely fascinating thing that the UK has been doing, because the THFC is a finance aggregator and an intermediary that co-funds affordable housing for rent-ownership. This shared ownership model is something that I think the coalition should be considering—that I know that the coalition is considering. But, again, it is one of those things that requires longevity. Housing affordability is a long-term project. To implement this appropriately needs bipartisan support. So, I would urge those opposite to look beyond the blunt instruments of negative gearing, beyond the blunt instruments of capital gains tax, and think outside of the square. It is not just about those two solutions. (Time expired)

"O'Neill, Sen Deb",ALP,2017-02-09,"



Senator O'NEILL
 (New South Wales) (15:11):  I also rise to speak on this motion to take note of answers on housing affordability and to express some incredulity at the absolute lack of preparedness in terms of any policy position from the Leader of the Government in the Senate this afternoon. When asked a question by Senator Singh about the government report that has been 20 months in the making, his response was absolutely missing any policy response at all. Senator Brandis in fact said, in his response to that question, that he was not going to embark on any policy, and that is clearly what this government has decided to do—not to do anything at all about the shame of inequitable access to housing for Australians.


The Turnbull government has indeed sat on its hands as this housing affordability crisis has gotten worse and worse. And we can see why it is getting worse—the failure of policy response that we saw in the answers given today. This government has not appointed a federal minister for housing and homelessness. There is no national housing affordability plan being implemented anywhere. The government continues to ignore the advice of independent economists, international economic agencies and think tanks who argue that Australia's housing affordability crisis needs more than blaming the states for a lack of housing supply. And that is all we heard today: the reiteration of that—it is the states' fault, it is the states' responsibility; they are the ones who should release the land; it is simple supply and demand. And we heard it reiterated in the comments by Senator Hume. It is no plan for no Australian and it has nothing to do with a future that we need to see, no vision for Australians to actually get housing.


This week the government's complete lack of leadership and lack of vision were evident when it came to housing affordability. The House of Representatives Economics Committee, after spending 20 months and being given 65 submissions and hearing 68 witnesses, handed down its housing affordability report. The government members have recommended not one change—zero recommendations—to their housing affordability inquiry. That is a waste of an entire committee, a complete waste of taxpayers' money, and it is symptomatic of this government's absolute lack of leadership, lack of policy and lack of any ideas about solving this crisis that is part of the world in which we Labor senators, at least, live.


Mr Harbourside Mansion: his policy is that your mum and dad should kick in and buy you your first home. A complete lack of leadership that is obvious from this lack of policy from the government when it comes to housing affordability mirrors their approach to economic policy. It is a failure.



Senator Brandis interjecting—




Senator O'NEILL:
  I can see that this whole debate is absolutely getting under the skin of the Attorney-General—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator O'Neill, could you resume your seat.




Senator Bilyk:
  Madam Deputy President, I think there was a very nasty reflection on the Leader of the Opposition by Senator Brandis, and I would ask that you ask him to withdraw.




Senator Brandis:
  I did not reflect on the Leader of the Opposition.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  I remind senators that there is a standard of parliamentary debate in the Senate, and all of us should be mindful of that when we speak.





Senator Bilyk:
  It must be upsetting them.




Senator O'NEILL:
  I agree with Senator Bilyk's interjection there. I think it would be very instructive to review any comments that have been noted by Hansard, because I believe that I heard a very insulting remark. I was about to make the comment that clearly Senator Brandis is very unhappy about having to debate this important policy position. We know that the Liberal Party are vastly out of touch with what is going on for ordinary Australians who cannot get into the housing market and cannot secure a home by the way in which they simply dismiss the problem. What we have heard is the confusion: 'If we do anything, prices will go up. If we do anything, prices will go down.' They do not know how to react to the problem.


In addition to that, they say to young people who are looking to get a home or people who are trying to get into the market at any age: 'Just move. Go and find a life somewhere else. Leave your job, leave your family, leave your supports, leave your doctor, leave your health care, leave it all behind. Just go and find somewhere you can afford. Go to where you belong, away from the cities, away from the entire east coast where this problem is absolutely abundant.' A Productivity Commission report has revealed the full extent of the Turnbull government's cuts to funding for affordable housing. The Productivity Commission confirms that there is $400 million less being invested in the National Affordable Housing Agreement than in 2011-12. So in addition to ignoring the problems, spending 20 months coming up with a report with no recommendations and failing to answer a single question today, they have taken $400 million away from what needs to happen for investment in affordable housing. This is a government that is failing every Australian with regard to housing policy in every state and in every possible way. (Time expired)

"McKenzie, Sen Bridget",Nats,2017-02-09,"



Senator McKENZIE
 (Victoria) (15:17):  It would seem from listening to today's take note debate that the Labor Party, in our first week back in this place after the break over summer, is still on the beach. They have not come with a new policy. They may have taken their break in the regions. They may have gone up to the Gold Coast, maybe Mr Shorten was down at Lorne—




Senator Brandis:
  He would've been at Portsea or Sorrento.




Senator McKENZIE:
  No, he would not have been at Lorne or Anglesea; he was definitely at Sorrento and Portsea—absolutely, Senator Brandis, thank you. That is right. That is exactly where Labor spent their summer. What they have not done is spend it on good ideas about what can build and grow our nation. It is incredibly expensive to live in capital cities on the east coast and to purchase a home, particularly in Melbourne and Sydney and increasingly so in Brisbane, but the solution is not the tired, worn-out housing policy the Labor Party took to, and failed to convince the Australian public about at, the last election. In fact, what the Labor Party fails to realise is that the issues around housing affordability are complex but directly go to demand and supply, and so it is state governments who should be releasing more and more land around capital cities. It is state governments and local councils who should be considering density requirements around their suburbs to ensure that housing stocks, the supply side of that equation, actually increase. That indeed is not within the purview of the federal government. 




Senator Bilyk:
  Where did you go for your holiday, Bridget? You don't even have a policy. You don't know whether prices will go up or down.




Senator McKENZIE:
  What we have been doing over summer, rather than lying on a beach with a tattered copy of our election policies, is talking to constituents out there in communities, talking to our local people to understand what their issues are. We understand what they want. You know what it is pretty hard to do? It is pretty hard to get a mortgage without a job. It is very hard to purchase a house—whether it is in Bunbury, whether it is in Benalla or whether it is in Brisbane—without a job. What our government has been focused on is increasing jobs supply and absolutely ensuring that the policies we bring to this place are wholly and solely focused on improving the economic growth within this country and therefore the job prospects of Australians across our economy, not just in capital cities.


I know Senator Hume went through some of the regional policies that we have been developing and talking about, but just this week, for instance, we have seen support for our dairy industry come through the parliament in the House. You want to talk about jobs? I know people on the other side deride living in the country as if it is a bad place, as if it is a negative thing to not live in a capital city. I can tell you, having grown up in a rural area, that it is fantastic. I think there are a lot of CEOs of ASX companies who come from the country. There are a lot of scientists—contrary to those critiquing the APVMA situation—that come from regional areas. A lot of science is done in the regions. When we talk about not having jobs, I think about the measures passed through the House about the dairy industry, which supports 40,000 jobs across this country directly and 100,000 indirectly. Those measures we passed in the other place to support them and their sustainability were fantastic, the sign of a government focused on job creation across our economy—food manufacturing, tourism jobs, trade agreements and mobile infrastructure. It is an incredible challenge. We all want Australians to be able to realise the great Australian dream of owning their own home, but we have to ensure that they have a job and that they earn enough money to save for it.


I think Bernard Salt is quite a witty commentator. He wrote a fabulous article about young people and how they choose to spend their disposable income these days. I think it is quite a useful reference point. I know that my government will be doing absolutely everything it can do, but we are not state governments. We cannot increase land supply. We cannot override local councils' planning decisions. What we can do is focus on building a strong economy so that each and every Australian can have a secure job where their wage increases so they can save and increase their prospects of owning their own home over the course of their lifetime. What we have been focused on over summer has been improving the outcome for all Australians; you have been at the beach. (Time expired)

"Bilyk, Sen Catryna",ALP,2017-02-09,"



Senator BILYK
 (Tasmania) (15:22):  Once again today we heard Senator Brandis not even attempt to answer the questions that were asked of him. We had the diatribe about everything in the world being the fault of the Labor Party and what terrible people we are, but it just goes to show exactly how out of touch with ordinary Australians both he and the Prime Minister, for the moment—I think he has a limited tenure there, I might add—are. It goes to show that they do not have an answer and they have no desire, really, to find an answer or to fix the issue of housing affordability. Senator Brandis was asked, 'Who was correct—was it the Treasurer or the PM—regarding housing price changes under the Labor Party policy?' which is a fantastic policy for housing, and he could not give an answer.


So, once again, there is lots of dysfunction, chaos and division within the government. Their attempt at a scare campaign on Labor Party policy on housing is just that. It is a pretty weak attempt and it is pretty hopeless. But we all remember the former Treasurer's response to housing affordability—that was for people to get a better job. Mr Hockey probably managed to get a better job. After all, he has gone to America and he has a lovely house there at taxpayers' expense. Someone might say I am envious, because that seems to be the latest line from the government: we are all envious on this side.





Senator Brandis:
  How many times have you been to dinner at Raheen, Senator?




Senator BILYK:
  Senator Brandis, while Mr Hockey has left the parliament what we have been left with is Mr Barnaby Joyce. He recently suggested that you just need to get out of Sydney and Melbourne. What a hoot! Move away from your family, move away from your support and move away from your friends and your life and everyone you know. Move away and don't worry about your job. Move away from your GP. In other parts of Australia it is even a matter of moving away from public transport. His suggestion is to move to somewhere where unemployment is higher and jobs are more difficult to secure, just so you can buy a house. Well, no, I do not think that is right. I think that shows the absolute cold and callous indifference of Senator Brandis's government. I am not sure if he is popping over to London to get a new house soon, but I am sure we will find out sooner rather than later. Certainly, I know people on his side are trying to get rid of him and would like him to go. But that is not the point. The point is that unless we address prices in capital cities, high costs will continue to push people out into regional centres, jacking up the house prices and perpetuating the affordability crisis regional residents already face.


Labor has a great policy, no matter what those living in Narnia land over on that side say. We have a great policy in regard to—




Senator Brandis:
  What land?




Senator BILYK:
  Narnia land. I am sure you would have read that book, Senator Brandis. With all your books I would be most surprised if you had not read Narnia, because you have those huge bookshelves chock-a-block full of things—




Senator Brandis:
  It is called Narnia, not Narnia land.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order!




Senator BILYK:
  I should not let Senator Brandis and his very large bookshelves and large acquisition of books distract me! We do have and have had some great proposed changes to negative gearing tax concessions that would limit it to newly built homes, and changes to the capital gains tax concession, reducing it from 50 per cent to 25 per cent. That would save the budget $565 million over four years. But, instead, we get from the other side: 'Well, get your parents to buy you a house.' Thanks very much: I am a parent and my son lives in Sydney and now I have two adult children saying to me, 'Help me buy a house.' I will do what I can for my kids, but not every parent is earning the income I am earning. If you think people on $80,000 a year are able to buy their kids a house then you are living in Narnia—you are living in some completely different realm, not Narnia, where reality is non-existent.


Young people deserve a chance to own a home. The Australian dream of owning your own home is still strong and ongoing with most Australians— (Time expired)

Inquiry into the Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (Jobs for Families Child Care Package) Bill 2016 [Provisions] and Social Services Legislation Amendment (Family Payments Structural Reform and Participation Measures) Bill 2016 [Provisions]



February 2017




Introduction



The Australian Government welcomes the report by the Senate Education and Employment Legislation Committee in relation to the inquiry into the Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (Jobs for Families Child Care Package) Bill 2016 (the Child Care Bill) and Social Services Legislation Amendment (Family Payments Structural Reform and Participation Measures) Bill 2016 (the Social Services Bill).


The Jobs for Families Child Care Package (the Package) will provide genuine and necessary reform for a simpler, more affordable, accessible and flexible child care system. The Government's child care assistance package strikes the right balance between targeted child care support for hard working families who depend upon it, a generous safety net to protect those most vulnerable in our community and ongoing support for high quality early learning. This is why the passage of the Child Care Bill, as well as the savings required to fund it, is amongst the Government's top priorities for 2017.


The Government thanks those individuals and organisations who contributed to this inquiry, and previous inquiries into these Bills, by preparing written submissions or appearing at the public hearings.




Majority report



The Government welcomes and accepts the recommendation from the Majority Report that these Bills be passed. The Government notes the Committee's view that reforms to the child care system contained within the Child Care Bill will achieve quality early childhood education and care as well as provide increased opportunities for workforce participation.


The Government also notes the Committee's view that the measures contained within the Social Services Bill will provide greater assistance on a fortnightly basis to lower income families who need it, and will create a more accessible and flexible child care system for Australian families.




Dissenting reports and additional comments



The Government's response to each recommendation made in the Senate Committee's report, including those contained in the dissenting reports of Labor and the Australian Greens Senators respectively, and the additional comments by Senator Skye Kakoschke-Moore from the Nick Xenophon Team, is provided below. There will be further opportunity to address concerns raised in dissenting reports and comments throughout the Parliamentary debate.


The Government does not accept the recommendations from Labor and the Australian Greens Senators that the Social Services Bill not be passed. The Government considers that redirecting funding from Family Tax Benefits into greater investment into childcare is a better way to spend public money. This redirection of funding will strengthen the incentives and support required to further increase workforce participation and, based on evidence and research, assist in increasing the living standards of low and middle income families. The Government notes that no other viable proposals to fully fund the Package were put forward during the inquiry and remains of the view that funding offsets are necessary in order to ensure a sustainable child care system into the future. The reforms in the Social Services Bill, in conjunction with those in the Child Care Bill, represent a fair and fiscally responsible way to deliver a simpler and more accessible, flexible and affordable child care system.


The Government acknowledges the range of feedback that has been received in relation to the development of the Child Care Bill over the period of its development, including through the Productivity Commission Inquiry, Regulation Impact Statement consultation process, two Senate Inquiry processes and ongoing consultation with the sector by the Department of Education and Training, as detailed in Attachment A.


The Government has considered the views of the sector in developing the Child Care Bill and will continue to consult with the sector and with the Senate cross-bench on the Package to ensure these reforms achieve the objectives of increasing affordability, flexibility and accessibility of the child care system for families.

Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (Jobs for Families Child Care Package) Bill 2016





Recommendation contained in the Committee
'
s Report



1. The committee recommends that both bills be passed.


The Government accepts the Committee's recommendation and urges Members of the House of Representatives and Senators to support legislation to ensure the Government can support families most in need through a sustainable system that will deliver quality learning experiences for Australian children.




Recommendations contained in Labor Senators
'
 Dissenting Report



1. Key ministerial determinations and rules—which will set many of the parameters affecting the day to day use of the system by families—should be published before the Parliament considers the Bill. This includes those relating to children at risk, financial hardship and the activity test.


In line with legislative process, the Minister's and Secretary's Rules that sit under the Jobs for Families legislation will be tabled following its passage.


In developing the underlying policy for the Minister's and Secretary's Rules, the Department of Education and Training has consulted extensively with, and taken advice from, the sector, as detailed in Attachment A. This has included targeted consultation on the policy parameters of the Additional Child Care Subsidy (Child Wellbeing) payment and the activity test.


A number of changes have already been incorporated in proposed Rules as a result of feedback from the sector. As the Department of Education and Training is still refining draft Rules, and will continue to seek feedback, it is not possible to publish a final set of Rules at this time, noting that Rules can only be made by the Minister or Secretary once the primary legislation has been passed by the Parliament.



The Department of Education and Training will continue to engage with the sector as these Rules are developed and will ensure that there is adequate opportunity for review and further feedback.


2. The transition process for Budget Based Funded Indigenous and Mobile services should be stopped and direct ongoing support should be guaranteed.


The Government is committed to ensuring these valuable community services continue to operate beyond the introduction of the Package. Senator the Hon Simon Birmingham, Minister for Education and Training, wrote to all BBF services in December 2016, expressing this commitment and clarifying the transition process (Attachment B).


The current funding model for Budget Based Funded (BBF) services is not working in a fair or transparent way, with some services receiving less than $100 per child per year and other services receiving thousands of dollars per child per year. A major program review, an ANAO audit and several smaller projects highlighted a range of problems with the BBF Program, including:


the program objective is unclear


most BBF services operate outside the regulatory system and are excluded from the National Quality Framework so BBF services are not held to the same quality standards as approved services


the program is capped and fully committed meaning no new services can be funded in areas of need


there is no incentive for services to increase utilisation


in some cases families pay high fees but are not eligible for any fee subsidy


in some locations approved child care services have been established close to the BBF service so there may no longer be a real need for that service


funding for BBF services has remained stagnant while funding for mainstream child care has increased steadily for many years.


The Government notes that some stakeholders have called for a separate grant fund for services providing care for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children. To do this would create these same issues, whereby artificial limits would be set, and services would not be paid according to the numbers of children that attend.


The new funding arrangements through the Child Care Subsidy will be demand driven, encouraging new services to open or expand their service delivery where there is need. This will mean former BBF services can be funded equitably based on the number of children they support and the services they deliver.


The new system has been designed to support a diverse range of services that have the flexibility to adapt to the needs of local families. The current arrangements do not allow this flexibility and have effectively limited services that would have benefited from a fairer funding model, such as the one proposed as part of this legislation.


Additional funding will be provided to eligible services through the Community Child Care Fund which will provide grants to child care services to reduce barriers to accessing child care, provide sustainability support for child care services experiencing viability issues and provide capital support to increase the supply of child care places in areas of high unmet demand, particularly in disadvantaged, regional or remote communities.


Further, the Additional Child Care Subsidy will provide extra subsidies to families who are eligible under the child-wellbeing component, those experiencing temporary financial hardship, and people moving from income support into work.


The Department of Education and Training has engaged consultants to provide face-to-face support to BBF funding recipients in their transition to the new child care system or, where appropriate, to move to alternative funding arrangements. This support commenced in May 2016.


Support will be provided in two phases. Phase 1, which will largely be completed by February 2017, is the development of a comprehensive report and transition plan for each BBF funding recipient including mobile BBF services. The analysis undertaken in Phase 1 will inform the ongoing tailored support provided to BBF funding recipients through Phase 2. This face-to-face support is expected to begin in February 2017 and will continue as long as necessary, beyond July 2018 if required.


3. The Government should consider amendments to their child care changes to:


 Ensure vulnerable and disadvantaged children are provided with adequate access to early education and care;


 Ensure the activity test—and associated determinations and rules—don't introduce unnecessary barriers for parents trying to get back into the workforce;


 Continue providing children with access to two days early education a week, and trial any changes to the activity test before their introduction; and


 Provide an immediate increase in assistance for families; in recognition of the cost pressures families will face because of the Government's decision to delay additional assistance until mid-2018.


The new Child Care Safety Net will assist disadvantaged communities and vulnerable and at-risk children and their families by addressing barriers in accessing child care, while encouraging parents to enter or re-enter the workforce. In particular, the Additional Child Care Subsidy component of the Child Care Safety Net will provide targeted additional fee assistance to families and children facing barriers in accessing affordable child care, including:


children at risk of serious abuse or neglect


grandparents on income support who are the primary caregivers of their grandchildren


families experiencing temporary financial hardship


low income families transitioning to work from income support


families with an income below around $65,000 (in 2017 terms) where the family does not meet the activity test.


The activity test will ensure Government support is better targeted to those who depend on child care to work, train, study, or participate in other recognised activities. It is estimated that the Package will encourage more than 230,000 families to increase their involvement in paid employment.


Under the Package, the more hours a parent works, studies, or trains (including in combination with other activities such as volunteering and looking for work) the more hours of subsidised child care they can access. In addition, the new Child Care Subsidy will be paid directly to child care service providers to make the system simpler for families.


A broad range of activities will meet the activity test requirements, including paid work, looking for work, volunteering or study. People on paid and unpaid parental leave who are returning to work would also meet the activity test. To ensure families with casual or irregular work are not disadvantaged by the activity test and to ensure their children receive continuity of care, parents in this circumstance will be able to estimate their hours of activity over a three month period.


The entry point to the activity test is set at a very low base - at least 8 hours of activity a fortnight results in access to up to 36 hours of subsidised child care a fortnight; more than 16 hours of activity a fortnight results in access to up to 72 hours of subsidised care a fortnight; and that more than 48 hours of activity a fortnight results in access to up to 100 hours of subsidised care a fortnight.


We know children from disadvantaged backgrounds benefit most from quality early childhood education and care, and that's why we're providing additional support to those who need it most. Families with incomes below around $65,000 (in 2017 terms) who do not meet the activity test will be able to access 24 hours per fortnight of subsidised care —equivalent to two weekly six-hour sessions—at the highest 85 per cent rate of subsidy (this is an increase on the current 72 per cent). The removal of minimum hours per day and days per week opening requirements will allow service providers' to deliver these hours over two sessions per week.


The Government is also considering the sector's proposal to increase the number of subsidised hours for families with low incomes (below around $65,000 in 2017 terms) who do not meet the activity test from 24 to 30 hours per fortnight as part of its negotiations and deliberations in preparation for Parliamentary debate. Noting that this and any other changes requiring additional expenditure would need to be offset.


As the Child Care Subsidy and Additional Child Care Subsidy will be legislated payments, it would be difficult to trial the new activity test prior to the legislated start date. This is why the Department of Education and Training is consulting on key policy concepts in the Bill that will be set out in Minister's Rules, such as Activity Test definitions and implementation details. This will ensure that key elements of the package are well tested amongst the sector before their final implementation.


To improve affordability for families in the short term, on 1 July 2017 the existing Child Care Rebate will be indexed by the Consumer Price Index for the first time since Labor froze the cap in 2011.



The Government will continue to consult with the sector on the detail of the Package over the coming months to ensure these reforms achieve the objectives of increasing affordability, flexibility and accessibility of the child care system for families.


4. Funding for early education should not be conditional on Family Tax Benefit cuts which will hurt low and middle income families.


As a result of the increased Australian Government investment into child care, the Package is to be implemented using savings contained in the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Family Payments Structural Reform and Participation Measures) Bill 2016.


The Government notes that no other viable proposals to fully fund the Package were put forward during the inquiry and remains of the view that funding offsets are necessary in order to ensure a sustainable child care system into the future. The reforms in the Social Services Bill, in conjunction with those in the Child Care Bill, represent a fair and fiscally responsible way to deliver a simpler and more accessible, flexible and affordable child care system.




Recommendations contained in the Dissenting Report by the Australian Greens



1. The Australian Greens recommend that the activity test be amended to include an additional amount of base level subsidised childcare for all families that fall within the 0-8 hours of activity to a minimum of two full days care.


The entry point to the activity test is set at a very low base - at least 8 hours of activity a fortnight results in access to up to 36 hours of subsidised child care a fortnight; more than 16 hours of activity a fortnight results in access to up to 72 hours of subsidised care a fortnight; and that more than 48 hours of activity a fortnight results in the maximum amount of subsidised care of 100 hours a fortnight.


A broad range of activities will meet the activity test requirements, including paid work, looking for work, volunteering or study. People on paid and unpaid parental leave who are returning to work would also meet the activity test. To ensure families with casual or irregular work are not disadvantaged by the activity test and to ensure their children receive continuity of care, parents in this circumstance will be able to estimate their hours of activity over a three month period.


Families with incomes below around $65,000 (in 2017 terms) who do not meet the activity test will be able to access 24 hours per fortnight of subsidised care —equivalent to two weekly six-hour sessions—at the highest 85 per cent rate of subsidy (this is an increase on the current 72 per cent). The removal of minimum hours per day and days per week opening requirements will allow service providers' to deliver these hours over two sessions per week.


The Government is also considering the sector's proposal to increase the number of hours in the safety net from 24 to 30 hours per fortnight as part of its negotiations and deliberations in preparation for Parliamentary debate. Noting that this and any other changes requiring additional expenditure would need to be offset.


2. The Australian Greens recommend that an adequately flexible reporting grace period be adopted that allows all casual workers, part-time workers with irregular hours or people who lose their jobs to estimate their expected activity and childcare needs, so as not to be disadvantaged by the activity test.




Workers with casual or irregular hours:



To ensure families with casual or irregular work are not disadvantaged by the activity test and to ensure their children receive continuity of care, parents in these circumstances will be able to estimate their hours of activity over a three month period. This will be captured in a Minister's rule, the content of which has been the subject of consultation with the sector.




Individuals who experience sudden change of circumstances:



Current provisions in the Bill already ensure continuity of care when parents experience a sudden change in circumstance that affects their entitlement.


These provisions include:


The Additional Child Care Subsidy (Temporary Financial Hardship) that will provide short‑term increased child care fee assistance to families who are experiencing significant financial stress due to exceptional circumstances. Families experiencing temporary financial hardship will be eligible to receive a subsidy equal to the actual fee charged, up to 120 per cent of the Child Care Subsidy hourly fee cap, for up to 100 hours per fortnight, for a maximum of 13 weeks per event). Families will not be required to meet the activity test during this period.


Individuals' eligibility for this payment can be backdated up to 28 days (from the date of application), in recognition that family circumstances may change with little or no notice.


The capacity for the Secretary of the Department of Education and Training to make a case-by-case determination of an individual's activity test result based on exceptional circumstances, which could be more than 100 hours of subsidy per fortnight. Exceptional circumstances could include, but would not be limited to, families impacted by significant trauma, the short-term incapacity of the individual or a member of their family, or where the individual, their partner or their child is affected by domestic violence.


An activity test which recognises the combined total of a broad range of activities (including actively looking for work and volunteering) to help them maintain access to subsidised care where their usual activity ceases unexpectedly.


3. The Australian Greens recommend that unless additional funding for services which meets the needs of vulnerable children in remote and regional Australia and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children is provided, that the current Budget Based Funding levels remain in place.


Refer to the response provided to Labor Senator's Dissenting Report, Recommendation 2, above.


4. The Australian Greens recommend an amendment to include mechanisms for increasing childcare places where vacancy rates are critically low, creating barriers to parents being able to find affordable care.



The Government does not intervene directly in the child care market. Elements of the Package are aimed at encouraging services to be more flexible in how they provide care and child care places to both encourage more providers and to free up potential places in current services. For example, the Government is removing the requirement on the number of hours per day and days per week that an approved service must be open, in order to free services up to respond to the particular needs of their community.


5. The Australian Greens recommend that providers of In Home Care be explicitly referenced in the Bill as being eligible for Child Care Subsidy payments.


In Home Care (IHC) is an important part of the child care and early education landscape and will continue beyond the introduction of the Package in July 2018.


The future policy design for approved child care delivered in the family's home will be informed by the current evaluation of the Nanny Pilot Programme, and the review of IHC. The Institute of Social Science Research at the University of Queensland is currently undertaking the evaluation to inform future policy, which will be designed to cater to a range of different needs, including parents who cannot work for reasons such as disability or illness, parents who live in rural or remote areas away from suitable child care options and parents who are looking to either meet or increase their workforce commitments and cannot access other child care because they work non-standard hours.


It has been over 10 years since there has been a review of IHC and the current review, which will be completed this year, seeks to collect more up-to-date information about the IHC program to inform development of the new policy.


The Child Care Bill contains a rule making provision to prescribe a new service type and a relevant Child Care Subsidy hourly rate cap. Provision will be made for continued Australian Government support for care in the family's home under the Package, based on the findings of the University of Queensland evaluation and the IHC review.



Recommendations contained in the Additional Comments by the Nick Xenophon Team



1. The Department of Education clarify as a matter of urgency whether funding for in-home care will continue to be made available under the Jobs for Families package.


Refer to the response provided to the Dissenting Report by the Australian Greens, Recommendation 5, above.


2. The Department of Education review their consultation procedures to ensure that all appropriate stakeholder groups are comprehensively consulted when reform packages are being developed.


The development and refinement of the Package has been the subject of significant and comprehensive consultation over several years, as outlined in Attachment A.


The Department of Education and Training is committed to ongoing consultation and will continue to engage with the sector on policy settings for the Minister's and Secretary's Rules to be made under the Child Care Bill.


3. The Department of Education and Training make public information in relation to the tenders.


All details relating to contracts executed with the department are publicly available on AusTender which is the Australian Government's procurement information system. The three contract numbers relating to the tender to support Budget Based Funded services to transition to the new child care system are:


1. PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) - CN3341068-A2


2. PricewaterhouseCoopers Indigenous Consulting (PIC) - CN3341067


3. Community Child Care Co-operative NSW (CCCC) - CN3341077


Contract number 3341077 with the CCCC was mutually terminated on 31 August 2016 and has been incorporated into contract CN3341068-A2.


The contract was mutually terminated as the CCCC did not have a detailed understanding of key elements of the Package which resulted in contractual obligations not being met, specifically in regards to the support for BBF services to transition to the new child care system or alternative funding arrangements.


4. The Department further consults with stakeholders regarding the suitability of the 15 hours proposal and the impact on business models of ECEC providers.


The Department of Education and Training notes that a number of stakeholders in the early childhood education and care sector have worked together to propose increasing the low income provision (for families with annual income under the low income threshold and who not meet the activity test) from the 24 hours of subsidised care per fortnight (12 hours per week) contained in the Child Care Bill, to 30 hours per fortnight (15 hours per week).


The Government is also considering this proposal as part of its negotiations and deliberations in preparation for Parliamentary debate of the Bills.


The Bill removes regulatory requirements that currently apply to child care services, including the hours per day and days per week a service must open. This will allow providers and services to be able to consider flexible options that may better suit their children and families, as well as their business.


5. The Department conduct modelling on the impact 15 hours of subsidised ECEC would have on childcare workers' workforce participation.


The Government is considering the sector's proposal to increase the number of subsidised hours of care to low income families who do not meet the activity test from 12 to 15 hours per week and notes evidence given by Mr John Cherry, Advocacy Manager, Goodstart Early Learning to the Committee on this matter, as follows:



""I can speak on behalf of the country's largest provider. We certainly believe that the key to actually going from 12 to 15 is that it forces you to offer two sessions, two days, because 12 hours in the long day care environment is closest to one day but certainly when you move to 15 then you have to offer that over two days. As the largest childcare provider we would say that we would be certainly looking at offering sessions over two days that would meet that 15-hour entitlement.""1


The removal of minimum hours per day and days per week operating requirements will enable services to consider flexible options that may better suit children and families, as well as their business.


The Department of Education and Training is unable to model the workforce participation of child care workers, including in relation to this proposal, because child care service providers are responsible for making their own business decisions in relation to operational matters including staffing.

Australian Government response to the Senate Education and Employment Legislation Committee report:





Inquiry into the Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (Jobs for Families Child Care Package) Bill 2015 [Provisions]





February 2017





Introduction



The Australian Government welcomes the report by the Senate Education and Employment Legislation Committee in relation to the inquiry into the Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (Jobs for Families Child Care Package) Bill 2015 (the 2015 Child Care Bill) and thanks those individuals and organisations who contributed to this inquiry by preparing written submissions or appearing at the public hearings.


The Jobs for Families Child Care Package (the Package) will provide genuine and necessary reform for a simpler, more affordable, accessible and flexible child care system. The Government's child care assistance package strikes the right balance between targeted child care support for hard working families who depend upon it, a generous safety net to protect those most vulnerable in our community and ongoing support for high quality early learning. This is why the passage of the Child Care Bill, as well as the savings required to fund it, is amongst the Government's top priorities for 2017.


Since the Committee tabled its report, the Bill lapsed due to the prorogation of Parliament on 15 April 2016. The Bill was re-introduced to Parliament, with minor technical and corrective amendments, as the Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (Jobs for Families Child Care Package) Bill 2016 (the 2016 Child Care Bill) on 1 September 2016.


This Government response relates to the 2015 Child Care Bill, noting that some similar issues were raised, and responded to, through the Committee's Inquiry into the 2016 Child Care Bill and the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Family Payments Structural Reform and Participation Measures) Bill 2016.




Majority report



The Government welcomes and accepts the recommendation from the Majority Report that the Bill be passed, noting that this Bill has since been replaced by other legislation to give effect to the Package. The Government notes the Committee's view that the Package will target support to those who depend upon it in order to work or work more, as well as recognise the importance of access to high quality early childhood education and care for children.




Dissenting reports



The Government's response to each recommendation made in the Senate Committee's report is provided below, including those contained in the dissenting reports of Labor and the Australian Greens Senators respectively.


The Government has considered the views of the sector in developing this Bill, as well as the 2016 Bill, and will continue to consult with the sector and with the Senate cross-bench on the Package to ensure these reforms achieve the objectives of increasing affordability, flexibility and accessibility of the child care system for families.




Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (Jobs for Families Child Care Package) Bill 2015





Recommendation contained in the Committee
'
s Report



1. The committee recommends that the Senate pass the Bill.


The Government accepts the Committee's recommendation and urges Members of the House of Representatives and Senators to vote in favour of the Package in the Parliament to ensure the Government can deliver on its long term reform plan which delivers support to children and families, and a sustainable system for taxpayers and the sector.




Recommendations contained in Labor Senators
'
 Dissenting Report





Considering the evidence presented to the Committee, Labor Senators recommend the following amendments to the Bill:



1. Ensure that vulnerable children, or children at risk of abuse, not be worse off under the reforms;


The new Child Care Safety Net will assist disadvantaged communities and vulnerable and at‑risk children and their families by addressing barriers in accessing child care, while encouraging parents to enter or re-enter the workforce. In particular, the Additional Child Care Subsidy component of the Child Care Safety Net will provide targeted additional fee assistance to families and children facing barriers in accessing affordable child care, including:


children at risk of serious abuse or neglect


grandparents on income support who are the primary caregivers of their grandchildren


families experiencing temporary financial hardship


low income families transitioning to work from income support


families with an income below around $65,000 (in 2017 terms) where the family does not meet the activity test.


Prior to the introduction of the 2015 Child Care Bill, the Government announced at the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook 2015-16 the inclusion of Additional Child Care Subsidy (Grandparent). This was in response to sector feedback, to ensure grandparent primary carers on income support will have access to subsidised child care.


Since the time of the Committee's report, the Government has made further refinements to the Additional Child Care Subsidy to better support vulnerable children. For example, the name of the payment to support children at risk of serious abuse or neglect was changed from Additional Child Care Subsidy (At Risk) to Additional Child Care Subsidy (Child Wellbeing) in the 2016 Child Care Bill. This change was prompted by feedback from the sector that the original name could deter families from accessing this additional support. While the name has changed, the intent, design and application of the subsidy remains the same.


2. Ensure that families in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities not be worse off under the reforms by establishing an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community based program within the new Child Care Safety Net;


The current funding model for Budget Based Funded (BBF) services is not working in a fair or transparent way, with some services receiving less than $100 per child per year and other services receiving thousands of dollars per child per year. A major program review, an ANAO audit and several smaller projects highlighted a range of problems with the BBF Program, including:


the program objective is unclear


most BBF services operate outside the regulatory system and are excluded from the National Quality Framework so BBF services are not held to the same quality standards as approved services


the program is capped and fully committed meaning no new services can be funded in areas of need


there is no incentive for services to increase utilisation


in some cases families pay high fees but are not eligible for any fee subsidy


in some locations approved child care services have been established close to the BBF service so there may no longer be a real need for that service


funding for BBF services has remained stagnant while funding for mainstream child care has increased steadily for many years.


The Government notes that some stakeholders have called for a separate grant fund for services providing care for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children. To do this would create these same issues, whereby artificial limits would be set, and services would not be paid according to the numbers of children that attend.


The new funding arrangements through the Child Care Subsidy will be demand driven, encouraging new services to open or expand their service delivery where there is need. This will mean former BBF services can be funded equitably based on the number of children they support and the services they deliver.


The new system has been designed to support a diverse range of services that have the flexibility to adapt to the needs of local families. The current arrangements do not allow this flexibility and have effectively limited services that would have benefited from a fairer funding model, such as the one proposed as part of this legislation.


Additional funding will be provided to eligible services through the Community Child Care Fund which will provide grants to child care services to reduce barriers to accessing child care, provide sustainability support for child care services experiencing viability issues and provide capital support to increase the supply of child care places in areas of high unmet demand, particularly in disadvantaged, regional or remote communities.


Further, the Additional Child Care Subsidy will provide extra subsidies to families who are eligible under the child-wellbeing component, those experiencing temporary financial hardship, and people moving from income support into work.


The Department of Education and Training has engaged consultants to provide face-to-face support to BBF funding recipients in their transition to the new child care system or, where appropriate, to move to alternative funding arrangements. This support commenced in May 2016.


Support will be provided in two phases. Phase 1, which will largely be completed by February 2017, is the development of a comprehensive report and transition plan for each BBF funding recipient including mobile BBF services. The analysis undertaken in Phase 1 will inform the ongoing tailored support provided to BBF funding recipients through Phase 2. This face-to-face support is expected to begin in February 2017 and will continue as long as necessary, beyond July 2018 if required.


3. Ensure volunteering is treated similarly to paid work or study under the activity test;


A broad range of activities will meet activity test requirements, including paid work, being self-employed, unpaid work in a family business, looking for work, undertaking unpaid voluntary work or studying. There will also be exemptions to the activity test for parents who legitimately cannot meet the requirements.


Through the Regulation Impact Statement for the Package, the Department of Education and Training's submission to the Senate Inquiry and sector consultation on Minister's and Secretary's Rules, the Government has consistently made it clear that a broad definition of voluntary work will be adopted for the purposes of the activity test.


The proposed definition which was provided to the Senate Committee during the hearing and which was the subject of sector consultation is: an individual undertakes unpaid voluntary work to improve work skills or employment prospects, or for community engagement. To be recognised, voluntary work can be undertaken at a registered or recognised voluntary organisation or other charitable or community organisation, and this may include churches, sporting clubs or schools. Since that time, and in response to further consultation from the sector, the proposed definition of unpaid voluntary work has been expanded to include volunteering in a centre-based service undertaking activities that directly support children's learning and development. The proposed inclusion of this activity will assist in encouraging parental engagement and supports children's learning and development.


It is also proposed that individuals undertaking unpaid voluntary work would be entitled to 36 hours per fortnight (step 1 of the activity test) of subsidised child care. Voluntary work can be combined with other recognised activities to increase hours of subsidised child care.


4. Ensure provisions are made to ensure casual and seasonal workers are not disadvantaged by the activity test by including appropriate averaging and transitionary arrangements, and including a six week 'exceptional circumstances' exemption; and


To ensure families with casual or irregular work are not disadvantaged by the activity test and to ensure their children receive continuity of care, parents in this circumstance will be able to estimate their hours of activity over a three month period.


Current provisions in the Bill ensure continuity of care when parents experience a sudden change in circumstance that affects their entitlement without the need for a six week exemption period.


These provisions include:


The Additional Child Care Subsidy (Temporary Financial Hardship) that will provide short‑term increased child care fee assistance to families who are experiencing significant financial stress due to exceptional circumstances. Families experiencing temporary financial hardship will be eligible to receive a subsidy equal to the actual fee charged, up to 120 per cent of the Child Care Subsidy hourly fee cap, for up to 100 hours per fortnight, for a maximum of 13 weeks per event. Families will not be required to meet the activity test during this period.


Individuals' eligibility for this payment can be backdated up to 28 days (from the date of application), in recognition that family circumstances may change with little or no notice.


The capacity for the Secretary of the Department of Education and Training to make a case-by-case determination of an individual's activity test result based on exceptional circumstances, which could be more than 100 hours of subsidy per fortnight. Exceptional circumstances could include, but would not be limited to, families impacted by significant trauma, the short-term incapacity of the individual or a member of their family, or where the individual, their partner or their child is affected by domestic violence.


An activity test which recognises a broad range of activities (including actively looking for work and volunteering) to help families maintain access to subsidised care where their usual activity ceases unexpectedly.


5. The Government should provide modelling showing the longer term impact of the proposed benchmark price on the proportion of ECEC costs borne by parents and its impact on out of pocket costs. The Government should structure the child care subsidy more effectively to limit out of pocket costs for parents.


The new Child Care Subsidy has been designed to place downwards pressure on child care fees to improve affordability for families, through an hourly fee cap.



Fee assistance payments under the Child Care Subsidy are based on a percentage of the actual fees charged, up to the relevant percentage of an hourly fee cap, with the level of the cap varying based on the service type used. The hourly fee caps effectively set a 'benchmark price' from which Australian families have a reference point to hold providers accountable and from which they can expect prices should not dramatically exceed. This measure is necessary to ensure that the increased level of fee assistance offered by the Package does not accelerate fee increases, as we saw when the previous government increased the Child Care Rebate from 30 per cent of fees charged to 50 per cent of fees charged, with no constraints on the fees charged by centres. In addition, as part of simplifying the child care system and ensuring services can operate in a manner that best suits the families who use them, the Bill will reduce regulatory requirements currently applying to child care services, including the hours per day and days per week a service must open. This will mean that services and providers will be able to consider flexible options that better suit their children and families, as well as their business models, which will contribute to affordable and flexible child care options.




Further, Labor Senators recommend that the government:



6. Expand the Explanatory Memorandum to address key definitions (particularly with regard to abuse and neglect) pertaining to subsidies and payments;


The ability to define key terms (such as those related to ""abuse and neglect"" and ""risk"" for Additional Child Care Subsidy (at risk / child wellbeing)) in subordinate legislation was to allow for further consultation with the sector and other key stakeholders. Rather than pre-empt the outcome of ongoing consultation, the Government will table the Rules following the passage of legislation, in line with legislative process.


During 2016, the Department of Education and Training consulted the sector on all Minister's and Secretary's Rules which are proposed to be made at this time. The Government will continue to take sector feedback into consideration as the Rules are finalised. This is further elaborated in the Government's response to the more recent Senate Inquiry.


7. Extend the Ministerial Advisory Council on Child Care and Early Learning to include key stakeholders and peak bodies in the industry;


The Ministerial Advisory Council (MAC) on Child Care and Early Learning already consists of representatives of national peak bodies as well as experts in early childhood development and pedagogy, and the child care and early learning sector. MAC members' appointments were recently extended to the middle of 2017.


Given the diverse membership on MAC, as well as the range of other consultations with the sector (see Attachment A), the Government is confident it has received comprehensive feedback on all elements of the Package.


8. Review internationally recognised research on the returns on investment that public expenditure on early learning brings, ensure ECEC in Australia is in line with OECD best practice, and make sure levels of investment in early childhood are consistent with the best outcomes for children and the community; and


Australia performs well in its funding and delivery of early childhood education and care compared to other OECD countries, noting that the extent of public funding for early childhood education and care in Australia is not well represented in OECD data. This is because funding delivered to parents through fee subsidies is often reported as a 'private expense' in OECD data when in fact the Government provides generous subsidies that are targeted to families who need it most.


The Package reflects extensive consultation and expert analysis over several years and has been developed taking into account the significant evidence base developed by the Productivity Commission through its Inquiry into Childcare and Early Childhood Learning, including consideration of workforce participation, early childhood educational outcomes and relevant international models. This is why the objective of the Government's significant investment in the Package is to provide parents with more choice and opportunity to work, and children with high quality early education.


In addition, to understand the impact of the Package over time, there will be ongoing monitoring and evaluation of the changes to the child care system. The Government's framework for evaluation of the Child Care Package includes a post‑implementation review to commence in 2018-19 and a subsequent impact evaluation. The evaluation will build on the previously undertaken activities of monitoring, data collection, baseline data and the post implementation review to assess the effect of the changes on the community.


9. Immediately release to the public all data, research and evidence used in developing the legislation—including complete details of the impact the changes will have on families - so that the Senate can make a more informed assessment of its impact on all Australian families.


The Government has provided significant detail on the modelling and assumptions used to develop the Package and details of the impact the changes will have on families. This includes an impact analysis of the Package at Chapter 5 of the Regulatory Impact Statement. Section 5.3, in particular, analyses the impact on families, child care service providers, communities and governments, and an assessment of the Package's effectiveness at achieving the objectives of the reform. A summary of that information, as it relates to families, is provided in the submission to the inquiry made by the Department of Education and Training at paragraphs 137 to 142.




Recommendations contained in the Dissenting Report by the Australian Greens



1. The Australian Greens recommend that the activity test be amended to include an additional amount of base level subsidised childcare for all families that fall within the 0-8 hours of activity, so that all children have access to a minimum of 24 hours of subsidised child care per week.


The entry point to the activity test is set at a very low base - at least 8 hours of activity a fortnight results in access to up to 36 hours of subsidised child care a fortnight; more than 16 hours of activity a fortnight results in access to up to 72 hours of subsidised care a fortnight; and that more than 48 hours of activity a fortnight results in access to up to 100 hours of subsidised care a fortnight.


A broad range of activities will meet the activity test requirements, including paid work, looking for work, volunteering or study. People on paid and unpaid parental leave who are returning to work would also meet the activity test. To ensure families with casual or irregular work are not disadvantaged by the activity test and to ensure their children receive continuity of care, parents in this circumstance will be able to estimate their hours of activity over a three month period.


We know children from disadvantaged backgrounds benefit most from quality early childhood education and care, and that's why we're providing additional support to those who need it most. Families with incomes below around $65,000 (in 2017 terms) who do not meet the activity test will be able to access up to 24 hours per fortnight of subsidised care —equivalent to two weekly six-hour sessions—at the highest 85 per cent rate of subsidy (this is an increase on the current 72 per cent). The removal of minimum hours per day and days per week opening requirements will allow service providers' to deliver these hours over two sessions per week.


The Government is also considering the sector's proposal to increase the number of subsidised hours for families with low incomes (below around $65,000 in 2017 terms) who do not meet the activity test from 24 to 30 hours per fortnight as part of its negotiations and deliberations in preparation for Parliamentary debate.


2. The Australian Greens recommend that an adequately flexible reporting grace period be adopted that allows all casual workers, part-time workers with irregular hours or people who lose their jobs to estimate their expected activity and childcare needs, so as not to be disadvantaged by the activity test.


Refer to the response provided to Labor Senator's Dissenting Report, Recommendation 4, above.


3. The Australian Greens recommend that further detailed clarification be provided as to how the Additional Child Care Subsidy will meet the needs of vulnerable children, in particular children in remote and regional Australia, and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children.


The new Child Care Safety Net will assist disadvantaged communities and vulnerable and at‑risk children, including children in remote and regional Australia and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children, and their families to address barriers in accessing child care, while encouraging parents to enter or re-enter the workforce. In particular, the Additional Child Care Subsidy component of the Child Care Safety Net will provide targeted additional fee assistance to families and children facing barriers in accessing affordable child care, including:


children at risk of serious abuse or neglect


grandparents on income support who are the primary caregivers of their grandchildren


families experiencing temporary financial hardship


low income families transitioning to work from income support


families with an income below around $65,000 (in 2017 terms) where the family does not meet the activity test.


Since the time of the Committee's report, the Department of Education and Training has undertaken consultation with the sector on the proposed detail of all Additional Child Care Subsidy payments, and will continue to engage with the sector as policy settings for these payments are finalised.


For further detail on specific support available to services currently funded through the Budget Based Funded program, please refer to the response provided to Labor Senator's Dissenting Report, Recommendation 2, above.


4. The Australian Greens recommend an amendment to include mechanisms for increasing childcare places where vacancy rates are critically low, creating barriers to parents being able to find affordable care.


The Government does not intervene directly in the child care market. Elements of the Package are aimed at encouraging services to be more flexible in how they provide care and child care places to both encourage more providers and to free up potential places in current services.

Inquiry into the Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (Jobs for Families Child Care Package) Bill 2016 [Provisions] and Social Services Legislation Amendment (Family Payments Structural Reform and Participation Measures) Bill 2016 [Provisions]



February 2017




Introduction



The Australian Government welcomes the report by the Senate Education and Employment Legislation Committee in relation to the inquiry into the Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (Jobs for Families Child Care Package) Bill 2016 (the Child Care Bill) and Social Services Legislation Amendment (Family Payments Structural Reform and Participation Measures) Bill 2016 (the Social Services Bill).


The Jobs for Families Child Care Package (the Package) will provide genuine and necessary reform for a simpler, more affordable, accessible and flexible child care system. The Government's child care assistance package strikes the right balance between targeted child care support for hard working families who depend upon it, a generous safety net to protect those most vulnerable in our community and ongoing support for high quality early learning. This is why the passage of the Child Care Bill, as well as the savings required to fund it, is amongst the Government's top priorities for 2017.


The Government thanks those individuals and organisations who contributed to this inquiry, and previous inquiries into these Bills, by preparing written submissions or appearing at the public hearings.




Majority report



The Government welcomes and accepts the recommendation from the Majority Report that these Bills be passed. The Government notes the Committee's view that reforms to the child care system contained within the Child Care Bill will achieve quality early childhood education and care as well as provide increased opportunities for workforce participation.


The Government also notes the Committee's view that the measures contained within the Social Services Bill will provide greater assistance on a fortnightly basis to lower income families who need it, and will create a more accessible and flexible child care system for Australian families.




Dissenting reports and additional comments



The Government's response to each recommendation made in the Senate Committee's report, including those contained in the dissenting reports of Labor and the Australian Greens Senators respectively, and the additional comments by Senator Skye Kakoschke-Moore from the Nick Xenophon Team, is provided below. There will be further opportunity to address concerns raised in dissenting reports and comments throughout the Parliamentary debate.


The Government does not accept the recommendations from Labor and the Australian Greens Senators that the Social Services Bill not be passed. The Government considers that redirecting funding from Family Tax Benefits into greater investment into childcare is a better way to spend public money. This redirection of funding will strengthen the incentives and support required to further increase workforce participation and, based on evidence and research, assist in increasing the living standards of low and middle income families. The Government notes that no other viable proposals to fully fund the Package were put forward during the inquiry and remains of the view that funding offsets are necessary in order to ensure a sustainable child care system into the future. The reforms in the Social Services Bill, in conjunction with those in the Child Care Bill, represent a fair and fiscally responsible way to deliver a simpler and more accessible, flexible and affordable child care system.


The Government acknowledges the range of feedback that has been received in relation to the development of the Child Care Bill over the period of its development, including through the Productivity Commission Inquiry, Regulation Impact Statement consultation process, two Senate Inquiry processes and ongoing consultation with the sector by the Department of Education and Training, as detailed in Attachment A.


The Government has considered the views of the sector in developing the Child Care Bill and will continue to consult with the sector and with the Senate cross-bench on the Package to ensure these reforms achieve the objectives of increasing affordability, flexibility and accessibility of the child care system for families.

Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (Jobs for Families Child Care Package) Bill 2016





Recommendation contained in the Committee
'
s Report



1. The committee recommends that both bills be passed.


The Government accepts the Committee's recommendation and urges Members of the House of Representatives and Senators to support legislation to ensure the Government can support families most in need through a sustainable system that will deliver quality learning experiences for Australian children.




Recommendations contained in Labor Senators
'
 Dissenting Report



1. Key ministerial determinations and rules—which will set many of the parameters affecting the day to day use of the system by families—should be published before the Parliament considers the Bill. This includes those relating to children at risk, financial hardship and the activity test.


In line with legislative process, the Minister's and Secretary's Rules that sit under the Jobs for Families legislation will be tabled following its passage.


In developing the underlying policy for the Minister's and Secretary's Rules, the Department of Education and Training has consulted extensively with, and taken advice from, the sector, as detailed in Attachment A. This has included targeted consultation on the policy parameters of the Additional Child Care Subsidy (Child Wellbeing) payment and the activity test.


A number of changes have already been incorporated in proposed Rules as a result of feedback from the sector. As the Department of Education and Training is still refining draft Rules, and will continue to seek feedback, it is not possible to publish a final set of Rules at this time, noting that Rules can only be made by the Minister or Secretary once the primary legislation has been passed by the Parliament.



The Department of Education and Training will continue to engage with the sector as these Rules are developed and will ensure that there is adequate opportunity for review and further feedback.


2. The transition process for Budget Based Funded Indigenous and Mobile services should be stopped and direct ongoing support should be guaranteed.


The Government is committed to ensuring these valuable community services continue to operate beyond the introduction of the Package. Senator the Hon Simon Birmingham, Minister for Education and Training, wrote to all BBF services in December 2016, expressing this commitment and clarifying the transition process (Attachment B).


The current funding model for Budget Based Funded (BBF) services is not working in a fair or transparent way, with some services receiving less than $100 per child per year and other services receiving thousands of dollars per child per year. A major program review, an ANAO audit and several smaller projects highlighted a range of problems with the BBF Program, including:


the program objective is unclear


most BBF services operate outside the regulatory system and are excluded from the National Quality Framework so BBF services are not held to the same quality standards as approved services


the program is capped and fully committed meaning no new services can be funded in areas of need


there is no incentive for services to increase utilisation


in some cases families pay high fees but are not eligible for any fee subsidy


in some locations approved child care services have been established close to the BBF service so there may no longer be a real need for that service


funding for BBF services has remained stagnant while funding for mainstream child care has increased steadily for many years.


The Government notes that some stakeholders have called for a separate grant fund for services providing care for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children. To do this would create these same issues, whereby artificial limits would be set, and services would not be paid according to the numbers of children that attend.


The new funding arrangements through the Child Care Subsidy will be demand driven, encouraging new services to open or expand their service delivery where there is need. This will mean former BBF services can be funded equitably based on the number of children they support and the services they deliver.


The new system has been designed to support a diverse range of services that have the flexibility to adapt to the needs of local families. The current arrangements do not allow this flexibility and have effectively limited services that would have benefited from a fairer funding model, such as the one proposed as part of this legislation.


Additional funding will be provided to eligible services through the Community Child Care Fund which will provide grants to child care services to reduce barriers to accessing child care, provide sustainability support for child care services experiencing viability issues and provide capital support to increase the supply of child care places in areas of high unmet demand, particularly in disadvantaged, regional or remote communities.


Further, the Additional Child Care Subsidy will provide extra subsidies to families who are eligible under the child-wellbeing component, those experiencing temporary financial hardship, and people moving from income support into work.


The Department of Education and Training has engaged consultants to provide face-to-face support to BBF funding recipients in their transition to the new child care system or, where appropriate, to move to alternative funding arrangements. This support commenced in May 2016.


Support will be provided in two phases. Phase 1, which will largely be completed by February 2017, is the development of a comprehensive report and transition plan for each BBF funding recipient including mobile BBF services. The analysis undertaken in Phase 1 will inform the ongoing tailored support provided to BBF funding recipients through Phase 2. This face-to-face support is expected to begin in February 2017 and will continue as long as necessary, beyond July 2018 if required.


3. The Government should consider amendments to their child care changes to:


 Ensure vulnerable and disadvantaged children are provided with adequate access to early education and care;


 Ensure the activity test—and associated determinations and rules—don't introduce unnecessary barriers for parents trying to get back into the workforce;


 Continue providing children with access to two days early education a week, and trial any changes to the activity test before their introduction; and


 Provide an immediate increase in assistance for families; in recognition of the cost pressures families will face because of the Government's decision to delay additional assistance until mid-2018.


The new Child Care Safety Net will assist disadvantaged communities and vulnerable and at-risk children and their families by addressing barriers in accessing child care, while encouraging parents to enter or re-enter the workforce. In particular, the Additional Child Care Subsidy component of the Child Care Safety Net will provide targeted additional fee assistance to families and children facing barriers in accessing affordable child care, including:


children at risk of serious abuse or neglect


grandparents on income support who are the primary caregivers of their grandchildren


families experiencing temporary financial hardship


low income families transitioning to work from income support


families with an income below around $65,000 (in 2017 terms) where the family does not meet the activity test.


The activity test will ensure Government support is better targeted to those who depend on child care to work, train, study, or participate in other recognised activities. It is estimated that the Package will encourage more than 230,000 families to increase their involvement in paid employment.


Under the Package, the more hours a parent works, studies, or trains (including in combination with other activities such as volunteering and looking for work) the more hours of subsidised child care they can access. In addition, the new Child Care Subsidy will be paid directly to child care service providers to make the system simpler for families.


A broad range of activities will meet the activity test requirements, including paid work, looking for work, volunteering or study. People on paid and unpaid parental leave who are returning to work would also meet the activity test. To ensure families with casual or irregular work are not disadvantaged by the activity test and to ensure their children receive continuity of care, parents in this circumstance will be able to estimate their hours of activity over a three month period.


The entry point to the activity test is set at a very low base - at least 8 hours of activity a fortnight results in access to up to 36 hours of subsidised child care a fortnight; more than 16 hours of activity a fortnight results in access to up to 72 hours of subsidised care a fortnight; and that more than 48 hours of activity a fortnight results in access to up to 100 hours of subsidised care a fortnight.


We know children from disadvantaged backgrounds benefit most from quality early childhood education and care, and that's why we're providing additional support to those who need it most. Families with incomes below around $65,000 (in 2017 terms) who do not meet the activity test will be able to access 24 hours per fortnight of subsidised care —equivalent to two weekly six-hour sessions—at the highest 85 per cent rate of subsidy (this is an increase on the current 72 per cent). The removal of minimum hours per day and days per week opening requirements will allow service providers' to deliver these hours over two sessions per week.


The Government is also considering the sector's proposal to increase the number of subsidised hours for families with low incomes (below around $65,000 in 2017 terms) who do not meet the activity test from 24 to 30 hours per fortnight as part of its negotiations and deliberations in preparation for Parliamentary debate. Noting that this and any other changes requiring additional expenditure would need to be offset.


As the Child Care Subsidy and Additional Child Care Subsidy will be legislated payments, it would be difficult to trial the new activity test prior to the legislated start date. This is why the Department of Education and Training is consulting on key policy concepts in the Bill that will be set out in Minister's Rules, such as Activity Test definitions and implementation details. This will ensure that key elements of the package are well tested amongst the sector before their final implementation.


To improve affordability for families in the short term, on 1 July 2017 the existing Child Care Rebate will be indexed by the Consumer Price Index for the first time since Labor froze the cap in 2011.



The Government will continue to consult with the sector on the detail of the Package over the coming months to ensure these reforms achieve the objectives of increasing affordability, flexibility and accessibility of the child care system for families.


4. Funding for early education should not be conditional on Family Tax Benefit cuts which will hurt low and middle income families.


As a result of the increased Australian Government investment into child care, the Package is to be implemented using savings contained in the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Family Payments Structural Reform and Participation Measures) Bill 2016.


The Government notes that no other viable proposals to fully fund the Package were put forward during the inquiry and remains of the view that funding offsets are necessary in order to ensure a sustainable child care system into the future. The reforms in the Social Services Bill, in conjunction with those in the Child Care Bill, represent a fair and fiscally responsible way to deliver a simpler and more accessible, flexible and affordable child care system.




Recommendations contained in the Dissenting Report by the Australian Greens



1. The Australian Greens recommend that the activity test be amended to include an additional amount of base level subsidised childcare for all families that fall within the 0-8 hours of activity to a minimum of two full days care.


The entry point to the activity test is set at a very low base - at least 8 hours of activity a fortnight results in access to up to 36 hours of subsidised child care a fortnight; more than 16 hours of activity a fortnight results in access to up to 72 hours of subsidised care a fortnight; and that more than 48 hours of activity a fortnight results in the maximum amount of subsidised care of 100 hours a fortnight.


A broad range of activities will meet the activity test requirements, including paid work, looking for work, volunteering or study. People on paid and unpaid parental leave who are returning to work would also meet the activity test. To ensure families with casual or irregular work are not disadvantaged by the activity test and to ensure their children receive continuity of care, parents in this circumstance will be able to estimate their hours of activity over a three month period.


Families with incomes below around $65,000 (in 2017 terms) who do not meet the activity test will be able to access 24 hours per fortnight of subsidised care —equivalent to two weekly six-hour sessions—at the highest 85 per cent rate of subsidy (this is an increase on the current 72 per cent). The removal of minimum hours per day and days per week opening requirements will allow service providers' to deliver these hours over two sessions per week.


The Government is also considering the sector's proposal to increase the number of hours in the safety net from 24 to 30 hours per fortnight as part of its negotiations and deliberations in preparation for Parliamentary debate. Noting that this and any other changes requiring additional expenditure would need to be offset.


2. The Australian Greens recommend that an adequately flexible reporting grace period be adopted that allows all casual workers, part-time workers with irregular hours or people who lose their jobs to estimate their expected activity and childcare needs, so as not to be disadvantaged by the activity test.




Workers with casual or irregular hours:



To ensure families with casual or irregular work are not disadvantaged by the activity test and to ensure their children receive continuity of care, parents in these circumstances will be able to estimate their hours of activity over a three month period. This will be captured in a Minister's rule, the content of which has been the subject of consultation with the sector.




Individuals who experience sudden change of circumstances:



Current provisions in the Bill already ensure continuity of care when parents experience a sudden change in circumstance that affects their entitlement.


These provisions include:


The Additional Child Care Subsidy (Temporary Financial Hardship) that will provide short‑term increased child care fee assistance to families who are experiencing significant financial stress due to exceptional circumstances. Families experiencing temporary financial hardship will be eligible to receive a subsidy equal to the actual fee charged, up to 120 per cent of the Child Care Subsidy hourly fee cap, for up to 100 hours per fortnight, for a maximum of 13 weeks per event). Families will not be required to meet the activity test during this period.


Individuals' eligibility for this payment can be backdated up to 28 days (from the date of application), in recognition that family circumstances may change with little or no notice.


The capacity for the Secretary of the Department of Education and Training to make a case-by-case determination of an individual's activity test result based on exceptional circumstances, which could be more than 100 hours of subsidy per fortnight. Exceptional circumstances could include, but would not be limited to, families impacted by significant trauma, the short-term incapacity of the individual or a member of their family, or where the individual, their partner or their child is affected by domestic violence.


An activity test which recognises the combined total of a broad range of activities (including actively looking for work and volunteering) to help them maintain access to subsidised care where their usual activity ceases unexpectedly.


3. The Australian Greens recommend that unless additional funding for services which meets the needs of vulnerable children in remote and regional Australia and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children is provided, that the current Budget Based Funding levels remain in place.


Refer to the response provided to Labor Senator's Dissenting Report, Recommendation 2, above.


4. The Australian Greens recommend an amendment to include mechanisms for increasing childcare places where vacancy rates are critically low, creating barriers to parents being able to find affordable care.



The Government does not intervene directly in the child care market. Elements of the Package are aimed at encouraging services to be more flexible in how they provide care and child care places to both encourage more providers and to free up potential places in current services. For example, the Government is removing the requirement on the number of hours per day and days per week that an approved service must be open, in order to free services up to respond to the particular needs of their community.


5. The Australian Greens recommend that providers of In Home Care be explicitly referenced in the Bill as being eligible for Child Care Subsidy payments.


In Home Care (IHC) is an important part of the child care and early education landscape and will continue beyond the introduction of the Package in July 2018.


The future policy design for approved child care delivered in the family's home will be informed by the current evaluation of the Nanny Pilot Programme, and the review of IHC. The Institute of Social Science Research at the University of Queensland is currently undertaking the evaluation to inform future policy, which will be designed to cater to a range of different needs, including parents who cannot work for reasons such as disability or illness, parents who live in rural or remote areas away from suitable child care options and parents who are looking to either meet or increase their workforce commitments and cannot access other child care because they work non-standard hours.


It has been over 10 years since there has been a review of IHC and the current review, which will be completed this year, seeks to collect more up-to-date information about the IHC program to inform development of the new policy.


The Child Care Bill contains a rule making provision to prescribe a new service type and a relevant Child Care Subsidy hourly rate cap. Provision will be made for continued Australian Government support for care in the family's home under the Package, based on the findings of the University of Queensland evaluation and the IHC review.



Recommendations contained in the Additional Comments by the Nick Xenophon Team



1. The Department of Education clarify as a matter of urgency whether funding for in-home care will continue to be made available under the Jobs for Families package.


Refer to the response provided to the Dissenting Report by the Australian Greens, Recommendation 5, above.


2. The Department of Education review their consultation procedures to ensure that all appropriate stakeholder groups are comprehensively consulted when reform packages are being developed.


The development and refinement of the Package has been the subject of significant and comprehensive consultation over several years, as outlined in Attachment A.


The Department of Education and Training is committed to ongoing consultation and will continue to engage with the sector on policy settings for the Minister's and Secretary's Rules to be made under the Child Care Bill.


3. The Department of Education and Training make public information in relation to the tenders.


All details relating to contracts executed with the department are publicly available on AusTender which is the Australian Government's procurement information system. The three contract numbers relating to the tender to support Budget Based Funded services to transition to the new child care system are:


1. PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) - CN3341068-A2


2. PricewaterhouseCoopers Indigenous Consulting (PIC) - CN3341067


3. Community Child Care Co-operative NSW (CCCC) - CN3341077


Contract number 3341077 with the CCCC was mutually terminated on 31 August 2016 and has been incorporated into contract CN3341068-A2.


The contract was mutually terminated as the CCCC did not have a detailed understanding of key elements of the Package which resulted in contractual obligations not being met, specifically in regards to the support for BBF services to transition to the new child care system or alternative funding arrangements.


4. The Department further consults with stakeholders regarding the suitability of the 15 hours proposal and the impact on business models of ECEC providers.


The Department of Education and Training notes that a number of stakeholders in the early childhood education and care sector have worked together to propose increasing the low income provision (for families with annual income under the low income threshold and who not meet the activity test) from the 24 hours of subsidised care per fortnight (12 hours per week) contained in the Child Care Bill, to 30 hours per fortnight (15 hours per week).


The Government is also considering this proposal as part of its negotiations and deliberations in preparation for Parliamentary debate of the Bills.


The Bill removes regulatory requirements that currently apply to child care services, including the hours per day and days per week a service must open. This will allow providers and services to be able to consider flexible options that may better suit their children and families, as well as their business.


5. The Department conduct modelling on the impact 15 hours of subsidised ECEC would have on childcare workers' workforce participation.


The Government is considering the sector's proposal to increase the number of subsidised hours of care to low income families who do not meet the activity test from 12 to 15 hours per week and notes evidence given by Mr John Cherry, Advocacy Manager, Goodstart Early Learning to the Committee on this matter, as follows:



""I can speak on behalf of the country's largest provider. We certainly believe that the key to actually going from 12 to 15 is that it forces you to offer two sessions, two days, because 12 hours in the long day care environment is closest to one day but certainly when you move to 15 then you have to offer that over two days. As the largest childcare provider we would say that we would be certainly looking at offering sessions over two days that would meet that 15-hour entitlement.""1


The removal of minimum hours per day and days per week operating requirements will enable services to consider flexible options that may better suit children and families, as well as their business.


The Department of Education and Training is unable to model the workforce participation of child care workers, including in relation to this proposal, because child care service providers are responsible for making their own business decisions in relation to operational matters including staffing.

Australian Government response to the Senate Education and Employment Legislation Committee report:





Inquiry into the Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (Jobs for Families Child Care Package) Bill 2015 [Provisions]





February 2017





Introduction



The Australian Government welcomes the report by the Senate Education and Employment Legislation Committee in relation to the inquiry into the Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (Jobs for Families Child Care Package) Bill 2015 (the 2015 Child Care Bill) and thanks those individuals and organisations who contributed to this inquiry by preparing written submissions or appearing at the public hearings.


The Jobs for Families Child Care Package (the Package) will provide genuine and necessary reform for a simpler, more affordable, accessible and flexible child care system. The Government's child care assistance package strikes the right balance between targeted child care support for hard working families who depend upon it, a generous safety net to protect those most vulnerable in our community and ongoing support for high quality early learning. This is why the passage of the Child Care Bill, as well as the savings required to fund it, is amongst the Government's top priorities for 2017.


Since the Committee tabled its report, the Bill lapsed due to the prorogation of Parliament on 15 April 2016. The Bill was re-introduced to Parliament, with minor technical and corrective amendments, as the Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (Jobs for Families Child Care Package) Bill 2016 (the 2016 Child Care Bill) on 1 September 2016.


This Government response relates to the 2015 Child Care Bill, noting that some similar issues were raised, and responded to, through the Committee's Inquiry into the 2016 Child Care Bill and the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Family Payments Structural Reform and Participation Measures) Bill 2016.




Majority report



The Government welcomes and accepts the recommendation from the Majority Report that the Bill be passed, noting that this Bill has since been replaced by other legislation to give effect to the Package. The Government notes the Committee's view that the Package will target support to those who depend upon it in order to work or work more, as well as recognise the importance of access to high quality early childhood education and care for children.




Dissenting reports



The Government's response to each recommendation made in the Senate Committee's report is provided below, including those contained in the dissenting reports of Labor and the Australian Greens Senators respectively.


The Government has considered the views of the sector in developing this Bill, as well as the 2016 Bill, and will continue to consult with the sector and with the Senate cross-bench on the Package to ensure these reforms achieve the objectives of increasing affordability, flexibility and accessibility of the child care system for families.




Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (Jobs for Families Child Care Package) Bill 2015





Recommendation contained in the Committee
'
s Report



1. The committee recommends that the Senate pass the Bill.


The Government accepts the Committee's recommendation and urges Members of the House of Representatives and Senators to vote in favour of the Package in the Parliament to ensure the Government can deliver on its long term reform plan which delivers support to children and families, and a sustainable system for taxpayers and the sector.




Recommendations contained in Labor Senators
'
 Dissenting Report





Considering the evidence presented to the Committee, Labor Senators recommend the following amendments to the Bill:



1. Ensure that vulnerable children, or children at risk of abuse, not be worse off under the reforms;


The new Child Care Safety Net will assist disadvantaged communities and vulnerable and at‑risk children and their families by addressing barriers in accessing child care, while encouraging parents to enter or re-enter the workforce. In particular, the Additional Child Care Subsidy component of the Child Care Safety Net will provide targeted additional fee assistance to families and children facing barriers in accessing affordable child care, including:


children at risk of serious abuse or neglect


grandparents on income support who are the primary caregivers of their grandchildren


families experiencing temporary financial hardship


low income families transitioning to work from income support


families with an income below around $65,000 (in 2017 terms) where the family does not meet the activity test.


Prior to the introduction of the 2015 Child Care Bill, the Government announced at the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook 2015-16 the inclusion of Additional Child Care Subsidy (Grandparent). This was in response to sector feedback, to ensure grandparent primary carers on income support will have access to subsidised child care.


Since the time of the Committee's report, the Government has made further refinements to the Additional Child Care Subsidy to better support vulnerable children. For example, the name of the payment to support children at risk of serious abuse or neglect was changed from Additional Child Care Subsidy (At Risk) to Additional Child Care Subsidy (Child Wellbeing) in the 2016 Child Care Bill. This change was prompted by feedback from the sector that the original name could deter families from accessing this additional support. While the name has changed, the intent, design and application of the subsidy remains the same.


2. Ensure that families in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities not be worse off under the reforms by establishing an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community based program within the new Child Care Safety Net;


The current funding model for Budget Based Funded (BBF) services is not working in a fair or transparent way, with some services receiving less than $100 per child per year and other services receiving thousands of dollars per child per year. A major program review, an ANAO audit and several smaller projects highlighted a range of problems with the BBF Program, including:


the program objective is unclear


most BBF services operate outside the regulatory system and are excluded from the National Quality Framework so BBF services are not held to the same quality standards as approved services


the program is capped and fully committed meaning no new services can be funded in areas of need


there is no incentive for services to increase utilisation


in some cases families pay high fees but are not eligible for any fee subsidy


in some locations approved child care services have been established close to the BBF service so there may no longer be a real need for that service


funding for BBF services has remained stagnant while funding for mainstream child care has increased steadily for many years.


The Government notes that some stakeholders have called for a separate grant fund for services providing care for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children. To do this would create these same issues, whereby artificial limits would be set, and services would not be paid according to the numbers of children that attend.


The new funding arrangements through the Child Care Subsidy will be demand driven, encouraging new services to open or expand their service delivery where there is need. This will mean former BBF services can be funded equitably based on the number of children they support and the services they deliver.


The new system has been designed to support a diverse range of services that have the flexibility to adapt to the needs of local families. The current arrangements do not allow this flexibility and have effectively limited services that would have benefited from a fairer funding model, such as the one proposed as part of this legislation.


Additional funding will be provided to eligible services through the Community Child Care Fund which will provide grants to child care services to reduce barriers to accessing child care, provide sustainability support for child care services experiencing viability issues and provide capital support to increase the supply of child care places in areas of high unmet demand, particularly in disadvantaged, regional or remote communities.


Further, the Additional Child Care Subsidy will provide extra subsidies to families who are eligible under the child-wellbeing component, those experiencing temporary financial hardship, and people moving from income support into work.


The Department of Education and Training has engaged consultants to provide face-to-face support to BBF funding recipients in their transition to the new child care system or, where appropriate, to move to alternative funding arrangements. This support commenced in May 2016.


Support will be provided in two phases. Phase 1, which will largely be completed by February 2017, is the development of a comprehensive report and transition plan for each BBF funding recipient including mobile BBF services. The analysis undertaken in Phase 1 will inform the ongoing tailored support provided to BBF funding recipients through Phase 2. This face-to-face support is expected to begin in February 2017 and will continue as long as necessary, beyond July 2018 if required.


3. Ensure volunteering is treated similarly to paid work or study under the activity test;


A broad range of activities will meet activity test requirements, including paid work, being self-employed, unpaid work in a family business, looking for work, undertaking unpaid voluntary work or studying. There will also be exemptions to the activity test for parents who legitimately cannot meet the requirements.


Through the Regulation Impact Statement for the Package, the Department of Education and Training's submission to the Senate Inquiry and sector consultation on Minister's and Secretary's Rules, the Government has consistently made it clear that a broad definition of voluntary work will be adopted for the purposes of the activity test.


The proposed definition which was provided to the Senate Committee during the hearing and which was the subject of sector consultation is: an individual undertakes unpaid voluntary work to improve work skills or employment prospects, or for community engagement. To be recognised, voluntary work can be undertaken at a registered or recognised voluntary organisation or other charitable or community organisation, and this may include churches, sporting clubs or schools. Since that time, and in response to further consultation from the sector, the proposed definition of unpaid voluntary work has been expanded to include volunteering in a centre-based service undertaking activities that directly support children's learning and development. The proposed inclusion of this activity will assist in encouraging parental engagement and supports children's learning and development.


It is also proposed that individuals undertaking unpaid voluntary work would be entitled to 36 hours per fortnight (step 1 of the activity test) of subsidised child care. Voluntary work can be combined with other recognised activities to increase hours of subsidised child care.


4. Ensure provisions are made to ensure casual and seasonal workers are not disadvantaged by the activity test by including appropriate averaging and transitionary arrangements, and including a six week 'exceptional circumstances' exemption; and


To ensure families with casual or irregular work are not disadvantaged by the activity test and to ensure their children receive continuity of care, parents in this circumstance will be able to estimate their hours of activity over a three month period.


Current provisions in the Bill ensure continuity of care when parents experience a sudden change in circumstance that affects their entitlement without the need for a six week exemption period.


These provisions include:


The Additional Child Care Subsidy (Temporary Financial Hardship) that will provide short‑term increased child care fee assistance to families who are experiencing significant financial stress due to exceptional circumstances. Families experiencing temporary financial hardship will be eligible to receive a subsidy equal to the actual fee charged, up to 120 per cent of the Child Care Subsidy hourly fee cap, for up to 100 hours per fortnight, for a maximum of 13 weeks per event. Families will not be required to meet the activity test during this period.


Individuals' eligibility for this payment can be backdated up to 28 days (from the date of application), in recognition that family circumstances may change with little or no notice.


The capacity for the Secretary of the Department of Education and Training to make a case-by-case determination of an individual's activity test result based on exceptional circumstances, which could be more than 100 hours of subsidy per fortnight. Exceptional circumstances could include, but would not be limited to, families impacted by significant trauma, the short-term incapacity of the individual or a member of their family, or where the individual, their partner or their child is affected by domestic violence.


An activity test which recognises a broad range of activities (including actively looking for work and volunteering) to help families maintain access to subsidised care where their usual activity ceases unexpectedly.


5. The Government should provide modelling showing the longer term impact of the proposed benchmark price on the proportion of ECEC costs borne by parents and its impact on out of pocket costs. The Government should structure the child care subsidy more effectively to limit out of pocket costs for parents.


The new Child Care Subsidy has been designed to place downwards pressure on child care fees to improve affordability for families, through an hourly fee cap.



Fee assistance payments under the Child Care Subsidy are based on a percentage of the actual fees charged, up to the relevant percentage of an hourly fee cap, with the level of the cap varying based on the service type used. The hourly fee caps effectively set a 'benchmark price' from which Australian families have a reference point to hold providers accountable and from which they can expect prices should not dramatically exceed. This measure is necessary to ensure that the increased level of fee assistance offered by the Package does not accelerate fee increases, as we saw when the previous government increased the Child Care Rebate from 30 per cent of fees charged to 50 per cent of fees charged, with no constraints on the fees charged by centres. In addition, as part of simplifying the child care system and ensuring services can operate in a manner that best suits the families who use them, the Bill will reduce regulatory requirements currently applying to child care services, including the hours per day and days per week a service must open. This will mean that services and providers will be able to consider flexible options that better suit their children and families, as well as their business models, which will contribute to affordable and flexible child care options.




Further, Labor Senators recommend that the government:



6. Expand the Explanatory Memorandum to address key definitions (particularly with regard to abuse and neglect) pertaining to subsidies and payments;


The ability to define key terms (such as those related to ""abuse and neglect"" and ""risk"" for Additional Child Care Subsidy (at risk / child wellbeing)) in subordinate legislation was to allow for further consultation with the sector and other key stakeholders. Rather than pre-empt the outcome of ongoing consultation, the Government will table the Rules following the passage of legislation, in line with legislative process.


During 2016, the Department of Education and Training consulted the sector on all Minister's and Secretary's Rules which are proposed to be made at this time. The Government will continue to take sector feedback into consideration as the Rules are finalised. This is further elaborated in the Government's response to the more recent Senate Inquiry.


7. Extend the Ministerial Advisory Council on Child Care and Early Learning to include key stakeholders and peak bodies in the industry;


The Ministerial Advisory Council (MAC) on Child Care and Early Learning already consists of representatives of national peak bodies as well as experts in early childhood development and pedagogy, and the child care and early learning sector. MAC members' appointments were recently extended to the middle of 2017.


Given the diverse membership on MAC, as well as the range of other consultations with the sector (see Attachment A), the Government is confident it has received comprehensive feedback on all elements of the Package.


8. Review internationally recognised research on the returns on investment that public expenditure on early learning brings, ensure ECEC in Australia is in line with OECD best practice, and make sure levels of investment in early childhood are consistent with the best outcomes for children and the community; and


Australia performs well in its funding and delivery of early childhood education and care compared to other OECD countries, noting that the extent of public funding for early childhood education and care in Australia is not well represented in OECD data. This is because funding delivered to parents through fee subsidies is often reported as a 'private expense' in OECD data when in fact the Government provides generous subsidies that are targeted to families who need it most.


The Package reflects extensive consultation and expert analysis over several years and has been developed taking into account the significant evidence base developed by the Productivity Commission through its Inquiry into Childcare and Early Childhood Learning, including consideration of workforce participation, early childhood educational outcomes and relevant international models. This is why the objective of the Government's significant investment in the Package is to provide parents with more choice and opportunity to work, and children with high quality early education.


In addition, to understand the impact of the Package over time, there will be ongoing monitoring and evaluation of the changes to the child care system. The Government's framework for evaluation of the Child Care Package includes a post‑implementation review to commence in 2018-19 and a subsequent impact evaluation. The evaluation will build on the previously undertaken activities of monitoring, data collection, baseline data and the post implementation review to assess the effect of the changes on the community.


9. Immediately release to the public all data, research and evidence used in developing the legislation—including complete details of the impact the changes will have on families - so that the Senate can make a more informed assessment of its impact on all Australian families.


The Government has provided significant detail on the modelling and assumptions used to develop the Package and details of the impact the changes will have on families. This includes an impact analysis of the Package at Chapter 5 of the Regulatory Impact Statement. Section 5.3, in particular, analyses the impact on families, child care service providers, communities and governments, and an assessment of the Package's effectiveness at achieving the objectives of the reform. A summary of that information, as it relates to families, is provided in the submission to the inquiry made by the Department of Education and Training at paragraphs 137 to 142.




Recommendations contained in the Dissenting Report by the Australian Greens



1. The Australian Greens recommend that the activity test be amended to include an additional amount of base level subsidised childcare for all families that fall within the 0-8 hours of activity, so that all children have access to a minimum of 24 hours of subsidised child care per week.


The entry point to the activity test is set at a very low base - at least 8 hours of activity a fortnight results in access to up to 36 hours of subsidised child care a fortnight; more than 16 hours of activity a fortnight results in access to up to 72 hours of subsidised care a fortnight; and that more than 48 hours of activity a fortnight results in access to up to 100 hours of subsidised care a fortnight.


A broad range of activities will meet the activity test requirements, including paid work, looking for work, volunteering or study. People on paid and unpaid parental leave who are returning to work would also meet the activity test. To ensure families with casual or irregular work are not disadvantaged by the activity test and to ensure their children receive continuity of care, parents in this circumstance will be able to estimate their hours of activity over a three month period.


We know children from disadvantaged backgrounds benefit most from quality early childhood education and care, and that's why we're providing additional support to those who need it most. Families with incomes below around $65,000 (in 2017 terms) who do not meet the activity test will be able to access up to 24 hours per fortnight of subsidised care —equivalent to two weekly six-hour sessions—at the highest 85 per cent rate of subsidy (this is an increase on the current 72 per cent). The removal of minimum hours per day and days per week opening requirements will allow service providers' to deliver these hours over two sessions per week.


The Government is also considering the sector's proposal to increase the number of subsidised hours for families with low incomes (below around $65,000 in 2017 terms) who do not meet the activity test from 24 to 30 hours per fortnight as part of its negotiations and deliberations in preparation for Parliamentary debate.


2. The Australian Greens recommend that an adequately flexible reporting grace period be adopted that allows all casual workers, part-time workers with irregular hours or people who lose their jobs to estimate their expected activity and childcare needs, so as not to be disadvantaged by the activity test.


Refer to the response provided to Labor Senator's Dissenting Report, Recommendation 4, above.


3. The Australian Greens recommend that further detailed clarification be provided as to how the Additional Child Care Subsidy will meet the needs of vulnerable children, in particular children in remote and regional Australia, and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children.


The new Child Care Safety Net will assist disadvantaged communities and vulnerable and at‑risk children, including children in remote and regional Australia and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children, and their families to address barriers in accessing child care, while encouraging parents to enter or re-enter the workforce. In particular, the Additional Child Care Subsidy component of the Child Care Safety Net will provide targeted additional fee assistance to families and children facing barriers in accessing affordable child care, including:


children at risk of serious abuse or neglect


grandparents on income support who are the primary caregivers of their grandchildren


families experiencing temporary financial hardship


low income families transitioning to work from income support


families with an income below around $65,000 (in 2017 terms) where the family does not meet the activity test.


Since the time of the Committee's report, the Department of Education and Training has undertaken consultation with the sector on the proposed detail of all Additional Child Care Subsidy payments, and will continue to engage with the sector as policy settings for these payments are finalised.


For further detail on specific support available to services currently funded through the Budget Based Funded program, please refer to the response provided to Labor Senator's Dissenting Report, Recommendation 2, above.


4. The Australian Greens recommend an amendment to include mechanisms for increasing childcare places where vacancy rates are critically low, creating barriers to parents being able to find affordable care.


The Government does not intervene directly in the child care market. Elements of the Package are aimed at encouraging services to be more flexible in how they provide care and child care places to both encourage more providers and to free up potential places in current services.

INTERACTIVE GAMBLING AMENDMENT BILL 2016


Online gambling has grown with consumers moving away from traditional gambling products to betting online using smartphones, tablets and other digital devices. In 2014, $2.4 billion was spent on online gambling by Australians – which was double the amount ten years earlier. Australia's high rate of gambling expenditure and strong adoption of digital technologies makes it imperative that there is a strong and enforceable regulatory framework to protect Australians from the adverse effects of illegal online gambling services. 


To support this objective, in April this year, the Government announced it would implement 18 of the 19 recommendations in the 2015 Illegal Offshore Wagering Review in a three staged process.


The Interactive Gambling Amendment Bill is the first stage of the Government's process to implement the recommendations in the Review. It will complement the other stages to establish a national consumer protection framework to minimise problem gambling and consult on other disruptive measures to stop offshore operators from providing illegal interactive gambling services to Australians.




Key findings of the Illegal Offshore Wagering Review



The Review found that the amount of money being spent on illegal wagering services could be as high as $400 million annually with a further $100 million in lost taxation revenue and product fees. Previous estimates found the total amount of money spent on all illegal interactive gambling services was close to $1 billion annually. 


Offshore gambling has detrimental effects on the Australian wagering, racing and sporting industries, problem and at‑risk gamblers, consumers and government. Offshore gambling operators do not pay Australian taxes, racing or sporting fees; they do not share information regarding suspicious betting activity with law enforcement or sporting bodies which risks the integrity of Australian sport; they offer gambling services prohibited under Australian law; they can be used for money laundering and other criminal activities; and they provide minimal to no harm minimisation and consumer protection controls which poses a threat to problem and at-risk gamblers.


The Review showed the rate of problem gambling is higher among interactive gamblers compared to gamblers more generally − 2.7 per cent of interactive gamblers are problem gamblers compared to 0.9 per cent of all gamblers. The devastating effects of problem gambling is not just felt by the gambler but also his or her family, friends, colleagues and the community.


The Review concluded that the aim of governments should be to reduce the scope of illegal offshore gambling activity and control the associated harms through a range of disruptive and deterrent measures and strong enforcement of regulation.




Minimal enforcement of the Interactive Gambling Act



The key piece of legislation to protect Australians against illegal online gambling services is the Commonwealth's Interactive Gambling Act. The Actprohibits the provision and advertising of prohibited interactive gambling services to persons in Australia. 


Stakeholders informed the Review that the existing approach to enforcement of the Interactive Gambling Act was insufficient to deter offshore operators from providing prohibited online gambling services to Australians. There have been no prosecutions under the Interactive Gambling Act since its inception in 2001 despite a considerable number of complaints made by Australians in regards to illegal online gambling services.


The borderless nature of the internet enables Australians to access hundreds of illegal online gambling sites on their computers and smartphones. Stakeholders assert that offshore operators ignore the provisions of the IGA because they are not well enforced.


Criminal prosecution is considered likely to be unsuccessful or ineffective due to the competing priorities of the Australian Federal Police, uncertainty around the legality of services under the Interactive Gambling Act, evidence requirements and the offshore location of gambling operators.


Some of these challenges were highlighted in 2015 when a number of Australian licensed wagering operators launched 'click to call' in-play betting services. The ACMA assessed these services as potentially a prohibited interactive gambling service and referred the matter to the Australian Federal Police for investigation. The Australian Federal Police declined to investigate due to competing priorities and ambiguity around the legality of these services under the Interactive Gambling Act. 


The Bill sets out to address these challenges. It will clarify the law regarding illegal online gambling services and empower the ACMA by strengthening the enforcement mechanisms under the Interactive Gambling Act.




Reforms to the Interactive Gambling Act



The Bill will prohibit a person providing regulated interactive gambling services to Australians unless the person holds a licence under the law of an Australian State or Territory. This amendment will clarify the licensing requirements for interactive gambling services in Australia and will provide a simple to establish key criterion for enforcement agencies when investigating whether to take action against unlicensed services. It is expected that reputable gambling organisations will obtain a licence in Australia or cease providing illegal services.


The reforms will introduce a civil penalty regime to be enforced by the ACMA which will allow the ACMA to be responsible for the entire complaint handling process from receipt to enforcement. The ACMA will be able to issue formal warnings and infringement notices, and seek civil penalties and injunctions. This amendment will allow for a quicker and more focused response as formal investigation or prosecution processes will not depend upon the priorities of other agencies. 


These penalties will also apply to any person that supports the provision of illegal interactive gambling services to Australians. Criminal offence provisions have been retained in the Interactive Gambling Act to allow the ACMA to refer complaints to the Australian Federal Police for more serious cases. 


The Bill will prohibit 'click to call' in-play betting services. These services allow consumers to place a large number of bets in a short period of time which can lead to serious gambling problems. The Government is committed to closing down these services as they undermine the intent of the IGA to limit the scope of problem gambling in Australia. 


The reforms will enable the ACMA to notify the Department of Immigration and Border Protection of the names of directors or principals of offending gambling services so they can be placed on the Movement Alert List and any travel to Australia can be disrupted.


These enforcement actions will be combined with a number of measures to build relationships with international regulators and raise awareness of Australian gambling laws and the risks associated with illegal gambling services.


Firstly, the ACMA will be able to notify international regulators of information relating to interactive gambling services. The offshore location of many gambling operators makes it difficult to enforce the IGA. Establishing productive relationships with international regulators to raise awareness of Australian gambling laws and receive assistance in any enforcement actions will assist the efforts of the ACMA to enforce the IGA in relation to foreign entities.


Secondly, some offshore gambling websites deliberately target Australian consumers by using Australian imagery and colloquialisms. Many consumers are unaware that these sites are not licensed in Australia and that there is limited legal recourse if they run into any difficulties obtaining winnings or deposits from these operators. The Bill will establish a register to be published on the ACMA website to raise awareness of wagering services that are licensed in Australia to ensure that persons looking to gamble will not inadvertently use an offshore site.


The combination of clearer legislation, stronger enforcement measures and awareness raising activities will assist in ensuring Australians are protected from illegal gambling services.




Other related amendments to the Interactive Gambling Act



The Bill contains related amendments to complement the ACMA's increased enforcement role, including to simplify and streamline the complaints handling and investigation process to remove mandatory requirements to refer matters to the police and enable the ACMA to handle the entire process from receipt of complaints to enforcement, similar to its complaints handling and enforcement role in relation to other legislation. The Bill also contains provisions to clarify the legality of services provided in licensed gambling and wagering venues and for the development of a legislative instrument to determine what constitutes a sporting event for the purposes of in-play betting under the IGA.


As mentioned, this Bill is the first stage of a three stage process the Government is taking to implement the recommendations in the Review.


The Government is working with State and Territory governments to establish a national consumer protection framework. It is imperative if we are to protect Australians from offshore gambling providers, we must ensure that proper protections exist in our own industry. The Government is also consulting with internet service providers and financial payment organisations on technological options to further disrupt the access of illegal offshore gambling services.




Conclusion



For too long, the Interactive Gambling Act has struggled in its role of keeping Australians, in particular problem and at‑risk gamblers, protected from the risks of illegal online gambling services. 


A combination of clearer laws, an active regulator and stronger enforcement measures will send a clear message to operators that Australia is serious about compliance of its gambling laws. Whilst there will remain practical and legal challenges in prosecuting overseas entities, these measures are expected to reduce the provision of prohibited interactive gambling services to Australians.


I would like to thank the Hon Barry O'Farrell for leading the Review and the many stakeholders across the wagering, racing and sporting industries, academia, responsible gambling organisations, consumers and government who provided their views to inform the development of this Bill. 


I commend this Bill and look forward to implementing the next stages of the Government's response to ensure Australia has a strong and enforceable regulatory framework for online gambling.


MIGRATION AMENDMENT (VISA REVALIDATION AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2016


The Migration Amendment (Visa Revalidation and Other Measures) Bill 2016 amends the Migration Act 1958 to support important Government initiatives which seek to promote Australia as an attractive destination. It will also facilitate the use of enhanced technology to improve the traveller experience at the Australian border. 



Schedule 1 – Visa Revalidation



Schedule 1 to the Billcontains amendments to the Migration Act to introduce a visa revalidation requirement. This will support the pilot of the proposed new 10-year validity visitor visa to ensure that only genuine visitors retain the right to travel to and enter Australia. 


Tourism is a vital part of the Australian economy, providing employment for around 600,000 Australians and accounting for more than $120 billion of economic activity. The Government is committed to boosting tourism across the nation, which in turn helps grow our domestic economy.


The introduction of a 10-year visitor visa will encourage repeat visits by genuine tourists and business people choosing Australia as their preferred destination. However, 10 years is a long time and it is likely that an individual's circumstances will change throughout the visa validity period. 


To manage the risks that this may present, Schedule 1 of the Bill introduces a mechanism that will allow for the Department to seek revalidation of certain information from visa holders over the life of the visa, either through a 'routine' revalidation or a 'public interest' revalidation. 


This 'revalidation' will be used to ensure that visa holders continue to meet genuine temporary entrant, identity, health, character, passport, national security and other criteria over the 10-year period. 


The introduction of a 'routine' revalidation requirement will simplify visa processes for frequent travellers. It means that, after completing a visitor visa application and being granted a visa, a frequent traveller won't need to do so again for up to 10 years. Instead, they will only need to periodically revalidate some key details. This will result in a significant reduction in red tape for low risk, high volume travellers to Australia. It is an example of how we are making the visa process for travellers easier, and seamless.


It is expected that the introduction of longer validity visas will also lead to an increase in the total number of visitor visa holders overseas. In terms of travel facilitation this is a desirable outcome, allowing potential visitors to more easily take advantage of last minute travel deals and choose Australia as their preferred destination – but we also need to consider the risks. A serious incident overseas, for example, may create a situation where it is in the public interest to reassess a number of longer validity visa holders' individual circumstances.


Accordingly, Schedule 1 of the Bill also introduces a 'public interest' revalidation check to manage specific, serious, or time-critical risks in relation to an identified cohort of visa holders. In such circumstances, issuing a personal Ministerial revalidation requirement will immediately prevent specified visa holders from being able to travel to and enter Australia until they successfully revalidate their visa. This will ensure that we have up-to-date information on an individual's circumstances and we can effectively mitigate potential risks to the Australian public, while providing a streamlined mechanism to facilitate travel as appropriate. 


In our digital age, international travellers increasingly expect to be able to transact with the Government online. Accordingly, governments are increasingly playing a role to deliver seamless, accessible and timely services to clients to meet both public expectations and a broader digital transformation agenda. 


Revalidation is consistent with this digital approach by facilitating real time interactions online between visa holders and the government. It provides an online mechanism for visa holders to update the information they have previously provided (for example contact details), as their circumstances change. 


The amendments in Schedule 1 of the Bill will ensure that both the integrity of the visitor visa framework and public confidence in the visitor visa programme are maintained as the new 10-year visa is introduced.



Schedule 2 – Cessation of Visas not in effect



The amendments made by Schedule 2 clarify the circumstances in which a visa can cease to be in effect under the Migration Act. 


While most visas come into effect immediately upon the grant of the visa, there are a small number of visa classes that are granted, but do not come into effect immediately.


There is currently ambiguity as to whether a 'ceasing event' under sections 82, 173 and 174 of the Migration Act can apply to a visa that has been granted, but not in effect.


The amendments contained within schedule 2 will ensure that, subject to limited exceptions, a visa will cease if a relevant ceasing provision applies to it, even if the visa is not in effect at the relevant time. 


This measure is particularly important in light of the new revalidation check framework being introduced by Schedule 1 of the Bill which will increase the number of persons who may hold a visa that is not in effect at a particular time. 



Schedule 3 – Contactless Immigration Clearance



Finally, Schedule 3 of the Bill makes amendments to support the next generation of contactless SmartGates.


In 2014-15, over 19 million travellers arrived into Australia of which over six million self-processed through our automated immigration clearance system known as SmartGates. Forecasts suggest that the number of travellers arriving in Australia will increase by almost 25 per cent over the next four years. 


To meet the challenges associated with the ever increasing number of travellers, this Government continues to implement new technologies at our borders to ensure that the ABF can continue to facilitate traveller flows, minimise delays and to identify persons of concern. 


As part of the 2015-16 Budget, the Government committed $93.7m to the Seamless Traveller initiative which included the expansion of SmartGates, and when fully implemented, we expect 90% of travellers will self-process through these gates. 


The next generation of SmartGates use leading edge technology to confirm a traveller's identity without the traveller having to present their ePassport. The live facial image of the traveller at the SmartGate will be compared with a verified image from departmental holdings to confirm a traveller's identity. 


As such, travellers will no longer be required to physically present their passport unless specifically requested, therefore reducing the time it will take for a traveller to self-process through a SmartGate. However, while they may not be required to present it, it is important to note that travellers will still be required to hold a valid passport, and carry that passport with them whilst travelling.


In addition to faster processing, and a reduction in queues, contactless technology delivers stronger security at our border, as the identity of the traveller is based on a facial image as a unique identifier, instead of document based checks. 


This automated system will remain voluntary and travellers can choose to use SmartGates or be processed by a clearance officer. Contactless SmartGates will be available to both Australian citizens and non-citizens departing and arriving into Australia, expanding the self-processing option to a greater number of travellers. 


Additionally, as more and more travellers self-process through SmartGates, Australian Border Force officers can be freed up from manual processing tasks to focus instead on higher risk traveller interventions. 


Introducing contactless technology into our border clearance processes is an important step in strengthening border security as traveller numbers continue to grow, and the amendments in Schedule 3 of this bill will enable the use of this world class, contactless SmartGate technology.



Conclusion



In conclusion, this bill makes a number of important amendments that will not only ensure that visa holders continue to meet entry requirements under the 10-year visitor visa pilot, but also support improved and streamlined passenger movements at our borders.


I commend the bill to the chamber.

Senator PRATT
 (Western Australia) (15:39):  At the request of Senator Gallagher, I move:


That the Senate condemns the failure of the Turnbull Government to invest in public transport infrastructure across Australia.


Here were are some eight months into the second term of the coalition government and, in that time, our Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull, has not sought to commence a single new major public transport project anywhere in the country. We all had high hopes that Malcolm Turnbull would differentiate himself from Abbott's appalling record on this front, but instead investment in our public transport systems coming from the Commonwealth continues to languish.


When Labor were in government, however, we increased federal spending on transport infrastructure from $141 to $269 a person. We committed to more public transport than all our predecessors since Federation combined. This has been incredibly important for our nation because we cannot have sustainable cities and quality family lives when people are stuck on congested roads.


In fact, the Barnett government relied on federal Labor when we were last in government to put money into the sinking of the railway line between Northbridge and the city of Perth, and we are just beginning to see the benefits now of this fantastic investment in the city. It has been thanks to the planning and investments coming from the Commonwealth that we have been able to see this project start to come to fruition. Without that money, this project would not have happened and our city would be much the poorer. The project really highlights the significance of investment in public transport, and this is exactly what WA is now missing out on.


What we had instead from the Liberal government when they came into government is that they scrapped all funding for public transport in our nation to the tune of $4 billion. From my home town of Perth where this investment is sorely needed, the Commonwealth has withdrawn $500 million that Labor allocated for public transport when we were in government. This is despite the appalling fact—and I know you will understand this, Madam Deputy President—that figures show that Perth is set to have seven of Australia's 10 most congested roads within 15 years. The Bureau of Infrastructure, Transport and Regional Economics says that 50 to 65 per cent of people are spending more than 45 minutes commuting to work every single day. That could be more than 10,000 hours per year stuck on the road because we have a government that will not invest in public transport around our country, 10,000 hours per year of people missing out on time with their families because the Liberals will not invest in public transport.


There has been no investment by the Turnbull government in public transport in Western Australia. There has been no investment by the Barnett government in public transport in WA. What we have here is both the Turnbull and Barnett governments taking Western Australians for granted. We have here a very wrong set of priorities. The WA Liberal and National government's key infrastructure project is, I am very sorry to say, a $1.9 billion freight link that is in fact a road to nowhere. It is a road whose construction is destroying important wetlands in areas of biodiversity. These are very precious areas that are much needed within our urban environment. It is a road that is destroying the homes of animals and wiping out endangered flora.


Colin Barnett, the premier, has argued that the freight link is to facilitate the passage of trucks to Fremantle Port. But the simple fact is that the road does not go to the Fremantle Port. If that were not so terrible it would almost be funny. The road terminates before it gets anywhere close to the Fremantle port. In fact, what we know about the Fremantle port is that it is already very much close to capacity, and what the state really needs is a southern port that fits with the state's future infrastructure needs and enables the state's economic development. 


Instead, what we have is this appalling road to nowhere. The Freight Link has been an absolute debacle from the get go. It is a terrible example of the Barnett government's mismanagement of Western Australia. So while we have Colin Barnett, Lisa Harvey and their mates in the Turnbull government sitting back and doing nothing about public transport in WA, what we have in the Mark McGowan Labor government is a real plan. We have a plan to invest in METRONET to connect our suburbs around Perth and to help fix congestion on our roads. It includes the introduction of a circle line, revolutionising Perth's rail system, providing the first east-west rail link so that commuters do not have to travel into the CBD to get out to other suburbs. It is an incredibly important plan. It includes completing the Forrestfield-Airport line, building a train line to Ellenbrook and, finally, keeping the promise that the Liberal government broke time and time again, building a Yanchep line to the north and a Byford line to the east as well as a new train station at Karnup in the south. 


It is a comprehensive plan, but it will need investment from the Commonwealth government. The plan involves fixing dangerous level crossings on the Armadale, Midland and Fremantle lines. With that, with METRONET, Western Australia will have the world-class public transport system that it deserves. It is smart, affordable and achievable and it will bring Perth in line with some of the best cities in the world when it comes to public transport. 


These are issues that the Commonwealth government can no longer be missing in action on. The plan is not only good for fixing congestion; it will create more than 10,000 jobs for Western Australians in our state. It will also see local manufacturing of railcars in Western Australia, increasing our local manufacturing of railcars to 50 per cent, which is a massive increase from the current two per cent under the Barnett Liberal government. This is incredibly important because the decline in the economy in Western Australia has seen many of our state's young people missing out on apprenticeships. We need this infrastructure and these jobs for the future of our state. 


But the plan does require federal funding and federal investment for WA. So what we really need to see is the Commonwealth government diverting that money from the Freight Link, because we know a Mark McGowan government will not go ahead with it. The Commonwealth government needs to divert that money from the Freight Link and invest it in our public transport system, just as it did for the state of Victoria when state Labor won government there and the state made infrastructure and planning changes. 


Those of us from WA Labor here in this place and the other place will not back down on this question. We will be fighting the Turnbull government to make sure that you fund our infrastructure projects in WA. We will fight to make sure that the Turnbull government invests in our public transport to ease congestion in WA. We want to fight the Turnbull government to make sure you play your part in making METRONET happen for the people of Western Australia. Why? Because it is a good plan. It is a necessary plan and it is the only real plan that is going to reduce congestion in our cities.


I know that if the Turnbull government takes money away from Western Australia because they do not support the reinvestment of the Perth Freight Link money into our public transport system, if they do not act on congestion problems that are becoming uncontrollable in our state, then they will lose seats in Western Australia, because voters in Western Australia's outer suburbs are angry. They are angry about the lack of investment in infrastructure and public transport in our state. They are sick and tired of being left behind by Liberal governments here in Canberra and over in WA. 


What we have here is a real choice on 11 March. It is a choice between a tired Liberal government that has no plan for Western Australia, or a fresh approach with the Mark McGowan Labor government. Labor will invest in our future and in our public transport system. I am confident that we in this place will be able to fight the Turnbull government for a better deal for our state.

"Smith, Sen Dean",LP,2017-02-09,"



Senator SMITH
 (Western Australia—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (15:50):  Is that it? Is that the first contribution by the Labor Party this afternoon on their notice of motion in regard to a lack of investment in public transport infrastructure—they allege—by the Turnbull government? We did not hear one convincing bit of evidence. There was lots of rhetoric and lots of wishful thinking about the future of a possible Labor government in Western Australia. But there was nothing convincing in Senator Pratt's contribution this afternoon. I hope that other Labor senators will rise to the occasion and at least put their hearts into the motion that Senator Gallagher moved.


I am surprised, I have to confess, about Labor's choice of subject for this afternoon's motion. Here is Senator Sterle—it will be interesting to see Senator Sterle's contribution this afternoon. It will be interesting to see whether he is tempted to digress into the rhetoric of Mark McGowan and future Labor governments that they hope for. 


I am very surprised at Labor's choice of a discussion topic this afternoon in the Australian Senate. I think it is very odd that the Australian Labor Party in this place would be looking to talk about public transport this week. I will be particularly interested if any Labor senators from Queensland are planning to take part in this afternoon's debate, given the week that the Labor government there has experienced, specifically in relation to public transport. The veracity of their claim around poor public transport infrastructure spending by the Turnbull government will be tested if there are any Labor senators from Queensland that participate in the debate this afternoon.


It is an odd choice of motion for another reason—and that one is a pretty simple one. The evidence just does not demonstrate a lack of investment in public transport by the Turnbull government. To accuse this government of the lack of care, concern or investment in public transport infrastructure requires one to live in a fantasy world because it is just not reflected in the reality. I will demonstrate that with not rhetoric but facts. Quite frankly, it is hard to think of a federal government that has done more for public transport infrastructure than the Turnbull government. That is not a difficult claim for someone like me to make.



Senator Sterle interjecting—




Senator SMITH:
  Senator Sterle, I hope you will sit through my whole presentation because I am going to put the facts and the evidence on the table. That will be your challenge—to put the facts and the evidence on the table.




Senator Sterle:
  I am riveted, Deano!




Senator SMITH:
  This historical investment in public transport infrastructure has arisen in no small part because, after seemingly endless stuff-ups and delays under hopelessly incompetent Labor state governments, the community has developed an expectation now that the federal government will be involved. Now, if you will permit me to be brutally honest for a brief moment: that does not sit particularly well with my very, very strong federalist instincts. I think it is a bit rich for Labor state governments, in particular, to now expect the federal government to be doing their job for them, especially in the space of public transport.


I also note that this motion comes from Senator Gallagher, the former Chief Minister of the ACT, which is not a jurisdiction renowned for its exceptional public transport system. And I might add that, after some 16 years of unbroken Labor government, I find that deeply ironic. Of course, there is now a light rail project being constructed on the north side of Canberra. I can only hope for the sake of this city's residents it does not suffer the same usual problems of major projects managed—or, in this case, mismanaged—by Labor governments. It is also worth noting that the Turnbull government has provided $67 million to the ACT to assist with the construction of that project. Perhaps that might have slipped Senator Gallagher's mind when she presented the motion this afternoon.


Nonetheless, our system has evolved to the point where there is an expectation now that the federal government will be involved in funding public transport infrastructure projects. That being the case, this federal government has been more than willing to step up to support the development of public transport infrastructure. No matter which part of Australia you live in, there is ample evidence to back that up.


So let's look at the evidence—let's look at some of the facts. Between now and 2018-19, the Turnbull government is investing some $1.9 billion on urban passenger rail projects, despite the fact that it is primarily a state government responsibility. Let's look at South Australia, a jurisdiction also afflicted with a long-term Labor government so incompetent that it literally cannot keep the lights on. I send my greetings to those in South Australia who may be watching or listening to this debate, but, sadly, we cannot be confident that they are able to turn on their televisions and listen to their radios as a result of the incompetence. In South Australia, the Turnbull government is investing $43 million to extend the Tonsley rail line to the Flinders medical precinct. In the state of Queensland, this government has made a contribution of $95 million to stage two of the Gold Coast Light Rail extension project. That will see the line extended by 7.3 kilometres from the Gold Coast University Hospital to connect with the heavy rail network at the northern end of the Gold Coast, at Helensvale, with new stations at Parkwood and Parkwood East, and a new heavy rail/light rail interchange at Helensvale.


In South Australia, in Queensland, Senator Gallagher's motion that the Turnbull government is not investing in public transport infrastructure has proven to be wrong. Importantly, for Queenslanders and for others travelling to Australia for the Commonwealth Games, this public transport infrastructure will, of course, be very, very important. In addition to this, Queensland is also getting from the Turnbull government $10 million to further investigate urban regeneration opportunities and funding and financing options, and assess the integration of Cross River Rail with the council's Brisbane Metro Subway System. It is very, very clear that Queenslanders are benefiting from the Turnbull government's investment in public infrastructure.


Turning to New South Wales: through the asset recycling initiative the Turnbull government is contributing over $1.6 billion to the Sydney Metro, Australia's largest public transport initiative currently under construction, which, when completed, will be Australia's first fully-fledged rapid transit system. On top of this, in New South Wales there is $98.4 million for the Western Sydney rail upgrade, $78.3 million for the Parramatta Light Rail project and $26 million to support development of a rail link to the new Western Sydney Airport.


In Victoria, the Turnbull government is contributing $10 million to the development of the Melbourne Metro project, which includes five new underground rail stations. I know, Senator Rice, you would prefer people to walk! I know you prefer people to walk, but people need to get to work, they need to shift their families around they need to get jobs, and freights are important.




Senator Rice interjecting
—





Senator SMITH:
  I know you prefer people to walk or to sit under a tree.


In my own state of Western Australia—which is where Senator Pratt left her very, very modest contribution to the afternoon debate—the federal government is contributing $490 million to the Forrestfield-Airport rail link, which is an absolutely critical project for Perth and for the entire state of Western Australia. And I should point out that that construction work is well underway—it has already started; it is well underway—after careful planning and implementation of those plans. Of course, that money came as partial compensation for our low share of GST revenue.



Senator Sterle interjecting—




Senator SMITH:
  Together with my Liberal colleagues in this place, I am very proud to have played a role in securing it—which brings me to an important point, Senator Sterle. Your challenge to Mark McGowan is to ask him what he is going to do about GST distribution. And what is Bill Shorten going to do about GST distribution? If the government changes, that issue falls heavily on what he is going to do. What is he going to do?




Senator Sterle:
  I would say probably a lot more than what Barnett has done.




Senator SMITH:
  Through you, Mr Acting Deputy President, I ask Senator Searle: what is Mark McGowan going to do about GST distribution? I think that is the answer—silence; nothing.




Senator Sterle:
  Do you want me to answer?




Senator SMITH:
  That is his big challenge. I will be watching closely, Senator Sterle; I will be watching very, very closely. It is worth noting that Bill Shorten has never revealed his own plan to address WA's GST shortfall. I suspect we all know why: he is utterly beholden to his Labor mates in South Australia, who continue to fight against sensible reform that would be in the interests of Western Australians and indeed, I argue, in the interests of Australia's economic productivity.


It is a marked contrast to the approach from WA Labor, which went to the last state election, in 2013, promising to build an airport station that was located a couple of kilometres from the airport terminal. I know you remember that, Senator Sterle.




Senator Sterle:
  No, I don't know what you are talking about.




Senator SMITH:
  You do remember that, don't you? A railway station that was not even located where the people are! This demonstrates a consistent problem with the WA Labor Party: they like to talk big. They have a nice, colourful map and a few logos for their projects, and the spin gets underway. They hoodwink Western Australian voters, and then of course, in the end, Western Australian voters are left with nothing. But scratch the surface and, time after time, they have the detail badly wrong. That is something that Western Australians will be bearing in mind as we approach the state election on Saturday, 11 March.


While on the subject of transport infrastructure in my home state of Western Australia, it would be remiss of me not to mention the brazenly irresponsible decision of the WA Labor Party to oppose Roe 8, which is a critical element of the Perth Freight Link project, in a cynical attempt to win a few preferences from the Australian Greens in advance of the election. The Labor Party has bought into this ridiculous notion that we have to make a choice between road and rail. That is simply a false choice. We need both. It will come as news to the Labor Party, but not everything can move around by rail alone. It is not a perfect solution. That is why Roe 8 and the recently announced Roe 9 tunnel are absolutely critical to meeting Perth's freight needs.


It is odd that the Labor Party are constantly talking about the need to create jobs—and they are right; job creation is critical in Western Australia—but they never want to actually build the road infrastructure that will deliver it. Instead, they want to get together with the Greens and pursue an ideological fetish for passenger rail. Roe 8 and Roe 9 are critical projects that will both help WA to diversify its economy and make it easier to export our goods to growing markets in Asia. Roe 8 and Roe 9 will remove nearly 7,000 heavy vehicles per day from Perth's southern urban arterial road network. This will make for a safer and more reliable road journey into and out of Fremantle. Together, they will also allow heavy vehicles and other road users to bypass the 14 sets of traffic lights now on the Leach Highway and Stock Road, creating a safer environment for all road users. Moreover, the project is anticipated to create 1,900 direct jobs, with a total on-site workforce of over 6½ thousand during the construction phase. This is something that WA Labor—




Senator Sterle:
  Bollocks!




Senator SMITH:
  You do not believe that any jobs will be created from the Roe 8 and Roe 9 projects? You do not believe that any jobs will be created?





The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Marshall
):  Senator Sterle, on a point of order?




Senator Sterle:
  Senator Smith is misleading the Senate here. I agree jobs will be created, but nowhere near the make-believe figure that the WA Liberal government mentions.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Thank you for that, but that is not a point of order. Resume your seat. Senator Smith, you have the call.




Senator SMITH:
  Thank you for paying attention to my contribution this afternoon, Senator Sterle; I do appreciate that. But job creation, of course, is very, very important to the Western Australian economy. With 1,900 direct jobs and almost 6½ thousand other jobs during the construction phases of Roe 8 and Roe 9, that has to be good news for Western Australians and for the Western Australian economy. It is a very confusing stance that WA Labor have. It is one taken simply because they have convinced themselves that there is more virtue in rail projects than there is in road projects, and that is just not true.


At the beginning of my contribution, I said that it was very curious that the Labor Party had chosen this week to raise the matter of public transport, given the problems currently being experienced by the Labor government in Queensland. I just want to have a look, briefly, at what has happened in recent times in Queensland. Since the second part of last year, it is fair to say that Queensland's passenger rail system has been a basket case—and that is probably putting it charitably. On 21 October last year, around 100 passenger rail services across south-east Queensland had to be cancelled due to a shortage of drivers. On Christmas Day, almost two-thirds of scheduled services had to be cancelled for the same reason. This left many people who were trying to spend Christmas Day with loved ones simply stranded.


These shortages occurred because of the bungled implementation of a new timetable, not due to a lack of investment from the Turnbull government. The federal government does not schedule train services. The federal government does not recruit train drivers. Passengers were not left stranded on rail station platforms across south-east Queensland on Christmas Day because of inaction on the part of the federal government. This is something that has occurred because of the manifest ineptitude of the Queensland state Labor government. I note that the minister for transport in that government finally fell on his sword earlier this week after a damning report into that disaster, and is it any wonder? Just listen to this:


There was also a 7 per cent drop in train crew productivity due to more restrictive crewing rules agreed between unions and QR's—


Queensland Rail's—


management.


The supply of qualified drivers declined by 4 per cent over the same period, reaching 471 drivers in December 2016, due to QR preferring to operate with a 5-10 per cent undersupply of crew, driven by a practice of providing overtime opportunities and restrictions on the ability to recruit externally.


So a sweetheart deal between the unions and Queensland Rail, a Queensland government body, limited the ability for new drivers to be recruited.


Of course, we all know which side of politics is beholden to the Australian trade union movement in our country—that is the Labor Party; no surprises. The report went on to recommend that negotiations with unions address the restrictive rules regarding continuous working time, meal breaks and rostering processes. I wonder what prospect there is that a Queensland Labor government which cannot survive without the political muscle supplied by its union allies will act on that very simple and clear recommendation? My fear is that Queensland commuters may be experiencing delays for some time to come, if they have to rely on the Labor Party to do the right thing and put the public interest before the unions' interests.


Of course, it is also the Turnbull government that has established the Smart Cities and Suburbs Program, and public transport is an absolutely critical element within that. This government recognises than an ad hoc approach to the development of cities is no longer viable. In today's economy, our cities must compete in order to grow and prosper. That competition should foster important collaboration. The government is combining smart policy, smart investment and smart technology to ensure our cities are more liveable, more productive and more prosperous. The Smart Cities Plan means more affordable housing, new jobs closer to homes, better transport and more liveable cities. To support the Smart Cities Plan, we announced $50 million to accelerate planning and development on major urban transport projects and the establishment of an Infrastructure Financing Unit to broker commercial deals with the private sector so that we can deliver more congestion-busting infrastructure sooner. This will make our cities more liveable through better coordination, integrated planning and targeted infrastructure investment. Smart Cities creates a shared vision for cities and a plan for governments, businesses and communities to coordinate their actions and investments to achieve agreed targets.


This motion before us is from the Labor Party, and so, in the very brief time available to me it would be remiss of me not to reflect on their record in government in this area. And I have to say that there is not a lot to say about Labor's record of investment in public transport infrastructure. Before and during the 2016 election campaign, the Labor Party committed to funding a number of urban rail projects through its $10 billion 'concrete bank' facility, with the balance apparently to come from the Building Australia Fund. However, that money is already fully allocated to other projects, and the Labor Party have not identified what projects they would cancel. So Labor's answer to public transport infrastructure is to make promises that cannot be funded, that cannot be honoured. I know what you're going to say, Senator Sterle: 'Here we go again—Senator Smith is right. This is history repeating itself. How does he know these things?' Because you and Labor oppositions think they can hoodwink the Australian community. When the Labor Party were last in government, of the $6.2 billion they allocated to urban transport in the 2013 budget, just $1.9 billion—30 per cent—was in the forward estimates. The remaining $4.3 billion was outside the budget estimates. That is standard operating procedure for the Labor Party in this place—talk projects up, promise voters the world and then keep kicking the can further down the road when it comes to the question of actually paying for things.


 It is clear: the Turnbull government does have a plan for investment in public transport infrastructure in Queensland, in Victoria, in South Australia, in New South Wales and, indeed, in my own state of Western Australia. What is the contrast? What is the comparator? The Labor Party has no plan. When it did have a plan, those plans were unfunded, they were hollow commitments and they would have left Australians high and dry.

"Rice, Sen Janet",AG,2017-02-09,"



Senator RICE
 (Victoria) (16:10):  In parliament yesterday we heard the Prime Minister accuse the Leader of the Opposition of being a parasite. But, when it comes to public transport policy in Australia, Prime Minister Turnbull is the great leech of our trains, trams and buses. He is more than happy to try and boost his popularity by taking selfies of himself on the train or—his second favourite—bus, but when it comes to investing in public transport he is just absent. He sucking the life out of public transport across our cities and propping up the big road lobby instead.


Senator Smith wanted to talk about facts, traversing the country as to where federal investment in transport was being made. The figure that he quoted for Victoria was notable. If you look at how much federal money is going into public transport infrastructure in Victoria, you see that less than one per cent—yes, one per cent—of that money has gone to Victoria in recent years. Senator Smith's quote was very telling: $10 million towards the Melbourne Metro rail tunnel. That is $10 million out of a project for which there is an investment of $10 billion. This is how out of whack this government's public transport funding is. What is really sad and what makes it so clear is that this is just a continuation of policy by both Labor and Liberal governments over many decades. If you look at investment by federal governments over many, many years, you see there was zero investment in public transport. Since the middle of last century, overwhelmingly the money from both state and federal governments has been spent on building more and more and more roads. 


I am not against roads—roads are very useful things. I am also not against cars, as much as some people in this place might think that is the case. I drive a car. But it is a matter of having some balance. The balance that we need is a balance that will give us a very different model of transport investment than what we currently have. We are at a crossroads. We can continue in the direction in which we have been going for the last 60 years, with the overwhelming investment in large, polluting roads—more and more and more of them—in the vain hope that, by building more and more roads, we will somehow solve our congestion problems. Or we can take a step back and look at what transport planners, transport academics, community groups—anybody who is looking at the future of our cities in an objective way—say: that is not going to deliver the cities that we want. So we have got a choice. We have two very different models that we have to choose between. 


The model that has a much better balance between road based transport—with cars providing passenger transport—and public transport and active transport is the city that I want to live in. We need cities that have got that balance. Let us look at all the trips being done in our city and let us aim to have about an equal balance. About a third of those trips should be made by private transport, so when we need to be driving somewhere in our private cars there is the road capacity to do that. About a third of all the trips we are taking should be able to be made by public transport. And about a third of the trips we are taking should be able to be made by active transport, like walking and cycling. To me, that is the balance that would actually lead us to have much healthier cities.


But the direction we are heading in at the moment is just a continuation of the same, which is where we have nine out of 10 trips being made by people in private cars, generally with only one person in that private car. There is an occupancy rate of 1.1 person per car. That might have worked in cities in Australia in the 1950s and 1960s and even the 1970s, because our cities were not nearly as big. We did not have the density that we have in our cities now. We could build the roads to cater for everyone who wanted to drive, who wanted to be able to jump in their car whenever they wanted to get somewhere and have a relatively clear, flowing journey to get from A to B. But it just does not work in cities the size of Australian cities today.


When you have cities like Melbourne and Sydney, which are pushing five million people, the fundamental problem is that you cannot fit that many cars in without having massive impacts on how your cities function. If you are going to continue to have nine out of 10 trips being made by cars in cities of five million people, you actually have to take up about a third of the city. One third of the space of the city has to be allocated to those cars in roads and parking, and that is just swallowing up far too much of the city that should be being used for all sorts of other things. It should be used for parkland, for housing and for recreational space. But the ongoing obsession with building big, new roads means that just gets eaten away. We have the tollways continuing to eat up our cities whether it is in Perth, with the Perth freight link; Sydney, with WestConnex; or Melbourne, with what was the East West Link, and we are now fighting the Western Distributor.


You cannot build your way out of congestion, because if you are going to build those roads to cater for that many people, you have the city going down the gurgler in terms of being a livable space. You also have the pollution that accompanies all of those trips—unless you are suddenly going to have a massive investment in renewable energy and electric cars being powered by renewable energy. The cars in our cities today have internal combustion engines, which are pumping out those greenhouse gases that are causing climate change. If we are serious about tackling climate change, we have to deal with reducing the number of cars on our roads. Then there is the urban air pollution, not just the carbon dioxide. There are the nitrous oxides, the sulphur and the other pollutants. The more cars you have in the city, the less and less livable it is.


When it comes to investment and the lack of investment by the federal government, the other telling factor as to why it is so much more sensible to be investing in public transport rather than in our roads is just how much more bang for your buck you get when you invest in public transport. Whether it is putting in something at grade or above ground or whether it is digging a tunnel to put in a train line or a tollway, basically you can shift far more people with a public transport project that you can building a tollway to shift people at 1.1 people per car.


In fact, if you build a new rail line, the number of people who can travel on a service operating at a high frequency is the equivalent of 12 lanes of freeway traffic. It is 12 to one in terms of the number of people you can shift, for about the same cost. That is why, if you are working out where you are going to put your money and what is going to give you the most benefit in terms of shifting people around their city, time and time again, hands down, investing in public transport is going to win out, and it is not just trains either. The Greens have a commitment to investing in trains, trams, buses and other public transport vehicles. You can get so much better value out of investing in busses to solve the congestion problems in the outer suburbs than you can by just continuing to expand the road network. As I said, we are at a crossroads. We can continue to go down the path we have in the past, which leads to congested, polluted, incredibly unpleasant cities to live in. Or we can go down a path that will lead to cities that are much more livable and sustainable and where people really want to live.


I think about the young people who are growing up in our cities today, particularly people who struggling to afford to buy a house. They find themselves having to live and rent in the outer suburbs, with pathetic public transport. That is not fair on them. And you have the older generations, who are able to afford to live in the inner city and who have access to good public transport. But because the investment in public transport has not kept up with our population growth, anybody who is living in more affordable housing on the outskirts of our cities are being discriminated against. It is not fair. It is intergenerational inequity, just so that the people who have always wanted to drive their cars can continue to drive their cars. It is not surprising that the younger generation have been much less keen. They see the advantages of public transport. They know that on public transport they can sit there and work on their phone or check their emails. They do not have this obsession or feeling that their whole sense of identity is tied up with having to be able to get in their car for every journey they take.


We have a situation where it is clear that logic and sensible planning shows that investment in public transport is the direction we need to be heading in. If we are heading towards a city that has the sort of balances I have talked about—a third of trips being made on public transport, a third being made in private cars on roads and a third on bikes and walking—there is something that is a really important part of that equation, and that is that we actually do not need more roads. We have enough roads for a third of our trips to be undertaken by roads, but we need to be investing in public transport to have public transport trips that really compete with cars and to provide public transport that is fast, frequent, reliable, affordable, safe and well-networked. That is where the deficiencies are, and it is because we have had this failure of investment over the last 60 years and we are continuing to have the failure of investment by this government.


If we actually decided that we really wanted to have healthy, sustainable cities and looked objectively at where the money needed to be spent, it would be very clear and very obvious that it is in those public transport projects, whether it is in the metros, electrification of lines that are currently regional services like the Melton line in Melbourne or putting in train services like the airport. People are astounded that Melbourne, a city the size that it now is, has not got a rail line to its airport. That is where the priority needs to be. Forget about trying to build your way out of congestion by wasting money on roads like the Western Distributor and the East West Link. It is by putting money in things like airport rail and rail out to Doncaster that we can really start to transform our cities.


The Greens have got a vision for $10 billion of investment over the next four years as being what is needed in federal funding to get public transport back on track. We will continue to call upon this government and to call upon Labor governments here at the federal level and at state levels to give priority to public transport funding. The Prime Minister in particular must stop being a public transport pretender and start getting serious about making public transport a better experience for all Australians.

"Sterle, Sen Glenn",ALP,2017-02-09,"



Senator STERLE
 (Western Australia) (16:24):  I cannot believe how blessed I am to be following on from Senator Smith and Senator Rice. Before I go to Senator Smith's contribution, I say God bless the Greens. I think Senator Rice really is pure of heart, and it is well known that Senator Rice is a cyclist, but I just have to clarify a few things. It is a wonderful dream to think we could have a third—I think it was, Senator Rice—of journeys in cars, a third on public transport and a third walking or cycling. But it never ceases to amaze me. The Greens, like all Australians, like to wake up in the morning and know the milk is fresh in the stores, there is bread on the shelves and newspapers have been delivered so everyone can read them. They actually get there through heavy vehicles and our transport networks, and we have to have roads to get our trucks from the ports, railheads, warehouses and distribution centres. You always seem to skip over that, Senator Rice.


I could probably make a suggestion: the Greens should lead by example. If they really are that concerned and passionate about cutting down on car journeys, why don't they all turn up each morning here—the whole nine of them—in a pastel rainbow painted bongo van so they could save the eight Comcars the journey? You do not see that. Mind you, it would remind me of that 1960s comedy sitcom, The Munsters, when they were on holidays! But I digress. I have got to come back to Senator Smith's contribution.


It is very clear the general business notice of motion was condemning the Turnbull government's lack of investment in public transport infrastructure, but Senator Smith clearly did not deliver a lot of home truths, and I would like to correct the record before I go down the path of talking about infrastructure for public transport. It is not only trains. It is not only buses. It is roads, bus stations and train stations. Senator Smith, in our state of Western Australia you cannot possibly argue—and I know you would not even try to argue—against the massive investment by state Labor governments in public transport over the last 20 years. It was state Labor governments that built the northern railway line, as you and I both know. You also know it was the Court Liberal government that shut down the Fremantle train line. You would remember that very well, because I know I do too. It was the state Labor government that opened it back up again. You would also know it was the state Labor government, through a previous member for—what seat was Alannah in? I cannot remember. What was her federal seat?




Senator Lines:
  Perth.




Senator STERLE:
  Perth! It was her fantastic work that opened up the southern suburbs with that magnificent piece of public transport infrastructure: the Perth-Mandurah railway line. I tell you what: I use it so many times. There are so many times when I use that in peak hour, and it is not big enough, let me tell you. It should be double-deckers.


But let's just clear some things that Senator Smith will not talk about. Yes, there happens to be a state election coming up in WA. We know that. Each time we have a state election under Barnett, from the Liberal opposition in 2008 to becoming the Premier in 2008 and then the Premier again at the 2013 election, there are shocking, misleading statements that the Barnett opposition and then Barnett government put out. Senator Smith, in his own words, made accusations of Labor 'hoodwinking voters' and about promises. I am not quite sure if it was 'broken promises' or 'Labor makes lots of promises'. But let me quote to this chamber a few examples of the shocking broken promises, false commitments and—no, I cannot use the word 'lies', because I will get pulled up by the Acting Deputy President. But what about the Ellenbrook railway line?


Everyone in this chamber knows I very rarely read speeches, and I am not reading a speech, but I want to quote and make sure I get my quotes right. This was during the 2008 campaign, when Mr Barnett was the Leader of the Opposition. The Liberals specifically stated:


A Liberal Government will provide $53 million over the next four years toward the construction of a new rail line to Ellenbrook, to meet needs in the fast growing North Eastern Growth Corridor.


The Liberal candidate and now member for Swan Hills, Mr Frank Alban, sent out material to his electorate, telling voters that the Liberals would build the Ellenbrook line. The fact is the funding was not delivered. The project was cancelled. During the 2013 campaign, Premier Barnett claimed that the commitment had never been made. Of course, someone forgot to tell Mr Alban, who sent out all that information to the seat.


Here is another ruse from the Barnett Liberal government in Western Australia. This was on 31 July 2013. The catchcry at the time was 'fully funded, fully costed'. Here we go: despite claiming during the election campaign that its projects—this is the Liberal Party—were fully funded and fully costed, it was revealed that a total of $3 billion in Commonwealth contributions was assumed for major infrastructure projects such as the Liberal's MAX Light Rail, the Liberal's airport rail and the Perth to Darwin highway. The federal government had not given one single commitment to provide one cent of funding. It was another ruse by the Liberal Premier Barnett.


I will go onto the MAX Light Rail; let's talk about the MAX Light Rail not being funded. MAX Light Rail was this grand plan that the Liberals had into the election. They were going to look after Perth's public transport infrastructure. On 31 July 2013, both the funding and time frame of Premier Barnett's MAX Light Rail project were uncertain, with the Premier refusing to reiterate his promise that it would be operational by 2018. Former Prime Minister Tony Abbott refused to provide the required federal funding for the project as well.


The Liberal government said the Metro Area Express, which is the MAX, would be a new light rail system connecting Mirrabooka with the CBD—Mirrabooka is a northern suburb—and across to Nedlands. Nedlands is the area around the university. It is very nice suburb. You would not find too many blue-collar workers in Nedlands, which is a shame, because I know I would love to live there. The light rail would also connect up with Victoria Park, which is the next suburb, out of Perth and over the Causeway. Commuters would be able to use that new light rail by 2018. The Premier, Mr Barnett, said this on 2 September 2012:


Max light rail, that project is going to be complex … my instinct tells me is that if any of the projects are going to slip out, it’ll be that one.


He said that a year later, on 15 May 2013, on ABC TV radio.


Here is another cracker. We will take this one from 28 August 2013: the rapid bus transit to Ellenbrook. You would have heard about that one. The Barnett government broke another promise to the people of Ellenbrook by failing to fund the Ellenbrook rapid bus transport service. They could not have the rail line and they are certainly not going to get the bus line. This is what the Barnett Liberal government promised: they promised Ellenbrook a rapid bus transit service, which was identified as a priority in the state government's public transport plan for Perth. Do you know what they are saying now? No funding was provided back in 2013-14 and it has just slipped off the books.


Here is another one. Now, before they all jump up on that side, all of a sudden with an election in the air, whoosh, it was: 'Let's get the graders out there, let's get some orange witch's hats and let's put some sites and fencing.' They have now extracted their political digit and now got on with the airport rail link because there is an election on. It is two years delayed. That happens. We know, we understand that delays happen. But Mr Barnett promised on 13 February 2014 that the Barnett government would deliver the airport-Forestville train line by 2018. If there was not an election coming now, there still would not be anything. That is the only reason they started one project after all the broken promises.


They also promised, on 30 June 2015, the Aubin Grove station. The Liberal government broke another promise on public transport with the delay of the construction of the Aubin Grove train station. They promised a train station and 2,000 park-and-ride facility would be open in 2016. Now they are hoping it is going to be open sometime around 2018. Before those opposite get all excited, I know massive infrastructure projects get delayed, but there is a difference between promising when you are going to do it and waiting until the last minute before the next election, then racing out to try to tell the people of Perth why you have lost a AAA credit rating and that you are a government that delivers. They are a government that breaks promises on public infrastructure and infrastructure projects constantly.


The Barnett Liberal government in Western Australia also promised—it was the Liberal-National government back then; now they are not, because they have had a little bit of a falling out with Mr Grills, the leader of the Nations, but anyway—that the Liberal-National government would add more than 15 million service kilometres and an extra 158 buses to the state's transport system, in the biggest boost to bus services in Western Australia in more than a decade. That was on 23 May 2011. What they are now saying is that the target of 15 million service kilometres has been 'wound back a little bit'—I do not know what that means—and spread over an extra seven years. That came from the Public Transport Authority's managing director, Mark Burgess—I know Mark Burgess. That was at an estimates hearing on 9 June 2015, when Senator Smith gave me the opportunity to correct the record.


I may as well keep going. On 27 July 2015, Mr Troy Buswell, who at the time would have been the Minister for Transport, said:


Our two key transformational projects to redefine travel and development patterns are the extension of the northern suburbs railway to Yanchep and a light rail from Mirrabooka to the CBD.


I have heard that before; it has popped up again. This was to the Sun City News on 21 July 2011. Where are we now? The Yanchep rail extension is not going to happen until possibly the middle of the next decade.


See, there is a constant here. There is a constant theme of promising anything that they think they need to do to win an election. They take the Western Australian voters for fools, promising it up. They promise, promise and promise. They then come back after the election and have more excuses than you could even imagine about why they cannot do it, while also losing our AAA credit rating, while also knowing that the wind-down on construction and in the mining industry was going to bite and while also knowing all the Treasury forecasts that the price of iron ore would fall through the floor. But that did not stop Premier Barnett and his ministers and members of parliament absolutely misleading the people of Western Australia with false promises that I said I am not allowed to call lies—but I do not know what else you call them in this day and age.


So, while I am on a roll, let's continue about the Western Australian Liberal government, shall we? And let's have a look. On 6 November 2015 they promised:


In total, 50 six-car sets (300 railcars) will be delivered over 10 years from 2019 at an estimated total capital cost of $1.2 billion.


Then, on 26 October 2015 in TheWest Australian Mr Barnett is quoted as saying:


We're just not in a position to make a huge commitment for the next series of cars.


Now, isn't that amazing? So, Senator Smith: good luck. I know how it works, mate: Thursday arvo, and we have been here bashing heads all week, and we all have a lot of things going on, and then you get tapped on the shoulder, you get the phone call from the whip's office: 'Geez, we've got 20 minutes. Can you burn up some time, because the bloody opposition's put one on us. You're from Western Australia; the West Aussies will certainly get up and have a crack at us. Can you go in there and defend the indefensible?'—which I think you have done. You have done your party a service. You have tried your best, Senator Smith, but you really led with your jaw when you allowed me to come in and talk about the lack of public transport infrastructure in Western Australia and the misleading commitments and promises that were all broken by your mates in the Western Australian Liberal government in Perth under the leadership of Premier Barnett—who, I must say, now has found himself heading for another election, and all of a sudden I am just waiting for the promises that are going to come this time.


But unfortunately the beauty of this is that I think Western Australians will say: 'Hang on: we've heard it all before. We're sick of the promises. You can get away with the odd one that slips up now and again, but when you continually lie to us and continually mislead us and continue to promise the world and then come up with all the lame excuses for why you can't do it, while congestion in Perth is going through the roof—'.


And there is absolutely no secret that the former Prime Minister, Prime Minister Abbott, had no respect for public transport. He made it quite clear. How do I know this? I know because I have chaired the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Committee, whether it was Legislation, in the government years, or References, in the opposition years, for the past 10 years. That is how I know that. I sit there in Senate estimates, alongside Senator Back. We know all the promises. We know all the bulldust that gets sprayed around in every set of estimates. We get up there and we ask the same questions: when are you going to get a Bobcat and start turning over some soil, and when are we going to get graders in and when are we going to start building these huge infrastructure projects that you are good at talking about but do not deliver?


One can only say this, in all fairness: it is a well-known, proven fact, when it comes to infrastructure, that the previous, Labor, government was a leader of the pack, under the great leadership of the transport and planning minister, Anthony Albanese—Albo, as we all know him. What a leader. I have to tell you: I was at the Safety Summit the other day and I was listening to Albo speak and I am still inspired that the man has been in parliament for as long as he has and still has the passion for infrastructure, still has the passion for public transport, and absolutely has a passion for road safety. And I cannot wait for the next Labor government, because when we get in we will continue to invest heavily in infrastructure projects. We will continue to invest heavily in public transport. We will not be as misleading and as silly and off with the fairies as the Greens are—just imagine: we are all going to put a sidecar on our pushbikes and squeeze a couple more Greens in on top of each other—we are going to be sensible about it. We understand that freight has to move around this nation. We understand that people have to move around this nation. We also understand that public transport has to be safe, it has to be reliable and it has to be up there with best practice. We know all that. We also know that whatever we do we have to integrate all the facets of transport. It has to line up. And we do not go off into fairyland at elections and make all these weird promises and then come up with, 'Oh, sorry; we can't do it.'


So, Senator Smith, thank you so much for giving me the opportunity on this side of the chamber to actually correct some of the wrongs that you did espouse—and some of the language was a little—there was a little bit of argy-bargy, because I quite enjoy listening to Senator Smith, because he is a very intelligent person; there is absolutely no doubt about that. But he cannot fool those of us on this side of the chamber, who actually understand infrastructure, understand the need to move freight safely and to move it as sustainably as we can—




Senator Smith:
  I don't think that's what we—




Senator STERLE:
  So, thank you. On that, I would just make this very clear: we have a proven track record on the Labor side. No-one can even try to pretend that it is Labor that does not build public transport infrastructure, and we recognise that we have to move people around this nation safely. 


Senator Back is jumping at the gate to make a contribution. He is like a greyhound. I was at the Dapto dogs the other night, when I put that $20 on the dud.




Senator Back:
  You should have backed me, son!




Senator STERLE:
  If he was jumping at the gate like Senator Back is, I would have been able to take the kids out for tea on Saturday night. But, on that note, I thank the Senate for its time and I shall now disappear off into the ether and see you next Monday.

"Back, Sen Chris",LP,2017-02-09,"



Senator BACK
 (Western Australia) (16:42):  And what a disappointment it is that Senator Sterle is going to leave us, because I was going to refer to some comments of the then secretary of the Transport Workers Union Western Australia in regard to the performance of one Alannah MacTiernan and her role as transport minister. And of course—before he leaves—that official was none other than now Senator Glenn Sterle. But I will not be addressing that for some time, Senator Sterle, so, if you are on your way then you might as well go on your way, because it is going to be about 10 minutes into my contribution before I actually get to roll that one out again.


In 2008 I was a candidate in the state election for the seat of Alfred Cove. And do you know that the Labor premier was Mr Carpenter? We did not have a leader, as Senator Smith knows. Troy Buswell was on his way. Colin Barnett had made a decision to retire, and he came back in. And the complete program that we ran: do you know what we actually said to the people of Western Australia by way of launching our campaign? We said, 'Name us five things that Labor has done in government.' And do you know, they could not: the people of Western Australia could not name five things Labor had done in government. Now, Senator Smith sits here, and if I am wrong I ask him to stand up and correct me. Why did we end up winning the election? It was for two reasons. First of all, nobody could name what Labor had done in government. It is true what Senator Sterle says—that they retained their AAA credit rating—because they did not do anything.


The second thing was that Mr Carpenter at the time, the Premier of the state, had within his right to control and nominate the date of the election. He could have said, 'It's going to be on Saturday, 9 or 10 February 2009,' but did he? No. Why? I will tell you why: he was an opportunist. He knew his government had achieved nothing in his time or that of his predecessor, with the exception, I will say, of then minister MacTiernan, a competent minister. I agreed with the statements that the then Secretary of the Transport Workers Union, Mr Glenn Sterle, said about Alannah MacTiernan: that she was competent and she achieved something, but she was the only one in their government that did. So what did Mr Carpenter do? Believing in the chaos that he thought existed in our party, he called the election for the middle of September 2008, thinking he would get us offside. He got one thing right, and that was Labor had twice the amount of money that we had. But what poor old Alan Carpenter forgot to take into account was that the first two weeks of the campaign were the Beijing Olympic Games, during which time whatever message went out from Mr Carpenter was buried in the euphoria. Not even his strategist, Mr Jim McGinty, knew that Alan Carpenter was going to go to that early election, so by the time the games were finished, the game was on. We both had the same amount of money.


Colin Barnett had gathered us together. He is a man of enormous integrity. He had had years in government, in opposition, as Minister for State Development, as Minister for Resources Development. When I was chief executive of Rottnest Island, he was my minister for tourism, which is where I first came to understand the intellect of the man and, I must say, his intolerance for fools. Senator Smith and I would both agree that one of Colin's weaknesses is that not only is he highly intolerant of fools but he has a bit of difficulty in concealing it. I was talking to him the other day and I reminded him of a campaign. Mr Ben Morton, the now member for Tangney, was the new state director for that campaign. Coming from eastern Australia—now he is a confirmed Western Australian, fortunately—he had not been there five minutes, but he had woken up to the fact that Labor had done nothing in government, and he ran the campaign. I said to Colin Barnett the other day, 'Colin, if we asked people today—whether they like you or not, whether they like the Liberal Party or not—to name 20 things you've done in government, I tell you what, they would get RSI writing out the number of things that the Barnett government has achieved.'


Poor old Senator Sterle is going to go now, but I am going to get to his comments about Alannah MacTiernan in her time when I speak about the Roe 8and Roe 9 campaigns. But one of the very first things Barnett did was the undergrounding of the railway. You remember, Senator Smith, that they had talked for about 100 years about undergrounding of the railway in the centre of Perth. Who did it? Barnett. Did it cost? The benefit to the city has been the sale of the land on top of that area and the reconnection of the city with the area to the north.


You know, Acting Deputy President Bernardi, and I think those in the gallery know, that you incur debt in this world. We all have debt. We incur a debt to buy a home. We might incur a debt to buy a car. But there are two types of debt. There is debt that creates assets and there is debt that damns you in liabilities. In my contribution, thanking Senator Gallagher for the opportunity this afternoon, I intend on alerting the wider community to the miserable circumstances that the Labor governments of Mr Rudd, Ms Gillard and Mr Rudd left this country as a result of the squandering of what was a surplus handed to them on a silver platter, not through the debt from the creation of assets that create you further wealth, but the debt that damns you to the $360 billion that we inherited from Mr Rudd in 2013. But those of you that need to get a handkerchief in the gallery need to know this. It is not so much the debt that is costing you today and restricting our ability to do a lot of things we talk about; it is the fact that we are borrowing from overseas $400 million a day, or $1.2 billion a month.


Now you would think, 'Oh well, if Australia's doing that to pay the debt back, isn't that a good idea?' But no, as Senator Smith knows—he has cried out over this—we are not paying the $1.2 billion a month on the debt repayment; we are paying it to pay the interest on the debt. The $1.2 billion a month, the $400 million a day, 30 days of every month goes down the gurgler like it does if you have a credit card debt: you must pay. If you have a mortgage on your home, you know you have to pay the interest, and that is where we find ourselves in this country today. Mr Costello, who inherited a $96-billion debt from the previous government of Mr Keating—typical of Labor governments—said to me one day, 'Chris, when we paid the $96 billion back, we had $6 billion then that used to go out in interest that we could now put back into the Australian economy.' Incidentally, he did not sell anything. He did not sell any Australia Posts to pay back the $96 billion; he just did it through economic rigidity and stability.


Imagine that $1.2 billion a month today. Imagine if we had $15 billion or $16 billion that we could put back into services. I will tell you what that $1.2 billion equates to. It equates to the new Perth Children's Hospital, which Mr Barnett has just finished. That is one lousy month's interest on the debt. The Fiona Stanley Hospital that Mr Barnett has built—arguably, in the words of doctors I have spoken to in recent days, the most modern hospital in the world—is about six weeks interest on the debt. Do you know that we could be building two new primary schools a day, seven days a week, if we were not repaying that interest on the debt?


That brings me not just to the Fiona Stanley Teaching Hospital and the new children's hospital that Premier Barnett has been responsible for—in the time Mr Barnett has been in government, there are no less than 37 new hospitals in the rural areas of WA, the ones that Senator Smith and I represent. They are in the Wheatbelt, the South West, the Great Southern, the Mid West and the Pilbara—in towns like Merredin, Northam and Narrogin new hospitals are being developed—23 small hospitals. And we are invited to think that the Barnett government has not done anything?


Let me tell you a little bit more about assets versus liabilities, because I am going to get onto the liabilities of the federal government, where they wasted your money. In a visionary manner, Colin Barnett has reclaimed the Swan River back up to the city. It had always been river. It was reclaimed and he has brought it back up to the city and created what is called Elizabeth Quay. So we have this absolutely world-leading capitalised facility now, right at the base of the city. All the critics said, '$440 million. What a shock. What a debt he has incurred in doing this—' in creating the most phenomenal facility. Did you know that the other day he sold the last block that is available as part of the commercial development and he already has $390 million of the $440 million back in the kick? That is what expenditure of money on assets creates.


Only recently did I have the pleasure, on behalf of the federal transport minister, to open a section of the Forrest Highway-Kwinana Freeway, right beside that Aubin Grove railway station that Senator Sterle was asking, 'Would it ever be built? Is it ever likely to be there?' It is bad luck that Senator Sterle does not perhaps get into those areas a bit more often, because it was right beside where our Minister Marmion and I opened the $120 million freeway. The Aubin Grove railway station is there; it is finished. But I was able to say proudly at that time how phenomenal it is that the Barnett government, with the support of federal funding, has completed the Great Eastern Highway extension out to the airport. It has completed the multibillion dollar Gateway road project around the international and domestic airports. It has built the Forrest Highway down into the south-west, down into our Margaret River-Dunsborough recreation areas, attendant upon all of the increased business in tourism, in mining and in agriculture. But I was also able to say that through the excellence of the combination of Western Australian and federal funding, each of those projects has been completed under budget, under time and if not superior to at least equal to the quality that was contracted for.


That is what the Barnett government is achieving in Western Australia. I was not always in favour of a new football stadium, but most Western Australians are. We looked at the beautiful facility they now have in the Adelaide football oval in South Australia when we looked at the old heap of garbage that exists at Subiaco Oval. Yes, some people do not always want every project. But, as I said to somebody the other day when he was complaining about the debt incurred, 'Mate, just tell me which project you did not want. Tell me about not wanting Elizabeth Quay. Tell me about roads to the north of the state you did not want. Tell me about roads that are now more safe. Tell me about hospitals and schools. And tell me all about those infrastructure projects you don't want.' And this joker said, 'Chris, I want every one of them.' That is the difficulty in today's world—so, yes, the Barnett government has incurred debt.


I now want to turn attention to where the Rudd/Gillard/Rudd governments incurred the debt that the Australian taxpayers will be paying back well beyond the time of their children and their grandchildren. Remember, Rudd came into government with no debt—the only country in the OECD that had no debt. No deficits; we were in surplus. We had $40 billion or $50 billion sitting in the bank earning interest. So, what did he do with that? Well, he chucked it out on $900 and $1,200 cheques. That was successful! People who had died got them; people in prison got them; backpackers back in Switzerland who had paid tax in the previous year got their $900 cheques; and my aged mother, wheelchair-bound in a nursing home, got both the $900 and $1,200 cheques. Do you know where most of the money went? We know this as a result of Senate inquiries and joint inquiries. It went into three main sources: drugs and alcohol, evidenced by the increase in accidents and emergencies at all of Australia's major hospitals on those two Friday nights; poker machines, as evidenced in evidence to us in the Mr Wilkie inquiry on mandatory pre-commitment; and, of course, Chinese TVs. That was the first great effort by the Rudd government.


Was any money spent on asset development, like exploration from mining, which might then actually lead to some more employment? No, no, no—no Labor government ever spends money on asset creation! What was next? Next was the Gillard memorial halls. I chaired the Education, Employment and Workplace Relations Committee at that time, and for my sins I was for nine years on the Catholic Education Commission of Western Australia, so I know a little bit about spending Commonwealth government moneys, because the Commonwealth gives the independent and Catholic schools money, and we spend that money down to the last dollar, because it is so rare to get it. But we sat there and watched the states like New South Wales—not so much Victoria, because they had the sense not to spend the money initially, and that was fairly unusual because the whole purpose of giving it to them was to create an economic activity. Victoria did not do the spending but at least they did not waste as much money. The other states all did. So it was about $13 billion or $14 billion on the Gillard memorial halls.


Moving on, there was the $2.8 billion of the pink batts—do you remember that? There were people going up and down streets saying, 'We put pink batts there, there, there and there,' and they sent in the bill and the Labor government paid the bill. The unfortunate thing was that four young people, I think, regrettably were killed as a result of the dereliction in terms of oversight of those young people in roofs. People were saying, 'No.' When it all came out and there was a royal commission, they went back and said, 'We better go back and address ourselves.' Officers knocked on doors and they said, 'Oh, Mrs Fognucklevitch, we're here to check on the pink batts for which the Australian taxpayer paid $1,600 to some charlatan.' And Mrs Fognucklevitch said, 'Nobody's been to my home to put in pink batts.' That was $2.8 billion, plus the other costs associated with further compensation.


We know, of course, there was the infamous mining tax. Some of us from the west actually know a bit about the mining industry. And to give him credit, the then shadow minister, Mathias Cormann, stood up here and said to the now Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Senator Wong, again and again: 'You will make no money out of the mining tax. It'll be the first ever tax which is going to cost you more than you'll get back.' And indeed that happened. That was a bit more expenditure on liabilities. We also had the carbon tax offsets that went up in smoke. We had the Green Loans scheme, another $175 million. You see? That is the difference between a Barnett government and a Labor government. A Barnett government, with the assistance of a coalition government in Canberra, will spend its resources and those of the Australian taxpayer on assets, whereas a Labor government will squander them—your money; not government money, but your money.


I conclude my contribution with the Roe Highway, going through an area very close to where I live and where my electorate office exists—Roe 8 and Roe 9. I did mention many years ago that this project should have been completed. But a then state Labor government, with then minister Ms Alannah MacTiernan and the local member for Fremantle at the time, Mr Jim McGinty, decided that they would put a spoke in the wheel. They rezoned the land as residential and they started selling it. I said—I promised—that the biggest critic at the time from a heavy transport point of view was none other than a person I regard as a personal friend, the highly respected Senator Glenn Sterle, who was the secretary of the Transport Workers Union in WA at that time. He resoundingly criticised Ms MacTiernan.


So here we are today building Roe 8 and Roe 9, a project mainly funded out of federal government funds because Infrastructure Australia has concurred how critically important that project is—one that will add immeasurably to safety and one that will cut down on travelling time. And, yes, the heavy industry will pay a little bit of a toll. Residential cars will not pay a toll, but the trucking industry will pay a bit in consideration of the enormous savings they will make. I can only thank Senator Gallagher for the opportunity to highlight why Western Australians must re-elect a Barnett-led government.

Senator LINES
 (Western Australia—Deputy President and Chair of Committees) (17:03):  I know that Senator Back and Senator Smith work very hard. They are on a number of Senate committees and they are from Western Australia. Most of you in this chamber know that it is a long flight and as senators we often are on the trot for three or four days in a row when we do our committee work. I can only conclude the fact that they have this bizarre idea of what is happening in Western Australia, looking at Mr Barnett through rose-coloured glasses, because they have been out of the state for quite some time because nothing they have said today is actually accurate. Senator Back was within the last seconds of his speech before he mentioned public transport. And do you know why, Mr Acting Deputy President Ketter? Because Mr Barnett's track record and, indeed, Mr Turnbull's track record—and, before him, Mr Abbott's track record—on public transport spending in WA is zero. They have done nothing. In fact, Liberal governments in WA have a history of broken promise after broken promise and of even closing down train lines.


The motion before us today is the failure of the Turnbull government to invest in public transport infrastructure across Australia. Senator Smith and Senator Back focused on Western Australia because Colin Barnett is in big trouble. He is the most unpopular Premier of all time. The other point that Senator Back talked about was—he tried to slip the West Australian debt under the carpet. The West Australian debt is so big, is so large and is so frightening you could not sweep it under anything if you tried. It is currently at $41 billion, all incurred by the Barnett government—every single cent of that. That is the legacy Mr Barnett will leave when he is swept out of office on 11 March. No wonder Senator Back and Senator Smith did not mention public transport, because it is a sorry story. Certainly it could be called, like Roe 8, a road to nowhere. That could be the mantra of the Turnbull government followed by a failure of the WA Barnett government in any kind of investment, whether it is road investment or public transport investment.


I want to put my bona fides on the table. This is my SmartRider card. I am a user of public transport in Western Australia, public transport that has, in the main, been put in place by Labor governments. Let me just go over the records of the Turnbull and, indeed, the Barnett governments. I want to start with Ellenbrook, which sits in the state seat of Swan Hills—there is a fabulous Labor candidate there by the name of Jess Shaw—but also sits in the federal seat of Pearce, which is held by Mr Christian Porter. Mr Christian Porter well and truly takes that seat for granted—I have never seen him at Ellenbrook—and his margin during the federal election was halved. Is it any wonder? Ellenbrook is not a new development, although there are still housing developments going up there; it has been around for quite some time and it is completely isolated as a suburb of Perth. Mr Barnett, when he came into power, made big promises—'We'll get a train line out to Ellenbrook'—copying the commitments that Labor had given. He was forced to follow on with that commitment.


To get to Ellenbrook, you have to go on very narrow old roads that once upon a time would not have been used very much, because Ellenbrook is adjacent to a pine forest and sits in what was formerly fairly rural land. We created this development, but sadly that is all we did. We developed housing development after housing development. There are two roads into Ellenbrook, single lane all the way. There are a number of roundabouts on those single-lane roads. Believe me: on the times that I have been out to Ellenbrook, it does not matter what time of the day you go out there. The tailbacks coming off those roundabouts are disgraceful.


So Mr Barnett, in a great flurry, said, 'Yes, yes, yes, I'll build a rail line to Ellenbrook.' Within six weeks of winning government, he had completely reneged on that promise. Some time later, he said he would do a fast transit lane out there. I am not quite sure how he was going to put a fast transit lane in on roads which are predominantly single lane, but anyone who has been stuck on Lord Street or the other roads leading out to Ellenbrook will just laugh at that commitment. But guess what: he did not even deliver that. That got cancelled quickly. Then he promised Ellenbrook, a fast-growing suburb, a high school. That has gone by the wayside as well.


I just want to share with you a story from a woman called Tiffany who lives in Ellenbrook, about the daily battle that she has to endure as she travels to work, because her only option is to use her car or sit on a bus—but that would equally mean getting caught up in the chaos of that single road in and out of Ellenbrook. She is an education assistant, and she travels from Ellenbrook to Redcliffe. That is similar to the journey that I do. I live in the adjoining suburb to Redcliffe, so I know the sorts of trials and tribulations that Tiffany endures. With only two roads leading in and out of Ellenbrook, the outcome of her drive to work is always the same: slow, long and irritating. The 48-kilometre journey takes up to two hours. This is not Western Sydney; this is Western Australia—Perth. It amounts to more than $200 every fortnight in fuel, and this is for an education assistant whose hourly rate is probably around $26. Sadly, this is not an uncommon story among Ellenbrook residents, and that is why so many of them want a rail line. Over the past nine years, the Barnett Liberal government has broken promise after promise on local transport to Ellenbrook. In 2008 it was the Ellenbrook rail line, and then it was the fast transit lane. Of course, all Tiffany wants to do is reduce her two-hour car journey to and from work every day.


Ellenbrook is so isolated. I will just say again that we have pine plantations at the western end and fairly rural communities around Ellenbrook. There was a very bad fire there in 2013, in the Gnangara pine plantations, and guess what: residents were unable to evacuate because those two roads became so congested with people trying to leave. But that did not spark Mr Barnett into action to keep his promise. He completely broke that promise to the voters of Ellenbrook, and they will remember that. I have to say that Mr Porter, as the federal member and a member of the Turnbull government, has also not been banging on the door and saying to the Prime Minister, 'We need to do something in Ellenbrook.'


But it does not stop there. That is the story of Ellenbrook. The other story, of course, is the MAX light rail project, another pie in the sky idea from the Barnett government. They were going to build a MAX light rail system that went across the north of the city. Great promises were made about the MAX light rail. It was going to ease city congestion. It was going to be wonderful. They promised that it would happen. Well, guess what: another broken promise, and that promise did not even have any funds committed from the federal government, because Mr Abbott, when he was Prime Minister, made it very clear that the Abbott government was not going to commit those funds to the MAX light rail project.


You might want to forgive the federal government for reneging on that. You might even want to forgive Mr Barnett for failing to invest in public transport into Ellenbrook or, indeed, public transport across the northern suburbs of Perth. But it does not stop there; it just goes on and on and on. This is a Liberal Party, as I said, with a history of closing rail lines. Under Mr Court they closed the Fremantle line. Who in their right mind would close the rail line from Perth to Fremantle? Well, the Liberals did it under Mr Court.


I used to live in the suburb of Byford. We had a rail link to Byford that I used to use as a young mum with two kids. There was a train twice a day. In those days, when my children were small, Byford was a very long way out, in the outer metropolitan area, and they closed that line. Now Byford is going to be another Ellenbrook unless something is done to make public transport accessible out there. Byford, a little bit like Ellenbrook, was formerly on the outskirts of the city, with lots of dairy farms. Those have now all been subdivided, so there is booming development in Byford, in those former dairy paddocks, and guess what: Mr Barnett has not provided one ounce of public transport. We will have another Ellenbrook on our hands if we are not careful.


Young people in Ellenbrook are trapped there on the weekends, with nothing to do. Students in Ellenbrook have to move closer to the city if they want to go to university, because, just as Tiffany travels each day for two hours to her workplace in Redcliffe, if you were going to university from Ellenbrook, your journey would probably be three hours by car. And goodness knows how long it would be if you had to use what limited public transport there is, because Mr Barnett and Mr Turnbull have absolutely failed to invest any money in public transport. 


In Byford, there is this new development sitting on the former dairy farms. They have some of the largest primary school. With the development, every week, if you go out there along the Thomas Road, there are more and more houses, with more and more people moving out there because it is affordable. But there is no public transport.


I know that Mark McGowan, the Labor leader in Western Australia, has invested in public transport, and he has pledged to reopen the Byford line. You would not think that would be such a hard commitment to make. All the line infrastructure is still there because the trains that go down to Bunbury still use that line. It is not as if it has fallen into disrepair. It is perfectly able to be used. The trains go as far as Armadale, and Byford is the next stop. But there has been nothing from Mr Barnett. He does not have the foresight to do anything because he does not believe in public transport, and neither does the Turnbull government, so no commitments are being made there. If the Barnett government is re-elected, which I have to say at this stage there are very long odds against, the people of Byford will be left high and dry. 


But it does not stop there. Belmont is a suburb adjoining mine. Yesterday in here I reported on the sudden closure of the Medicare office. It was closed by the Turnbull government—no notice, nothing. Belmont is a suburb that has a high population of people over the age of 70 and a higher than average population of families. If they need a full-service Medicare office, if they need to talk face-to-face with a person, they have to go to Cannington, 8.5 kilometres away. Guess what? There is no direct transport link. Once again, that is an absolute failure by Liberal governments. Both Mr Turnbull and Mr Barnett are failing to invest.


As a mum with kids or as a dad with kids, if you need to go and do face-to-face work with the Medicare office in Cannington, you could either make a two-bus journey or—wait for it—you could do two buses and a train. That is to travel 8.5 kilometres. What a joke. They are almost adjoining suburbs, yet you have to take this indirect route, round and round the tree, to travel 8.5 kilometres. Even if people have a car at their disposal, as certainly some of the senior Australians I spoke to do—who were very disgusted by the Turnbull government closing this Medicare office, on Medicare's birthday last week, I might add—they do not want to travel those 8.5 kilometres in their cars because, given that the public transport options are so bad, where you have the choice between a two-bus journey or a two-bus plus a train journey, the road is heavily congested. The roads between Belmont and Cannington are heavily congested because people have no option other than to get in their cars, just to travel 8.5 kilometres.


Let us look at the sort of investment Mr Turnbull or Mr Barnett have made in the seat of Belmont, which, again, sits in the federal seat of Swan, the seat that I live in: zilch. In fact, the big joke is that, time after time, the member for Swan tries to take credit for the Gateway project around the airport, which we all know was a Labor project, and he tries to take credit for the upgrade of the Great Eastern Highway, which again was a Labor investment—so much so that, during the federal election, when the member for Swan made these incorrect pronouncements once again, his own state Liberal members said, 'Actually, no, that was the Labor government that put those in place.' So we have this pretence going on that, somehow, the Turnbull government is interested in infrastructure in Western Australia. It is not. It has not spent a cent on public transport infrastructure in Western Australia, and all we have seen from Mr Barnett is failure, and broken promise after broken promise, on public transport.


Finally, there is, we think—we think; we do not know—a link being built out to the airport. I heard Senator Rice speak earlier about the embarrassment of Melbourne not having a train, and I agree with her; we should have a train out to our airport in Melbourne. Until recently, we did not even have a bus service out to the international airport in Western Australia, so, if you were a visitor and you wanted to use public transport, sorry, but you have to pay for a taxi, a private car or a private bus. For the last six months, we have had one bus going out to the airport, but it does this almost circular route, so you probably need to allow about two hours for your journey. That has been the sole public transport option delivered by the Barnett government in Western Australia. As for the airport link, I will not hold my breath. I will not hold my breath, because Mr Barnett has made a commitment for beyond his term of government about what might happen out at the airport in terms of trains. So I am not holding my breath on that one, because that could well be a white elephant in the unlikely event that the Barnett government gets re-elected, because you can only break promises so many times before people see you as just a complete waste, someone who squandered the boom and who racked up a $41 billion debt all of his own making—all his own making, nothing to do with Labor. That absolutely lies at the feet of Colin Barnett. It scares me as a Western Australian that we have this massive debt. It really does.


Labor has a plan for public transport, a plan for jobs, a plan for building train carriages locally and a plan for local jobs. Mr Barnett has nothing. He has a history of broken promises. He does not deserve to be re-elected on 11 March, and, certainly, at this rate he will not be.

"O'Sullivan, Sen Barry",Nats,2017-02-09,"



Senator O'SULLIVAN
 (Queensland) (17:22):  Before I start my contribution on this motion I cannot help but reflect on the final presentation by Senator Lines, who clutching her heart indicated that she was scared about the debt of Western Australia of $41 billion. I do not know where she got her fright from, but it was not Western Australia. It might have had something to do with the $320 billion that you yoked the neck of this nation with when Labor were in power. I have no idea why she is frightened of a little tree snake in WA when she left a dirty, big mongrel python crawling around in this part of the nation. I promised myself that I was going to make a quiet and constructive contribution, but this hypocrisy gets to me eventually.


I do not often point out to the Australian Labor Party where they have gone wrong, but I do want to give them some advice on drafting these motions. When I read this motion in my office I thought that finally the Australian Labor Party wanted to have a discussion with us about infrastructure and public transport. I have not seen any sign of it in the last couple of years. We come into question time time and time again—and I am noted for interjecting on this subject and calling out: 'Are you going to talk about education? Infrastructure? Are you going to ask us a question about health?' But I get no, no and no.


So here is my advice for you. When you drafted this motion you should have said, 'That the Senate condemns the failure of the Turnbull government to invest in public transport in marginal seats in Western Australia.' You forgot to put in the motion 'marginal seats in Western Australia'. Here is what was a bit of a clue for me. I came in here and saw the speakers list and saw that every Labor contribution was to come from a Western Australian senator. I scratched my noggin and wondered why that would be so. I am a bit slow on things, but then it dawned on me that there must be a state election in the west.


In the contribution by Senator Lines she drew the boundaries around suburbs. This was not a general question. This was not a reflection across the nation. She went street by street, if you listened very carefully. I say, as I lead into my contribution on this, that that is a complete abuse of this place. It is a complete abuse that the Labor Party would engineer to devote the time of this Senate to direct politicking in a state election campaign in their home state. You need to be condemned for it.




Senator Moore:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, I have a point of order. It is a point of order in terms of just some advice back to Senator O'Sullivan. If he reflected on the previous contributions in this debate by the Western Australian Liberal senators, he would understand that there were a wide range of contributions in this debate.




Senator O'SULLIVAN:
  Through you, Mr Acting Deputy President, I let Senator Moore know that just because I have given her some advice she does not need to give me any. It would be no surprise for the government to send in qualified individuals from the state of Western Australia to rebut the falsehoods expressed by Labor senators from that state. I am going to leave that where it is because I will not be denied the chance to lay down the fantastic work of this government in the field of public transport and infrastructure. I am best qualified in my home state of Queensland and I want to talk about that.


I see Senator Dastyari there. If I were to ask to him: what is the RAAP? I bet him a carton of anything he drinks that he cannot answer that question. I will sit silently if he wants to take a point of order and win a carton of Dom Perignon or whatever it is Labor people drink. I can tell you that it is the Regional Aviation Access Program. For all of my National Party colleagues here this is a significantly important program. In this program the Australian government provides targeted support for aerodrome infrastructure and air services to remote areas. 


Why is that important? Because if you people who come from the cities get a bit crook you can take a cab, take a bus, get an ambulance or even get a helicopter to land on the park opposite you if you want. There are so many choices of modes of transport that you have to get yourself from point A to point B. Our people, particularly those in the more rural and remote areas of the country, have to rely on air services. It might take them 15 to 20 times longer to get themselves into care or to go about the general business that they need to do. This support keeps these aerodromes open for that public transport and publicly subsidised private transport. In Queensland $140 million is spent in supporting the provision of public transport by private sector providers. This is incredibly important funding.


Your motion says that the Turnbull government has failed, but that is an absolute nonsense. Not only are these public services funded and supported but there is support for the aerodromes and all the infrastructure that goes with them that enables them to operate. This is the lifeblood for these communities of ours. Fresh food, mail, educational materials, medicines and other urgent supplies come via these simple routes. I can promise you this: whatever you may think of us in the National Party, if the government that we were involved in and that we had influence in was not doing the right thing about investing in the sorts of infrastructure and public transport needs of our people in the bush, we would be squealing here like stuck pigs all day—12 hours a day and four days a week—when the Senate sits. That is all we would talk about. But we are not doing that because we are a part of a government that understands the essential needs for so many Australians who do not live in postcodes that end with three noughts.


This scheme currently subsidises a regular air service to 260 remote communities. You want to talk about this government supporting public transport? We subsidise regular air services to 260 remote communities. Do know why that is important? It is because they do not have any other choice. There are no bicycle pathways—hundreds of millions of dollars have been spent around the nation putting in bicycle pathways—and you cannot walk under the street light to get from where you are to where you need to be. You cannot even ring a near friend. Your nearest friend could be 200 or 300 kilometres away. There are just so many things that the Labor members in this place take for granted, because they are all locked and embedded in the metropolitan high-population areas, and their lives have always been like that. Their lives have been lived through a trade union movement for the most part, where they spend their time taking something off someone else. They do not know how to deliver it themselves. They have never employed anybody. Honestly, if a Labor person over there put their hand in their pocket to pay a wage it was because they were reaching for the consolidated revenue of some organisation they were working for. There are no business people, no farmers and no people from the bush over there. Labor people come in here to try and lecture us about the government that we are a part of not supporting public transport and all the infrastructure that underpins it. I must say that I take some offence to that. Eighty-six of these locations are Indigenous communities, with the balance being primarily cattle stations—that is what it is. Our people are making their land available—their own private assets—for services to be delivered to their regional communities—no charge. 'Let's build and maintain a light airstrip at property No. 1 and all the people who live in the district, within a couple of hundred kilometres, can utilise it for services that are supported by our government.'


Then, of course, there is this Remote Airstrip Upgrade Program. It is a competitive merit-based grants program where there is some flexibility to relax the co-funding requirements for projects if they happen to be in priority Indigenous communities. These are people who cannot get out of these places unless we have subsidised public transport opportunities. I can tell you and report to this place—I keep a close eye on this and I keep a close ear out, and I know my colleagues from New South Wales do the same—that I do not have one complaint to make.


At my end of town, in Queensland, I am happy with what this government has done. We can always do more, and we continually push for more or less increases in services, not the establishment of them. I have been around for a while now—in my adult life I have been involved in politics for nearly 35 years—and there are two things I can tell you about the Australian Labor Party without fear of contradiction, and this is what makes it so offensive when they come in here with these things. First, they cannot manage an economy. They are good at so many things and the Labor movement is made up of so many decent people—honest people and true warriors for their ideology—but they cannot manage an economy. Second, they have no interest in rural Australia. Not only do they have no interest in rural Australia but they also do not understand rural Australia. They did not understand when our government invested $10 billion to upgrade the Bruce Highway in my home state of Queensland. That was the biggest single infrastructure commitment in the history of the Commonwealth government, but not by the Labor Party. The Labor Party had been in power for six or seven years beforehand and not a red razoo was committed or promised to the Bruce Highway upgrade. We then came to power and spent $10 billion, which, over a period of time, will enhance the movement of public transport and subsidised transport up and down the eastern seaboard of my home state of Queensland.


This Remote Air Services Subsidy Scheme that we talk about provides 366 remote communities in isolated Australia with improved access through the subsidy of delivery of regular air transport services by the private sector. Do you want to talk about the public sector? Do you want to talk about how you can walk out of your house and ring Uber, ring a cab or walk over the road and get a train every three minutes? All of these things are what you, my colleagues on the other side, take completely for granted living in the city and in the metros. Our people are lucky to have a service a week, and they would not have that if this government did not heavily subsidised these 366 communities not just in the movement of people passengers but also in the movement of freight—the essentials of life in many cases. You go down and get your bottle of fresh milk. That is not available to our people in the bush.


This investment by our government is not just simply about subsidising public transport and making sure that we subsidise and support the maintenance of hundreds of airstrips—I imagine across the country there is well over a thousand 'aerodromes', as they were called—but it is also about other infrastructure programs. I have just talked to you about the Bruce Highway. I will talk now about the Toowoomba Second Range Crossing. If anybody from Longreach—and if you are familiar with our state, just close your eyes and imagine about half the land mass of the state of Queensland—wants to use subsidised public transport with buses and a range of other methods, they have to come down. They have to get efficiently from where they are to where they are going. That is why this government has invested about another $2.5 billion in things like the range crossing and the upgrade of the Warrego Highway. So it is unfair, and in fact quite hypocritical, for the Labor Party to come out and talk about the failure of the Turnbull government to invest in public transport infrastructure.


Every time I speak I am going to ensure that I bring to everyone's attention this feature of the Australian Labor Party: they are like an organ-grinder's monkey—I could put in ear plugs, move my lips and tell you what they are saying. They come in here and get this whine up and we hear this big shrill noise—it is complete and absolute negativity. There is not one positive element, not one alternative option. We heard Senator Lines—she went street by street, crescent by crescent. If I closed my eyes I could almost make the journey. I do not know where it is but I have an image in my mind now that if you turn left and go down there past the medical centre, you get to the end and turn right—no grids to cross, just four-lane bitumen roads. There was not one word from her, or in any of the other contributions today, about what the alternative would be; nothing about what Labor would do. There is a reason for that—Labor made some monstrous commitments during the election and reflected on commitments that they said they had done, but of course they made the statements, they made the promises, but they did not make provision in the budget and the budget forecasts, in forward estimates, to pay for the projects. 


I heard the Greens senator lament the inability of the Victorian government to provide some public transport infrastructure out to the airport. For goodness sake, this is the same government that tore up $1 billion—that is what it had to pay contractors when it abandoned its biggest major project in recent decades in the state of Victoria. I wish Senator Lines were here because I would yield some of my time for her to answer me: what could you build for $1 billion? Could you have put a public transport corridor, a rail corridor, from the city for these visitors out to the Melbourne airport? I think the answer is clear—I think the answer is yes. 


We just have this unfolding hypocrisy. I do not know what structure there is with our friends across the other side, but someone has just had a little brain thought: 'We've got a Western Australian election, we will have a statement and we will conceal it as if it is generally for Australia but then we'll have a series of speakers and we will not mention anywhere in Australia except in marginal Labor state seats in Western Australia. That is the hypocrisy. There is a reason they do not stand on their record; there is a reason they do not say to us that 'Turnbull and company have not done this but we have done that,' and the reason is that they did not do that. We watch this vulnerability here all the time, particularly at question time, when they want to talk about defence spending. My colleagues would have noticed over recent weeks and months that they do not ask questions on defence spending any more, because they were tired of being struck in the middle of the forehead with the fact that in six years under a Labor government they never spent a zack. It is for that very reason that they do not stand on their record when they come up with these crazy, crazy motions like this one here today. There is not one mention from any of their speakers about what they have done. Not one significant project was heralded, and particularly not in regional and provincial Australia. They have never been out there. They do not know of the need for public transport in Roma because they have never been to Roma and they do not care—that is not where their people are; that is not where the CFMEU is based. They do not care about my country communities. We hear the view that there is no public transport and no support, but I read out all the programs that we support—260 remote communities, 360 airport services subsidised—and I am sure that if there are any more contributions from the other side they will not recognise that. They will not say one single thing about the description provided by this side of the chamber of the incredible investment that has been made by the Turnbull government, and indeed the coalition since we came to power. There is a lot of catch-up, a lot of investment in things that should have been done years ago. We can stand here for the next hour and talk about the projects, we can talk about the funding, but the facts are there; they are on the public record and they cannot be disputed. Yet we listened to Labor speaker after Labor speaker after Labor speaker and not once did they either put on the record what they themselves have done or offer any alternatives to their whingeing. We have done all this with the legacy of a $300 billion debt. We have done all this with a legacy of structural deficits that we are still struggling to get under control. We have had to do that because all those projects that they even put in in pencil had no money in the forward estimates. I do not intend to sit quietly while the Labor Party comes along and lectures my government in relation to matters of public transport infrastructure when we have such a sterling record to date in very difficult circumstances.

"Roberts, Sen Malcolm",PHON,2017-02-09,"



Senator ROBERTS
 (Queensland) (17:43):  I want to make four points. In the Pauline Hanson's One Nation party we are strong supporters of the need to invest in infrastructure—infrastructure of all kinds that becomes productive and adds to our wealth. But I am very doubtful about this Labor motion. As a 17-year-old I can remember Gough Whitlam saying at the end of his first year that he had spent $50 million on Aboriginal people in Australia, and he proudly boasted that that was double the expenditure of the last 12 months of the previous government under William McMahon. He implied that by spending more it benefited the people. We see now that that welfare, according to many Aboriginal people, has effectively hurt Aboriginal communities. So the spending of money does not necessarily translate into beneficial spending or investing in people or infrastructure. It is the quality of spending of taxpayer funds that matters, not the quantity. That means we need cost-benefit analysis to justify any expenditure, and what I have seen in the brief period that I have been here—three months—is that there is very little, if any, cost-benefit analysis used. Quite often we see spending used as window-dressing to promote fantasies, to promote propaganda and to promote reputations. That is the first point: spending does not necessarily translate into effective spending.


The second point I raise is that competitive federalism is at the heart of our Constitution. The states are responsible for transport and transport infrastructure. Unfortunately, we have gone so far away from our Constitution that competitive federalism is dying. The Commonwealth has made a mess of education. The Commonwealth has made a mess of health and a mess of the environmental stewardship. Those are just to name a few. We need to give back taxation to the states and let them be responsible for spending, and then we will have far greater accountability—instead of the Commonwealth raising all the funds. We need to restore our Constitution.


This reminds me of a very effective mayor that I met recently while travelling in south-west outback Queensland. Tyson Golder, from the Maranoa Regional Council, is the mayor at Roma. He became mayor on a ticket of handing the power back to the councils, back to the local shires, and that is difficult under the state government laws. But that is something he is working on. He has councillors who have their positions as a result of the amalgamation, so they are hanging onto the power. Nonetheless, we need to do what he is doing—taking the regional council and sending the decisions back to the people in the shire councils. We need to do the same—take what is currently used at the federal government level and move it back to the states. Of course, the federation was formed with the idea of protecting the smaller states that cannot raise the funds. That is a legitimate need, and that has to be addressed, but we need to restore responsibility and accountability in the state governments and let them fund.


The third point I want to make is that South Australia and Victoria now illustrate what is happening under the 'spend, spend, spend without accountability' reputation of these states. The lights have gone out in South Australia, and the last thing we need is a Commonwealth government to bail them out. Now we are talking about massive federal control, or federal oversight, over energy, which is the last thing we need. Queensland has the world's best and cleanest coal, and yet the Palaszczuk government, another Labor government, is shutting down the coal industry. It refuses to invest in coal-fired power stations when we need that. It is the cheapest and most reliable form of electricity, the most stable and the most secure, and the Palaszczuk government, sitting on a treasure-trove of coal, will not use it. We have seen the South Australian Labor government dynamite their last coal-fired power station and shut down their coalmines. We have seen them rely on Victoria, yet Victoria now wants to shut down its Hazelwood plant, so then everyone from South Australia and Victoria will be needing power from Queensland and New South Wales, which will drive up our prices. We need to stop this stupidity, and we must not continue to subsidise stupid state behaviour, fraudulent and dishonest state behaviour, irresponsible state behaviour that is hurting the citizens of South Australia and Victoria.


We have seen Labor states spend money on desalination plants. This is my fourth point. Those plants, with the exception of one of them, have never been used. We have spent billions of dollars—I believe the figure is around $10 billion—and they have never been used. We have achieved nothing. That is not investment in the future; that is waste. If we do not get a return on our investment, if we have nothing to show for it, then we will go broke. But we will have the Greens parroting on about renewable energy and water from desalination plants that never materialises.


We need to fix the systems in this parliament to ensure accountability and to stop the waste of funding. Instead of speaking to sell, more politicians in this building need to listen to learn. Instead of using taxpayer funds as bidding on an auction for a reputation for votes, we need to restore accountability and cost-benefit analysis. We need to restore competitive federalism. We want productive spending that is investment, so I do not accept the Labor Party's motion that we need to increase spending. The Turnbull government, for all its many ills and shortcomings, cannot be labelled incompetent or lacking simply because it has not spent enough money in the Labor Party's eyes, because they are spendthrift eyes. I disagree with the Labor Party motion.

"Back, Sen Chris",LP,2017-02-09,"



Senator BACK
 (Western Australia) (17:56):  The Senate Select Committee on Wind Turbines reported to the Senate on 3 August in 2015. The government did not respond to the recommendations until 8 December 2016, some 16 months after the select committee had put its report into the Senate. That is exceedingly disappointing given the amount of work that was done.


In March 2016, the chair of the committee, Senator John Madigan, moved a motion signed by the crossbench members requesting the government response by 10 May 2016. Parliament was dissolved for the election, so that did not happen. On the first sitting day of this parliament, the 45th Parliament, on 30 August, Senator Leyonhjelm lodged a motion signed by every member of the new Senate crossbench asking the government to respond by 21 November 2016. So it is somewhat disappointing, then, that we have only just had the government's response now.


There were 491 submissions to the committee. The committee, under the chairmanship of then Senator Madigan and the deputy chairmanship of then Senator Day, held eight public hearings across Australia. An enormous amount of work was undertaken. I take this opportunity to thank all members of the community who wrote submissions and came forward to provide evidence. It was very, very emotional for many of them. In some instances submissions needed to remain confidential for people's personal safety. In fact, there were many, many witnesses who had great apprehension about appearing before the committee. Also, whilst I am thanking people, I take the opportunity to thank the secretariat for the work that they did.


There were 15 important recommendations in the report that addressed the ongoing issues associated with industrial wind turbines in Australia. I must say that they are recommendations that have remained without response until now. I am sure Senator Leyonhjelm will have his own comment to make on that as well.


During the time since we had the inquiry, we have seen the wheels come off the wagon of the renewable sector, particularly that which resides in industrial wind turbines. You do not have to think back too far—you only have to think back to this time yesterday when, as usual, in South Australia, where some 40 per cent of energy is now supplied by renewables if the wind blows, the wind did not blow, so South Australia suffered what probably might be its fifth blackout since August-September last year. At the time, in the minds of many people this particular issue was unimportant. In fact there was a degree of ridiculed associated with this inquiry, the conduct of it and the people who were appearing. I can assure you that the people of South Australia are not laughing today. They are very, very concerned about the circumstance of a state that cannot keep the lights on and cannot keep the power up: businesses losing staff, losing money and going to the wall. This is probably not the most important in terms of overall scale, but in the big blackout in the spring of 2016 they were so ill prepared in South Australia that the airport could not operate, hospitals could not operate, surgeons had to stop operating in theatres; but, worst of all, the Flinders Medical School, which held the frozen embryos and hopes of so many families in South Australia, could not keep up the power, and those frozen embryos were destroyed. I think that is a real personal indication of what we are talking about and the impact on families that occurred.


In the time left to me I want to focus on two of the recommendations. Recommendation 14 was:


The committee recommends that the Australian Government direct the Productivity Commission to conduct research into the impact of wind power electricity generation on retail electricity prices.


It has to be done. We are getting so much conflicting information from so many different sources around this country from those who support renewables, particularly industrial-wind-turbine-generated power, to those like me who do not, although I declare myself to be a strong supporter of renewable energy, for example through solar, tide, wave action and of course hydroelectricity. But it is the case that this analysis has not been done. We are 16 years into a renewable energy scheme and nobody knows the cost. 


We do know that the cost of subsidising industrial wind turbines is massive. As we draw closer to 2020 the shortfall charge payments could reach $1.5 billion a year, or more than $20 billion by 2030. Indeed, it is possible, if the policies of some of the governments of this country come into place, that we could be seeing a figure of $40 billion in cost by 2030. That is $1,600 for every man, woman and child in this country. I do not think consumers know that when a wind turbine generates electricity in this country they are paying $850,000 per wind turbine per year by way of subsidies. That is when they actually generate anything and sell any power. As I said, only yesterday we had a situation in which South Australia could not keep the lights on. The spot price for electricity hit $14,000 per megawatt hour. In any event the forward spot price for electricity in South Australia at the moment is $150 per megawatt hour, while it is only $50 in Victoria. But do not let the Victorians get any relief out of this, because their state Labor government, having made the decision to close coal-fired power stations, is also rushing towards a so-called renewable platform. I can tell them that they are rushing towards an absolute train wreck. A cost-benefit analysis of the effect of wind turbines has never been so important. The results will show that the nation, now and certainly should the federal Labor Party come to government and enact a 50 per cent renewable energy policy, is absolutely and utterly unsustainable.


The second recommendation to which I refer is recommendation 15:


The Renewable Energy Target should be amended so that all new investments in renewable energy between 2015 and 2020 will be eligible to create renewable energy certificates for a period of no more than five years—


—accepting the grandfathering of those that were already in existence. Indeed, because we have the excellent system of the Emissions Reduction Fund organised by the coalition government through direct action on climate change, we do have Australian carbon credit units. I believe and the committee believed at that time that there is a tremendous opportunity to morph from these renewable energy certificates, which at the moment are at a cost of about $88 per certificate and apparently relieving about one tonne of carbon dioxide, through to the carbon credit units, which are about $10 to $11 per unit and again are giving about one tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent.


At the time, the comment kept being made, and even in its response the government said that it 'notes that wind farm approvals are a matter for individual state and territory governments'. I have had long discussions with the federal minister. I have spoken in this place and in the public arena. If we look at the events in South Australia in the last few days and the events that we are going to see in Victoria, Tasmania and particularly in Queensland, which says that it is going to 50 per cent renewables, I have to say that the community of Australia expects the federal government to take a leadership role in the provision of safe, sustainable, reliable and economic power. It is fundamental to all Australians that this happens. The states who have undertaken this have failed, and I believe the recommendations of this report remain current today.

"Leyonhjelm, Sen David",LDP,2017-02-09,"



Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (18:07):  I rise to speak on the government's response to the final report of the Senate select committee report on wind turbines. I was a member of that committee and contributed significantly to both its interim and final reports. I have taken a keen interest in ensuring that those reports did not gather dust, like so many other reports have done. In fact, we had some success in getting the government to respond to the interim report. But I regret to say its response to the final report has been anything but praiseworthy.


The committee submitted its final report to the Senate on 3 August 2015. On 16 March 2016, the chair of the committee, Senator John Madigan, moved a motion signed by the Senate crossbench calling on the government to respond by 10 May 2016. No response was received, and parliament was dissolved the day before that. On the first sitting day of the 45th Parliament, 30 August 2016, I lodged a motion signed by every single member of the new Senate crossbench asking for the government's response to the inquiry to be laid on the table by 21 November 2016. On 21 November there was still no government response. In fact, the government did not respond until 8 December 2016—16 months after the report was tabled. The required time for responding to Senate reports is three months. This is a mockery of our Senate process.


Now that it has responded, there are several aspects about its response that warrant comment. One of the priorities of the inquiry was to examine the impact of wind farms on those living and working in close proximity to them. The committee heard how some of these people were suffering ill health, that their health improved when they moved away and deteriorated when they returned. It heard how these health effects were not understood by the medical world, were commonly dismissed and that the suffering of those affected was made worse by their shabby treatment. It heard how the wind industry and its cheerleaders in the media, academia and health belittled those adversely affected. One retired academic with no qualifications or even expertise in medical matters promoted the lie that only people in English-speaking countries were claiming to be adversely affected.


Some plausible explanations were put forward to explain the ill-health effects, mostly relating to infrasound or very low-frequency soundwaves. Evidence was given that infrasound is a known cause of ill health in humans and that wind turbines emit infrasound. What we do not have is confirmation that the infrasound emitted by wind farms is sufficient to cause adverse health effects. Not everyone is affected, and those affected are not always invariably affected. As one who is easily affected by seasickness when others are not, I did not find that very difficult to understand. But, apparently, it is good enough for the wind industry, or 'big wind', as I describe them and their shills, to discredit those poor individuals who are made ill.


The committee also heard how the process for approving wind farms was a farce, with state policies ranging from non-existent to something that might as well not exist. It heard about: buck-passing between state governments and local governments, with nobody accepting responsibility for outcomes; how, once a wind farm is built, nobody is interested in whether it complies with its approval conditions; and that those approval conditions do not even include infrasound.


Some of these problems were highlighted in the interim report of the committee. Based on that report, I led a crossbench delegation to see then Prime Minister, Mr Abbott, to accept some of the recommendations. That led to the creation of the position of wind farm commissioner, the establishment of an independent committee to advise the minister and the commitment of funds to a proper scientific investigation of the health effects of wind farms. The wind farm commissioner has made some progress towards dealing with some of these issues. Complainants now have someone who will listen, and at least some wind farm operators now realise they should cooperate in investigating why people are getting sick. I understand they might even agree to release their operating data so that it can be correlated against symptoms. That would, indeed, be progress.


But, beyond that, very little has changed. In particular, there were some very important recommendations in the final report that have not been treated seriously by the government in its response. The government has observed that wind farm approvals are a matter for individual state and territory governments and that it, therefore, cannot address the manifest inadequacies in their regulatory regimes. This is profoundly wrong. Unless a wind farm meets Commonwealth requirements, renewable energy certificates cannot be issued. Without the certificates, the wind farm cannot sell them to electricity retailers. And selling certificates is its source of revenue. A wind farm needs the Commonwealth government more than it needs a state government. The Commonwealth is abdicating its responsibilities.


The government response says state government planning regulations require a noise monitoring regime as part of wind farm development approvals for both approval and operational stages. This is not always true. And, in any case, no state requires monitoring of infrasound. The response says the government is moving to develop national wind farm guidelines. This should be a priority, given its significance to state governments. It is a golden opportunity to address the impact of wind farms that were raised in evidence. And, yet, the government is dragging the chain.


The response says the government does not want the Productivity Commission to examine the impact of renewable energy, of which wind is the main component. Its impact on electricity prices was discussed by Senator Back in the previous address. The government says that the Australian Energy Market Commission produces an annual report on retail electricity price trends and that it does not believe further analysis is required by the Productivity Commission at this time. When is the right time to find out how much this utterly indefensible policy is costing the Australian economy or what the social harm being caused by energy poverty is? Do poor people have to die of cold or heat exhaustion before the insanity of ever-rising electricity prices is stopped?


Australia's postwar prosperity is attributable to the fact that we had a reliable source of cheap energy. Cheap, coal-fired power is what has kept the lights on and people in jobs for over a century. It also ensured that everyone could afford to stay warm in winter and cool in summer, no matter whether they were poor or rich. That is no longer the case. How many dead people are an acceptable price for Australia's contribution to combating climate change? I seek leave to continue my remarks later.


Leave granted; debate adjourned.

For many years our nation's economic fortunes rode upon the sheep's back, and, especially in my home state of Western Australia, broadacre cropping and livestock production continue to be the major regional economic activity—especially with the downturn in the mining and resources sector.


In Western Australia, 2016 proved to be an exciting year for agriculture, and 2017 looks as though it has the potential to be even better. Record pasture yields last year had many graziers celebrating their best season in five decades, a turn of fortune that is expected to flow into the coming season as well. At the same time, across WA's north, cattle stations in the Kimberley have had an ideal start to the year with steady, consistent falls of rain. Despite numerous setbacks over the past year, including frost and waterlogging, WA's grain growers were still able to deliver the largest crop in the state's history, at 16.5 million tonnes. This is an outstanding achievement, especially when one considers that there are approximately 4,250 grain growers across Western Australia and that they are farming in some of the most challenging conditions on the planet.


These growers have been provided a high level of certainty for 2017 and beyond, thanks to the WA Liberal government repealing one of the last remaining pieces of legislation strangling WA growers, that being the previous Labor state government's Genetically Modified Crops Free Areas Act. This means that Western Australia's growers are allowed the freedom to choose which types of crops they will grow without meddlesome government intervention and regulation. This includes the freedom to grow GM canola, a crop which previously could only be grown under an exemption order. This is an immensely valuable crop for our state. Indeed, the 2016 harvest alone was estimated to be worth more than $200 million, and that value is reflected in take-up by growers. GM canola is now is the most heavily adopted cropping technology across Western Australia. So valuable and so popular has it become that even the WA Labor Party has been dragged kicking and screaming to recognise this point. 


In the second week of 2017, WA Labor executed one of the greatest backflips since Nadia Comeneci scored perfect 10 in the Montreal Olympics. At long last, they have abandoned their impossible dream to prevent the growing of genetically modified crops in Western Australia by lifting a ban on the growing of GM crops. WA Labor's agricultural spokesman, Mick Murray, has finally conceded that the growth of GM in WA could not be stopped. The fact that something so blindingly obvious took so long to be understood by WA's alternative agriculture minister is deeply troubling and still speaks to Labor's fundamental inability to grasp agricultural issues central to WA's future economic prosperity. This leaves the WA Greens as the lone voice of opposition to the growing of GM crops. I am sure that is a fact not lost on the tens of thousands of voters in the agricultural region of Western Australia who will cast their vote at the state election in March. And, if a potential WA Labor government were reliant on the Greens to pass its legislation, you can bet for sure they would sell out WA's farmers in a flash.


 Despite Western Australia being traditionally known as a top producer of bulk products, focus in regional WA has increasingly been shifting towards premium, high-quality products, including premium wines, truffles and seafood. This shift is expected to see the WA agricultural industry, which is currently worth $7.8 billion, double in value over the next 10 years. This strong growth in niche, premium food products has been fuelled primarily by the rising demand from China's emerging affluent middle class and the ever steady increase in cultural tourism. In a timely release, yesterday the Menzies Research Centre launched a new publication, authored by Andrew Bragg, titled Fit for service: Meeting the demand of the Asian middle class. As the publication notes, exporting to this market will be critical in determining our future economic success, with the emerging middle class in the Asian region expected to number some three billion people by 2030. When it comes to WA's products in particular, we know they are among the world's best. It is up to us to make that understood in Asia, as well as at home in Perth. It is worth remembering that Australia's quarter-century of uninterrupted economic growth was fundamentally established by trade liberalisation, reducing subsidies and cutting tariffs. The neo-protectionist approach, which is currently enjoying some measure of popularity, even in this Senate, has never shown itself capable of producing similar runs of economic growth. And I confidently predict it never will.


The core task is clear: to encourage people to visit Western Australia and to experience the quality of our premium goods whilst here, and then to continue purchasing them when they return to their homes in other places in the world. This approach has driven the success of WA's premium wine industry, which has capitalised on meeting the appetites of tourists. The industry is set to experience further growth, thanks to the Turnbull government's recently announced changes to the wine equalisation tax. These measures not only address the inequality between WA fine wine producers and bulk and unbranded winemakers in the east but also introduce a new Wine Tourism and Cellar Door grant scheme, designed to offset the reduction of the WET rebate cap from $500,000 to $350,000. It also recognises the important role played by the wine industry in creating jobs and investment opportunities across regional Australia. The government's comprehensive response to the concerns of WA's wine industry representatives, its preparedness to seek improvements to the original reforms and a willingness to understand the unique nature of wine tourism and the regional economies it supports have meant the final outcomes are better that they could have possibly first imagined.


 The same can be said for another one of the Turnbull government's outcomes—one that began last week —supporting the refurbishment of the Busselton-Margaret River Regional Airport. This $60 million project not only will allow direct flights to and from the eastern states but also, thanks to the federal government's Building Better Regions program, will see the runway length increased to cater for important international airfreight. This $9.78 million investment will make Busselton the first major regional freight hub in Western Australia, increase regional employment, support new and emerging markets, and provide a least-cost pathway for farmers, fishers, winemakers, horticulturalists and exporters. That includes exporters like south-west meat processor V&V Walsh, who last year became the first red meat processor in Australia to receive full accreditation from Chinese authorities to export chilled sheep, goat and beef meat, providing a market for a further 500,000 lambs each year. It can also assist the state's largest beef abattoir, Harvey Beef, which has invested over $30 million in upgrading the chiller capacity and retail-ready packaging facilities to meet the growing international demand for beef and sheep meat. Winemakers, fishermen, fruit and vegetable growers, dairy farmers and cut flower suppliers are also set to benefit from a direct air link with China and South-East Asia.


Early last year, Volga Dnepr, operators of the Antonov An-225 Mriya, the world's largest plane, met with the City of Busselton to discuss using the airport as a regional transport hub flying direct to Singapore. Ocean Grown Abalone, located at Flinders Bay, is the world's first abalone sea ranch and will produce 100 tonnes by 2018, primarily for airfreight to the Chinese market. WA's avocado farmers are experiencing a huge increase in avocado production as strong demand for the fruit continues to grow throughout the country. Over 40 per cent of all avocados grown in Australia are grown in WA's south-west, primarily for the eastern domestic market.


These are just some of the tremendous examples of the exciting future for agriculture in my home state of Western Australia, a future made possible not only through the science and research that has been going into developing new products such as truffles, or the commercial farming of abalone, but through the innovation and the determination of Western Australia's primary producers.
