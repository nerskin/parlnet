"Faulkner, Senator John",ALP,2000-10-31,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Special Minister of State (Senator Ellison), to questions without notice asked today, relating to the use of a telecard issued to the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith).
When the Minister for Administrative Services, Mr Jull, was sacked on 24 September 1997 because of the botched repayment of $8,000 in TA by the former transport minister, John Sharp, the Prime Minister stated in parliament:
... I believe ... the magnitude of the adjustment that was made ought to have been disclosed at the time and ... given the magnitude of the adjustment, there should have been a pursuit of a more detailed formal explanation for the reason for the discrepancy.
	...	...	...
The public is not only entitled to the reality of honesty and probity but must also not be left in any doubt in relation to perceptions.
Mr Jull was sacked for not telling the Prime Minister about the fraud—about the repayment—and for not pursuing the matter properly and promptly. That was Mr Jull's crime, and for that he lost his position in the ministry. He was sacked for causing public doubt and concern about the integrity of the system of the administration of politicians' entitlements.
The truth of the matter is that Senator Ellison has done precisely the same thing as Minister Jull. Some nine months of DOFA inquiry later we still have this minister dissembling in the Senate over the telecard affair. You have to ask yourself the following question: why is Senator Ellison still in the ministry when he has committed the same breaches as Mr Jull? The truth is: on his own account, his department was recommending police intervention in September 1999, but he did nothing. He claims he told no-one—an extraordinary claim that almost beggars belief, but I suppose we have to accept it. At least, in the end, David Jull asterisked the repayment on a tabled document. If Senator Ellison and Mr Reith had got away with their attempt at a cover-up, the $950 repayment would never have been revealed. A statement has been made that this revelation has been the result of questions that were asked when we defined it down—that is, that the repayment would have become public because of my questions into telecard accounts in the Senate estimates committee. Of course that is not right, and that was exposed yesterday.
The truth of the matter is that, if the Canberra Times had not exposed the Reith affair, we would all still be in the dark. The police investigation would not be known about; perhaps there would not even have been any involvement from the DPP and the Solicitor-General and, if there had, it certainly would not have been public knowledge. This whole matter would have been hidden from view. It is no wonder that Mr Reith has now decided on the political tactic of offering up Senator Ellison as the sacrificial goat on this matter. His bungling over the Reith affair has made him as culpable as Mr Reith. Mr Reith scrambles around and decides the new political tactic is to blame Senator Ellison. Stick the blame on to Senator Ellison over here in the Senate and perhaps that might mean less pressure on Mr Reith. He has deliberately set out to burn Senator Ellison by revealing the call on 22 February and asking what had happened with the telecard matter nearly six months after he had asked Senator Ellison to have the matter investigated. He has now implicated Senator Ellison quite successfully, and Senator Ellison has proved again today in one of the worst performances we have ever seen from a minister in this chamber that he is completely unable to defend his ministerial actions, or non-actions. He stands condemned.

"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2000-10-31,"—I will make a contribution. It is a confusing debate, I have to say. All I can suggest is that it demonstrates that the Labor Party has decided to let the Reith matter rest. At least that is a positive move. I take that to mean that it believes that a penalty of $48,000, or a little over, is enough. The mistake that Reith—Mr Reith—made—
—Mr Reith.
—I corrected myself, Senator—which he acknowledged, has cost him a great deal, and no doubt a lesson has been learnt. It has taken us some weeks to get to that point, but at least we have now got to that point and we can move on. I interpret it that way because there were a couple of questions today that did not relate to Mr Reith; they related to Senator Ellison.
—It is a convenient interpretation for your own purposes.
—That was the attack that was made by Senator Faulkner when he debated the subject in the Senate today. He said to us, `Our target today is Senator Ellison.' I can only interpret that as meaning Labor has now let the Reith matter conclude. I think most Australians will be pleased that it has now got to that stage, and perhaps the political debate can move on to matters of substance. But no—of course Labor cannot do that because it has no matters of substance. So what has Senator Faulkner sought today? He has sought to somehow or other move the attack on to Senator Ellison. What is his criticism of Senator Ellison? Senator Ellison, when he was advised of the problem, had it investigated in accordance with the guidelines, at arms-length by the proper authority. He did exactly what a minister in his portfolio should do. So any attempt to discredit Senator Ellison out of this debate is obviously doomed to failure. Senator Ellison carried out his ministerial responsibilities in this matter perfectly. As a result of the administration working properly, matters were investigated, and they have got to the stage of where we are today, as I said, with the Reith matter being concluded.
Let the real debate in Australian politics commence. But of course it cannot because the Labor Party is unable to debate policies. The Labor Party is unable to present itself as an alternative government because it has no policies. It has been in opposition for four years, and it cannot put to this Senate one policy. It cannot stand up and say, `This is what we stand for on education,' or, `This is what we stand for on innovation.' Senator Cook once had an innovation policy, but goodness only knows what the Labor Party now has on that subject matter. It has no health policy. It took three years to decide that it would endorse the coalition's policy in relation to private health care. It took three years for the Labor Party to do that, but does it have an alternative? No, of course it does not have an alternative. The people of Australia are not being presented with an alternative. Take my portfolio area. Does Labor have an environment policy? Of course it does not have an environment policy. Four years in opposition and it does not have one policy to present as an alternative.
We nearly got one, and it was called roll-back. This was the imitation of a tax policy because, when the Australian Labor Party decided to endorse the goods and services tax, it had to vary its product slightly. So its variation was roll-back. It was going to roll it back a little bit, but it was never prepared to say how far it would roll it back or how it would fund the difference. Everyone knew that it would have to fund the difference by putting up income taxes or by borrowing more and pushing up interest rates—what it used to do when it was last in government. Roll-back, particularly after the goods and services tax was accepted by the Australian people so well, became a liability to the Labor Party. When was the last time we heard mention of roll-back? If it has not got roll-back, it has got nothing. It tried to introduce a little tax policy, but it did not work. It had to pull back, and now after four years of opposition it presents to the Australian people absolutely nothing. No wonder we have this desperate, baseless, shallow, weak attack on Senator Ellison today because the Labor Party has no alternative subject to debate.

"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,2000-10-31,"—Students of proper constitutional behaviour may think that, when a department is under sustained attack, the responsible minister will step forward and defend it and, at the very least, quickly investigate any allegations that have been made and report, and students of con-stitu-tional behaviour would have been right up until now. Things are different, however, under the Howard government. Senator Ellison, the Special Minister of State, has become the invisible man when his depart-ment has come under a sustained attack from his colleagues during what is now known as the Reith telecard affair. But Senator Ellison is not only invisible to his department; Sena-tor Ellison is also invisible when it comes to the media. He is so invisible that last night we learned on the 7.30 Report that he has been invited to attend and appear on that program six times to discuss these issues, and six times he has declined. There is an old saying in politics: if you don't appear in the media, you don't exist. One can only postu-late that this is the new cute line in minis-terial accountability. When serious issues are raised against your department, don't com-ment, don't answer questions if you can avoid it, don't appear in the media and don't exist.
There are allegations here that need answering. What did Senator Ellison's colleagues—the former minister, David Jull; the National Party pretender, Ian Causley; and the telecard villain, Peter Reith—say? In Mr Causley's case he just gave the department a general spray, claiming in so many words it was incompetent. Is it? If it is, does the minister take responsibility for that incompetence? If it is not, why is the charge left hanging? Why are public servants expected to think their minister allows this criticism of their behaviour and does not defend them? Mr Jull, who was Senator Ellison's predecessor bar one, was an insider and he made criticisms of the department. He knows what happens in this department. Therefore, his allegations have to be allegations that bear, in these circumstances, much more weight and substance because he is a former minister. Last week Mr Jull told an AM interviewer, Alexandra Kirk, that bureaucrats in the department are at fault and Kirk came back at him. Let me quote her:
But how is it that, for example, after merging with the Department of Finance after the travel rorts affair, that was supposed to inject into the department the rigour of the finance department? 
What did David Jull say? He said:
I don't know the workings of the finance department. My suggestion would be that maybe we've got the same personnel in there and maybe there should be some changes in the administration. 
In other words, they ought to have sacked a few more people than they actually did. But of course Kirk was right. After the travel rorts affair, the department undertook wide-ranging redundancies and lost its departmental head. It was merged with the Department of Finance so it, we were told, would be more efficient. It also got a new minister. After the travel rorts affair, some of us thought, `Well, in this case, some of the politicians messed it up so the Public Service gets it in the neck.' But what a stinging rebuke from Mr Jull to Senator Ellison. After all the blood-letting and after all the departmental scapegoating, there are still public servants in his department, alleges a former minister, who are incompetent. Well, Senator Ellison, are there? Where is your answer? Have you put down the criticism? If Mr Jull is right, what are you doing about it? Why don't you say something?  
That brings me to Mr Reith, the man who did not say anything about his telecard from August last year to May this year when he knew it was being abused. Mr Reith was reported in the Sydney Morning Herald on 14 October, and I will quote from the article:
Reith's pat “defence” is that he never knew the bills were rolling in, and he's stuck the boot into other colleagues and questioned the Government's competence and integrity to help save himself. “When they [the Finance Department] revealed all the details to me of the 11,000 phone calls . . . I said to them, `Well, if an account for a million dollars had come in, would you have paid it? And they said, `Yes we would have paid it.' And I said, `Would you have told me?' And they said they wouldn't have. Now, I don't think that's reasonable.”
He then went on to attack the department. It is Senator Ellison's job to defend this department. Senator Ellison, is it true what Mr Reith says? If so, what is being done to correct it? We know that this is a cover-up, and it is about time the minister stepped forward and did the honourable thing and explained what his department has been doing. In his absence, if he cannot do that, then let's hear from Dr Boxall, the new head of this department.

"Knowles, Sen Susan",LP,2000-10-31,"—Isn't it fascinating? We have just had the last assault on Senator Ellison from Senator Cook, the senator who asked the Minister for Justice and Customs today not once but twice to comment on operational matters. This goes to show just how bright Senator Cook really is in this matter. The Labor Party have launched into this constant personal assault and personal vilification. We have just moved from Mr Reith and on to Senator Vanstone and on to Senator Ellison, and then we will move on to the next one the next day. As Senator Hill said, where is the policy? Policy is not coming out of the Labor Party. Everything is driven by personality, yet the Labor Party will not control their own. Why won't they control their own? What has been done about certain motor vehicles being used by certain people on the Labor Party side? Absolutely nothing. How many people have repaid certain amounts of money in connection with certain motor vehicles? Not one cent has been repaid. If certain senators are interested to find out how to get personal loans for substantial amounts of money, I am sure Mr Reith could tell them. So why do the Labor Party not start to focus upon their own, instead of now shifting their assault and petty attack to Senator Ellison? Senator Ellison, I might add, has not only done what the Labor Party did not do and refused to do, but he has enhanced protocols that were put in place by Senator Minchin; and somehow or other the Labor Party have forgotten that Senator Minchin was the minister for administrative services between Mr Jull and Senator Ellison. But of course those on the Labor Party side do not even bother to remember that because that might actually give some continuity and fact to the debate. The fact of the matter is that the protocols were set down by Senator Minchin and they have been tabled here today.
—No, they haven't. They have not been tabled today.
—Senator Ray interjects that the protocols have not been tabled. Senator Ellison informed me just before he left the chamber that he has tabled the protocols today and he was quite happy to do so. The fact of the matter is that, when possible irregularities relating to the use of Mr Reith's telecard were found on 30 August 1999, the department informed Mr Reith and the matter was referred to the departmental internal audit unit for preliminary investigation. To listen to the Labor Party humbug on this issue, one would suspect that there had been no such investigation. But it was perfectly proper and in accordance with the fraud control policy of the Commonwealth that such a matter be investigated in the first instance by the departmental internal audit unit. The department did this before—and I emphasise the word `before'—it informed the Special Minister of State, Senator Ellison. In fact, the first reference by Ministerial and Parliamentary Services was predicated on the assumption that the Australian Federal Police may need to be called in at a later time.  
But, once again, as I have already mentioned, Senator Cook does not understand the way in which the Federal Police does investigations. In fact, he does not understand the way anyone does investigations, it appears. Nor does Senator Forshaw, because Senator Forshaw, having sat through four minutes of Senator Vanstone's answer, then asked why she was unable to comment on the investigative process and operational matters. The investigation was particularly time consuming and complex. Yet here the Labor Party are still saying that Senator Ellison, having followed all the protocols, having followed all the procedures, is wrong. How pathetic when day after day goes by and they have not controlled, nor questioned, nor sought any answers in any way, shape or form from any of their own. They know that there are moneys outstanding. They know that circumstances have been disclosed recently that really do need answers.

"Ray, Sen Robert",ALP,2000-10-31,"—Senator Ellison had a great opportunity this afternoon to answer Senator Evans's question. Mr Jull went on the AM program and lambasted the MAPS section of DOFA. He made claims that they had bungled one of his staff's medical insurance deductions. We hear today, `Oh, the matter is solved.' We understand it is solved because the mistake was not the department's. Why couldn't Senator Ellison bring himself in here today to say, `My department was innocent of this'? Why couldn't he utter those words? He was asked twice to do so, but he would not defend his department. Senator Ellison comes in here and boasts about the reforms made to the administration of parliamentary entitlements. He cites tightened procedures and a more transparent reporting system. I acknowledge that has occurred. But everyone knows these reforms are as a direct response to the exposure of people rorting their entitlements. This is not a proactive government in terms of these reforms; this is a reactive government. Every time the genie gets out of the bottle they put the cork in it afterwards. 
I acknowledge, year by year over the last 20 or 30 years, improvements and progresses made by all sorts of governments, but for this one to boast about it when they are only reacting to scandal is absolute hypocrisy at its worst. When scrutiny is applied they bellow that we are not on the big national issues, because they hate scrutiny. When misuse of MPs' entitlements is exposed they attack the public servants who administer those particular entitlements. They take their vengeance on the public servants, terrifying them to the point that they cannot do their job. Yet these very public servants were the ones who in 1997, on their own initiative, recommended and executed a draft paper on reform of parliamentary entitlements. They did not seek ministerial approval; this was an initiative out of the department. Mr Sam Szrypek was the one delegated to do the task because he was in the department but not in the MAPS division. He produced a report recommending the overhaul of parliamentary entitle-ments, scrutiny and transparency. What happened to that report? The government still to this day refuse to release that report. It went to ministers, it went to the Prime Minister, and it got deliberately buried—and there is evidence on the record that it got deliberately buried—before the Sharp, McGauran and other incidents occurred. So this government had their opportunity to respond to a thoughtful report, recommending changes to scrutiny of parliamentary entitlements, and they buried it out of cowardice. They said, `This won't go down well in the party room.' They junked this particular proposal.
The former head of the MAPS division, who left a few months ago, actually proposed that MPs sign off their phone accounts. That proposal was rejected. I do not know who rejected it. I have to put that on the record. But that very distinguished public servant, who had a great record in Finance and has gone on to another very high office in this land, recommended that MPs sign off their phone accounts. Guess what? No action was taken. I do not know to whom he made the recommendation. I do not know whether it went to ministerial level or not. But what is never acknowledged by the coalition is that it was the Labor government that first brought in transparency of ministerial expenses—TA, overseas travel and Comcar use were all published. Guess what? When we came into office in 1983 none of that was published, and who was a prominent cabinet minister for the previous six years? None other than Mr John Howard, our current Prime Minister. He did nothing when he was in cabinet to bring in transparency, to bring in proper scrutiny; he just sat there, and none of this material was out there publicly. Progress has been made in the last 15 to 20 years in relation to these issues, but there is no doubt, given the events of the last three weeks, that more progress needs to be made, more scrutiny needs to be applied and more transparency needs to exist. But it will not happen with this government unless they are forced to do it. (Time expired)

 (1)	Page 3 (after line 9), after clause 4, insert:
5  Reports on operation of Act
	(1)	As soon as practicable after the end of each financial year ending on or after 30 June 2001, the Minister must cause to be prepared a written report on the following:
	(a)	the number of:
	(i)	public pathology collection centres; and
	(ii)	private pathology collection centres;
in each State by statistical local areas;
	(b)	the number of public or private pathology collection centres that have commenced or ceased operations in non-metropolitan areas in the preceding financial year;
	(c)	any action taken by the Minister in the preceding financial year to ensure that access to pathology services in non-metropolitan areas is not reduced overall. 
	(2)	The Minister must cause to be laid before each House of the Parliament a report prepared under subsection (1) within 7 sitting days of that House after he or she received the report.
	(3)	In this section:
statistical local area means an area defined in the Australian Standard Geographical Classification 1999 published by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (publication number 1216.0 of 1999).
This opposition amendment tackles the problem of a shrinking public sector and loss of rural services by establishing a reporting mechanism. The problem of ensuring that there are sufficient collection centres in rural areas has been acknowledged in the past and is reflected in the three to one provision that entitles large providers to open more rural centres. The fact is that this bonus allocation has not been utilised to the necessary extent. The general pattern of recent mergers in the industry has seen a dramatic loss in the total number of centres. In the cities this has had beneficial effects as the industry has stabilised compared with wilder earlier days. But in rural Australia the pendulum has swung too far and the public system, which has provided the backbone of services, will now be under real pressure. We may not just see collection centres close; we may also see the closure of vital small laboratories in local and regional hospitals that provide timely and effective services. 
As a first step to get this problem into the light of day, the opposition is moving an amendment to require annual public reporting of the number of collection centres in each local statistical zone. The minister will be required to report on the trends in closures of centres in non-metropolitan areas and the action taken to ensure that access is not reduced. The report should include advice on the action taken by the minister to ensure that access to pathology services in non-metropolitan areas has not been reduced. At the government's request, this subsection has had the word `overall' added to the end of the sentence to make clear that the purpose of the report is to get an overview of the broader trends and not to report on each and every closure of a facility. The object of this amendment, which I understand is supported by the government, is to ensure some transparency and to enable monitoring of the impact of the new rules and whether there is any reduction in access to services. We think this amendment is an important measure to enable the public to judge the impact of the legislation and the effectiveness of the government's rural health policies. I understand that the wording of the amendment has been discussed at some length among various advisers, and I hope that the government will support this amendment in its final form.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 4) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,8,1

The reason for putting this question to Senator Tambling is that there will be effects relating to the bill. I ask whether an area such as the Atherton Tableland, which is 60 kilometres west of Cairns, and which is decidedly rural, actually qualifies as rural and remote, or will there be two assessments—will there be rural and remote, or does it have to be remote and a rural area? If the minister could clarify that for the chamber, I would appreciate it.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 4) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,8,1
"Tambling, Sen Grant",CLP,2000-10-31,"—It is difficult to understand the context in which Senator Harris is bringing this question, given that he has not participated in the earlier debates in this area. My understanding from the question that he has put to me is that he is seeking to ascertain the definition with regard to Atherton and the Atherton Tableland area. I am advised that that area is under the definition of rural and remote metropolitan areas in the classification 4-5.
While the government are happy to agree to the proposed amendment to report once a year on collection centres, in prior discussions with the opposition we have outlined the limited value of the information requested as a measure of access to pathology services for the following reasons. Funding for pathology services occurs through many streams, including Medicare, Australian health care agreements, health fund program grants in rural and remote areas, Department of Veterans' Affairs funding, et cetera. Data on public pathology providers—that is, public proprietors, laboratories, pathologists and collection centres—is available if they provide private pathology under Medicare, otherwise they fall under the jurisdiction of the states. Data can be provided on the numbers of openings and closures of collection centres that provide private pathology under Medicare.  
From experience with the movement of collection centres under the LCC scheme, the amount of movement is high and reflects business decisions by APAs. Specimens for testing are collected in multiple settings—including doctors' surgeries, nursing homes, laboratories and hospitals—and by patients. Collection centres are another facility within which specimens are collected. Businesses independently make decisions to open or close collection centres or utilise other methods of collecting specimens—that is, collections from doctors' surgeries, nursing homes, laboratories and hospitals, et cetera. In all other respects the government, as Senator Evans indicated, is pleased to support the amendment that has been put forward by the opposition.
Amendment agreed to.

"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2000-10-31,"—by leave—I move opposition amendments Nos 4 and 5:
(4)	Schedule 1, item 32, page 9 (after line 25), after subsection (4), insert:
	(4A)	Approval Principles determined by the Minister under subsection (4) must promote fair competition and the entry of new providers.
 (5)	Schedule 1, item 32, page 10 (after line 9), at the end of section 23DNBA, add:
	(7)	In this section
new provider means a person who, or entity that, does not have an ownership or management relationship with the holder of an existing approval for an eligible collection centre.
These seek to amend item 32 of schedule 1. These reflect our concern that the government has given too much incentive to existing private pathology providers. We think it risks creating an anticompetitive situation where a few large operators are protected from new entrants by virtue of the new system for calculating the entitlements to licence numbers for collection centres. If licences are issued only on the basis of turnover, it will be impossible for niche operators to grow where they have proved themselves to be efficient service providers. This bill will effectively close the door on new competition in the private sector, and it will stifle growth in the public sector. There is already a large degree of concentration in the industry, and it is time to allow more competition to ensure that there is no scope for the major companies to slide away from the most cost-effective patterns of operating.
Under the proposed rules, a new entrant will be limited to two licences at most. They will then have to fight for additional licences solely on the grounds of turnover. This puts them in an impossible situation, as they have no network to build volume and they are competing against much larger groups for whom an extra licence can be gained by the equivalent of an extra day or two's turnover. This problem should be overcome by rewriting the ministerial guidelines to ensure that new entrants are encouraged rather than frozen out. The overall caps can be maintained in a situation where the major players will have to work hard to maintain their market share by being cost effective and offering customer service that matches the best that the new providers can come up with. I am somewhat surprised that the government has not embraced this amendment, as one would expect it to support fair competition. It will be interesting to see how the minister's guidelines end up impacting on new entrants and to see the flow-on effect, particularly on rural services. I hope the government might reconsider. I also hope that the Democrats will support the interests of small operators to avoid the dominance of a few large providers of pathology services creating an imbalance in that market.

Can the parliamentary secretary advise the committee, taking into consideration the depreciation of the Australian dollar together with the increased cost of health care and the increased use of pathology in our modern health system, and bearing in mind that a lot of the equipment that is used in the collection of specimens and in the laboratories comes from overseas, whether the five per cent cap that the government is implementing—and I seek your indulgence, Parliamentary Secretary, if the cap is in the previous bill, but I would still like to ask this—is realisable?

"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2000-10-31,"—The Financial Sector Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2000 seeks to build on the government's legislation flowing from the 1997 Wallis report into the financial sector, largely supported by Labor. The bill contains a number of measures, the main ones aimed to: alter the prudential regulation of authorised deposit taking institutions; rationalise and consolidate the Commonwealth's unclaimed moneys provisions; simplify and modernise service provisions in the Reserve Bank Act 1959; and alter superannuation laws by strengthening the enforcement provisions of the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993. The bill was referred to the Senate Economics Legislation Committee, which reported on its inquiries on 30 August. The bill was also referred to the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation and Financial Services, which examined clauses in the bill in respect of the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993.
I want to discuss briefly the main changes covered in this bill. I will firstly deal with proposed changes to authorised deposit taking institutions, ADIs. The bill proposes a number of changes to the Banking Act 1959 that will affect the regulation of ADIs. These include: permitting conditions to be placed on approvals for mergers, acquisitions or restructures of ADIs under section 63 of the Banking Act 1959; providing APRA with the power to act pre-emptively to stop undesirable activities rather than simply acting to impose punishment after damage has occurred; broadening the definition of information that APRA can require from ADIs under sections 13 and 62 of the Banking Act to include documents; providing APRA with the power to impose directions if APRA considers that an ADI is likely to breach a prudential regulation or standard or if the ADI is conducting its affairs in an improper or financially unsound manner; and ensuring that APRA has the power to appoint itself to investigate the affairs of an ADI so that APRA is able to conduct its own investigations under the Banking Act.
I would like to focus on the proposed powers in this bill to allow the Treasurer to attach conditions when consenting to the merger or reconstruction of an ADI. When introducing this bill in the House of Representatives, the Minister for Financial Services and Regulation noted that the Treasurer's proposed new powers to attach conditions to a merger of an ADI were designed to allow more mergers to proceed more quickly. The minister for financial services stated:
In particular, this bill grants the Treasurer, or delegate, power to attach conditions to his or her consent for an ADI to reconstruct or demutualise. This will ensure that any undertakings made by an applicant are enforceable and may facilitate a greater number of applications receiving consent.
I am concerned that the government's priority is to make banking mergers easier rather than to address community concerns about bank mergers and banking services.
When inquiring into this bill, the Senate Economics Legislation Committee received submissions from the Australian Consumers Association and the Finance Sector Union who were concerned about the impact of bank mergers on banking services and the community. The Consumers Association stated to the committee that they were concerned that past bank mergers have reduced the level of competition in the banking industry. In particular, they cited the merger of Westpac and the Bank of Melbourne in 1997. Prior to its merger with Westpac, the Bank of Melbourne was regarded as an aggressive competitor in Victoria, marketing itself as `cutting the cost of banking'. In 1997, the Australian Consumers Association conducted a bank satisfaction survey in which the Bank of Melbourne topped the list for best regional bank, with 48 per cent of customers reporting that they were `very satisfied' with the bank. They obviously had nothing to do with the Trust Bank of Tasmania! Following the merger with Westpac, the Consumer Association's 1999 bank satisfaction survey revealed that only 14 per cent of customers were very satisfied with the bank. In 1999, their survey revealed that an astounding 71 per cent of Bank of Melbourne customers believed that fees and charges were worse or a lot worse since the merger. 
This significant turnaround in community attitudes to the Bank of Melbourne following the merger was despite the fact that the ACCC accepted a series of undertakings from Westpac management that were intended to protect competition. Westpac's undertakings to the ACCC included that 100 Bank of Melbourne branches were to be opened from 9 a.m. to 12 noon on Saturday, and that 100 Bank of Melbourne branches were to open for a minimum of eight hours from Monday to Friday; no pre-existing customer who has had a minimum of $400 in a Bank of Melbourne account will be charged account keeping fees or transaction fees where the minimum balance is over $400; and the CEO of the Bank of Melbourne will have authority to make decisions in respect of interest rates and fees, management of branches, marketing and credit decisions.
Westpac undertakings have now expired. However, given that the ACCC also accepted a series of undertakings when it agreed to the merger of the Commonwealth Bank and Colonial, it is appropriate to examine whether the ACCC's Westpac undertakings were successful in maintaining competition in Victoria. The conclusion, unfortunately, is that the ACCC's undertakings have not been successful in maintaining competition. And Mr Hank Spier admitted, just before he finished as the CEO of the ACCC, that yes, he was disappointed that despite the time lapse and the expiry of those undertakings' deadline there had been no keeping of those commitments, and he expressed his disappointment at the outcome of the ACCC's supervision—or lack of—after the expiry. Indeed, a survey by Channel 9's A Current Affair demonstrated that a Bank of Melbourne passbook account that was opened in January 1998 with $50 had a debit balance of $1.04 three years later.
The Commonwealth Bank merger has been heavily criticised by media commentators for its impact on competition. In reference to the merger, Kenneth Davidson from the Age newspaper stated on 1 June of this year:
The agreement is a fig leaf designed to hide the fact that the takeover of Colonial is intended to reduce competition, not enhance services or reduce costs for customers, who still overwhelmingly want the banks to provide over-the-counter services.
The Commonwealth Bank gave an undertaking to the ACCC that it would set rates, fees and charges on all products to customers in Tasmania and regional New South Wales so that they are equivalent to, or more favourable than, the rates, fees and charges imposed on the Commonwealth Bank customers residing in metropolitan New South Wales. Despite this undertaking, the Commonwealth Bank recently announced that it would increase its giroPost transaction fees from $2 to $3. The fee increase was announced on the day of the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games. There was no press release; instead, the announcement appeared in the back pages of daily newspapers. How cynical can you get. The day Australians started to watch the opening ceremony of the Olympics, and the Commonwealth Bank slips out an announcement slugging customers for, in some cases, a 100 per cent increase in fees.
The Labor Party has raised concerns with the ACCC that the Commonwealth Bank may have breached its undertakings by increasing these fees. I am concerned that the Commonwealth Bank's decision to increase its giroPost transaction fees breaches the intent of the undertakings that the bank provided to the ACCC when it sought approval to buy Colonial. Given that giroPost is predominantly used by rural and regional communities—which the Commonwealth Bank is aware of—I question the bank's commitment to provide its services to rural communities on an equivalent or more favourable basis if it has increased a fee which disproportionately hits rural customers. With my colleague Sue Mackay I have written to the ACCC to express my concern that by increasing giroPost fees the Commonwealth Bank has breached the intent of the undertakings that it provided to the ACCC. 
In a media report a couple of Sundays ago in the Sun-Herald a source at the ACCC described this as a prima facie breach of those undertakings and they are seeking urgent consultations with the Commonwealth Bank to address this matter. We had the Commonwealth Bank's profits announced as recently as last Thursday, and Mr Murray made it absolutely clear up-front that there will be more Commonwealth Bank branch closures. He got himself an extra huge swag of options, increased his salary package substantially and at the same time announced a record profit while stating that there will be more bank branch closures. The cynicism of the banks knows no bounds.
There has been great community concern that the Treasurer and the ACCC have failed to adequately consult communities when making a decision on whether to approve the merger of an ADI. Consumer groups have expressed concern that under the current process of approving a merger the ACCC does not consult with all groups affected by the merger. The Financial Services Consumer Policy Centre were concerned that when the Commonwealth Bank merged with Colonial the ACCC did not consult consumer groups in Tasmania, despite the fact that the merger had major competition implications for Tasmanian customers. As if Tasmanian consumers were not getting a raw enough deal—and my colleague Acting Deputy President Murphy has made this point on a number of occasions—they were not even consulted about their views on this issue. Louise Petschler from the Consumers Association told the Senate Economics Legislation Committee inquiry into the bill that she was concerned that the voice of consumers was not being heard. She stated:
... we are not at the point now where we need to worry about the fact that someone should have a bigger voice than someone else. Our concern is that we do not get the opportunity to put that voice forward at the stage where mergers are being approved.
They do not want the only say; they just want a say. Currently the Treasurer is not required to consult when making a decision to approve or reject the merger or reconstruction of an ADI. Labor believes that the bill offers an opportunity to harmonise provisions in the Banking Act. The bill also provides parliament with a chance to debate the impact of banking mergers on the provision of banking services and allow consideration of the issues that the Treasurer should consider when consenting to the merger or reconstruction of an ADI. This government talks the talk on social obligations and banking services but not does not walk the walk when it comes to actually delivering.
Senator McGauran over on the other side of the chamber knows, because he has been visiting his new office in Benalla, that the banks are not interested, they are pushing their customers out of the door, they do not want to see your face, they simply want you to be a number on a computer. That is the banks' endgame. They have made it clear in the last week. Mr Murray knows and states quite categorically that they want to close more branches. Closing more branches means they are trying to push their customers out the door. Senator McGauran, you know this. You should be standing up for your electors. You should be fronting the Prime Minister in your party room—like some had the courage to do today on petrol—and saying, `John Howard, we don't want—
—How would you know?
—We know what happened, Senator McGauran. You just have to pick up the paper tomorrow and you will read all about it. But your name will not be linked to it, will it? We want you to stand up on behalf of your Benalla voters and say, `Prime Minister, John Howard, you cannot let this go on; you cannot let Australia go down the US path.' We cannot have, as we have in the US, 12 million families with no bank account; we cannot go down that path, Senator McGauran. I am looking to you to stand up, like Fran Bailey tried to do today on petrol, and lead the push in the coalition party room. 
—Mr Acting Deputy President, on a point of order: I think the honourable senator opposite should be asked to address his remarks through you, as you are in the chair at the moment. Senator McGauran is certainly not in the chair. Senator Conroy seems to be addressing his remarks to the opposition whip, and that is entirely out of order.
 (Senator Murphy)—I am sure Senator Conroy is aware of the standing orders, and he should address his remarks through the chair.
—It is simply more of the government talking the talk, but when it comes to the hard facts, when it comes to dealing with the banks, all they want to do is put their hand out to their banking mates, take their donations and do nothing to bring the banks to heel. That sort of response from Senator Ian Campbell is typical of this government—not wanting to deal with banks but wanting to protect backbenchers and the fact that they will not stand up on behalf of ordinary Benalla voters or, in terms of some other senators in the chamber at the moment, regional and rural voters.
—Senator Heffernan is a big champion of the regional and rural, but when it comes to standing up to those banks there is not a word—there is not a word in the party room about standing up on behalf of regional voters and their concerns. We will talk the talk, but we are not walking the walk—that is all that matters to the government on this bill. This is about whether or not the government will just cave in to the banking interests in this country or whether they are prepared to talk the talk and walk the walk.
Labor senators questioned Treasury officials during the Senate Economics Legislation Committee inquiry into this bill as to the issues the Treasurer should consider when consenting to the merger of an ADI. Treasury officials responded that the Financial Sector (Shareholdings) Act requires the Treasurer to consider the national interest when allowing a financial sector company to go above the 15 per cent ownership limit of another financial sector company. Treasury advised that, while the national interest is not defined in legislation, a number of common facts are usually considered. These include prudential considerations, competition policy issues and other issues relevant to the national interest, which could include employment effects, regional effects, benefits to consumers and industry groups of greater efficiencies and productivity, and benefits in creating stronger institutions or greater diversity of product lines.
The power is there in this bill for the Treasurer to make the banks share the profits around. If they are going to push you out of their branches, if they are going to make you pay more across the counter and if they are going to put up their fees and charges on almost all their other accounts, here is the position in this bill for the Treasurer to ensure that the profits banks are making by going down this merger path are shared around so that the banks are made to give some profits back to their customers. I would have thought, given that the purpose of this bill is to harmonise provisions in the Banking Act, the government would have taken the opportunity to introduce into the Banking Act a national interest test, which is currently contained in the Financial Sector (Shareholdings) Act. Labor have worked closely with the Democrats on this issue of a national interest test for banking mergers to develop an amendment to this bill which we will be supporting.
Let me make a few comments on other areas of the bill. Labor is supportive of the measures in the bill designed to give the Treasurer the power to delegate the unclaimed moneys provisions in the Banking Act to other portfolio agencies in addition to the Department of the Treasury. There are currently various unclaimed moneys functions managed by different agencies across the Treasury portfolio, including provisions in the Life Insurance Act 1995 and the Corporations Law. The amendments in the bill will allow for these unclaimed moneys to be administered by the one agency, which we understand will be the Australian Securities and Investments Commission. 
The bill proposes changes to the Reserve Bank Act 1959 which will have the effect of inserting a new definition of `staff members of the Reserve Bank Service' to replace various definitions of `officer', amending provisions in relation to appointment of staff which allow the bank to appoint such staff as the bank considers necessary for the performance of its functions on terms and conditions of employment to be determined by the bank and deleting section 7 1, which currently allows the bank to lend to staff for the purpose of housing.
In concluding I would like to make reference to a previous debate that Senator Ridgeway participated in on banks and banking policy. I know Senator Ridgeway took the opportunity to make a few points on behalf of the Democrats and this is my first opportunity to respond. Senator Ridgeway made the point that the Labor Party have form. It is the Labor Party who went down this path in the first place. I simply make the point that the banks have gone too far. What we have seen in this country is the banks exploiting their position. We have always stood ready, Senator Ridgeway—hopefully with Democrat support—to act if that exploitation is shown to be pushing customers out the door. Now we see in the ACCC report that banks have been guilty of price fixing.
We stand ready to act; we stand ready to move on the social charter. We call on you to join the campaign on the social charter and we call on the government senators in this chamber—Senator McGauran and Senator Heffernan—to stand up and join the campaign on the social charter so that we can see banks brought to heel and brought to the table. We urge all senators in this chamber to join the campaign on the social charter. We have ideas and I am sure that the government have ideas. I welcome the Democrat ideas. Pensioners groups, consumer groups and unions all have ideas about what the social charter should mean. We welcome the debate and we offer the opportunity for all to join that debate.

"Ridgeway, Sen Aden",AD,2000-10-31,"—I also rise to talk on the Financial Sector Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2000, acknowledging that it is a bill that is a continuation of the government's financial sector reform agenda that seeks to implement its response to the 1997 Wallis inquiry into the financial system. Senator Allison will speak about the superannuation industry. I note Senator Conroy's comments, and certainly this has been the subject of various inquiries and urgency motions, adjournment speeches and so on. I am glad to hear his idea of a campaign. It is one that has been pursued by the Democrats for many years now, and I am glad to see that he has picked that up as part of perhaps his new- found quest in political life.
The Australian Democrats of course welcome the government's recognition of the need to apply greater scrutiny to the merger of banks in Australia, and this is a matter where we have made our position very clear. It is an issue that the Australian public feels equally strongly about. I think it inspires the spectrum of emotions in terms of what it is that people regard as being important in terms of service delivery by banks and particularly in relation to this bill. The Democrats are of the view that there are insufficient opportunities for consumer and community input and participation in bank merger approvals and the consequences of those things. At present there is no opportunity or guarantee that merger approvals will be considered in terms of a broad public interest test. Yet we have a situation in Australia where, in the 18 years spanning 1979 to 1997, Australia's financial sector experienced some 17 bank mergers and takeovers—an extraordinary number. Another feature of Australia's banking and financial services over the last decade has been bank branch closures.
Perhaps the people most affected by this phenomenon—as you, Mr Acting Deputy President Murphy, would appreciate—live in Tasmania, where there have been an alarming 35 bank closures in the space of five years. This shrinkage in the accessibility of banking and financial services has also heavily impacted upon rural communities across Australia. Recent figures that were compiled by the Reserve Bank of Australia for the period from 1993 to 1996 suggest that for that same period perhaps as many as one in three major bank branches in rural communities had closed. It is of concern when we address bills of this sort that, for people living in rural Australia, the impact of bank closures is not just on the number of transactions people make in certain places. Closing a bank branch means job losses. It also means changes to the way that people shop and do business in their communities. It means changes to the way that people interact and socialise, particularly when they come to town, or whether they come to town at all. Despite bank claims to the contrary, new methods of banking service delivery, such as EFTPOS, phone and Internet banking and ATMs, are simply not meeting the banking needs of consumers. This is something that is being expressed by people right across the board. This is especially the case for the elderly and the disabled, for whom a bank closure means the added inconvenience and expense of travelling to a more distant location if they want to deposit cheques, undertake some sort of financial transaction and the like. 
The Australian Democrats have long subjected banks and the financial services sector to close scrutiny and have applied equally close scrutiny to relevant government policies over time. Yet while the combined profits of the four major banks in the last financial year clearly indicate that banks are having little difficulty in meeting their needs when it comes to profitability, the number of complaints coming from consumers makes it equally clear that the banks are simply not meeting the needs of their customers. A recent survey undertaken by the Australian Consumers Association reported in the summer issue of Consuming Interest also backs up claims of widespread dissatisfaction amongst bank customers. Of the more than 5,000 people that were surveyed, 76 per cent said they believed that consumers would be worse off if the big banks merged. In addition, 31 per cent of those respondents said that they had been affected by a merger involving their financial institution, and of those customers banking with a particular institution that had been taken over, 55 per cent—more than half of them—said that they were worse off in regard to fees and charges than they were before. Another 26 per cent said that staff knowledge and the client-customer relationship were worse since the takeover and those living in rural areas have been particularly hard hit. 
The widespread nature of these concerns is echoed in the 1998-99 report of the Australian Banking Industry Ombudsman. In that report he noted that many of the more than 2,000 complaints registered in the one-year period related to increased bank fees and bank closures. Sadly, the ombudsman noted that it appeared likely that this level of complaint would continue to increase unless steps were taken by banks to more effectively manage their relationship with their customers.
The Australian Democrats have long held the view that community service obligations should operate in the banking sector. Banks have a special role in our society, and they fulfil an important and essential service. In past years banks have enjoyed preferential regulatory treatment, and we therefore concur with recent comments by the ACA, which argued that consumers would benefit from mechanisms which ensured minimum protections in financial services based on the premise that access to banking services is a requirement for all consumers in our society. 
If the government is sincere in its public acknowledgment that banks do provide essential services and therefore should bear the associated social obligations, then the government should be prepared to do whatever it takes to balance the needs of the community against the profit motivations of the banks. Most of the major banks are on the public record as saying they acknowledge that they have important social obligations. Only yesterday, Mr John McFarlane, the Chief Executive of ANZ, was quoted in the Financial Review as saying that he and many of his ANZ colleagues `believe that we have very direct responsibilities to the communities in which we operate, and we should exercise [those] with very great care'. 
The Australian Bankers Association recently indicated that they take the view that there is no social obligation on the banking sector, although I note the letter recently written by Mr Geoff Oughton, the acting CEO of the ABA, trying to clarify what they were saying at a recent inquiry about that issue. The opposing views of the government, the community and the Australian Bankers Association need to be reconciled by legislative change which ensures that banks are bound by reasonable obligations which result in all Australians having access to affordable banking services. By the term `reasonable obligations', I understand the following: that in trying to define what this community service obligation is, the bottom line must be about bank fees, and where there is profitability, the banks must make a commitment to pass on benefits by reducing fees to their customers; that there are community partnerships that look at banks meeting their triple bottom line in terms of meeting their social responsibility to communities, particularly schools and hospitals; that where there are commercial ATMs in place, they are done on a commercial basis but having regard to the profile of particular communities and the viability for smaller business holders who operate in that same locale; and, last but not least, that notification of bank closures is given. In relation to the closure of bank branches, it is not unreasonable to suggest four months notice, and in rural communities, particularly where there is only a single branch, it is not unreasonable to think there might be six months notice so that communities have an opportunity to make plans about what services will be provided.
Just providing that the Treasurer can now place conditions on the approval of reconstructions and amalgamations of banking institutions and withdraw that approval where breaches occur is a good first step, but it can hardly be called a home run when you consider the angst and anxiety amongst consumers. Following recent representations by the Finance Sector Union and the Australian Consumers Association to the Senate Economics Legislation Committee, the Democrats are now calling on the government to support our proposed amendment to require greater public consultation about potential bank mergers and acquisitions and a guarantee to all Australians that their concerns in this regard will be taken into account by the Treasurer before he makes a decision on such matters. In view of the level of public outrage that bank mergers and acquisitions continue to trigger in communities across the country and the Treasurer's intention to attach conditions to any approval that he might give, it seems only sensible that the government should be guided by the views expressed by the broader community who will be impacted upon by his decisions. In the year 2000, it is simply not good enough for the Treasurer to sit behind closed doors and draw up his list of terms and conditions which govern bank mergers and acquisitions; the Treasurer's deliberations should be guided by the views expressed by those individuals, organisations and communities who will be impacted upon by any decision that is taken. 
Similarly, the Treasurer should be required to be accountable to the broader community by responding to the concerns raised with him when he announces his decision in relation to any merger or acquisition. If, in the light of any representations that are made to him, the Treasurer cannot publicly demonstrate that any proposed changes to the structure of the finance sector will be in the national interest, he should not authorise or approve the said merger or acquisition. This requirement would bring the Banking Act into line with similar provisions contained in the Financial Sector (Shareholdings) Act, which requires the approval of the Treasurer when an entity is proposing to acquire more than a 15 per cent stake in a financial sector company. So we are not talking about something new; the precedent is already there.
Associated with the Democrats' call for greater public involvement in the regulation of the financial sector is the need for the Treasurer to publish any conditions imposed on a merger or acquisition. This would enable everyone to understand a number of points: one, why the Treasurer believed that the merger or acquisition would be in the public interest; two, what concerns had been brought to the Treasurer's attention through the process of public consultation; three, the reasons why there was a need for certain conditions or restrictions to be applied for any merger or acquisition; and, four, what areas the public should monitor to ensure that the terms and conditions set down by the Treasurer are met by the institution involved. 
The Democrats have consistently raised concerns about the impact of the banking industry on consumers and, in particular, on rural communities and businesses generally. The issue of accessing banking services has received a great deal of attention over the past few years and is still outstanding. Over that period, bank fees and charges have increased, jobs have been cut, branches have closed and bank profits have soared, along with community dissatisfaction with service delivery. It is with these community concerns in mind that the Democrats call on the government to do more than it is currently proposing in this bill. We believe that our amendments constitute the bare minimum of what is required for the concerns of the community to be addressed and responded to in an appropriate fashion. The level of community consultation and public accountability on the part of the Treasurer which we are proposing in our amendments is no more than that required of other ministers when they are required to make decisions which will impact on the national level. I therefore draw to the attention of the chamber the amendments which the Democrats will seek to move to foster greater accountability and social responsibility in the national financial sector. If we again fail to put in place the legislative framework to encourage banks to act ethically, morally and with greater cultural sensitivity towards the community, we can only expect that the banks will deliver much more of the same.",SENATE,<title>FINANCIAL SECTOR LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,9,1
"Cooney, Sen Barney",ALP,2000-10-31,"—The Financial Sector Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2000, as has been said before by Senator Ridgeway and Senator Conroy, will change to some extent the Banking Act, the Reserve Bank Act, the legislation dealing with superannuation plus some other legislation. It will bring into play more regulation than was there before. This is a typical event that happens these days where it is necessary for parliament to move in to regulate the private sector. It is becoming more and more clear that competition alone is not the regulator of industry that many theorists say it is. But in that context I would like to quote from a book—I have quoted from this book before—by Adolf Berle and Gardiner Means called The modern corporation and private property. The first edition appeared in 1932. Mr Acting Deputy President Murphy, I do not think you were then present. But you were when the revised edition came out, which was prepared by the authors in 1967. It is from that edition that I quote. I think it is just a very interesting quote. On page 308, Berle and Means say:
Finally, when Adam Smith championed competition as the great regulator of industry, he had in mind units so small that fixed capital and overhead costs played a role so insignificant that costs were in large measure determinate and so numerous that no single unit held an important position in the market. Today competition in markets dominated by a few great enterprises has come to be more often either cut-throat and destructive or so inactive as to make monopoly or duopoly conditions prevail. Competition between a small number of units each involving an organization so complex that costs have become indeterminate does not satisfy the condition assumed by earlier economists, nor does it appear likely to be as effective a regulator of industry and of profits as they had assumed.
I think that is very true. So this legislation is an example of where, more and more, parliament has to move in to regulate enterprises. The Telstra act—which I think you had much to do with, Mr Acting Deputy President Murphy—is another example of what has been said here. In this book there is also a discussion of the growth of power, different power groups in the world, and how there is need for society, in light of that growth, to bring in laws. At the risk of perhaps sounding a bit stilted, it is worth reading again from the book. The authors deal with concentrations of power, and they say: 
Such a great concentration of power and such a diversity of interest raise the long-fought issue of power and its regulation—of interest and its protection. A constant warfare has existed between the individuals wielding power, in whatever form, and the subjects of that power. Just as there is a continuous desire for power, so also there is a continuous desire to make that power the servant of the bulk of individuals it affects. The long struggles for the reform of the Catholic Church and for the development of constitutional law in the states are phases of this phenomenon. Absolute power is useful in building the organization. More slow, but equally sure is the development of social pressure demanding that the power shall be used for the benefit of all concerned. This pressure, constant in ecclesiastical and political history, is already making its appearance in many guises in the economic field. 
Senator Conroy, who preceded me in this debate, asked the Bankers Association in Adelaide: do the banks—and business corporations in general I suppose he meant—have any social obligations? The answer was no. I think the sort of approach contained in that answer brings us to great difficulty in society today. There is a need for people to have more of a say in the laws by which big business and, in particular, the banks operate. I am glad to see that Senator Ridgeway has brought forward an amendment which says:
The Treasurer must not make a decision whether to consent to an ADI—
ADI is short for authorised deposit taking institutions, according to the Banking Act, and therefore includes the banks—
entering into an arrangement or agreement, or effecting a reconstruction ... unless the Treasurer has first:
(a) caused for public submissions on the proposal to be called for through a process of national advertising; and
(b) given the public a reasonable period in which to make submissions on the proposal. 
Mr Acting Deputy President, that is a good thing because, as you have put eloquently on many occasions in this chamber, banks do have an effect on our everyday lives and do affect citizens in the same way as churches and political institutions do. It is proper that just as rules and regulations are made for the political process so they should be made for the economic processes and be made from the point of view of the social impacts that they have. There is too much readiness these days to say, `It all has to be worked out in terms of the economy. You have to look at the return to the shareholders.' We learnt all these sorts of things in basic concepts when we first went to law school, as Senator Forshaw will remember. These concepts have been around for years and I think they must give way to new ways of thinking, and this legislation—in particular, the amendments that have been put forward by Senator Conroy and by Senator Ridgeway—deserves mention. 
Mr Acting Deputy President, no doubt you would remember how the banks, the post office, the railway station and the police station for that matter were all part of a township in the old days. I have now got to the point where I want the old days back. They were not as romantic as I now think they were. But there was a time when the local bank manager and the local teller would be part of the community, and they would go to the church and to the balls that were held—
—I remember that too.
—I hope you have some sort of love for that time.
 (Senator Murphy)—Order!
—Through you, Mr Acting Deputy President. 
—Interjections are not acceptable under standing orders.
—We remember those days and we romanticise about them. But it recalls a time when bank staff were very much part of the community. During the depression of the 1930s, I venture to suggest that many banks saw people through very difficult times, and they were loved for it. Until quite recently, banks were respected institutions to which people attached a lot of credibility. Unfortunately, that respect has now gone because the things that used to motivate banks, such as social obligations, have disappeared.
This bill should be passed, but with amendments. In a sense, the banks play too big a part in the economy of this nation. The National Australia Bank, the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Westpac Banking Corporation and the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd are among the biggest companies in this country. However, if we look at the big overseas companies, we will see that banks are not among them. From that fact, I conclude that the banks produce nothing. They serve a useful purpose in making money available to would-be entrepreneurs and they protect the money of those who want to save. In the old days the banks used to help pensioners and those with small deposits, but that is becoming less and less likely. They performed—and still perform—a very useful social function and they give proper returns to their shareholders.  
However, Australian banks do not produce things in the same way as the top European companies. I referred to the magazine produced this Monday by the Australian newspaper on the subject of Europe. It set out the largest European companies. Vodafone, United Kingdom topped the list; followed by Royal Dutch/Shell, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom; BP Amoco, United Kingdom; Nokia, Finland, and so on. All of these companies produce things that we can use to make our lives better and the banks underpin their manufacturing functions. In Australia the banks have reached the point where they dominate too much, and something must be done. I do not think this legislation will achieve that aim, but it purports to bring more rules and regulations into play. The second reading speech states:
The financial sector is a key driver in the economy. The measures contained in this bill will further enhance this sector's ability to contribute to our record economic growth; they help consolidate Australia's position at the leading edge of financial sector reform; and, finally, they contribute to our continued efforts to secure Australia's place as a centre for global financial services. 
They are good and proper ambitions for the government to have and we will see whether it can achieve those goals. It will certainly not do so through this legislation. I do not suppose the government makes that claim, but it purports that this legislation helps it to achieve this purpose and I am not sure that it does.
We must have integrity in the financial system and a reputation that that integrity exists. The same magazine published by the Australian refers to the latest survey conducted by Transparency International. It produces worldwide rankings, awarding a score to indicate whether a country has a good reputation and is above corruption. The top-ranking country—it scored 10 on the scale—was Finland, which makes Nokia. Denmark came next, followed by Sweden and so on—the Nordic countries scored highly. Australia came 13th with 8.3; New Zealand scored 9.4; Canada, 9.2; and Singapore, 9.1.
Singapore is a place where financial transactions are much in evidence, and we as a country are competing against places like Singapore. It is important that our structure—the regulations that we have in place here—is such that our reputation is going to be at least as high as Singapore's. If we are not as corruption free as other countries, it seems unlikely that we will attract great financial centres here. Unless people see us as corruption free, we will have some problems and those problems will persist. Let us make it clear: 8.3 is a good score; to be 13th in the world is very good indeed. But this is a situation where we are up against some very heavy competition indeed, and we need to do something about it.
I think in the end what is needed in the banking sector is a culture and an ethic which returns to the culture and the ethic the banking sector had in the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s and so on, when they did see themselves as people providing services to the community. Mr Acting Deputy President Lightfoot, with the career that you have pursued in Western Australia and with the conditions that exist in the towns of Western Australia, you would understand the importance of the banking industry in these towns. There has been a turning away from the culture and the ethic that the banks used to have. We will perhaps talk more about that when we come to look at the amendments.
But, overall, we are only going to get integrity into the system if there is a change in the culture and the ethics of the banking community. Then, when a person is asked a year or so from now, `Have the banks got any social obligations?' the answer will be, `Yes, of course they have.' In the meantime, we have to persist with regulating the banks in the way that this bill introduced by the government does. We have to try to get the banks to do, by regulation, what they should be in any event doing by their own culture and ethical approach.

"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2000-10-31,"—I rise tonight on the Financial Sector Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2000 just to comment on aspects which relate to superannuation as the Democrat spokesperson for that portfolio. Part 2 of schedule 3 of this bill includes a number of amendments which will impose strict liability in the event of contravention of a number of provisions of the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993. Whilst there are other aspects of this bill which relate to superannuation, I will this evening confine my comments to those amendments related to strict liability.
The traditional rule is that the prosecution in a criminal trial bears the onus of proving the defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. In the adversarial legal system, private individuals accused of criminal offences must defend their personal liberty or property against the state and the vast resources it commands. It has always been considered crucial that certain safeguards, such as the presumption of innocence, be in place to protect the accused.
The current legislative abrogation of individual rights is taking place slowly over many years through technical statutory changes to common law safeguards and has thus avoided attracting a great deal of public attention. In the view of the Democrats, it is vital that such changes be the subject of scrutiny wherever they are proposed. Onus of proof reversals appear in a large number of statutes dealing with a diverse range of activities. Government departments often seek to have such provisions incorporated into legislation on the basis that they are supported by public interest considerations that should take precedence over common law protections afforded to individuals. For example, it might be said that the evidence required is peculiarly within the knowledge of the accused person or too difficult or expensive for the prosecution to otherwise obtain.
A similar desire for administrative efficiency often motivates the creation of strict liability provisions in defiance of fundamental common law principles. Strict liability involves the imposition of a penalty or punishment for an act or omission in respect of which the Crown need not establish any recklessness or blameworthy intent. Such provisions are most common in relation to issues of public health and safety. For example, a dairy farmer might be held strictly liable for the presence of certain harmful bacteria in his or her product, irrespective of whether its presence is the result of recklessness or an improper intent.
Strict liability is a highly effective means of ensuring that all care is taken in such matters. However, it creates a wide net that can catch many innocent people. Strict liability is totally inconsistent with the principle that the prosecution must establish not only the relevant act but also the guilty mind, as it were. This can only be justified in circumstances where there is a compelling public interest, such as the protection of health or safety, and there is no other means of dealing with the problem. The public interest must be so great and the impossibility of alternative approaches so clear that we are prepared to countenance the summary conviction of innocent people.
At this stage the Democrats will not be opposing the amendments in this bill that impose strict liability. But I warn the government that, from this point on, we will be taking a much more critical approach to legislation which imposes strict liability or places the onus of proof on the defendant. It is not the case that we will necessarily be imposing provisions that have one of these effects, but we will be scrutinising them much more closely and requiring that they be justified by overriding public policy rather than administrative expedience.",SENATE,<title>FINANCIAL SECTOR LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,9,1
"Hogg, Sen John",ALP,2000-10-31,"—I rise in this debate this afternoon on the Financial Sector Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2000, having listened to Senator Conroy and Senator Ridgeway. Senator Conroy spoke about the cynicism towards banks. That is borne out nowhere more than in my own state. Recently I was in Gladstone and they complained there about the closure of the Commonwealth Bank branch at Boyne Island. I have also had complaints in respect of my own strip shopping centre in Brisbane, where all the banks have now pulled out—the ANZ, Commonwealth and Westpac. 
With the Commonwealth exhorting people to go and use the facilities of Australia Post through giroPost, people in my area have now found that the transaction fee has gone from $2 to $3. That is a real disincentive to use the post office at all. When you look at a place like Kin Kin—which is a rural area south of Gympie, just west of the highway, in Queensland—where they not only have no banks but have also lost their post office, you find that they are bereft of facilities. I recently received an email complaining that the only opportunity they have is to go to a place such as Cooroy, and that is terribly inconvenient indeed.
When the local Commonwealth Bank closed in my area, I wrote to the local area manager and complained. I complained that the Commonwealth Bank concentrated purely on the commercial imperative of banking and overlooked completely the issue of any community service obligation that it might and should have, given the very privileged position that I believe banks have occupied in Australia over a long period of time.
More recently, the cynicism towards banks has been even more confirmed in my own mind. Having lost the Westpac branch which was close to my office, I set about going to the local service station which had a Westpac ATM. That was a logical thing for me to do. It meant that I did not have to pay a transaction fee. I have availed myself of this on a regular basis over the last two years. However, last Friday I made my visit to the ATM at the local service station and I was surprised that the ATM had a new look about it. When I looked at the ATM, I thought, `Well, this is just an upgrade by the bank.' There was no indication that the ATM had changed hands. There was a flash sign over it saying `ATM' but not indicating which bank had possession of that ATM. It led one to the presumption that it had not changed hands, because there was nothing to indicate that it had changed hands.
I proceeded to make my transaction and, upon the conclusion of my transaction, I looked at the transaction slip to find that it was no longer a Westpac ATM but now a National Australia Bank ATM. Regardless of my own personal choice, I was now going to be slugged with a transaction fee. It came to my attention as I looked around further that littering the area there were more of these almost anonymous ATMs, with no indication as to what bank they belonged to, so that the unsuspecting consumer would be hit by this sneaky transaction fee. It is a sneaky charge that the banks have taken it upon themselves to levy—inordinately, in my view—on customers accessing money from the ATM system. That reinforces the contempt and the cynicism that people have for the banking system. As this bill is before the chamber today, it is an opportune time to record those few facts and my complete disgust with the subterfuge, in effect, that was undertaken in changing the ATM from a Westpac ATM to a NAB ATM without any consultation or without giving any notice to the public whatsoever.
Having said that, I want to focus more on the other aspect of this bill, and that is superannuation. Superannuation is a very important issue—I believe one of the most important issues that we address in this parliament because what it offers and has offered many people is security in employment and their right to enjoy a reasonable retirement. Only since the mid-1980s have we seen superannuation extended to many people in the work force; prior to that it was a right for a privileged few. With the operation of the SGC, superannuation has become far more available to the average person in the work force. This has built up an industry in itself. We have had numerous changes to the legislation since this government has been in power and we have had some more changes placed before us on this occasion to strengthen the policing powers in particular of the regulators of superannuation.
It is interesting that this bill was referred to the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation and Financial Services. I am a member of that Senate select committee, as you are, Mr Acting Deputy President Lightfoot. It is a very important committee. As the witnesses came before the committee when it met in Sydney on 11 July this year to take evidence, it soon became obvious that there had been little or no consultation on this bill whatsoever. Of course, that was one of the things that concerned me greatly. I tried to get to the bottom of why there had been no consultation. I wondered what the criteria were for consultation on this legislation. I asked, I suppose a little smartly in one sense, whether or not the people appearing before us were supporters of a particular football club. I thought that might have been a criterion. What were the criteria that were in place to decide whether one was consulted on this legislation? Of course there were none whatsoever, and that became patently obvious. One of the things given prominence in chapter 2 of the committee's report dated August 2000 is the fact that there was a lack of consultation. That was tagged as one of the most significant issues raised during the inquiry. 
There were organisations appearing before the committee from the superannuation trustees as well as service provider organisations from the super trustees, such as the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia, ASFA; the Australian Institute of Superannuation Trustees, AIST; the Small Independent Superannuation Funds Association, SISFA; the Industry Funds Forum; and the Corporate Super Association. The service providers were the Institute of Actuaries of Australia and the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Australia. So there were quite a range of organisations that had had no consultation whatsoever about the legislation which will stiffen some of the penalties and allow APRA and ASIC to act in a more forthright way. 
The fact that there was no consultation is very concerning indeed. At point 2.8 on page 6, the report notes a comment by SISFA. It says:
... it is extremely disappointing that it was introduced without any industry consultation or without the presentation of any evidence to highlight the insufficiencies in the current regime. Industry consultation should take place to discuss any of the problems, if any, being encountered by the regulators and to discuss appropriate solutions.
Further on, at point 2.10, the report says:
The Corporate Super Association also expressed its preference for consultation to have occurred prior to the Bill's introduction, describing the Bill as `bolt out of the blue'.
The report goes on to note, though, that, subsequent to that being a matter of contention at the committee's inquiry on that day, there was some industry consultation done. However, it is interesting to note the response of the regulators. That is summed up at point 2.18, which I think shows that they were a bit high-handed. It says:
All policy officials and most regulators agreed that there had been no consultation with industry prior to the introduction of the Bill ...
The report goes on:
... there was no real need for consultation.
At point 2.19, the report says:
APRA advised that, as the legislation was being developed by Treasury, it believed that it was Treasury's responsibility to conduct appropriate consultations. APRA also advised that, like Treasury, it saw no real need for consultation because of the specialised and technical nature of the proposed amendments.
—The left arm did not know what the right arm was doing.
—That is right. As Senator Sherry said, the left hand did not know what the right hand was doing. This was completely unforgivable. Here we were with a number of witnesses totally put out by the fact that there had been no consultation on the proposed changes and the legislation. For Treasury and APRA to merely say that there was no real need for consultation is just completely unforgivable. When those sorts of comments are made, one sees that cynicism can breed very quickly in organisations such as the service providers and in the organisations representing the superannuation trustees. I think that should have taught those officials that it is always good practice to consult, as the Labor members on the committee surmised in an addendum to the report of the committee. They said that, on matters such as this, there should be consultation and there should never be a presumption that there is no need to consult whatsoever.  
As I said, the Labor senators did take the time to put an addendum to the report highlighting a number of issues, including the government's failure to consult and the case for change. In looking at the issue of the case for change, the Labor senators' statement acknowledged:
... the evidence ... suggests that the current system works well.
The Labor senators' statement indicated:
... APRA strongly argued that the legislative changes in this bill would have assisted it in taking action against some five or six trustees representing around 50-200 fund members and some $0.5-$10 million were under risk.
One wonders whether one is taking a sledgehammer to crack a small nut in passing this piece of legislation. But superannuation is the most important thing for people in their retirement and, as the Labor senators said, governments should always make protecting the interests of fund members a top priority. With that in mind, the Labor senators acknowledged that the proposals of the government in this piece of legislation, whilst not necessarily needed, were welcome if they were going to protect the rights of individuals to their superannuation, but the Labor senators also said that there was a real need for this to be monitored over a period of time to ensure that none of the practices were abused by the regulators as a result of this legislation.
The last item that I want to address briefly is another item in the Labor senators' addendum, which went to the issue of the preservation of the representative super trustee system. One of the bits of evidence that came before us on the committee was that the new legislation may well deter people who are members of funds from becoming trustees. Whilst we acknowledged in our addendum statement that this was not necessarily going to be the case—because the evidence of ASIC, APRA, Attorney-General's and Treasury said that it was not the intention to persecute those people who take on the important role of a member trustee, and we accept that—we nonetheless accept in good faith some of the evidence that was given to us suggesting that people may well shy away from the threat of the penalties in this legislation for failing to comply with the filing of documents and with other pieces of the legislation. We felt nonetheless that we would see, arising from this, goodwill on the part of the government and on the part of the agencies to ensure that people are still encouraged, are still not threatened by the legislation and are still, therefore, able to become trustees of funds. The fact that there are member trustees on these funds has protected the lifelong superannuation interests of many of the people in these funds, and it would be a shame if, as a result of this legislation, we found that people were deterred from becoming trustees.
In the event that a trustee is now going to be prosecuted under the new liability provisions—and the liability has changed from being a fault liability to a strict liability—we understand that a defence is available that should provide trustees with a legitimate way of avoiding prosecution. We understand, though—and we say in our statements—that the new liability provisions should be closely monitored by the parliament. We also say in our report that the trustee system should remain a cornerstone of the superannuation system and provide ordinary fund members with much confidence and opportunity. It would be a shame if, as a result of this piece of legislation, ordinary people were not prepared to participate in the running and the governing of their funds. As we said in our report, this has been one of the highlights of a system developed in Australia as a result of the initiatives of the Labor government in the early stages of the advent of broad superannuation being available to people in the work force, and that has to remain one of the cornerstones, otherwise we will see superannuation fall into the hands of those who want to prey on the funds that are available to workers in their retirement.",SENATE,<title>FINANCIAL SECTOR LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,9,1
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2000-10-31,"—The Financial Sector Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2000 contains four broad measures: it alters the credential regulation of authorised deposit taking institutions, it rationalises and consolidates the Commonwealth unclaimed money provisions, it simplifies and modernises service provisions in the Reserve Bank Act 1959, and it alters superannuation laws by strength-ening the enforcement provisions of the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993—commonly known as the SI(S) Act—and facilitating the application of the Commonwealth's criminal code to certain offences in the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act. It is this latter series of changes that I want to make some specific observations about, and it is these provisions that were referred to the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation and Financial Ser-vices, of which I am deputy chair. 
There was a very fine contribution from my colleague Senator Conroy about the role of banks in the context of the proposed sections in the legislation that deal with banking law in this country. Senator Conroy, who will be handling this legislation, will be moving an amendment relating to a fit and proper person test for persons who apply for bank licences. It is an important issue and Senator Conroy raised a number of other important matters relating to the very, very poor—indeed, appalling—conduct and practices of some banking institutions in this country.
To return to the superannuation provisions, the proposed amendments change the regulatory framework in the following specific areas: amendments to facilitate the application of the criminal code to certain offence provisions; conversion of fault liability offences to strict liability, or two-tier, offences; a new power to enable regulators to disqualify persons who are judged not fit and proper from managing superannuation savings in certain circumstances; power to allow regulators to accept enforceable undertakings from a superannuation fund trustee; extension of the time limit in which prosecutions may be commenced; removal of immunity from prosecution in relation to certain evidence; measures to prevent persons holding themselves out to be auditors or actuaries without the requisite qualifications; and, finally, measures requiring former trustees to assist acting trustees. In considering the Senate select committee's report on this legislation, it is important to highlight the unanimous conclusions of—and some criticisms made by—the committee, and I do note in passing that the membership of the committee includes Senator Allison, Senator McGauran, Senator Lightfoot and my colleague Senator Hogg. With respect to the unanimous observations of the Senate committee, the committee points out on page 21 of its report:
... it is good practice to consult with stakeholders likely to be affected. In the view of the Committee, some of the industry's uncertainties and fears of the proposed legislation may have been avoided if consultation had occurred at an earlier stage.
The Committee notes the absence of such consultation prior to the introduction of the Bill and considers that it is regrettable that such consultation did not occur.
This is a reference to the approach of Treasury and APRA. It is very clear from the evidence that, as my colleague Senator Hogg has described, the two important arms of government bureaucracy and regulatory enforcement did not know what the other was doing, and this is very regrettable. Should the fault be sheeted home to the two regulatory authorities—Treasury and APRA? I do not blame those two organisations. This government has developed an unfortunate tendency to blame the bureaucracy, the public servants. But who is the political master? It is the minister responsible for ensuring that consultation takes place—none other than the Assistant Treasurer, Senator Kemp. Need I say more? We often hear from Senator Kemp, the Assistant Treasurer, in this place and during the estimates hearings that he is consultative and that government is consultative. It is the Assistant Treasurer's responsibility to ensure that organisations such as APRA and Treasury undertake the critical consultation in those areas affected by the changes we are considering in this legislation. I do not blame the public servants, APRA and Treasury; the responsibility lies with Senator Kemp, the Assistant Treasurer. He has policy direction in this area. Need I say more? 
Putting aside those criticisms, Labor senators have a number of other concerns about the legislation. APRA did argue for the legislative changes in this bill. They did point out that, if the proposed changes were in fact law, there would be five or six trustees representing around 50 to 200 fund members with assets of some $0.5 million to $10 million that were apparently under risk; and that the changes could have meant more effective supervision, regulation and possible prosecution. The information provided by APRA was not as detailed as the committee would have liked. We were not easily able to compare the information provided to us by APRA but, even in the context of the $450 billion in savings in superannuation, the modest sums of $0.5 million to $10 million under risk are important. They are important to those individuals whose money is at risk, even though the amounts of money are quite small compared with total superannuation savings. 
We also point out in our report that, if governments are required to outlay funds for retirement income support, it is important that there is effective supervision in this area. Governments should always make protecting the interests of fund members the top priority. Obviously, the continued growth of superannuation, albeit at a much slower pace than would have occurred under Labor's co-contribution policy and without the dreaded surcharge tax, will require even greater vigilance against theft, fraud or bad risk management practices. Regarding theft and fraud, it was the Labor government—and I understand this is unique in the world—that introduced provisions to ensure 100 per cent protection against theft and fraud. I note in passing that it was this Liberal government that attempted some months ago to reduce the 100 per cent protection in the event of theft and fraud down to 80 per cent. At times you really have to question the bona fides of the government's approach in this area. 
The current system of superannuation we have in this country is regarded as world's best practice. It attracts a great deal of international attention and it is a system where an ordinary fund member can become a member of the trustee board and directly influence the decisions of the fund. This is a very important cornerstone of Australia's superannuation system. If there are changes that are to be made that do impose a greater regulatory burden on trustees, they do have to be examined critically. On balance, the changes that are proposed in this legislation are worthy of support. They will enhance the protective provisions and they will enhance and improve the onus on trustees. I do not think they are over the top in the sense of being draconian. These changes that are being introduced are apparently being introduced right across the financial system—I certainly hope that we are going to see these changes introduced right through the financial system. There is the issue of compliance cost, and there will be an increased compliance burden. It is hard to quantify, but we have to weigh up the cost of the additional compliance against the enhanced protections that will result from the amendments that will be passed.
Before I conclude, and while I am speaking on the issue of superannuation, there are two issues that I want to touch on briefly. Firstly, I have had a matter referred to me by the member for Braddon, Mr Sidebottom. He is the new Labor member for Braddon and a very effective representative on behalf of his constituents. He has drawn to my attention an issue relating to the superannuation guarantee entitlements of car salespersons who work under the vehicle industry repair service and retail federal award. Apparently, in this industry car salespersons receive a basic award payment under the provisions of the award, but a significant part of their taxable income is made up of commissions on the sale of motor vehicles. Close to 50 per cent of the income of car salespersons is derived from commissions. If we look at the vehicle industry repair service and retail federal award, the particular clause which outlines the base on which superannuation contributions is calculated, clause 51(a)(iv), is silent in defining ordinary time earnings for the purposes of superannuation payments. Apparently, many employers—at least up until now—have been in the practice of including commissions for the purposes of superannuation contribution. But, according to some advice by the Tasmanian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, they believe this is not correct and that employers have ceased paying superannuation guarantee contributions in respect of car salespersons' commissions. 
The particular clause in the award is silent on this matter. I have written to the tax office today about this matter. There are representatives of the Assistant Treasurer, Senator Kemp, in the Senate chamber, and I ask them to follow through on this issue so that the matter of the payments that car salespeople should—in my view—fairly receive can be resolved as quickly as possible. It also raises the issue of whether, given that some superannuation payments have been made in respect of commissions, the employer can take the money back from the superannuation fund. That is a second, and I think important, issue. I have my doubts that that can occur. That is the first issue I wanted to raise. The second issue—again referred to me by Mr Sidebottom, the Labor member for Braddon—relates to the hardship provisions.
—Yes, go Sid! He is a very effective representative on behalf of his constituents, as was illustrated at the last election when, of the seats that we won, Braddon had the largest swing to Labor in the country.
—We will see what happens at the next election. My tip, Senator Campbell, is that Mr Sidebottom will increase his vote, but we will see. I notice you have not even got an application for endorsement yet in the seat of Braddon. But, to return to the hardship provisions, this government introduced very specific hardship provisions for superannuation, and it laid out a series of clearly defined definitions for hardship application. Through Mr Sidebottom I have had correspondence from a dairy farmer on the north-west coast of Tasmania. The farmer has been receiving farm household support payments—known as restart income support payments—for over 26 weeks. As the minister's advisers would know, the hardship provisions under the act and the regulations refer to receipt of social security payments for more than 26 weeks as being one of the criteria for application for access to superannuation benefits in the event of hardship. Senator McGauran from the National Party should, I think, take particular interest in this. We know that the National Party have not been representing the interests of rural and regional Australia. It is interesting to observe that farmers are referring this to a Labor member, not a National Party member.
—That is right, you would not find one in Tasmania—the poor old National Party. No, I will not remind Senator McGauran about his part in the triumphant performance of the National Party in Tasmania.
—Two per cent, I think.
—Two per cent? I think they struggled to get two per cent, Senator O'Brien. But, anyway, the important thing is that this dairy farmer wishes to access part of their superannuation under the hardship provisions. We all know of the struggle that many dairy farmers have at the present time because of the consequences of the deregulation of the dairy industry—which, I might say, the National Party supported. I am not sure about Queensland, but certainly Senator McGauran in Victoria supported the deregulation of the dairy industry. Apparently, in the definition of social security payments under the SIS regulations, the restart income support payment is not an eligible payment for the purposes of access to superannuation.
I have not yet written to Senator Kemp about this matter. His advisers are here, and I urge them to have a close look at this matter very urgently, because I do not think that the dairy farmer that I am referring to would be standing alone; I am sure there are other dairy farmers, and other farmers, who are in receipt of restart income support payments and who have been excluded by the Liberal government's hardship provisions from accessing part of their superannuation. I am sure there are other farmers in this country who should—in terms of fairness, equity and balance, if we are to have these rules—be able to access their superannuation payments. From my research, the restart income support payments have, by not being included in the definitions, effectively excluded farmers in these very dire circumstances. 
The Labor Party is supporting the legislation. There are a number of important amendments. As I said earlier, my colleague Senator Conroy is moving an amendment in respect of fit and proper persons in regard to banking licences, and there are some other Labor amendments that go to ensuring that the provisions the government is seeking to impose on superannuation trustees are in fact imposed and replicated right through the financial system. We do not want a situation where there is increased imposition on superannuation trustees that is not also applied to other players in the financial system. That would be unfair. If there is to be improved regulation—which Labor believes is important to ensure safety, security and general protection—then it should apply right through the financial system.
To conclude, I do not blame Treasury and APRA for the lack of consultation. We know lack of consultation was a problem. I would urge Senator Kemp, the Assistant Treasurer, who is ultimately responsible in these areas, to lift his game. If he is fair dinkum about consultation, the minister as the person who is responsible should not blame the bureaucrats—there is enough of that going on at the moment, should not blame the public servants, should not blame Treasury and APRA. They are hard-working, dedicated and committed officials. The buck stops with the minister on this matter, and he has just got to improve his game when it comes to consultation on these sorts of superannuation changes.",SENATE,<title>FINANCIAL SECTOR LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,9,1
"Murphy, Sen Shayne",ALP,2000-10-31,"—I just want to make a few comments about the Financial Sector Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2000, which seeks to make a number of changes to a number of acts. The area I particularly want to look at is the Banking Act 1959 and the effect the bill will have on the regulation of ADIs. The bill seeks to allow for conditions to be placed on approvals for mergers, acquisitions and restructures of ADIs under section 63 of the Banking Act 1959, provides APRA with the power to seek an injunction to stop breaches of sections 7, 8, 66, 66A and 67 and conditions made under subsection 63(1) to enable APRA subject to court approval to act pre-emptively to stop undesirable activities rather than simply acting to impose punishment after the damage has occurred.
Just going to the first part of that—which relates to mergers, acquisitions, et cetera—we know that the Commonwealth Bank has recently taken over Colonial State and in my state what was Colonial Trust Bank. I found a very interesting situation developed because, as a result of that takeover, the Commonwealth Bank was required to give undertakings to the ACCC and in part those undertakings made some very clear statements. I would like to read some of those undertakings that were given to the ACCC in respect of the point I seek to make about this matter, which relates to a constituent who came in to see me with regard to an issue of increased fees. The undertaking said in respect of pricing, service quality and product range:
The Commonwealth is obliged to provide customers in Tasmania and regional New South Wales with pricing and service quality that is equivalent to or more favourable than that supplied to customers in metropolitan New South Wales, make available to customers in Tasmania and regional New South Wales the same standard products subject to certain conditions that are available to CBA customers in metropolitan New South Wales, and pay the costs of and provide information to an independent monitor who will be appointed to report to the commission on the CBA's compliance with these undertakings.
As I said, I had a constituent, who was in fact a war widow pensioner, who came in to my office to complain about the fact that she was now required to pay a $3 fee on every transaction she conducted with the bank—that is, $3 for a war widow pensioner for every transaction. The circumstances were that she had been a long-term customer of Trust Bank and subsequently Colonial Trust Bank when Colonial State bought the old Trust Bank of Tasmania. Under the old arrangements she filled out a form she got from the department, and she was exempted with the Trust Bank from paying fees at all. When Colonial State took over, as I understand it, they brought in a position where they allowed all passbook holders, not just war widow pensioners, to have 16 free transactions a month—that is, I assume, electronic transactions—and four free over-the-counter transactions per month. For most pensioners that would be a reasonable, acceptable position. But, oh no, not the good old Commonwealth—she's three bucks up-front, thank you very much. 
I asked my staff to contact the Launceston branch of the Commonwealth Bank, and they did. They spoke to a person in the customer service area who said, `Oh no, you send your constituent back down. They don't have to pay that fee at all.' So we advised the constituent of this, and off they duly trotted down to the Commonwealth Bank in Laun-ceston. But when they got there they were told, `Oh no, we made a mistake. We didn't advise Senator Murphy's office correctly. You do have to pay $3 per transaction.' So the constituent came back and told us. We rang up again, and this time we got to speak to the manager, Mr Darren Fraser, who said, `Oh no. Sorry. The information we gave you earlier was incorrect. They do have to pay three bucks every time they do a transaction.'
So I thought, `Okay, that's fair enough.' So we did a little bit of research, and found that the Commonwealth Bank has a position in respect of pensioners per se on their Net site. So we got on the Net and had a little bit of a look to see what the requirements are, and we saw that if you have been an existing customer of the Commonwealth Bank since prior to October 1997 you can get a rebate with respect to transactions—be they over the counter or otherwise. How very interesting. So I wrote a letter to the Commonwealth Bank. I wrote to Mr David Murray, who seems to be doing very well these days, and I said:
I am writing in regard to the Commonwealth Bank's special rebates offered to aged or war veteran pensioners. According to the Commonwealth Bank's web site, to be eligible for the special rebate of $6 per month a person must prove that they were an existing customer as at 31 October 1997 and are in receipt of an Australian aged or war veterans pension.
In relation to the mergers between and takeovers by the Commonwealth Bank with or of other financial institutions, what is the situation for customers who were gained through these processes? Are they recognised as new customers when it comes to the special rebate clause for aged or war veteran pensioners, or are they treated differently from existing Commonwealth Bank customers and therefore not eligible for the rebate?
I would appreciate it if you could provide me with an explanation in regard to these questions.
That was on 27 September this year. I got a letter back from the head of customer relations on 4 October. It said:
Thank you for your letter addressed to David Murray which was received at this office on 3 October. The issues you raised have been noted and to allow an appropriate response to be prepared it has been necessary to forward your letter to another area within the bank for their input, comment and action.
Thank you for taking the time to write. You can expect a written response to your letter within 21 days.
Remember the date—4 October I got that response back. That is not really a satisfactory answer, so I got my office to ring the bank again. On 9 October they rang the CBA and said, `This is just unacceptable. It is a very simple question. You people can either respond to this issue and say that these people will be treated the same or indicate otherwise.' I should just go back a few steps here because when we got to speak to the Launceston manager he said, `The pensioner is not entitled to a rebate, but you send her back down to the bank and we will fix it for her'—for that one pensioner, not for the rest; they are going to fix it for one.
I wrote to the bank and said, `This is totally unacceptable,' and I rang the bank and let them know my view that I thought they were in breach of the undertakings that they had given. They said, `We are sorry, Senator, that you are not happy with the response.' To cut a long story short, when we rang them again on 24 October—and this was despite the fact that we had already made numerous phone calls to them—they said that they were drafting a response to my letter, that the response was being finalised. As I said, this was on 24 October. In fact they rang on Tuesday to advise that a response had been prepared and that it would be received in the next few days.
As I said, we rang on 24 October and they apologised for the delays due to last-minute editing and long sign-off procedures—they certainly have long sign-off procedures in the Commonwealth Bank. But they said the letter would be posted today or, at worst, tomorrow and that I would definitely get a response by the end of the week. It is now 31 October and I still have not heard anything from the Commonwealth Bank or Mr Murray about their policy for the treatment of people that become customers of the bank as a result of takeovers and/or acquisitions. I think, frankly, the Commonwealth Bank have now left me with no option but to ask the ACCC to investigate the matter, because I have a clear view that they are indeed in breach of their undertakings. 
Regarding the other aspects of what this legislation will do, I now want to briefly address questions that go to the issue of undesirable activities by bankers, directors and officers. I have raised issues in this chamber on a number of occasions concerning undesirable activities that relate to a former trust bank in my state. I have raised these matters with APRA, who at one point in time informed me—and I do not want to quote this as a verbatim statement from them—that they have no power to act unless the actions of the directors or the management threaten the security of depositors' funds. Fair enough; so you can do all sorts of things within a bank—the management can do crooked things within a bank—but as long as you do not threaten depositors' funds it does not matter. I have to say I found that—and still find that—a most unacceptable situation. I hope this proposed amending legislation will fix a few of these sorts of problems.
The directors of the former Trust Bank in Tasmania paid themselves, on the sale of the Trust Bank to Colonial State, a retirement allowance of over $0.5 million. You may say, `So what? That is fair enough.' But the problem is that I could not find any legislation or any proposal that actually designated them with the ability to pay themselves a retirement allowance of over $0.5 million. So I went to the legislation which essentially governed the then Trust Bank of Tasmania, which was the trustee banks act. It says:
Directors: The General Council shall elect so many—
and so on. And at section 3 it says:
The Director may be paid and receive such remuneration as is determined by the General Council and approved by the Governor—
that is, the Governor of the state. I thought I would write to the Governor and ask him if he had approved a process that allowed for the directors of the bank to pay themselves a retirement allowance. I wrote on 11 October:
Your Excellency
I would very much appreciate your advice on a certain matter I am looking into. 
Under the Trust Bank Sale Act 1999—
again this was the subsequent act that the bank was sold under—
it states in Schedule 1 - Membership and Meetings of Board - regarding Remuneration, &c,of members:
3.(1) A member of the Board is to be paid such remuneration, expenses and allowances as the Governor may determine.
What I am seeking to determine is whether you or any previous Tasmanian Governor received and approved recommendation from the Board of Trust Bank in respect of Directors Entitlements or Benefits, in particular, Directors Retirement Benefits. 
If so, when did the relevant Governor approve those recommendations and what was the basis for approving these payments?
I would be grateful for your assistance ...
I got a response back on 17 October from the aide-de-camp, who said:
The Governor has asked me to respond to your letter of 11 October, which he received today. If the Governor exercised any function under the Trust Bank Sale Act 1999, it would be in his capacity as Governor-in-Council. If you wish to pursue this inquiry, you should therefore direct it to the Secretary of the Executive Council.
Now wait for this—the response went on to say:
However, as you would be aware, the deliberations of the Executive Council are confidential.
How do the people of a state ever get to know whether due process has been followed in respect of the transactions and the payments, et cetera, of the directors of a bank? How do they ever understand and find that out? It would appear there is no capacity. Again, I just hope that APRA, with the amendments that this legislation would provide, will get the opportunity to actually look at some of these things. 
Further, there was a case involving some very senior officials of the bank with regard to the purchase and sale of motor vehicles. These are matters that I asked the Tasmanian police to investigate. One went to the question of the managing director of the bank selling his personal car into the bank's car pool—of course I have raised this issue previously. At the end of the day, the legislation is very clear in respect of the operation of the bank. I have great difficulty, as I did when I raised these issues with APRA, in understanding why they could not act. They said that they had no power to act. I will be listening to the government when it explains this legislation as to whether or not this will grant APRA the power to actually take a course of action if an issue is raised with them by a customer of the bank or, indeed, someone who is not a customer, whether they will be able to investigate the issue and whether they will have the capacity to, as it says in the explanatory memorandum, to root out `undesirable activities'.
Another case involved a senior bank official who wanted to purchase a car that was repossessed by the bank. There is nothing wrong with that, but this person took the car and hid it for almost eight weeks. Why did the person hide the car? Why didn't the person just go through due process and approach the bank's management or the board and say, `I would like to make an offer on this repossessed car and, whilst you are considering the offer, can the selling of this car be put on hold?' That would not be an unreasonable position to take, and indeed it would not be an unreasonable thing for the board to do if it had the car under offer from an officer of the bank. I would accept that as a reasonable explanation. But, no, this guy took the car and hid it. I do not know whether he rented the particular garage—it was not far from my place actually—for the specific purposes of hiding the car, but that is what he did. I suggest that to any reasonable person that is an unacceptable practice from a very senior manager of the bank.
Another interesting action by the bank's managing director was the granting of $100,000 sponsorship to a Mr Owen Lindsay Parkinson. Mr Parkinson received a sponsorship grant from Trust Bank for $100,000 for the purposes of sponsoring motor racing. Prior to him getting his sponsorship grant of $100,000, Mr Owen Lindsay Parkinson had twice been convicted of deception in Tasmania. Mr Owen Lindsay Parkinson at the time of receiving the $100,000 sponsorship grant did not even own a motor racing car. Of course, this caused a bit of a problem with the bank, so they asked, `How do we fix it?' Mr Parkinson applied for a $90,000-odd loan to buy a car. So the bank lends Mr Parkinson the $90,000-odd to buy the car, but the deal was that he had to pay them back out of his sponsorship money. That is an odd sort of transaction; it is very interesting. I would like to bank with that bank; I surely would. I would like the bank to give me a sponsorship deal that says, `You can buy something and then pay us back with our own money.' I have to say for the police that, when they investigated this, they said that there had never been a transaction like this before in the history of the bank and there was not one since, at least until it was sold at the end of last year.
These examples have to be considered to be `undesirable activities' by any measure. I know that the good old bank's position in the community has taken a battering—and why? Look at the bashing that we get from time to time over various things, but when you look at these circumstances, you ask, `How is this acceptable?' I put it to APRA, and of course I got the old answer: `We cannot do anything unless it threatens the security of the depositors' funds.' I say to the government that I hope that, through this legislation, they will not accept these sorts of practices and that they will get rid of them. These matters should not just be a question of whether or not there is a threat to the security of depositors' funds; they must be stopped. It is unfortunate that the circumstances have passed us by to some extent, although I am not so sure about that yet. I think that, at the end of the day, we will get somewhere with regard to Trust Bank and the issues surrounding it. It may well take the Tasmanian people to do something about it, and I hope they will.

"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,2000-10-31,"—Like many senators around the chamber, we have been utterly gripped by the second reading debate on the Financial Sector Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2000! Because I have a number of other issues, I have not been able to focus totally on the contributions that have been made, but Senator Ian Campbell pointed out to me that a number of the usual suspects got to their feet—Senator Sherry, Senator Conroy and you, Mr Acting Deputy President Murphy, and I walked in at the end of your remarks. I tried to get a view on the quality of speeches that the terrible trio produced, but I was sorry to hear that, once again, they had not added much to the sum of human knowledge and, to the extent they made any points, they were rather poorly informed, which always surprises me because the Labor Party—I am not one to not give credit where credit is due—does have a number of fairly good advisers. I have never criticised Labor Party advisers. I just think those advisers must be in despair to have such poor senators. I cannot really assist the Labor Party in any way—
—Mr Acting Deputy President, on a point of order to do with relevance: this bill contains provisions on superannuation, which is actually in the portfolio area of the minister on his feet. He could dazzle us with his brilliance and make a contribution on the bill just by looking at the title.
 (Senator Murphy)—What is your point of order?
—I think relevance. He could talk about the bill with ease. 
—I am sure the minister is getting to the point in his contribution.
—I was just making some observations on the contributions that a number of senators had made, and I was giving a bit of the flavour of the advice that I had received from my colleague about the quality of those contributions. Nonetheless, there were a number of other contributions made. I have no doubt that the minister on whose behalf we are taking this bill through—the Minister for Financial Services and Regulation, the Hon. Joe Hockey, a very distinguished minister who may have slightly more respect for Senator Conroy than I actually do, but not much—will have listened very carefully to the remarks that were being made and will doubtless evaluate them in the same way that I would probably evaluate your remarks, Senator Conroy. Normally when we finish the second reading debate we get up and thank honourable senators for their contribution. In light of some of the contributions, I am not sure I can say that in all good conscience, but I am sure that Mr Hockey will carefully read the remarks which have been made.
—All class, like your president.
—Order!
—I am very glad I have your protective arm, Mr Acting Deputy President, to save me from Senator Conroy! The last few years have seen some major changes in the regulation of the financial system in Australia, largely as a consequence of the government's response to the recommendation to the financial systems inquiry. This is one of the many areas of reform which this government—
—Is that the Ralph report or the Wallis inquiry?
—Senator Conroy asks whether that is the Ralph report. I regret to say that that is the quality of Labor senators. Somehow they have to draw from a wider pool than the trade union movement. I think you are too narrowly focused. Your advisers would tell you, Senator Conroy, that that is the Wallis inquiry, not the Ralph inquiry. 
—Your advisers are blushing over there, Rod.
—Senator, if I were you, I would not look behind you. Greg Sword has summed you up very well, in my view.
—Minister, it is appropriate to direct your remarks through the chair.
—Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. I was a bit critical of Greg Sword in the days of your government, but I think he has properly evaluated Senator Conroy, and in respect of that matter alone I am on the Greg Sword bandwagon. Although the bulk of the reforms of the financial system are now in place following the Wallis report—not, as you said, Senator Conroy, the Ralph inquiry: just a little correction there for you—reform is an ongoing process, and this bill is a further step towards ensuring that the regulation of the Australian financial system remains world's best practice. The bill achieves this by amending provisions in the Banking Act which will enhance the prudential regulation of authorised deposit taking institutions.
—Are you reading my speech?
—Senator Conroy, if you read the speeches that your advisers prepared for you, you would probably do a little bit better. You get into trouble when you vary too much from what your advisers prepare. I cannot believe that people who have otherwise got taste could be bothered working for senators like Senator Conroy. It just amazes me. Still, we live and learn.
The bill also substantially improves the enforcement regime for the superannuation industry in Australia. Given the sheer number and diversity of participants in the industry, an effective enforcement regime is a crucial part of the prudential framework. The pool of superannuation savings in Australia is currently around $450 billion and continues to grow rapidly—a huge increase since this government came into office. Within 12 months of us coming to office Senator Sherry said that confidence in superannuation will collapse. That is one of the many serious errors that Senator Sherry has made in relation to superannuation. As I said, the exciting thing is that superannuation is one of Australia's great growth industries, as it should be, and it continues to grow rapidly.
—Thirteen minutes to go, Rod.
—Senator Conroy, if you are not careful, I will speak for the full 13 minutes. One of the remarks that some Labor senators made that I did pick up on was that somehow there had been a lack of consultation on this matter. I know Mr Hockey very well and he, like myself, is a consultative minister. This, as I have said, is a consultative government. I know there have been a number of meetings. I think Ms Susan Ryan's name was mentioned. Indeed, I have met with Ms Ryan on issues which are relevant to my portfolio, and I have no doubt that Mr Hockey has ensured similar access. I understand that in some areas there may have been a misconception about what was in this bill. We were able to ease some of the concerns that Ms Ryan and others had. Let me conclude, because I think we are all anxious to proceed to the committee stage of the bill.
—We're prepared to send out a search party to find Campbell.
—Like Senator Conroy, we are all missing Ian Campbell. You are not the only one.
—Not as much as you are. You're dying.
—Well, that is probably true, but I think it is good for a younger senator to sit here and have to put up with the problem of dealing with people like you, Senator Conroy.
—Minister, direct your remarks through the chair and Senator Conroy should cease interjecting.
—Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. The amendments in this bill will help ensure that the pool of savings is adequately protected by promoting adherence to sound prudential management policies and practices. I look forward to the interesting debate that we will certainly have in the committee stage of the bill. I call for perhaps a little better quality performance from Senator Conroy. We do not expect a lot, Senator Conroy. I make that point to you: we do not expect a lot from you. But if you could slightly lift your game, I think it would cause a great deal of pleasure right round this chamber.

"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2000-10-31,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
I draw the attention of the Senate to the 1999-2000 annual report of the Australian Electoral Commission and in particular the discussion in section 1 of the document which deals with performance outcomes against the AEC's performance benchmarks in relation to the electoral roll and the procedure for enrolment. The AEC reports that, although there has been a high degree of satisfaction from clients of the AEC and in terms of its own internal processes for auditing performance with its standards, the survey which it conducted and upon which it reports also identified further improvements that could be made in the areas of `enhanced product functionality'—that is the author's language—in relation to electoral roll management. In that regard, I wish to draw to the attention of the Senate proposals that were published on 18 October last by the Special Minister of State, Senator Ellison, in relation to the management of the electoral roll and in particular measures to ensure that the enrolments of persons on the electoral roll were appropriately verified in the same manner as other important qualifications of citizens, including passports for instance, are required to be verified. 
On 19 October, Senator Ellison released some draft regulations which he foreshadowed would be brought to the parliament later in the year. In a media release that he issued accompanying those regulations, he said:
The multiple cases of electoral fraud in Queensland over the past three years provide a powerful rationale for strengthening electoral involvement provisions aimed at preventing fraud ...
Senator Ellison went on to say:
If the States and the ALP are genuine about maintaining the integrity of the electoral system they will support the Federal Government's regulations, and introduce complimentary legislation to protect state rolls ...
Perhaps to the surprise of most, though not to the surprise of people as sceptical of the motives of the Queensland government as I am, the Premier of Queensland, Mr Beattie, immediately attacked Senator Ellison's proposals to protect the integrity of the electoral roll. Honourable senators might be forgiven for thinking that, if there were one politician in the entire Commonwealth of Australia today who ought to be too embarrassed to criticise a proposal to protect the integrity of electoral rolls, it would be the Premier of Queensland, Mr Beattie, particularly in view of what has been revealed by Karen Ehrmann in the District Court in Townsville, by me in this place and most recently by the Four Corners program, which so many of us observed last night. 
Notwithstanding that, in the Townsville Bulletin on Saturday, 20 October, Mr Beattie shamelessly said:
This is about taking out Labor voters, disenfranchising indigenous Australians, taking out the poor and doing over people who find it hard to meet the criteria the federal government is pursuing. The problem is if you are an indigenous community you do not have the stack of requirements that they want.
What are these onerous requirements which Senator Ellison is proposing to maintain to protect the integrity of the electoral roll and which Mr Beattie claims—somewhat disingenuously, it must be said—are too burdensome for ordinary Australians, including indigenous Australians? By regulation 12, the proposal in the draft regulations would require that, in order to be placed upon the electoral roll, an applicant for enrolment should produce one of 14 documents, including documents as difficult to produce as a birth certificate, a drivers licence, a passport, a social security concession card, a veterans' affairs concession card, any proof of age card or a document not mentioned in any of the preceding items in the schedule that is accepted by the Electoral Commission as evidence of the identity of the person. It is perfectly plain from the scrutiny of the proposed regulations that the requirements are not onerous.

"Mason, Sen Brett",LP,2000-10-31,"—I wish to congratulate the Australian Electoral Commission on a marvellous annual report. I think sometimes it is easy to forget that Australia has one of the fairest and most transparent electoral systems in the world. That is in no small part a result of the work and the commitment of officers of the Australian Electoral Commission. I think it is fair to say that it is respected by all major Australian political parties and indeed by the broader community. 
This annual report addresses many major issues, some of which are: the maintenance of the electoral roll; the conduct of electoral redistributions; the conduct of federal elections, referendums and by-elections; the conduct of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission elections, industrial elections and ballots for other organisations; the registration of political parties; and, of course, electoral education. In fact, outcome 3 in the annual report states:
The commission hopes to develop an Australian community which is well informed about electoral matters.
In a country like Australia, where voting is compulsory, that is a special and particular responsibility of the Electoral Commission. It is sad that in Australia sometimes we take all this for granted. Our democracy was forged not on the battlefield or in a revolution but at the behest of a colonising country. That has led to a lack of romanticism about our voting system and our democracy. That is a sad thing. Too many people are cynical about it. In fact, some people even seem to think that ignorance of the system is something of a virtue. It is not. Perhaps of all the things that were mentioned in the annual report, to me that is the most important.
It is a great privilege for me to be a member of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. On that committee, we have a lot to do with the Australian Electoral Commission, and all of their submissions, particularly the 11 submissions given to the committee in relation to the 1998 election, were terrific. They assisted us greatly. Moreover, they responded to our requests in great detail. While the committee did not in fact adopt all the recommendations of the AEC, we adopted many of them and they certainly led the way. My friend and colleague Senator Brandis mentioned the inquiry into the integrity of the electoral roll. Of course, another inquiry that the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters is involved in at the moment is the one into electoral funding and disclosure. Both of those are potentially controversial—there is no doubt about that.
—Are you on that committee?
—I am on that committee, Senator Ludwig. One of the interesting things about that is that all parties can be confident that the input of the Australian Electoral Commission will be nonpartisan and objective. Not many countries on earth can claim that. Those sorts of inquiries are fertile ground for partisan debate. We would agree with that. Senator Brandis mentioned the Four Corners program. I looked at the Courier-Mail this morning, and I am sure you saw that, Senator Ludwig. There is an enormous amount of consternation in Queensland and elsewhere about that issue. One thing we agree on, however, is that the Australian Electoral Commission can be trusted to come up with a report and input that is nonpartisan and that is objective. That is a great credit to it.",SENATE,<title>DOCUMENTS</title>,<title>Australian Electoral Commission</title>,Documents,10,1
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2000-10-31,"—The Australian Electoral Commission does a fantastic job for this nation in seeking to ensure that there is integrity in the political process. As a result, it is important for us as a Senate to consider some of the matters raised by my colleagues, especially those from Queensland. It is a sad fact that some people here owe their presence in this chamber to the power of the Australian Workers Union and some other trade unions in Queensland which have now been found to have been involved in activities that could only be described as less than desirable. 
Queensland, unfortunately, has a history that has been exposed in recent times of seeking to defraud the Queensland electorate of their rights and their entitlement to a true and rigorous democratic process. The fact that the Australian Labor Party seems to be so heavily involved—from the grassroots level right through to the upper echelons of the ALP in Queensland—in electoral fraud ought to be of grave concern to all Australians and especially to Queenslanders. Indeed, it ought to be of great concern to Peter Beattie, the Premier of Queensland, and to his state government. But the question has to be asked: what is the Labor Party doing about these allegations? Sure, the Australian Electoral Commission has an important role to play within Australian politics. But the fact is that political parties have a duty, and there is an onus on them to ensure that they play by the spirit of the law. But, in Queensland, not only has the Labor Party failed to play by the spirit of the law but it has now been exposed as failing to play by the letter of the law, and the recent Four Corners program has highlighted that problem.
The question then is: what ought the Labor Party do about it? The first person who ought to do something about it is in fact the federal Leader of the Opposition, Mr Kim Beazley. Does he have the ticker to involve himself in the Queensland division and to root out the rorting? In recent times, the Australian Labor Party has been seeking to remove the speck from the Liberal Party's eye in relation to Mr Reith whilst failing to identify the log within its own eye, which is the Queensland division of the Labor Party. If Mr Beazley fails to deal with this issue, it will be shown to everybody within Australia that he fails the leadership test of standing up for principle and standing up for the democratic process in this nation.
There is no greater test for a political leader than to be able to stand up against the rorts within his or her own party, to root them out and to ensure that the party is behaving in a manner appropriate to the democratic standards that are the very ethos of this nation. As soon as you allow the democratic process to be corrupted in the manner in which it has been in Queensland, you have the capacity to destroy the people's confidence in the democratic process. Once that is destroyed, you have the problems of extremist parties seeking to take over and the whole democratic ethos is destroyed. In the Queensland situation that has been referred to by my colleagues, Mr Beazley has a very important task. The onus is on him to ensure that he roots out the problems in Queensland, exposes them without fear or favour, deals with all the people responsible—and it sounds as though it is endemic within the Labor Party in Queensland—and shows his leadership.

"Knowles, Sen Susan",LP,2000-10-31,"—I too would like to make some comments about the Australian Electoral Commission annual report. It does highlight to the chamber that there is one side in this parliament trying to make sure that the electoral system is well and truly aboveboard. It is interesting that debate on this particular report should be on a day when the Labor Party have tried to imply that Senator Ellison has somehow been less than forthcoming about Mr Reith's circumstances. If everyone in the Labor Party were as up front and as honest as Senator Ellison, this parliament would not have a problem and nor would the Labor Party have a problem with its branch in Queensland.
It is interesting to note that the Labor Party is well and truly under the spotlight in Queensland for manipulation of the electoral system. It is interesting to note that Karen Ehrmann is—at the government's and the taxpayers' pleasure—in jail in Queensland for the very simple reason that she committed a number of offences against the Electoral Act. It is even more fascinating to note that, in last night's Four Corners program, it was revealed that someone in the Labor Party had tried to bribe Miss Ehrmann to keep other identities out of the spotlight.  
Then someone rang in to 4QR today during a talkback show. He identified himself only as `Tom', so heaven only knows who Tom is. Having looked at the Four Corners program last night he said:
As far as I am concerned, that process of ballot stacking and corrupt ballots is widespread within the trade union movement and has been going on for a very long time. So that when there are elections within the state in trade unions which are conducted by officials of the state union branch, branch stacking and corrupting the ballot is regarded as routine practice. And what's happened here is that the process of corruption has progressed into the state branch of the ALP and as a consequence you have members of the state parliament who were former employees of the AWU.
Isn't that a fascinating admission? People of Queensland know this but, as my colleague Senator Abetz just said, what is Mr Beazley doing about it? Absolutely nothing. Mr Beazley is too interested in pursuing personalities instead of pursuing what is right and proper and stopping such dreadful things as blatant electoral fraud. Mr Beazley is pontificating about things for which there has been repayment and apology, and yet he will not control people on his own side in this parliament, nor will he seek to control members of the Labor Party in other parliaments or other branches. He just allows this manipulation to go on, unfettered and unchecked, in every way possible. 
Then we have allegations that people have been offered bribes to keep other people out of it, including one Mr Mooney. It is interesting to note that people are not coming into this chamber while this debate is in progress and denying the material that was put forward in Four Corners last night. They are not denying what this so-called `Tom' has said on 4QR today, nor are they denying the evidence that Miss Ehrmann herself gave prior to her sentencing, I understand, about the conversations that she had with another Railway Estate branch member, Ron Barnard, and a person called Paul, who made the offers and the bribes. Why is it that the Labor Party are so deafeningly silent on this matter? At question time today, when there was an opportunity to bucket Senator Ellison, they were all in here trying to get a go at bucketing Senator Ellison. But now, they are sitting quietly through this whole saga that has been going on for months and months. Not one of them has come in here to either apologise or defend the actions of their own colleagues in Queensland.

"Payne, Sen Marise",LP,2000-10-31,"—I also wish to speak on the annual report of the Australian Electoral Commission. I have spoken before in relation to the Australian Electoral Commission, particularly with regard to their advances in electronic voting, which we will all welcome as they progress, and, in recent times, their enormous and valuable efforts in relation to the ballot in East Timor last year—their maintenance of the rolls, particularly in Darwin. I want to join with some of my colleagues on this side this evening in raising and addressing some matters concerning effective administration of the rolls by the Australian Electoral Commission and pertaining to discussions that occurred earlier in the evening.
I tuned in only very briefly last night to a small part of the ABC's production, Four Corners, but the part I did tune into was particularly interesting. It pertained to a very nice place in North Queensland known as Magnetic Island. I recall the reporter saying:
On a midsummer weekend, the ferry that normally brought the tourists started delivering unexpected guests to Magnetic Island's Arcadia Resort.
One of the people described as being part of the Left in this particular discussion was quoted as saying:
They did one of those good Aussie things like put on a keg of beer and a barbecue at the local pub and invite all the mates who were the anti-greenie forces, the pro-development forces, the redneck forces, on Magnetic Island who were prepared to back a horse, any horse, any colours, as long as it was backed by Mooney.
Another member of the local branch, Florence Harrison said:
Well, I saw all these people coming in and going up to the table and signing on and some of the members that were with me were just bewildered.
We didn't know what was going on.
We just couldn't understand it. 
And we ended up with 93 members, which we only usually had 24.
Poor old Florence Harrison was left as confused, I would suggest, as the rest of the people of Australia in relation to the administration of these sorts of matters, the involvement of particular members of the union movement and, most importantly—to come back to an issue that Senator Knowles raised in her remarks—what the leadership of the ALP is doing in this regard. What is the leadership of the ALP actually doing to address these problems, to take on board the very serious issues that have been raised and to do something about it, as opposed to letting it all float around them in the policy vacuum that they call an opposition? The answer to that question is a resounding silence from the other side of the chamber. It is, in effect, absolutely nothing. This is an organisation that prides itself on its ability to control the numbers, as was evident to all those who were watching last night. We finally got a concession out of the person described by the reporter on Four Corners as `AWU factional organiser, Lee Bermingham', who said:
Yeah, I can see why people would be upset by things like that.
Under the party rules, though, you have to join a branch that's within your federal area.
So legitimately, according to party rules, people can join a branch anywhere within that federal seat.
So there was nothing against the party rules in terms of people from one part of Townsville joining a branch in another.
But what is important in all this is the concession that actually comes from Mr Bermingham. He said:
And indeed sometimes there's legitimate reasons to do it.
The reporter asks:
Is it fair game?
And Mr Bermingham, in what I would describe as a telling response, said:
Um, no. I wouldn't call it fair game, no.
That is what we are talking about here: we are talking about what is appropriate and legitimate behaviour, and we are talking about what responsibility the people who are involved in this process are prepared to take. I think it is time the leadership of that part of the Australian Labor Party took responsibility and made some quite clear comments about what they are prepared to do about addressing these issues.
—Mr Acting Deputy President,  I raise a point of order to assist my Labor colleagues. I note there is some time left in this debate and I am sure that the two Labor senators from Queensland would like to make a contribution to this debate, so I simply rise—people know my cooperative and bipartisan nature in this chamber—to alert Senators Hogg and Ludwig to the possibility of defending themselves in this debate.
Question resolved in the affirmative.",SENATE,<title>DOCUMENTS</title>,<title>Australian Electoral Commission</title>,Documents,10,1
"Payne, Sen Marise",LP,2000-10-31,"—I will now address the remarks I had intended to make when I came into the chamber this evening on a subject that I regard as being very important; that is, the interplay in the modern community between mental health issues and the workplace. On several occasions recently I have addressed the question of the modernised workplace and its impact on individuals in the community. Recently, as a nation and internationally, we marked World Mental Health Day, and my interests in both these areas are linked. In fact, from the day I made my first speech in this place, I have continued to raise what I regard as being one of the greatest health challenges facing this nation.
The ongoing challenges associated with the changing workplace are reflected in changes that are so significant in only one or two generations. Workers have a wider choice in career opportunities and an increased capacity to learn, to travel and to change personal circumstances, giving individuals real choices when deciding when, why and how to work. As a more diverse cross-section of the community enters the work force—not least of which is the increasing participation of women in recent decades—there is a wider choice of staff for employers. We have also changed the way we lead our lives: we work longer hours, marry later, if at all, and have fewer children. Given the many hours that people spend at work, there often is less distinction between personal life and private life, which is not necessarily a good thing.
Just as we have more choice, so we have more pressure—pressure to perform, to compete, to earn and to build a career. We have got even more pressure to adapt to new technology, to new systems and to new approaches to working. Obviously, this has an effect on not only workplaces but also the people who work in them—significant effects on the mental health of workers at all levels. At the same time, the incidence of mental illnesses is increasing across the globe, so more people who work are doing so with existing illnesses that can be exacerbated by the work environment, and in that context consideration of their mental health becomes increasingly important.
Research into this area indicates that low morale at work due to a loss of faith in an employer is significant. In 1988, 22 per cent of workers said they were `frequently worried' about losing their job. In 1996 that response had risen to 46 per cent. There are substantial effects of workplace stress which are well documented. The British Medical Journal, for example, cites two studies which show that job stress may also increase chances of coronary heart disease. Workplace stress can have substantial side effects, and not only on the person affected. In some cases stress that is caused in the workplace can be both a cause and an effect of workplace violence. At the more extreme end there is in fact death from overwork—a combination of apoplexy, high blood pressure and stress—which many would know is identified as `karoshi' in Japan. 
So in 1992 the UN designated a World Mental Health Day, after they had actually identified mental illness as an epidemic. The day is co-sponsored by the World Health Organisation and the World Federation for Mental Health, and the 2000 theme is `mental health and work'. The World Federation for Mental Health, promoting this, is an international non-profit advocacy organisation founded over 50 years ago and aimed at promoting the prevention of mental and emotional disorders, the proper treatment and care of those with disorders, and the promotion of mental health. The federation runs public education programs like World Mental Health Day. It conducts research through collaborating centres at major universities, consults with the United Nations and its agencies and in the community. The theme of the year 2000 World Mental Health Day is a recognition that issues of mental health and work both involve fundamental principles of human value: the capacity to work, to be independent, to seek personal fulfilment, the right to reasonable working conditions and to be treated with respect.
It is important to identify that mental illness is a widespread problem in Australia. In 1993, for example, a human rights commission report indicated that one in five Australians will develop a form of mental illness. On the one hand we have got a rising incidence of mental illness, and on the other we have got people working in environments which are causing increasing levels of stress. Existing mental illnesses can have a significant effect on how much and how well any individual can work and can obviously be worsened by workplace stress. Its results in the workplace are things like absenteeism, job turnover, poor decision making, reduced output, poor health and tiredness. But pressure from a range of factors within the workplace can also lead to other problems, such as mood disorders, anxiety disorders and even drug or alcohol addiction.
It is important to emphasise that a discussion of stress and mental illness in relation to work does not suggest that pressure in the workplace is all bad. Stress obviously can be a cause of depression, but it can also have a positive effect on people as a motivator in prompting good performance. Of course, stress comes in two forms—eustress, or good stress; and distress, or bad stress—and by itself may not cause depression or other mental illness but can contribute significantly to larger problems. Ten years ago in the United States it was estimated that 290 million work days were lost to absenteeism due to depressive disorders. The World Federation for Mental Health indicates that depression alone costs business in North America about $US60 billion a year. The cost to the health system in Australia due to depressive disorders was estimated at $500 million in the year 1993-94.
In terms of taking action, what do we need to do? It is important to address the stereotypes that are often associated with mental illness, to ensure that people are not depicted as being `crazy' or, for that matter, incapacitated. Many people who have a mental illness have one that is treatable with appropriate medication or other techniques. For example, depression is the most treatable of mental illnesses. Research shows that 80 per cent of sufferers can alleviate symptoms with help. It is important that workers who do suffer from these illness are not ostracised or treated as being less valuable than other staff members. We have to bear in mind the significance of issues like privacy in the workplace as being very important in that regard.
Workplaces can and should avoid factors that might induce extreme stress, and can and should be supportive environments for someone who is suffering from a mental illness. One step that employers and managers can take is to be vigilant in watching for signs of extreme stress or depression. Research shows that if you intervene early and encourage treatment at that stage the costs are significantly less than the costs of hospitalisation and other treatments which may become necessary down the line if the illness is not addressed—let alone what can be very significant personal costs to the individual and to their health. 
It is not always easy to spot. Stress affects different people in different ways, and it is often difficult to assess what the influence of personal problems or situations other than those in the workplace may be. Indicators can be things like withdrawal from interaction with colleagues, an inability to concentrate, listlessness and an inability to complete work. Intervention is very important. It is important that treatment is neither put off nor difficult to access. It is also important that employers and managers do not think they have to solve the causes of depression themselves. They should always be able to refer the person to an appropriate source of help.
I have talked about flexibility in the workplace before, and part of that is about changing the expectations of both employers and employees in relation to altered circumstances, working hours, job structures and other conditions which can impact on mental health. Some of the most significant issues that cause stress—work overload, negative competition, ambiguity about job role or place within an organisation, and the feeling of having little or no control over work processes—can easily be addressed and often simply resolved.
Finally, I want to acknowledge the efforts of Australian governments to combat mental illness. The National Mental Health Strategy is very important. It is a landmark agreement between the Commonwealth and all state and territory governments. It is a recognition of the need to work together to reform services and mental health policy to ensure that, wherever possible, people with a mental illness are able to enjoy the same opportunities as other Australians. The Commonwealth commitment in that regard over five years is $300 million. The Commonwealth has also committed $17½ million to the National Depression Initiative to work with other levels of government and with corporate and community groups to address the significant impact of depression. The chair of that initiative is the Hon. Jeff Kennett, who takes up that role at a very significant time for a discussion of this issue in Australia.
So in many ways we have come a great distance. We have the treatments. We are getting better at identification of individuals who suffer from these problems and at trying to assist them in that way. We need to have between employers and employees the sort of cooperation that I have spoken about in my remarks in relation to the national efforts of governments. I suspect though that, as is often the case in debates such as this, our greater challenges lie in addressing the stigma that is so often attached to difficulties with mental health. We have seen in the last few weeks a sea change in this nation—where we have seen the Paralympics being around capacity and ability and not disability. If we can also change the stigma that is often attached to mental illness, then we will have come an extraordinarily long way for individuals extraordinarily deserving of our support.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Mental Health Issues and the Workplace</title>,Adjournment,11,1
