The SPEAKER
 (09:31):  For the information of honourable members, I present the report of the Australian Parliamentary Delegation to the Republic of Korea and Japan from 11 to 21 April this year. The delegation consisted of the Deputy President of the Senate, Senator Sue Lines; the members for Cunningham, Capricornia, and Mayo; and me. Senator Lines led the visit to the Republic of Korea, and I was privileged to lead the delegation to Japan. The Republic of Korea delegation formed part of the official 2018 bilateral parliamentary visits, and the delegation to Japan was on the invitation of the presiding officers of the Japanese diet. Senator Lines will speak to the Republic of Korea portion of the delegation in the Senate. I would like to speak to the visit to Japan.


I'd like to thank the presiding officers of the Japanese diet for inviting an Australian parliamentary delegation to their country. The delegation visited Tokyo, Kyoto and Osaka, where members undertook a mix of formal and cultural activities. The delegation provided opportunities for strengthening existing relationships with parliamentary counterparts, gaining a practical insight into Australia's growing economic and social relationship with Japan and discussing existing and potential areas for intergovernmental and interparliamentary cooperation and exchange.


In this sphere, discussions focused on strengthening parliament-to-parliament links; the similarities and differences between parliamentary office positions and member services; and strengthening the Australia-Japan bilateral relationship, including trade, energy, policy and improving regional stability. The delegation discussed the issue of empowering women in politics, with reference to the Japanese parliament's initiative of establishing a parliamentary league to promote female participation in politics.


The delegation also met with Australian business representatives in Japan and Colombo Plan scholars who are Australians studying and living in Japan and saw firsthand at Japan's National Museum of Emerging Science and Innovation some impressive glimpses into how robotics will assist humans into the future. The delegation was briefed on a number of important regional matters, which included maintaining regional stability and the issues surrounding the abduction of Japanese citizens by North Korea in the 1970s and 1980s, which Japan is still pursuing. The delegation acknowledges the difficulty faced by the Japanese government in negotiating on this matter over an extended period and the immeasurable loss to the victims and their families.


In addition to the presiding officers, on behalf of the delegation I wish to thank members of the Japanese diet that met and hosted members on their visit to Japan. I thank the mayor and deputy mayor of Kyoto for welcoming us to their beautiful and historic city. A particular note of gratitude and appreciation is extended to His Imperial Majesty Emperor Akihito of Japan for granting a special audience with me as Speaker.


The bilateral relationship is strong. In Japan we have a friend firmly committed to democracy and the rule of law, as we are. The delegation was warmly received wherever we went. At the conclusion of our meetings I was pleased to extend a reciprocal invitation to the Speaker and President of the Japanese diet to visit the Australian parliament in the near future.


I'd like to thank the Australian ambassador to Japan, His Excellency Mr Richard Court AC, and the embassy staff for welcoming and assisting the delegation throughout the visit. In particular, I thank Ms Melanie Calvert, who accompanied the delegation whilst we were in Japan. Members appreciate the time, effort and logistical coordination required to arrange visits programs such as this. On behalf of the delegation, I thank the Australian International and Parliamentary Relations Office and the Japanese international affairs department for arranging and facilitating the program and for making it the success that it was. Thanks also to the delegation secretary, Stephanie Mikac, for her very able assistance throughout both visits.


In closing, I would like to extend delegation members' appreciation to the Japanese ambassador to Australia, Mr Sumio Kusaka, who's here on the floor this morning. Thank you and thank you to your embassy staff for briefing the delegation and for ensuring that our visit was a success on behalf of both houses of the parliament. I again thank you and I commend the report to the House.

Ms LANDRY
 (Capricornia—Chief Nationals Whip) (09:35):  I seek leave from the House to speak on the report of the parliamentary delegation to the Republic of Korea and Japan, particularly about the Republic of Korea.


Leave granted.




Ms LANDRY:
  As one of the delegates, I can confirm this was an educational experience and one that, in the range of small ways, I hope may have helped bring our great nations closer together. The purpose of the visit was to sustain and strengthen social ties and discuss issues of mutual benefit and importance to Australia and Korea. By chance, our delegates to Korea were all women, which provided a unique opportunity to discuss female representation at both parliamentary and business levels in each country. While 31 per cent of Australia's parliamentary representatives are women, female representation in the Korean parliament sits at just 18 per cent. While this is slowly improving, women were not historically involved in hard-hitting political and economic issues but tended to be overrepresented in soft social issues relating to health and education.


We met with business representatives from both Australia and Korea and heard a lot about the challenges with business in both countries. The Korea-Australia Free Trade Agreement has assisted to increase and normalise trade between both countries. A tour of a popular Korean supermarket revealed the sales of fresh Australian fruit, vegetables, wine and beef. Coming from the undisputed beef capital of Australia, I was interested to see that they sold beef by the 100 grams as it is classed as a luxury item. We also visited the Hanwha Q CELLS facility, which manufactures solar panels. It was a real eye-opener to learn about the 16-step process, which is nearly totally automated. Hanwha have recently grown by establishing an operation in Sydney, further strengthening our trade bonds with South Korea.


The delegation had the opportunity to visit Sejong City, the smart, safe and happy city. Sejong is an innovative, high-technology city of the future located approximately 113 kilometres from Seoul. Construction of this city began in 2012 and expects to be completed by 2030 at a cost of AU$156 billion. The city is expected to reach a population of 500,000 on completion. Everything about this new city is about technology, from in-home waste recycling to an extensive safety- and traffic-monitoring system. The idea of Sejong City is to decrease the population in Seoul by providing an exciting and legitimate alternative community for thousands of young Koreans.


The geopolitical stability of the Korean Peninsula was, of course, a major topic of conversation during our visit. Visiting the Korean Demilitarized Zone, or the DMZ, provided a stark reminder of the tension and weight of prolonged antagonism. Walking the tunnel between North and South Korea—originally a North Korean tool of invasion—one could hardly be more thankful to live in a free and peaceful society. The area is a tourism hotspot for Korea, with thousands visiting each year. I was particularly intrigued to hear about the tax-exempt lives of residents near the border, a special incentive to keep the area populated. Families on each side of this political boundary are unfortunate victims of this ongoing state of the war. Great sadness occupies a large section of the community's psyche. Some families have been separated from loved ones for decades, some since the 1950s. Apart from a few brief reunions, these families remain separated and sorrowful—a sad and constant reminder of the silent victims of conflict.


To travel with this delegation has been a thoroughly engaging and enjoyable opportunity. To increase my understanding of the trade, culture and politics of these two unique and important partners to Australia is truly valuable. I wish to thank the secretariat, my colleagues and all the wonderful people in South Korea and Japan who helped make this experience possible.

"Morrison, Scott, MP",LP,2018-06-28,"



Mr MORRISON
 (Cook—Treasurer) (09:40):  I move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


Over the life of this government, we have consistently demonstrated our commitment to building a financial sector that is unquestionably strong, unquestionably accountable, and unquestionably competitive. 


This bill takes the next step on this path and delivers on the promises that we made in the 2017-18 budget to ensure that our regulatory architecture keeps pace with changes that are occurring in the financial environment. It includes two measures relating to financial sector ownership restrictions and bank licensing that will work together to make this critically important sector of our economy more contestable, more innovative, and improve overall choices and outcomes for customers in the banking and financial system.


We are building on the changes that we've already made:


the major bank levy, which is already ensuring that our largest banks pay their fair share. This is a measure brought in by the Turnbull government. No previous government who has talked about or even hinted at issues regarding the major banks did this. This was done by the Turnbull government to make sure that those major banks paid their fair share. That is already law. It is already occurring;


relaxing restrictions on the use of the term 'bank';


the introduction of crowdsourced equity funding—along with other aspects of the government's innovation strategy—that are already increasing entrepreneurs' access to finance; and


the announcement in the 2018-19 budget of the introduction of open banking which will have the potential to transform—and, indeed, I believe will—the competitive landscape in financial services and the way in which Australians interact with the banking system.


Today's bill significantly reduces barriers to entry that are preventing the innovation that our financial system needs, while still prioritising the safety of customers and the broader financial system. 


In particular, and consistent with the draft recommendations of the Productivity Commission's review into competition in the financial sector: 


Schedule 1 to this bill relaxes ownership restrictions in the Financial Sector (Shareholdings) Act 1998for all financial sector companies—banks as well as life and general insurance providers—and creates a new simplified approval path for new and recent entrants with concentrated ownership; and 


Schedule 2 amends the Banking Act 1959 to support the operation of APRA's restricted authorised deposit institution licensing framework. 


I will now provide some detail on these reforms. 


Under the Financial Sector (Shareholdings) Act, no individual can hold greater than 15 per cent of a financial sector company without being subject to approval under a national interest test. 


This is an important mechanism to ensure, among other factors, that prudentially regulated institutions have access to sufficient financial resources during times of stress and that their owners have the capabilities necessary to fulfil their responsibilities.


However, as identified by the House of Representatives Economics Committee in its first review of the four major banks—and I commend the member for Banks, the chair of the committee at that time and now the assistant minister, for his leadership on these issues—the criteria against which a national interest determination is made are not transparent, they found, and this can have unintended consequences, particularly for start-ups. 


The government believes the broadness of a national interest test is warranted when assessing significant transactions under the Financial Sector (Shareholdings) Act. However, the government agrees with the view that it is less justifiable when considering ownership of small institutions when they are just starting out, given that due to their size they pose limited risks to financial stability or a large numbers of customers. This is particularly true given that:


start-ups are more likely to have a concentrated ownership structure as a normal part of the business life cycle and thereby require Financial Sector (Shareholdings) Act approval; and


uncertainty about obtaining Financial Sector (Shareholdings) Act approval is limiting start-ups access to the finance they need to grow, given the perceived risk of an investment becoming 'stranded' should approval against 'national interest' not be granted. 


This is unacceptable as an outcome, and this bill will now seek to fix it in two ways. 


Firstly, the ownership threshold beyond which Financial Sector (Shareholdings) Act approval will be required for all financial sector companies will be increased from 15 to 20 per cent, in line with the threshold that exists in the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act 1975. There is no policy rationale for this discrepancy. Making the two acts consistent will simplify investment in the financial sector and remove a significant regulatory hurdle for institutions where owners are seeking to hold 15 to 20 per cent of available shares. 


Secondly, we will introduce a streamlined Financial Sector (Shareholdings) Act approval path for small domestically incorporated financial sector companies—that is, banks and life insurance companies with less than $200 million in assets and general insurance companies with less than $50 million in assets—that are seeking a prudential licence for the first time or have been licenced for fewer than five years. 


Under this model, qualifying institutions will not be assessed against the national interest framework. Instead, as long as the firms' owners are 'fit and proper' and the firm itself undergoes regular reviews of its ownership structure and provides relevant information to APRA each year, Financial Sector (Shareholdings) Actapproval will be granted. 


To ensure, however, that new entrants receiving approval under this framework do not receive a competitive advantage relative to existing firms, or grow so large that their ownership structure begins to pose risks to consumers, once such firms grow beyond the relevant asset threshold their owners will be required to either:


divest their holdings such that no one holds more than 20 per cent of the institution within two years; or


apply for regular Financial Sector (Shareholdings) Act approval subject to the existing national interest test within three months. 


Together, these two elements of the bill will ensure:


that the perceived risk of an investment getting stranded in a start-up is dramatically reduced, stimulating investment; and


that start-ups have a number of years to test their business in a lighter-touch regulatory environment, before having to comply with the same rules as everyone else, preserving competitive neutrality and system resilience. 


While schedule 1 to this bill makes significant inroads to cut red tape in relation to new businesses' ownership structure, the government recognises that the power of this change on its own is limited. Even with a Financial Sector (Shareholdings) Act approval in hand, start-ups need to obtain an APRA licence and be ready to comply with a range of prudential requirements covering everything from financial resources to corporate governance and remuneration policies from the day that they start operations. 


Meeting these requirements is a central part of Australia's regulatory architecture, and APRA's prudent approach to managing financial sector risks was key to Australia's relative success during the global financial crisis. As such, this is not a structure that any government would want to undermine. However, where there are opportunities to reduce barriers to entry without increasing risks, we support them being investigated. 


That is why the government fully endorses APRA's new restricted authorised deposit institution licensing framework. This will be similar to the United Kingdom's model, which, since 2014, has seen more than 10 new banks commence operations—compared to only one start-up bank in Australia in the last decade. 


Under APRA's approach, start-up banks will be able to obtain a restricted licence for up to two-years, or a time specified by APRA. During this time they will be subject to a limited suite of prudential requirements and strict caps on the size of their business, granting them the opportunity to prove their business model and attract the funding they need to successfully compete in the longer term. After two years, successful licences will transition to meet the full framework. 


Building on our reforms in the Financial Sector (Shareholdings) Act, schedule 2 to this bill therefore makes a number of technical amendments to the Banking Act to support this new licensing approach. In particular, the bill grants APRA the power to:


impose a 'time limited' condition on banking licences where institutions are seeking a restricted authorised deposit institution licence; and


remove such licences—without a merits review—when the licence holder is found to be noncompliant with their regulatory requirements or not able to develop sufficient resources to acquire a full unrestricted banking licence. 


While the revocation of a licence without the possibility of a merits review is a significant step, it is a necessary protection when banks are being allowed to operate at lower regulatory requirements and a bank's continued operations during an appeal process would pose unacceptable risks to customers. It is also necessary, more broadly, to protect the reputation of all 'restricted authorised deposit institutions' at a time when they are trying to build their businesses and attract customers. 


Under this approach, natural justice would still be provided to time-limited licensees, with APRA required to provide notice of its intent to revoke a licence in writing and allow the licensee to make submissions in its defence. This adequately balances the need for licenced institutions to have their rights protected against those protections required by the broader community. It will also have no impact on existing banks or new banks that acquire a full banking licence. 


To conclude, this bill is yet another example of the government's commitment to creating more competition in the financial sector, which ultimately leads to better outcomes for customers and a stronger economy. This two-pronged approach to simplifying the process of setting up a new financial institution—relaxing both ownership restrictions and licensing rules for new entrants—will support investment and drive the kind of robust competition necessary to create better, cheaper products for all Australians that rely on our banking and financial system.


This is another example of the Turnbull government getting on with doing what is needed in our banking and financial system to ensure that it is unquestionably strong, unquestionably accountable and robustly and unquestionably uncompetitive. These are the changes that need to be made to ensure that Australians can rely on a banking and financial system that underpins the strength of our economy. This goes again to the government's plan for a stronger economy, upon which all other things rely—jobs, wages, investment, essential services, keeping Australians safe, bringing the budget back into balance, the government living within its means. All of this depends on a stronger economy, and the banking and financial system that we continue to build and strengthen, to these ends, is what underpins the Turnbull government's commitments, whether on Medicare, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme or keeping Australians safe and ensuring the protection of Australians all around the country.

"Drum, Damian, MP",Nats,2018-06-28,"



Mr DRUM
 (Murray) (10:55):  On behalf of the Select Committee on Regional Development and Decentralisation, I present the committee's report entitled Regions at the ready: Investing in Australia's future, together with the minutes of proceedings. 


Report made a parliamentary paper in accordance with standing order 39(e).




Mr DRUM:
  by leave—As Australia battles to deal with its centralised population and congestion caused by having over 40 per cent of its population living in its two biggest cities, the realisation is stark that we have to take a different approach to growing our regions if we want to achieve a different outcome. For many decades, Melbourne and Sydney have dominated Australia's population. As these cities and our other capitals have grown and prospered, the demand for further infrastructure investment continues to grow. These endless demands from our capital cities for more lanes on freeways, more trains running more often, bigger hospitals, more universities, bigger airports and new airports put the nation in a continuous need for more resources. 


Once these infrastructure projects are completed, these capital cities continue to thrive and become more liveable and then more and more people make the decision to live in this capitals, and the congestion cycle starts all over again. Until we have a fundamental shift in spending priorities away from our congested capital cities and share the infrastructure spending with regional Australia, we cannot expect the current imbalance to correct itself. As a result of this cycle, more and more Australians are now growing tired of the congestion in our capital cities, despairing of their inability to enter the housing market and generally struggling to get ahead while living in these growing suburban based cities. 


The regions of Australia have never been in a better position to take advantage of an Australian population that is looking away from our capital cities and looking to the regions for a better all-around life. Regional Australia is ready to welcome these people with open arms, to live five to 10 minutes from work, to own your own home, to have space for your children to grow and play. These are the benefits our regions have over our capitals. We just need a greater share of the funding pie invested in regional Australia. 


While the quantum of spending in regional Australia is a critical factor, it is also important that our funding be more targeted. The committee continually heard that the most important issues are around making our regional cities, towns and communities more connected. Connectivity can be described as having better roads, better rail services, mobile phone coverage and access to quality broadband internet. Especially important is that those living in regional Australia have access to a reasonable base level of services such as health and education. 


The final piece of the puzzle that influences people's decisions to live in the regions is that of amenity. The amenity of a city, town or community can be visual aesthetics, buildings, parks, theatres, access to shops, recreational facilities, et cetera. While amenity is a broad and wide-reaching category, if we fail to invest in amenity, we will fail to entice people to live in regional Australia. 


The government's decentralisation agenda was warmly welcomed by every regional city that the committee visited. At every regional hearing, witnesses espoused the advantages of relocating government agencies or parts thereof from capital cities out to regional cities, where their performance and outcomes would be improved due to either a natural geographical advantage or advantages gained by creating a cluster and critical mass of agencies or businesses. 


While it is undeniably the preference of government to move more government agencies to regions where there will be a natural advantage, the committee also saw a number of successful examples of relocated government agencies where there was no natural advantage to speak of, other than the benefit of having well-paid government employees living and working in regional towns and cities. In these instances, I believe that there should never be any disadvantage to the efficiency of a government agency when a potential relocation is being considered. We also heard evidence that, even when the positives associated with moving an agency far outweigh the perceived negatives, there will always be an element of pushback from public servants who would much prefer to stay in their current location. 


It must be noted that while government agencies being relocated from capital cities out to regional cities become the face of decentralisation policy, it is the private sector that has the ability to dwarf the benefits that will be delivered from relocating government sector positions. Private sector decentralisation is often dependent on the decisions of government that set the environment for private sector movements. 


It is also abundantly evident that we need to categorise our own investment in regional Australia into four discernible categories. First, there are what we would all acknowledge as investments that maintain the status quo. These projects are necessary as they assist in enabling regional towns and cities to provide that universal base level of service and amenity. Second, and perhaps most importantly, is catalytic investment. These investments attract further investments, and they help create and build on critical mass in a particular sector. These catalytic investments that lure other businesses into a co-location should be given greater priority within government decision-making. Third is an investment in capacity building, and, finally, there is investment in human capital. The role of identifying catalytic-type investment is one that would be well served by our regional development committees into the future. 


There is so much work yet to be done in this space. Regional development and decentralisation will play an increasingly important role in growing the national economy and creating a more even spread of Australia's population. The committee strongly agrees that the Australian parliament create a joint standing committee on regional decentralisation to continue this work into the future. 


The committee would like to thank everyone who participated in this inquiry, particularly the members of our informal expert panel, namely: Jack Archer, Professor Andrew Beer, Professor John Cole, Ms Anne Dunn, Professor Robyn Eversole, Professor Fiona Haslam McKenzie and Professor Tony Sorensen, all of whom made an outstanding contribution not just as witnesses to our public hearings but also through submissions, other written contributions and advice. I would also like to thank the members of the committee, especially the former chairs, Dr John McVeigh and the honourable Darren Chester. I would also like to thank the deputy chair, Ms Meryl Swanson MP, for her professionalism and bipartisan approach. I would like to thank all the members of the secretariat, namely: Fran Denny, Lynley Ducker, Andrew Gaczol, Danton Leary, Kelly Burt and Julia Agostino.

Ms SWANSON
 (Paterson) (11:02):  by leave—I rise to speak on the Select Committee on Regional Development and Decentralisation's report into ways to increase the growth and prosperity of rural and regional Australia. The chair of our committee, the member for Murray, has just spoken about our findings. I would like to thank him for his remarks and for the level of cooperation and support he has extended throughout the committee's tenure. As the deputy chair of the committee, I would also like to note the substantial contributions made by the previous chairs, namely the member for Groom, Dr McVeigh, who joins us in the chamber, and also Darren Chester, the member for Gippsland, who was also a chair of the committee for a short time. We have had a very productive time on this committee. I would also like to thank the members of the secretariat, including: secretaries Julia Agostino and Lynley Ducker, inquiry secretary Fran Denny, senior research officer Andrew Gaczol, research officer Danton Leary, and administration officer Kelly Burt. Thank you so much. None of this would have been possible without your good work. 


Mention must also be made of the many individuals and organisations that provided essential information for this report and attended or made submissions to our hearings around the country—particularly our expert panel, whom the chair has already individually thanked. I would like to reinforce that thanks. I also make mention of the member for Indi, who has in particular applied her knowledge of rural and regional Australia and committed many hours to this. I would like to personally thank her for her assistance and cooperation in working through what were at times very complex issues across a very important part of our country. 


Thank you all for sharing your thoughts, your experience, your expertise and your passion for the fortunes and wellbeing of the people of regional Australia. I really share that passion about regional Australia. It is in many cases the untapped gem. My electorate of Paterson is one such gem. It spans wine producers, traditional industries, beef and dairy farmers, emerging high tech, the coalfields, booming regional and coastal areas, vegetable farmers, the Williamtown RAAF base and the glorious blue-water destinations of Port Stephens.


The committee's draft report, Regions at the ready: investing in Australia's future, acknowledges that our nation's economic prosperity is underwritten by investment in regional and rural communities such as my own. This is hardly surprising, considering around a third of Australia's workforce is employed outside of metropolitan areas. These people and industries really do ply some serious heft—they account for around 40 per cent of Australia's national economic output. How can we further capitalise on the marvellous opportunities presented by our fantastic regions?


It is a complex issue, and there is no one-size-fits-all for the regions. There are almost as many solutions as there are regions. But the Select Committee on Regional Development and Decentralisation's report has found that decentralisation, in and of itself, isn't enough. For example, it isn't good enough to lift up a government department or other public agency and drop it into a regional community hundreds of kilometres away for short-term political gain. We need to really grasp the nettle on this. We've got to stop politicising our regional areas for short-term political benefit.


To this end, the committee sought feedback from far and wide, throughout the country, over the past year, and it has drawn on this information to set out the basis of a solid Commonwealth decentralisation policy. Within it, there are some vital learnings. These include the fact that decentralised agencies or functions need to be a good fit for the location. This could mean a natural geographic advantage, existing complementary businesses or industries or a skilled workforce. Any decentralisation should be a catalyst for broader social and economic change. It should give rise to clustering opportunities—that is, attract relevant industries and businesses, encourage an expansion of services and facilitate education and training opportunities. One of the biggest items of decentralisation is efficiently and appropriately equipping agencies that are already in regional and rural areas.


The draft report also highlights the fact that we face two major challenges as we work to encourage more people to embrace a life in regional Australia. One is purely a matter of perception. The second could be a matter of trend. With reference to the first challenge, our committee identified the fact that many hold a perception that our regions are somehow second-rate—not those who live in the regions but perhaps those in other, more metropolitan areas. I'm the first to dispute that perception. I'm a product of a rural and regional environment. I know firsthand what sort of wonderful people and opportunities lie in our regions, and I know that our regions themselves, such as my electorate of Paterson, are often sustainable, vibrant and enjoyable places to live and work and raise a family. An erroneous perception that life in regional Australia is a second-rate existence really often fails scrutiny. Our metropolitan areas are often congested and many are experiencing the stress of rapid population growth and housing affordability. Those stressors, combined with the high cost-of-living expenses, make it harder for people achieve the quality of they want.


The second challenge the committee identified is that there is an established trend of people moving to the capital cities, to the metropolitan areas. That trend is on; it is happening. Rooted somewhere in the psyche of many Australians, I think there's a deep-seated message that lends them to believe that they could even perish if they lived more than half an hour from the coast. Maybe it's because our home is girt by sea. Maybe it's because we are a proud island nation. Maybe it's our collective pride in our beautiful coastline. Regardless, there are many of us, though, who might not clap eyes on the ocean more than once every six months, despite our relative proximity to it. So, we've got that challenge to understand. We've got to understand that trend of people moving to the capital cities and wanting to stay close to the coastal band. How do we tackle that challenge and encourage people to look beyond the big cities and the beach?


For regions to thrive, they need to attract and retain people. And, yes, much of regional and rural Australia lies more than half an hour from the big city or the beach.


Our committee identified four ways in which we can support this outcome, and they all boil down to investment: investment in infrastructure, such as roads, education, training, information technology, connectivity and regional facilities; investment that drives development and growth, such as in an airport, hospital, university or government department; investment in capacity building—that is, providing leadership development, education and training opportunities for people in rural communities; and, finally, investment in human capital—employing good people to deliver the services that our communities need.


However, decentralisation and investment across our three tiers of government are not enough on their own. We must encourage private entities to invest in regional and rural areas and we must collaborate and work collectively with our communities. Some Australians might baulk at the idea of moving to a regional or rural area, due to the perceptions. We must actively promote the value of and the advantages of living and working in regional Australia, and we must ensure universal access to reasonable services. These points lie within the 12 principles that the select committee believes should form the basis of all regional development policy.


We must also acknowledge that it is most important that the decentralisation of any Commonwealth or corporate entities meets the requirement of efficiency. We can't shift operations somewhere where the locale and the location hinder the function. In addition, we must acknowledge and embrace the fact that we live in a fast-evolving world. The ramifications of these changes, and the pace with which the changes occur, must be considered when we conceptualise, formulate and implement regional development policy. For this reason, the committee sees a need for the establishment of a Joint Standing Committee on Regional Development and Decentralisation. This issue demands an ongoing committee that exits to constantly examine and assess the issues that face rural and regional Australians. The committee asks that the same committee that is tasked with examining the issues also oversees the broader Commonwealth decentralisation program.


I would like to reiterate the committee's call for a consolidated government policy on regional Australia, through a regional white-paper process. In closing, I would like to make special mention of my electorate of Paterson and thank those people who submitted to the inquiry. I thank those who attended the Hunter hearing. I was most honoured to chair that hearing and I was very pleased that representatives from the airport at Newcastle, Maitland Business Chamber, Kurri Kurri District Business Chamber, the University of Newcastle and the Hunter Research Foundation all gave some fantastic ideas and evidence. Thank you so much for your commitment to helping our community thrive and, more broadly, thank you to the committee and those who served on it with me, as deputy. It was a terrific experience and I do hope that we can move forward and really help our regions that are so ready to prosper.

Ms McGOWAN
 (Indi) (11:13):  by leave—To endorse the comments of the chair and deputy chair—thank you. What I'm so pleased about is that this is a principle-based report and if the recommendations are accepted by the government it will lead to good governance for all of Australia. The principle that the deputy chair has referred to that I most want to stress, the one that's most important to me, is that of subsidiarity. This is a concept which says that decisions are made at the level of governance most close to the people who are going to be impacted by it. I think it's that particular principle that governs the whole report. How do we make sure that the people who live in the regions and in rural and remote areas of Australia have decisions made for them and by them at the level closest to them?


If I could briefly pick up on three of the recommendations in the report that support this principle. The long-term recommendations, as has already been mentioned, are about policy. I and very, very supportive of the green-paper and white-paper policy processes. As we travelled around the country, we saw examples of where this process works. It had the unanimous support of the committee and it's a process that, if we do well—which, of course, we have the capacity to do—will give this country a regional policy that will be there for the long term for all people.


However, in the report there are also some short-term, easily picked up recommendations. I'm delighted the minister is at the table. From my perspective, the most important recommendation in the report is about regional deals. I'm delighted that, when the minister was speaking to the National General Assembly of Local Government, both he and the Prime Minister endorsed this concept of regional deals. We look forward to working with you, Minister, on piloting these in the very, very near future and getting them underway. I think we can do things in a reasonably short time frame to actually show the people of rural and regional Australia that they have been listened to and to say, 'This report has been taken seriously, and here is the action that the government is going to take as a result of it.' We all know how well the city deals are working. So taking that machinery of government and applying it to regions will, I think, have a really big impact. So, Minister, I'm looking forward to working with you as we do that.


The other aspect of the report that I really like is the practical nature of the recommendations. I acknowledge the member for Murray for his work and his absolute tenacity in supporting Regional Development Australia groups as the main mechanism for grounding these regional deals. It's a strategic approach. We already have Regional Development Australia bodies in place. Let's use them. Let's do strategic planning at the regional level and then let's work with the governments—the Commonwealth government, state governments and local governments—and communities to do the planning and strategising that will enable these deals to take place. Here is a huge call-out to the RDAs: we're really looking forward to you having the resources you need to do the planning you need. We can work from that.


The other aspect of the report that I would like to talk about is that it is bipartisan. Again, I would like to acknowledge the leadership of all the chairs we've had and the contribution of the Labor Party. We have worked really hard with our communities, because we absolutely understand that, if we are going to get the development that we need in the regions, it's got to be a parliamentary activity. We can't fight on traditional tribal lines. It's got to be everybody working together regardless of their political affiliations. We have that in this report. It's a fantastic achievement. I'd like to really pay tribute to the leadership, who did the really hard work to get everybody to agree to the recommendations. So congratulations to this parliament. I think it will make the people of Australia really proud that, when we have to, we can work together as a parliament, not play those tribal games and deliver a report that everyone agrees with.


But, having done the report, the work's not over. As the deputy chair said, we've recommended setting up a parliamentary standing committee to make sure it gets supported. But here is my real call-out. It's to the Prime Minister and to the relevant ministers. This is only going to work if we have leadership. One of the reasons why this committee exists is that it had the support of the Prime Minister in the beginning. So I know he is onside with this. But, if we are going to have regional Australia reach its potential, be full of opportunity, be caring, be prosperous and take its place in this nation, it's going to need significant leadership. It's going to need us all pulling together behind that leadership. We absolutely know it's possible, but it's not going to be easy.


I mention to this parliament that one of my predecessors as the member for Indi, Lou Lieberman, in his maiden speech in 1993 said regional development was his major issue. Twenty-five years later I'm standing here as the member for Indi making the same call. But we must draw a line in the sand. We can't keep going without a national strategic approach to regional development.


In bringing my comments to a close, I want to say to my colleagues in this House—to the members of the National Party who represent regional seats, to the members of the Liberal Party who represent regional seats and to the members of the Labor Party who represent regional seats—that we have shown we can work together. We have a report here that has some significant recommendations in it. Over the next six months, if we can get that standing committee set up really quickly and begin to do the work that we know we can do so that, before the next election, before we all go out and face our electorates again, we can say, 'We have done this, we have delivered regional deals and we have the standing committee,' and if we could even get the Commonwealth government, through its cabinet, to reform its Regional Ministerial Taskforce to provide the coordination we need, they would be such good activities about which we could go back to our communities and say, 'Tick—we've done what we said we were going to do.'


In bringing my comments to a close, I also want to acknowledge—the general thankyous have been done—and thank the people of Indi for 44 submissions. Forty-four community groups and individuals got together. They did the hard work. They put the hours of preparation in. They heard the call. They turned up at the hearings. They delivered results. I have to say proudly that there were more submissions from Indi than from any other electorate in the country. Clearly, my electorate cares, and I care. So thank you to the people of Indi for absolutely getting behind me as your member. We'll continue to advocate for this.


The other people I need to thank are my staff. All our staff have worked so hard on this. I want to acknowledge Kerryn Lee for managing the diary, a really hard task. It was very, very difficult as we chopped and changed and did the hearings around the country. I want to acknowledge my electoral officers, Christine, Sara and Peter, for handling the constituent inquiries—fantastic. I want to thank my media people—Leah currently and other media people—who have got behind this whole process and helped explain to my electorate and particularly to the young people in the electorate why this is important. I want to thank Jeremy, my political adviser, who continues to give me really sound advice on how to do work. I thank George for a fantastic job, which you continue to deliver; you continue to persist. I know that in the last month you've worked so hard on this draft. I thank Di, my chief of staff, for the guidance you give all of us to enable us to keep doing our work. And to all my other staff, who I'm not going to name, but to all of you: this has been a whole-office job; it's been a whole-community job, and I am so pleased that we've got to this stage. I give my commitment to my community to work with my colleagues now, to work on the standing committee, so that we can advance the recommendations and actually do the hard work that we know needs to happen next.


Thank you, Deputy Speaker, for the honour of being here. I thank my colleagues, the chair and the deputy chair particularly, for your work. It's been a real—I want to say 'baptism of fire'—challenge, but I think that, if we can do what needs to be done next, we will all retire from this job, in the long term, very proud of the work that we've done for regional Australia.

Mr DRUM
 (Murray) (10:55):  On behalf of the Select Committee on Regional Development and Decentralisation, I present the committee's report entitled Regions at the ready: Investing in Australia's future, together with the minutes of proceedings. 


Report made a parliamentary paper in accordance with standing order 39(e).




Mr DRUM:
  by leave—As Australia battles to deal with its centralised population and congestion caused by having over 40 per cent of its population living in its two biggest cities, the realisation is stark that we have to take a different approach to growing our regions if we want to achieve a different outcome. For many decades, Melbourne and Sydney have dominated Australia's population. As these cities and our other capitals have grown and prospered, the demand for further infrastructure investment continues to grow. These endless demands from our capital cities for more lanes on freeways, more trains running more often, bigger hospitals, more universities, bigger airports and new airports put the nation in a continuous need for more resources. 


Once these infrastructure projects are completed, these capital cities continue to thrive and become more liveable and then more and more people make the decision to live in this capitals, and the congestion cycle starts all over again. Until we have a fundamental shift in spending priorities away from our congested capital cities and share the infrastructure spending with regional Australia, we cannot expect the current imbalance to correct itself. As a result of this cycle, more and more Australians are now growing tired of the congestion in our capital cities, despairing of their inability to enter the housing market and generally struggling to get ahead while living in these growing suburban based cities. 


The regions of Australia have never been in a better position to take advantage of an Australian population that is looking away from our capital cities and looking to the regions for a better all-around life. Regional Australia is ready to welcome these people with open arms, to live five to 10 minutes from work, to own your own home, to have space for your children to grow and play. These are the benefits our regions have over our capitals. We just need a greater share of the funding pie invested in regional Australia. 


While the quantum of spending in regional Australia is a critical factor, it is also important that our funding be more targeted. The committee continually heard that the most important issues are around making our regional cities, towns and communities more connected. Connectivity can be described as having better roads, better rail services, mobile phone coverage and access to quality broadband internet. Especially important is that those living in regional Australia have access to a reasonable base level of services such as health and education. 


The final piece of the puzzle that influences people's decisions to live in the regions is that of amenity. The amenity of a city, town or community can be visual aesthetics, buildings, parks, theatres, access to shops, recreational facilities, et cetera. While amenity is a broad and wide-reaching category, if we fail to invest in amenity, we will fail to entice people to live in regional Australia. 


The government's decentralisation agenda was warmly welcomed by every regional city that the committee visited. At every regional hearing, witnesses espoused the advantages of relocating government agencies or parts thereof from capital cities out to regional cities, where their performance and outcomes would be improved due to either a natural geographical advantage or advantages gained by creating a cluster and critical mass of agencies or businesses. 


While it is undeniably the preference of government to move more government agencies to regions where there will be a natural advantage, the committee also saw a number of successful examples of relocated government agencies where there was no natural advantage to speak of, other than the benefit of having well-paid government employees living and working in regional towns and cities. In these instances, I believe that there should never be any disadvantage to the efficiency of a government agency when a potential relocation is being considered. We also heard evidence that, even when the positives associated with moving an agency far outweigh the perceived negatives, there will always be an element of pushback from public servants who would much prefer to stay in their current location. 


It must be noted that while government agencies being relocated from capital cities out to regional cities become the face of decentralisation policy, it is the private sector that has the ability to dwarf the benefits that will be delivered from relocating government sector positions. Private sector decentralisation is often dependent on the decisions of government that set the environment for private sector movements. 


It is also abundantly evident that we need to categorise our own investment in regional Australia into four discernible categories. First, there are what we would all acknowledge as investments that maintain the status quo. These projects are necessary as they assist in enabling regional towns and cities to provide that universal base level of service and amenity. Second, and perhaps most importantly, is catalytic investment. These investments attract further investments, and they help create and build on critical mass in a particular sector. These catalytic investments that lure other businesses into a co-location should be given greater priority within government decision-making. Third is an investment in capacity building, and, finally, there is investment in human capital. The role of identifying catalytic-type investment is one that would be well served by our regional development committees into the future. 


There is so much work yet to be done in this space. Regional development and decentralisation will play an increasingly important role in growing the national economy and creating a more even spread of Australia's population. The committee strongly agrees that the Australian parliament create a joint standing committee on regional decentralisation to continue this work into the future. 


The committee would like to thank everyone who participated in this inquiry, particularly the members of our informal expert panel, namely: Jack Archer, Professor Andrew Beer, Professor John Cole, Ms Anne Dunn, Professor Robyn Eversole, Professor Fiona Haslam McKenzie and Professor Tony Sorensen, all of whom made an outstanding contribution not just as witnesses to our public hearings but also through submissions, other written contributions and advice. I would also like to thank the members of the committee, especially the former chairs, Dr John McVeigh and the honourable Darren Chester. I would also like to thank the deputy chair, Ms Meryl Swanson MP, for her professionalism and bipartisan approach. I would like to thank all the members of the secretariat, namely: Fran Denny, Lynley Ducker, Andrew Gaczol, Danton Leary, Kelly Burt and Julia Agostino. 


I commend this report to the House.

Ms SWANSON
 (Paterson) (11:02):  by leave—I rise to speak on the Select Committee on Regional Development and Decentralisation's report into ways to increase the growth and prosperity of rural and regional Australia. The chair of our committee, the member for Murray, has just spoken about our findings. I would like to thank him for his remarks and for the level of cooperation and support he has extended throughout the committee's tenure. As the deputy chair of the committee, I would also like to note the substantial contributions made by the previous chairs, namely the member for Groom, Dr McVeigh, who joins us in the chamber, and also Darren Chester, the member for Gippsland, who was also a chair of the committee for a short time. We have had a very productive time on this committee. I would also like to thank the members of the secretariat, including: secretaries Julia Agostino and Lynley Ducker, inquiry secretary Fran Denny, senior research officer Andrew Gaczol, research officer Danton Leary, and administration officer Kelly Burt. Thank you so much. None of this would have been possible without your good work. 


Mention must also be made of the many individuals and organisations that provided essential information for this report and attended or made submissions to our hearings around the country—particularly our expert panel, whom the chair has already individually thanked. I would like to reinforce that thanks. I also make mention of the member for Indi, who has in particular applied her knowledge of rural and regional Australia and committed many hours to this. I would like to personally thank her for her assistance and cooperation in working through what were at times very complex issues across a very important part of our country. 


Thank you all for sharing your thoughts, your experience, your expertise and your passion for the fortunes and wellbeing of the people of regional Australia. I really share that passion about regional Australia. It is in many cases the untapped gem. My electorate of Paterson is one such gem. It spans wine producers, traditional industries, beef and dairy farmers, emerging high tech, the coalfields, booming regional and coastal areas, vegetable farmers, the Williamtown RAAF base and the glorious blue-water destinations of Port Stephens.

We have worked really hard with our communities, because we absolutely understand that, if we are going to get the development that we need in the regions, it's got to be a parliamentary activity. We can't fight on traditional tribal lines. It's got to be everybody working together regardless of their political affiliations. We have that in this report. It's a fantastic achievement. I'd like to really pay tribute to the leadership, who did the really hard work to get everybody to agree to the recommendations. So congratulations to this parliament. I think it will make the people of Australia really proud that, when we have to, we can work together as a parliament, not play those tribal games and deliver a report that everyone agrees with.


But, having done the report, the work's not over. As the deputy chair said, we've recommended setting up a parliamentary standing committee to make sure it gets supported. But here is my real call-out. It's to the Prime Minister and to the relevant ministers. This is only going to work if we have leadership. One of the reasons why this committee exists is that it had the support of the Prime Minister in the beginning. So I know he is onside with this. But, if we are going to have regional Australia reach its potential, be full of opportunity, be caring, be prosperous and take its place in this nation, it's going to need significant leadership. It's going to need us all pulling together behind that leadership. We absolutely know it's possible, but it's not going to be easy.


I mention to this parliament that one of my predecessors as the member for Indi, Lou Lieberman, in his maiden speech in 1993 said regional development was his major issue. Twenty-five years later I'm standing here as the member for Indi making the same call. But we must draw a line in the sand. We can't keep going without a national strategic approach to regional development.


In bringing my comments to a close, I want to say to my colleagues in this House—to the members of the National Party who represent regional seats, to the members of the Liberal Party who represent regional seats and to the members of the Labor Party who represent regional seats—that we have shown we can work together. We have a report here that has some significant recommendations in it. Over the next six months, if we can get that standing committee set up really quickly and begin to do the work that we know we can do so that, before the next election, before we all go out and face our electorates again, we can say, 'We have done this, we have delivered regional deals and we have the standing committee,' and if we could even get the Commonwealth government, through its cabinet, to reform its Regional Ministerial Taskforce to provide the coordination we need, they would be such good activities about which we could go back to our communities and say, 'Tick—we've done what we said we were going to do.'


In bringing my comments to a close, I also want to acknowledge—the general thankyous have been done—and thank the people of Indi for 44 submissions. Forty-four community groups and individuals got together. They did the hard work. They put the hours of preparation in. They heard the call. They turned up at the hearings. They delivered results. I have to say proudly that there were more submissions from Indi than from any other electorate in the country. Clearly, my electorate cares, and I care. So thank you to the people of Indi for absolutely getting behind me as your member. We'll continue to advocate for this.


The other people I need to thank are my staff. All our staff have worked so hard on this. I want to acknowledge Kerryn Lee for managing the diary, a really hard task. It was very, very difficult as we chopped and changed and did the hearings around the country. I want to acknowledge my electoral officers, Christine, Sara and Peter, for handling the constituent inquiries—fantastic. I want to thank my media people—Leah currently and other media people—who have got behind this whole process and helped explain to my electorate and particularly to the young people in the electorate why this is important. I want to thank Jeremy, my political adviser, who continues to give me really sound advice on how to do work. I thank George for a fantastic job, which you continue to deliver; you continue to persist. I know that in the last month you've worked so hard on this draft. I thank Di, my chief of staff, for the guidance you give all of us to enable us to keep doing our work. And to all my other staff, who I'm not going to name, but to all of you: this has been a whole-office job; it's been a whole-community job, and I am so pleased that we've got to this stage. I give my commitment to my community to work with my colleagues now, to work on the standing committee, so that we can advance the recommendations and actually do the hard work that we know needs to happen next.


Thank you, Deputy Speaker, for the honour of being here. I thank my colleagues, the chair and the deputy chair particularly, for your work. It's been a real—I want to say 'baptism of fire'—challenge, but I think that, if we can do what needs to be done next, we will all retire from this job, in the long term, very proud of the work that we've done for regional Australia.

"Thistlethwaite, Matt, MP",ALP,2018-06-28,"



Mr THISTLETHWAITE
 (Kingsford Smith) (11:40):  The Treasury Laws Amendment (Protecting Your Superannuation Package) Bill 2018 aims to protect members' superannuation savings from erosion by fees and charges. Of course, this is an objective that Labor is sympathetic to. As the shadow Treasurer said in his remarks to the Press Club in May, 'We also think insurance, opt-in insurance, is a legitimate issue to consider, particularly for young people with low superannuation balances.' Account holders who generally have lower superannuation balances are younger members; low-income earners—predominantly women, unfortunately—and seasonal workers.


Often people with low balances are disengaged from superannuation and do not actively monitor or organise their accounts to minimise erosion of savings. Many people also have multiple superannuation accounts, leading to them paying multiple fees, charges and insurance premiums. At 30 June 2017, over 14.8 million Australians had a superannuation account—so approximately 15 million Australians had a superannuation account—and approximately 40 per cent of those people had more than one superannuation account. Of course, when you have more than one superannuation account often you're paying multiple sets of fees and have two insurance policies covering exactly the same thing—and, therefore, you are paying premiums for both those insurance policies. It's inefficient and, ultimately, it's whittling away investment returns for those members.


This bill aims to protect members' superannuation savings from erosion by limiting fees so that low-balance savings can grow and are protected from disproportionately high fees. It also bans exit fees. This will remove a barrier to account consolidation. The bill helps to ensure that arrangements for insurance in superannuation are appropriate so that members are not paying for insurance cover that they do not know about or that is inadequate in terms of the coverage and are not paying premiums that inappropriately erode their retirement savings. Finally, this bill strengthens the ATO's role in reuniting small inactive balances to reduce the costs to members and consolidate the accounts of members that have accrued multiple superannuation accounts. 


More specifically, the bill prevents trustees of superannuation funds from charging certain fees that exceed three per cent of the balance of a MySuper or choice product annually where the balance of the account is below $6,000. It also prevents trustees from providing opt-out insurance to new members aged under 25 years, members with balances below $6,000 and members with inactive MySuper or choice accounts, unless the member has directed otherwise. This is something that some of the super funds have been looking at for some time now. AustralianSuper, the largest industry superannuation fund in the country, actually decided to implement this policy so that members aged under 25 years need to opt in to insurance within their superannuation fund. If they've got balances below a certain threshold, then those provisions kick in as well.


The bill will require the transfer of all superannuation savings with balances below $6,000 to the tax commissioner, if an account related to a MySuper or Choice product has been inactive for a continuous period of 13 months or more. The proposed start date for these changes is 1 July 2019, and the explanatory material reports that the changes are expected to raise savings of $1.75 billion in underlying cash balance terms over the forward estimates and $850 million in fiscal balance terms. The changes in this bill are significant and will impact people's lives and retirement incomes. 


While Labor is certainly sympathetic to the objective, we wish to take our time in ensuring that there are no unintended consequences from this bill and to deeply analyse this legislation. In that respect, we are proposing that a Senate inquiry look at the provisions of this bill and their consequences and hear the views of the Australian people regarding them. Some concerns have been raised by employee representatives, by trade unions and by the operators and administrators of particular funds about the potential unintended consequences of removing insurance for people under the age of 25, particularly where they work in dangerous industries, like the building industry or the mining industry. We want to make sure that we're not unintentionally reducing that coverage. It is pretty important for people, particularly once you start raising a family, once you get married and have kids, that you do have an appropriate level of insurance. We all know that actuarial studies and other surveys have indicated that Australians are hopelessly uninsured when it comes to general insurance and, indeed, life insurance. We want to make sure that there are no unintended consequences of this and that it doesn't result in negative consequences rather than what was intended. So, as I mentioned, we will be referring it to a Senate inquiry.


When it comes to superannuation, this government doesn't have a really good record, to be honest. Of course, we remember the government's disastrous 2016 superannuation changes. After Labor led the way from opposition in 2015 and proposed policies to reform superannuation tax concessions, the government spent much of 2015 and 2016 arguing against the sensible changes to superannuation concessions that Labor had put forward. Then, in the 2016-17 budget, the government announced that it planned changes to superannuation, and they were done in a hurry and without consultation. The government's proposed $500,000 lifetime cap on non-concessional contributions triggered widespread concern that the government was making retrospective changes. Yet, the government ploughed on and, in its hurry to get to an early election, the then Prime Minister, when asked if he could foresee any circumstances in which the policy announced in the budget would change following an election, said, 'It's absolutely ironclad.' That was the Prime Minister's quote: 'It's absolutely ironclad.' They said they wouldn't be changing it. But after one of the longest elections in recent times, the divisions within the government became clear. We saw several members of the coalition raise concerns about retrospectivity, which saw the spectacle of some members of parliament threatening to cross the floor and oppose the government's budget proposals if changes weren't delivered upon. While the government eventually, reluctantly scrapped the flawed changes, it was only after it had undermined the confidence in the retirement system that sparked a civil war within the Liberal Party. Given the government's record, we will take our time to look through the proposed changes in this bill carefully.


Not only have the government made a hash out of their tax changes relating to superannuation but they have consistently shown a poor record when it comes to supporting the right changes around superannuation in this country. They voted against the introduction of universal superannuation when it was proposed by the then Treasurer, Paul Keating, back in the 1990s. They voted against every single increase in the minimum rate of the superannuation guarantee, because we all know that they don't believe in the notion of compulsory superannuation. They have never gotten over the fact that industry funds do a better job at managing people's finances than the retail funds and many of the self-managed funds. That's because there are union representatives working with employers on those superannuation trustee boards. The Liberals don't like that philosophy. They have never gotten over the fact that the industry funds do a better job of managing people's finances, in terms of lower fees and better investment performance when it comes to superannuation returns.


The Liberals delayed the scheduled increase to the superannuation guarantee from 9.5 per cent to 12.5 per cent. If we're going to ensure that Australians have an adequate income to retire on, and avoid going onto the pension in later years, particularly those workers who have breaks from the workforce—most notably women, unfortunately—if we're going to ensure that employees and workers retire with an adequate investment pool, through their superannuation, and can avoid going onto the pension, then we need to increase the compulsory rate of superannuation savings in this country. There is a litany of actuarial studies and other surveys indicating that on current trajectories most people won't make it, particularly those on low incomes—that they won't be able to ensure they have an adequate retirement savings pool, after they finish in the workplace, and thus avoid going onto the pension.


So this government's opposition to further increases in the compulsory superannuation rate is really damning for the budget, as far as increases in outlays associated with the pension are concerned. It therefore reduces the potential for us to run surpluses in the future and to fund programs that will be important, particularly aged care and other programs associated with an ageing population, like Medicare and properly funded hospitals and aged-care beds. So we need to be looking at increasing the compulsory rate of superannuation in this country, but this government has delayed it. On every occasion on which they've had the opportunity to vote for these changes, they have voted against them. They abolished the low-income superannuation scheme, and then they reintroduced it, but only under pressure from the Labor Party and from some within the industry. They reintroduced it one budget later. I think they got rid of it in the 2014 budget, and then in the 2015-16 budget they reintroduced it and renamed it the LISTO.


They undermined our superannuation system with their First Home Super Saver Scheme, which will do nothing to address housing affordability. More recently, the government has proposed a superannuation amnesty that would give a penalty holiday to employers who have not paid superannuation to their employees for as much as 25 years. The notion that under this government people who have broken the law for 25 years will be able to get away with it is completely ridiculous. Imagine if you rocked up to the tax office one day and said: 'You know what? I haven't paid income tax for 25 years. I haven't paid company tax for 25 years. I want you to give me an amnesty.' That is exactly what this government is doing with superannuation. Employers who haven't paid superannuation to their employees, which they are required to do under legislation, and for which there are quite harsh penalties, will be given an amnesty by the government. Labor, of course, has expressed its opposition to this proposal. Superannuation theft is exactly the same as wage theft. Why should dodgy employers get away with stealing hard-earned money from their employees?


In contrast, Labor has a very different philosophy when it comes to superannuation. We all know that it was the Labor Party that built the compulsory superannuation system. It has now developed into the third-largest savings investment pool in the world and it is one of the reasons that our economy had a buffer to protect Australian workers from the ravages of the global financial crisis in the wake of 2008. It was Labor that introduced universal compulsory superannuation. We proposed and legislated all of the increases to the rate of the superannuation guarantee. They were all opposed by the coalition.


Labor introduced the low-income superannuation contribution scheme, under which low-income earners would effectively not pay tax on their superannuation guarantee contributions. We introduced MySuper, the new, simple and cost-effective default superannuation product. Labor made it easier for small businesses to pay their super through the introduction of the Small Business Superannuation Clearing House in 2010. Labor led the way in reforming the payments system. The introduction of SuperStream in 2012 fundamentally improved the superannuation system experience for fund members, employers and funds.


Labor is the party of superannuation, and we'll be checking the bill, as I mentioned earlier, for unintended consequences and to consider whether there are better ways of achieving this objective. We'll take the time to consult with stakeholders and to explore concerns that have been raised, including: that the removal of default insurance could lead to members with high-risk occupations, and others with families and mortgages, becoming uninsured or underinsured; that the changes could lead to an increase in premiums; and that the transfer to the ATO of accounts which have been inactive for 13 months could lead to lower returns for members. We also need to ensure that the changes to the fees will not be able to be circumvented through an increase in other charges.


In conclusion, the objective of trying to protect the balances of people with low balances is one Labor is sympathetic to, but we'll take our time to work through these measures in this bill and we'll reserve our position on it, including on whether any amendments are required, until after the Senate Economics Committee inquiry into the bill has reported.

"O'Brien, Ted, MP",LP,2018-06-28,"



Mr TED O'BRIEN
 (Fairfax) (11:56):  The member for Kingsford Smith has done what Labor do so well: he has said that he is sympathetic to this bill that protects people's hard-earned money, their superannuation. The Labor Party are sympathetic, but what are they going to do? They're going to kick the can down that time-honoured road of analysis paralysis. There they stand, saying: 'We, like the government, believe in protecting super, and you know what we're going to do? We're going to analyse it even further, because there might be unintended consequences, and the Labor Party don't like springing surprises and don't like governing at speed.'


This is at a time when the Leader of the Opposition has surprised everybody, including his own caucus and front bench, with a complete reversal of tax policy. Now they're going after small and medium businesses. This is not just a denial of a tax cut to small businesses; these tax cuts have already been legislated for recently. This is an attempt by the Labor Party to collapse confidence in our economy. It is an attempt by the Labor Party to tax one of the values that this side of the House drives: aspiration. It is a clear tax on aspiration, and the Labor Party has the hide to stand in this chamber and hold back this bill, claiming that it wishes to have further analysis.


The only other bill the member opposite tried to attack was legislation debated in this House last week on providing an amnesty to employers over a 12-month period to pay superannuation that was due but not paid. This is an opportunity for 50,000 Australians to recoup the money they have earned. Did the Labor Party support that? No, they did not. An opportunity for employers to voluntarily fess up, the ones the government isn't already onto, and for over $200 million to go back to the workers—did the Labor Party support that? No, they did not. They want to kick the can again down the road and not deliver. We on this side of the House, the coalition, are different. We stand for many good and noble values firmly planted in the liberal tradition of free enterprise, personal freedom and the rule of law—not least among them is the right to aspire to be the very best you can be.


Key to any society that truly values and promotes such aspiration is one essential ingredient, and that ingredient is confidence—the very thing those opposite are trying to collapse in our economy. We share confidence in a strong Australian economy, an economy now in its 27th year of consecutive growth. It is an economy that creates jobs, thousands and thousands of new jobs, under this government. Last year we averaged more than 1,100 jobs every single day. Now, over one million jobs have been created since the coalition came to government less than five years ago. 


Then there's another level of confidence: confidence in good governance, confidence in fairness and confidence in that notion of the Australian fair go. It's this level of confidence deep within the economy, at the level of institutions and individuals, that motivates Australians to have a go, to have a crack, to work hard, to invest, and to better leverage their means to expand their enterprises and themselves. This is where the jobs and the growth ultimately come from, and it's something that the Labor Party never seems to understand. 


Labor thinks that if we have big taxes, big spending and big unions then everything will just fall miraculously into place and we'll arrive at some economic nirvana, where the iron laws of arithmetic are suspended and magic must just happen. In the real world, a strong economy doesn't just happen. It takes good government. And good government in this country empowers the efforts of all Australians through lower taxes and better protections for their wealth and their wellbeing. 


The Treasury Laws Amendment (Protecting Your Superannuation Package) Bill 2018 aims to do just that. You see, this bill is part of a wider suite of targeted reforms under this government—reforms that safeguard and sustain Australia's huge $2.6 trillion superannuation sector. The reforms introduced into this parliament will improve the governance, transparency and accountability of superannuation funds, while additional reforms will protect Australians' hard-earned savings by ensuring that all workers get their superannuation guarantee entitlements on time and in full. The Turnbull government—led most ably by the Minister for Revenue and Financial Services, who said she was not going to wait for the industry to do this—has taken resolute action to protect the superannuation savings of millions of Australians from undue erosion due to excessive fees, inappropriate insurance premiums and the inefficiencies of people having multiple accounts. 


Firstly, I will look at excessive fees. This bill will prevent the trustees of superannuation funds from charging administration and investment fees that together exceed three per cent per annum of the balance for accounts under $6,000. Trustees will likewise be banned from charging exit fees on all super accounts. I'll say that again, because I love this part of the bill: trustees will be banned from charging exit fees on all superannuation accounts. The benefit of these measures is twofold: preventing low-balance superannuation accounts from being just eaten away by high fees, and, at the same time, removing a clear disincentive to account consolidation and rollovers. The benefit, which is expected to flow to approximately seven million hardworking Australians and is estimated to save them about $570 million in the first year alone, should be obvious to almost everyone—everyone except those opposite and, in particular, the Leader of the Opposition. 


Back in 2013, when the Leader of the Opposition was the then superannuation minister, he deliberately removed protections for low-balance super accounts. These measures address the appalling consequences of the Leader of the Opposition's decision when he was the minister. And he didn't stop there, by the way. In addition to removing protections for low-balance accounts, the then minister, today's Leader of the Opposition, also required trustees to provide automatic insurance products on an opt-out basis, further eroding member account balances, with little or no real benefit in many cases. In so doing, he effectively ripped through the retirement savings of millions of Australians like a wrecking ball. Therefore, to make good on the hapless legacy of the Leader of the Opposition, this bill seeks to address issues associated with the current default insurance arrangements in superannuation accounts—more specifically those accounts held by younger Australians aged up to 25 years or members with account balances below $6,000 or whose accounts have been inactive for 13 months or more. In these cases, schedule 2 of the bill will require that insurance is only offered on an opt-in basis.


Voices within the industry, including the Financial Planning Association of Australia, have pointed to a potential underinsurance risk for young Australians and suggest that total and permanent disability cover—TPD, as it's typically referred to—coverage should remain as an opt-out policy to ensure adequate injury protection for young account holders. While this suggestion could be dismissed as self-interest, the government has carefully considered such advice and has designed the measure to ensure there is no disadvantage, so that any member can easily obtain or maintain insurance cover to suit their real needs and personal budgets. These changes have been estimated to give about five million Australians the option to save a total of up to $3 billion in unwanted insurance premiums annually.


Finally, schedule 3 of this bill will enable a more effective and timely mechanism whereby the ATO may proactively reunite and consolidate inactive accounts that are without insurance cover and have balances under $6,000. This measure in the first year is expected to reunite around $6 billion with the active accounts of about three million members. While the current system for recovering lost super will remain in operation, these new measures will significantly supplement and streamline those existing arrangements. Collectively, all the measures announced in this bill are specifically designed to restore protections lost under Labor—to protect the retirement savings of hardworking Australians against excessive account erosion and to prevent low-balance accounts from being eaten away to nothing by excessive fees, unwanted and inappropriate insurance and multiple accounts that compound inefficiencies and cost to account holders.


This government, the Turnbull government, believes strongly that the superannuation savings of Australians are their money—the Australians' money, the workers' money—and that money deserves to be protected and allowed to grow. For these reasons, I commend the bill to the House.

"Wilson, Tim, MP",LP,2018-06-28,"



Mr TIM WILSON
 (Goldstein) (12:08):  I rise to proudly support this bill, the Treasury Laws Amendment (Protecting Your Superannuation Package) Bill 2018, because it is part of a package of economic bills introduced by this government that seeks to honour the savings, the hard work, of Australians. Deputy Speaker, you may be aware, if you read through my speeches in this place—and maybe one day, like the former member for Fairfax, I might even publish a tome which will end up in the future member for Fairfax's office or perhaps corridor—that there is a consistent theme in every speech I give: the importance of people's freedom and a greater sense of intergenerational justice, where young Australians seeking opportunity are able to secure the chances they wish for in life but, equally, where security is provided for older Australians who are in a position where they can't change their circumstances.


We know, on this side of the House, that superannuation is part of that rich matrix of providing both opportunity and security at different stages of life. But there are thousands of young Australians at the moment who, under the legislative regime, have money taken out of the balance of their superannuation accounts to feed the interests of financial services companies—sometimes banks and sometimes many other agents—who want to extract the value of the hard-earned savings of those young Australians for their own benefit.


I have had constituents come up to me over time and complain about their low-balance accounts, particularly those of young people at the start of their working life, and how the value of their superannuation account balances is being extracted for the benefit of insurance payments that they don't seek, wish or want, because it doesn't reflect their stage of life. All it does is remove the value of their account to the benefit of the companies that hold their balances. Many of the constituents who have raised this with me haven't just raised it in an esoteric way. They've watched themselves or their young children who have got their first job lose the value of their superannuation account balance through these fees and insurance premiums. When you put that in the context of what the Leader of the Opposition did when in his previous role in government, when he deliberately designed mechanisms within the superannuation system to encourage the raiding of young Australians' superannuation accounts, not only does it raise an eyebrow but it also raises the question yet again: does he act in the interests of workers or does he act in the interests of his union friends, allies, comrades, financiers and sometimes acolytes? That is ultimately what this bill is trying to address. It is actually putting consumers and workers at the centre of the superannuation system, not the industry funds run by unions. 


It's a pretty straightforward proposition, which is perhaps why the opposition is so relativist on this piece of legislation. Perhaps the opposition leader and those who surround him, those who sit on the other side of this chamber, in a choice about whether union-controlled superannuation companies should be able to raid and extract every single cent of value out of the superannuation accounts of young Australians and whether funds should be provided to finance the interests of union-backed superannuation funds, are choosing the interests of their union mates yet again. That's what it looks like to me, and I suspect that's what it looks like to thousands of young Australians whose superannuation accounts are being raided by the types of regulations in law at the moment, which were unjustifiably introduced by the Leader of the Opposition and at their expense. 


It is true that there is a very important role for superannuation and people being encouraged to save for their retirement, no matter at what stage of their life. It is also true that underpinning a strong economic environment where people earn wages and contribute to their superannuation accounts is a strong economy. Of course, we know that, under this government, we have made a strong economy the primacy of our focus, because when we deliver a strong economy a human, social and environmental dividend comes with it, as well as an economic dividend. But, of course, a strong economy also heavily depends on having certainty in the market and, in particular, the legislation and regulation. We know that we don't have that with the opposition leader and the legislative agenda that he would aspire to introduce. 


I was reminded of that only this morning when I spoke on a program on 2CC Canberra radio, where the interviewer, Tim Shaw, was asking the member for Canberra simple questions like:


Do you agree and do you support your leader in the winding back of tax cuts for medium business that he announced this week?


And time and time again the member for Canberra dithered and couldn't answer the question. It was like the member for Bass the day before—in fact, it was Bass squared. Her answer was: 


We are continuing to consider businesses up to $10m turnover but we have always been crystal clear that we put schools and hospitals ahead of tax cuts for big business and the banks.


That's the standard line, the rhetoric. It has obviously been poll tested. It's not actually sincere. Then the interviewer, Mr Shaw, was quite right in saying:


Gai—


or, as we refer to her, the member for Canberra—


I asked you specifically, do you support Bill Shorten's position when he said 'yes' to the winding back of tax cuts for medium businesses? And I remind you that you are a former small business person yourself.


She responded: 


Yes I am and a proud former small business person—


good on her on that. She went on:


… as I said, we are continuing to consider … up to $10 million turnover.


Mr Shaw responded:


So the leader was wrong to announce to the media that, yes, the policy of the Australian Labor Party was to repeal already L.A.W. law tax cuts for small business?


The member for Canberra said:


Well there has been internal discussions on this issue, those discussions continue …


And the interview goes on—train wreck day 2.


In the end, we now have an opposition that clearly doesn't understand the importance of a strong economy or the interest of how it delivers for Australian workers and everything else. But the Leader of the Opposition no longer even enjoys the support of his party for his economy-wrecking agenda. I would hope that, when you see a Leader of the Opposition pushing forward an economy-wrecking agenda—whether it is repealing tax cuts, taking money out of the pockets of hardworking Australians, or it is potential meddling in industrial relations, or it is an economy-wrecking emissions reduction target; whatever the economy-wrecking position he takes—at some point the members opposite would actually stand up and defend the rights and interests of ordinary Australians and particularly workers.


That is why they should be supporting this piece of legislation—not the moral relativism that they engage with in the speeches in this place but actually supporting a cap on fees so that young Australians in particular do not have their superannuation accounts raided by union-backed superannuation funds. They should be supporting a piece of legislation that says that, if you do not want an insurance premium, you should have the freedom to choose not to get one from the get-go. You shouldn't have to find out that all this money has been taken out of your account before you turn around and say: 'Actually, I don't think that's right. At 16, I'm not sure it's actually a good financial decision to get a life insurance premium.' It might be, later, but not when you're only earning a few thousand dollars and you certainly have a superannuation account balance of less than six grand.


That's what's at the heart of this piece of legislation. It's just making sure that young Australians and those people with low, duplicate accounts don't get their money raided by the unions. Imagine that! I would have thought that this is a relatively straightforward proposition for everybody in this parliament to support, except for the fact that we know it will be going against the direct agenda of the Leader of the Opposition and the Labor Party in the past, who have actively supported raiding those accounts.


This bill seeks to do very sensible things. It does not require a genius to be able to stand up and realise that the principal benefits of this legislation are for those seeking their opportunity on their way up. They might have multiple accounts and have multiple jobs. They may have low balances because they have not contributed very much over the years, because they have started at a very small base at the start of their career.


But never forget, Deputy Speaker, that there is another big group of Australians—in fact, the majority of Australians—who will gain and secure the benefit from this piece of legislation. Rightly, there has been a focus on the low balances of women in their superannuation accounts, particularly as they enter retirement age, certainly in comparison to men. We all know that there are multiple factors that drive that. But, because superannuation is often one of those matters that are heavily debated, particularly when you see family breakdown or marital breakdowns, women have been exposed to some of the worst cases of egregious gouging because of life circumstances. I never want to get into generic and overgenerous assessment of people's individual circumstances. Every person's life is different. But the other core group of Australians who will benefit from this legislative reform is not just young Australians seeking their opportunity, in that their superannuation accounts will not be raided by union interests; it is women who will get the benefit of this reform.


It saddens me no end that those on the other side of this chamber, who could be supporting sensible, pragmatic reform to support young Australians and women, have chosen to put the interests of their union mates against those of Australians. They have chosen to support those people who fund their campaigns—to support those people who organise and rally to get them elected. Sometimes there's a thing in this parliament where we should rise above the interests of politics and look at the future of the nation. If we say that we are going to sell out young Australians and women, in particular, by keeping in place an unjust, unfair form of legislation and regulation that undermines their interests to the benefit of big-union established interests, the modern Labor Party no longer has any claim to understand what justice means in a free society.

Ms MARINO
 (Forrest—Chief Government Whip) (12:19):  I'm particularly pleased to be talking on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Protecting Your Superannuation Package) Bill 2018 today because some of the young people who will be affected by our measures in this bill are actually sitting up in the viewing area. They are the wonderful young people from Busselton Senior High School, who are here in the chamber gallery today. I welcome them and I really hope they enjoy their time here today and make the most of this opportunity. It's a long way to come from Western Australia, and they've done exactly that. They're most welcome. I'm really pleased that it is young people like these young people sitting here today who will be the beneficiaries of this legislation. It will be young people and, as we heard from the previous speaker, women, in particular. 


We're taking action to make sure that these great young people here will be able, when they go to work, to retain more of their own money, ensuring that these young people retain that through personal income tax cuts as well as through the decisions we are making in this superannuation bill. They will actually be able to keep more of their money, particularly when they're on low incomes at the beginning of their careers. But I'm equally hoping that these young people sitting in the gallery today will take a personal interest in their own superannuation when they go to work. I hope that they will actually take an active interest in what's happening with their superannuation.


Of course, this bill fixes yet another Labor mess: the decision in 2013 to abolish low-balance protection as part of the MySuper changes. Low-balance accounts were very vulnerable to changes through erosion by fees and charges. But, under this particular piece of legislation, we're going to prevent trustees of super funds from charging administration and investment fees exceeding three per cent per annum on the balance of superannuation accounts below $6,000. This is really important for people on low incomes. There are around seven million Australians who will actually save around $570 million in just the first year of this change. That's just extraordinary. The actual figures involved in this are just extraordinary. That's an extra $570 million that will be retained in superannuation for hardworking Australians, helping them to earn more interest and to accumulate more savings for their senior years.


The senior years are not something that's going to affect you young people from Busselton for some time, but, when you get there, I want you to have as much in your superannuation accounts as you possibly can. These measures today are going to help with that. They will prevent trustees from charging exit fees on any superannuation product, no matter what the balance is. According to APRA data, one-third of funds charged an exit fee in 2016-17—that was a total of $52 million across the industry. That's another $52 million of your own funds that will be retained. I think that's great news.


The bill addresses the provision of insurance through superannuation. When you're young, life insurance may not be your top priority. But, when a significant proportion of retirement savings—sometimes an entire balance—is eroded by insurance premiums, it certainly is an issue. Again, this was part of the opposition leader's MySuper default, with automatic insurance on an opt-out basis rather than an opt-in basis. I can't understand why the Leader of the Opposition would have made that decision knowing how badly it would affect—and has affected—those lower paid workers. We will ensure that members who are at the greatest risk of seeing their account balances eroded will not have to have insurance provided on a default basis. It will be on an opt-in basis for members with balances below $6,000, accounts which haven't received contributions for 13 months or more and new members from 1 July 2019 who are under the age of 25. These changes will affect around five million people, with the option to save an estimated $3 billion in premiums a year. What we're doing is giving people choices and options. This is something that is in our DNA. We actually believe in people having choices and having control. This is a really important issue. I encourage people—and these great young people in the gallery today—to take a direct interest in and know exactly what's happening with their superannuation because many people do not. We recognise that some don't take that interest, but we need to make sure that, irrespective of whether people take a direct interest or not, their interests are reflected and they retain as much of their earnings and their superannuation as possible.


A million workers need to have their say on superannuation and their choice of super restrictions, which have been affected and restricted by EBA directions. But in these days of people changing jobs, many millions of Australians have multiple superannuation accounts. Young people in Busselton could have multiple changes of jobs in their lifetime. We want to make sure that, irrespective of how many times they change their jobs, they are able to consolidate that superannuation into an account where they'll know exactly how much they have at their disposal. It's interesting that, of the 14.8 million people who have a super account, 40 per cent of them have more than one account and around 176,000 people actually hold six or more accounts. They need to bring them together. That leads to tens and sometimes hundreds of thousands of dollars less at retirement. When young people retire, they're going to want every cent so that they can do the things they want to do when they're at a more mature age. I want to see that they get that.


Through this bill, the Australian Taxation Office will be given the opportunity for the first time to proactively return the balances of inactive accounts that people might have from past jobs—but they may not know where that super is—to the people who earned it, along with existing unclaimed super moneys. That's what we want. We want your money to stay with you, like personal income tax cuts. The ATO estimates it'll be able to do this within a month of receiving the funds. Like a lot of these young people, one of my staff has had five jobs in 20 years in both the private and public sectors. He did a super search to see what was out there that he didn't know about and he found over $78,000 in a lost super account. Isn't this a great reason for young people to take a very direct interest in their superannuation when they go to work? Make sure you know what's there and that you take control of that. This is a very big issue for one of my staff, and this is a practical example for anybody watching or listening as to why you need to make sure that you know what's happening with your super.


I congratulate the minister for her efforts in getting this particular bill together. We're going to see a lot of Australians in the first year—three million people—automatically getting their money back, being reunited with $6 billion of their own money. What a fabulous outcome! It's a fantastic outcome by this government that we're going to see three million people reunited with $6 billion of their own money. I commend the bill to the House.

"Hayes, Chris, MP",ALP,2018-06-28,"



Mr HAYES
 (Fowler—Chief Opposition Whip) (12:28):  I too would like to make a contribution on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Protecting Your Superannuation Package) Bill 2018. We will be giving qualified support to the passage of the bill through the House. Our position on this bill will be subject to the findings of the Senate Economics Legislation Committee. We want to make sure that this bill delivers what it purports to do and that there are no unintended consequences. Labor will always act to support the hard-earned savings of Australians. As it stands today, superannuation has $2.6 trillion under investment. That's $2.6 trillion of assets for mums and dads out there. I don't know about these young people, but I don't know how many noughts you've got to put on 2.6 to get a trillion—they'll probably work it out for us, Mr Deputy Speaker. But we will always take the side of the workers in ensuring the safeguarding of their earnings and their superannuation, and we will be part of any attempt at legislation that delivers safeguarding from inappropriate fees, insurance arrangements and the inefficiencies that result, as at present, from multiple superannuation accounts.


The more superannuation accounts are out there for a single person, the less accumulated savings are going into that person's asset base for the future. This is particularly so when we consider young people who may be working casual jobs, low-income earners who may move from one job to another, women who may take periodic breaks in their career and, particularly, seasonal workers out there moving from one regional location to another, whether they're cherry picking, working on vineyards or doing other things. The tendency is that those people are more than likely to have multiple superannuation accounts. Treasury analysis in 2016 showed that, at 30 July 2016, there were 9.5 million superannuation accounts in this country with a balance less than $6,000. That accounts for 40 per cent of all superannuation accounts. The ATO, whose role in terms of superannuation this bill will strengthen, found in their super accounts data overview in 2017 that 14.8 million Australians had superannuation accounts, but 40 per cent of those people were holding multiple accounts. If that money could be put into one account, the growth rate would be increased and therefore the asset base for retirement earnings would be similarly increased.


As I say, we will always defend superannuation. We know on this side of the House that superannuation, together with a means-tested and government-funded age pension, forms an integral part of a person's retirement earnings. Australians now rely on it. I advise everyone not to forget that it was the Labor government that created the Australian superannuation system. We are the party of superannuation, and we'll always stand in this joint to defend it. Labor understands that superannuation is now the second biggest saving vehicle of any household. Apart from the house itself that people will purchase and live in, superannuation is already the second biggest asset base and will grow into the future. Seventeen per cent of the household asset base is currently based on superannuation alone.


I'd like to remind everybody that, if it weren't for a Labor government, we wouldn't have universal compulsory superannuation. Universal compulsory superannuation had its initiation, in the first iterations, as a trade-off for productivity. It was award based. I know our colleagues over there don't like talking about awards, enterprise agreements or trade unions, but it was a trade union initiative that forwent a four per cent increase in the productivity payment for, at the start, three per cent compulsory superannuation. It has grown from there. By the way, every measure of growth in compulsory superannuation, which now stands at 9.5 per cent, has been opposed by the coalition. Labor have supported every increase in the rate of superannuation guarantee. It was a Labor government that introduced the low-income superannuation contribution scheme. I remind those opposite: don't forget that you came here under directions from your then leader and repealed that legislation, which gave a measure of support to people on low incomes. You repealed it, only to find out that that wasn't particularly electorally popular and you had to reinstate it. It was the Labor government that brought MySuper—a new, simplified, cost-effective default mechanism—to superannuation products. Again, that was an effort to streamline it and make it a more effective payment system. And, further, it was also a Labor government that in 2012 brought in the SuperStream, which fundamentally improved the superannuation system and the experience that people, would have as members of a super scheme, not only for employees but also for the employers and the funds themselves.


We will always hold this government to account, particularly on matters that involve employees and workers. Those opposite would like you to believe that they have changed their stripes and they are now all about what's best for workers. This is the party of Work Choices, the party that made it legal for the first time in our history to pay people below an award rate of pay, and they would like us to believe that they've changed their stripes!


Don't forget that, back at the 2016 election, they had a policy of a $500,000 lifetime cap to non-concessional contributions. It triggered widespread concern, because people were being encouraged to contribute to superannuation but this had the aspect of retrospectively opposing this restriction, which would fundamentally change the saving plans for many households. But the government at that stage made it very clear that they weren't up for changing. The Prime Minister gave what he described as an ironclad guarantee, and, lo and behold, what did they do? Just like with the low-income superannuation contribution scheme, they backflipped. They didn't backflip because they thought it was a bad idea; they backflipped because of the pressure that came from their Liberal Party base, who thought, 'You are now retrospectively diving into our retirement funds, and we've caught you out.'


They also made further inroads into superannuation—and you could probably put it kindly by saying 'unwittingly'—making another regressive aspect to superannuation with the introduction of the First Home Super Saver Scheme, which allowed people to use their superannuation to buy their way into the real estate market. That was maybe a noble objective in the first place, but it was one which did not have regard to what it would do to the intention of superannuation in providing reasonable retirement earnings for people. And, by the way, it would have absolutely no effect at all on the affordable housing crisis, particularly what's being faced in Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane.


Only last week, there was another thought bubble that came from those opposite. They thought it would be wise to give a 12-month amnesty to employers who failed to make superannuation contributions on behalf of their employees for the last 25 years. Ordinarily, if you didn't pay your tax for 25 years, you would get a penalty. If you didn't pay your superannuation under current law, you would be penalised; as a matter of fact, you'd be penalised 200 per cent. Wipe all that! They're now saying that, under this amnesty, if you want to declare yourself and become an honest broker after 25 years—'Mea culpa; I haven't paid my employees properly'—you've got 12 months to rectify it. But what's unbelievably worse is that they will give that employer a tax deduction on the contributions they make. They're not just going to say, 'Don't do it again.' They're going to give them a tax deduction!


Just compare that to what the treatment would've been if an employee had been ripping off their employer for the last 25 years. They would probably be summarily dismissed in the first place once they were caught, and it is highly likely they would be fronting up before a court on some criminal charges of theft or whatever. So they're happy to look after dodgy employers and reward them with a tax deduction, but not so when it comes to workers.


The former speaker said looking after people is in their DNA. Well, for some of us on our side, looking after people has been in our DNA. I don't mind admitting that, like many on my side, we were formerly workers' representatives. We are working and advocating for workers' rights and looking after them as members of the trade union movement. I actually wear it as a badge of honour, but they want to create a slight about that.


Just think back: when was the last time you ever heard a positive word said by this government about a union or about a union official? I don't know if you can remember it, but there is one time. They spoke about Kathy Jackson, the then National Secretary of the Health Services Union. According to the Leader of the House and the Prime Minister, she was the hero of the trade union movement. She was the defender of workers' rights, a person we should look up to. They used a word: she was a 'doyenne' of the working class. Poor old Kathy at the moment is facing court on corruption charges in Victoria. Adverse findings have been made by the trade union royal commission, which they set up. But that was their hero of the working class. It was not someone who is going out, looking after people, looking after low-income earners and making sure their welfare has been looked after. They pick someone to hold up as an exemplar of trade union official, and the only example they ever have picked up to do that is, as I say, currently defending criminal charges resulting from corruption allegations.


The provisions in this bill, as I said at the outset, are good. We certainly want to be guarded against any unintended consequences. We want to make sure that we do not unnecessarily complicate things for people in high-risk occupations, see a possible increase of insurance premiums or make any change that would result in lower returns for members. We think we need to do everything to protect employees' savings and, in particular, superannuation. Superannuation, quite frankly, I think is one of the key initiatives that were brought in within our generation. It is a mechanism that we should be encouraging all people to be part of, not simply with their own contributions but looking to prop those up where necessary. It's not just about bringing people away from the concept of welfare or being on the old-age pension; it's a matter of making proper provision for their life in retirement. This is a matter of decency. It's a matter that we will always support on our side of politics, and I would caution those opposite to be more restrained when they refer to trade unions.

"Van Manen, Bert, MP",LP,2018-06-28,"



Mr VAN MANEN
 (Forde—Government Whip) (12:43):  I have to admit that I do like the member for Fowler. There's much in his contribution that I could speak on, but, in the interest of staying focused on the bill before us, I won't do so. But I will just outline a couple of things for the member for Fowler and his colleagues over there to consider. One of the reasons we're discussing the Treasury Laws Amendment (Protecting Your Superannuation Package) Bill 2018 is that in 2013, as part of the MySuper changes that those opposite legislated when the Leader of the Opposition was the Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation, they removed the member protections for small-balance superannuation accounts. I haven't heard those opposite mention that in their contributions this afternoon. Those standards protected accounts with balances of less than $1,000 from erosion via fees by ensuring those fees could not exceed the earnings of the superannuation fund. Whilst those opposite talk about protecting people with low balances, in reality when they were in government they did exactly the opposite. As is said many times in this place by my colleagues, it's not about what those opposite say; it's actually about what they do.


This bill is a great step in protecting the hard-earned superannuation contributions of working Australians. They're hard earned because, as the member for Fowler outlined, initially super was a trade-off for a wage increase. Now, with 9½ per cent of people's earnings going into superannuation, for the majority it is their second largest investment, behind their home. It is critically important that we have a system and framework that protects those funds from erosion via unnecessary fees and charges or, in some cases, inappropriate insurance.


The other interesting comment the member for Fowler made was around the importance of super in EBAs. Mandating a superannuation fund in an enterprise bargaining agreement means those employees have no choice whatsoever about where their superannuation goes. Nearly a million employees in Australia have no choice of where their superannuation goes. If they already have a personal or other fund and join an employer that has an EBA, they cannot have that employer put their superannuation into their existing fund. So what do they finish up with? They have multiple funds. We know that some 40 per cent of Australians have more than two funds.


In my experience prior to coming to this place in 2010 I had a client who had eight different superannuation funds, including the one into which contributions were being paid. It took nine months of working with that client and the various superannuation funds to consolidate all of that super into the one fund into which his contributions were going, but in the meantime all of those other funds were collecting fees and insurance premiums. In a number of cases, in those funds where he had income protection cover, he wasn't able to claim on any of that income protection cover and therefore was paying a premium for something he wouldn't ever have received. He wasn't getting any service, advice or anything like that from those funds. They were all funds with small balances. At the end of the day once we tallied them all up it was maybe $9,000 or $10,000.


These are the people this bill is seeking to protect. The measures in this bill, particularly around improving the capacity of the ATO to receive those low-balance superannuation accounts—those below $6,000 that have been inactive and are without insurance—are critically important. The bill will empower the ATO to proactively obtain those funds, then work through its systems to transfer those funds to an existing fund for that member.


Equally, it is important that where we see funds with a low balance—and we've set that limit at $6,000 in this bill—we provide the opportunity, where people are under 25, for default insurance arrangements not to exist on an automatic acceptance basis. Those superannuation members can always opt in to obtain insurance cover. It's about those first few years of accumulating your superannuation fund. When you start out in the workforce, there are two important things: the risk of multiple accounts and the risk of insurance cover that you don't necessarily need or that is way above what you need, and consequently paying unnecessary premiums. There is also a risk, as I've seen in many product disclosure statements, that even if you do have that insurance cover in your fund, particularly with income protection—less so with death and total and permanent disablement—you can't even claim on the income protection policy or, in a lot of cases too, death and total and permanent disablement cover, because you do not meet the relevant thresholds for making a claim within the fund. So why is there a situation where people are apparently covered for something and paying for something that they have no ability to access in the event they actually need it?


I don't think that that is a system that benefits hardworking Australians who are trying to save and accumulate super for further retirement. As has been rightly pointed out by a number of speakers in this place, we want to see people's superannuation grow and accumulate so that they have more in their superannuation funds when they retire, thereby ensuring that the requirement of government for age pensions is reduced. That was the original purpose of superannuation. It was to allow people to accumulate wealth in a tax-advantaged environment where they couldn't touch it until they were age 65—or age 55, in some cases—so that the requirement for the government to help fund people's retirement through the age pension would be reduced. We recognise as our population is getting older that the number of people actually working to support our social security and our age pension system is reducing. So the tax revenues are not necessarily there. That is the whole purpose of superannuation. The more we can do at the outset to create a superannuation system that protects those balances when they are small and ensures that the number of accounts that people have is kept to a minimum, the better it will be for those people in accumulating that superannuation and that wealth for their retirement. I commend this bill to the House. I think it's a tremendous example, again, of what this government is seeking to do to protect people's savings, allowing them to grow wealth and prosperity for the future not only for themselves but for their families and the country.

Ms O'DWYER
 (Higgins—Minister for Revenue and Financial Services, Minister for Women and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service) (12:53):  Firstly, I'd like to thank those in the chamber who have contributed to this debate. I particularly thank the member for Forde, who preceded me in speaking, for his passionate advocacy on behalf of so many superannuants. I am a bit disappointed that those opposite have not taken the opportunity in this chamber to back millions of Australians and their superannuation savings by giving support to this bill, the Treasury Laws Amendment (Protecting Your Superannuation Package) Bill 2018. We have heard from them a number of weasel words where they are squirming to try to maintain a position where they are of course protecting vested interests. Let's be very clear on what this bill does. This bill demonstrates the government's commitment to put members first and protect their hard-earned retirement savings from erosion through excessive fees, inappropriate insurance arrangements and the inefficiencies which result from having multiple superannuation accounts.


Schedule 1 to this bill prevents trustees of superannuation funds from charging administration and investment fees exceeding three per cent per annum of the balance of accounts below $6,000. Those listening to this debate will recall that there was a time when there were caps on fees. It was when the Leader of the Opposition was the minister responsible for superannuation that we saw fees become uncapped for low-balance accounts—accounts of below $1,000. This schedule also prevents trustees from charging exit fees, regardless of the account balance, which, of course, makes it so much easier for people to consolidate accounts.


Schedule 2 to the bill will address the provision of insurance through superannuation. The schedule requires that insurance be provided on an opt-in basis only for members with balances below $6,000, for accounts that have not received a contribution for 13 months or longer, and for any new members from 1 July 2019 who are under the age of 25. Again, when the Leader of the Opposition was responsible for superannuation, he presided over a change that saw young people defaulted into superannuation arrangements where they had to take out insurance, whether or not they wanted it or needed it. Under this bill, we are changing this.


Under schedule 3 to the bill, all inactive accounts with a balance below $6,000 and no insurance cover will be transferred to the Australian Taxation Office. The schedule also empowers the ATO, for the first time, to proactively return these amounts, along with existing unclaimed superannuation monies, to their rightful owners' active accounts. The ATO estimates that within a month of receiving the funds it will be able to reunify the amounts it holds with the rightful owners, which is a good outcome for those members. The amendments in the bill all apply from 1 July 2019. I commend the bill to the House.

"Thistlethwaite, Matt, MP",ALP,2018-06-28,"



Mr THISTLETHWAITE
 (Kingsford Smith) (11:40):  The Treasury Laws Amendment (Protecting Your Superannuation Package) Bill 2018 aims to protect members' superannuation savings from erosion by fees and charges. Of course, this is an objective that Labor is sympathetic to. As the shadow Treasurer said in his remarks to the Press Club in May, 'We also think insurance, opt-in insurance, is a legitimate issue to consider, particularly for young people with low superannuation balances.' Account holders who generally have lower superannuation balances are younger members; low-income earners—predominantly women, unfortunately—and seasonal workers.


Often people with low balances are disengaged from superannuation and do not actively monitor or organise their accounts to minimise erosion of savings. Many people also have multiple superannuation accounts, leading to them paying multiple fees, charges and insurance premiums. At 30 June 2017, over 14.8 million Australians had a superannuation account—so approximately 15 million Australians had a superannuation account—and approximately 40 per cent of those people had more than one superannuation account. Of course, when you have more than one superannuation account often you're paying multiple sets of fees and have two insurance policies covering exactly the same thing—and, therefore, you are paying premiums for both those insurance policies. It's inefficient and, ultimately, it's whittling away investment returns for those members.


This bill aims to protect members' superannuation savings from erosion by limiting fees so that low-balance savings can grow and are protected from disproportionately high fees. It also bans exit fees. This will remove a barrier to account consolidation. The bill helps to ensure that arrangements for insurance in superannuation are appropriate so that members are not paying for insurance cover that they do not know about or that is inadequate in terms of the coverage and are not paying premiums that inappropriately erode their retirement savings. Finally, this bill strengthens the ATO's role in reuniting small inactive balances to reduce the costs to members and consolidate the accounts of members that have accrued multiple superannuation accounts. 


More specifically, the bill prevents trustees of superannuation funds from charging certain fees that exceed three per cent of the balance of a MySuper or choice product annually where the balance of the account is below $6,000. It also prevents trustees from providing opt-out insurance to new members aged under 25 years, members with balances below $6,000 and members with inactive MySuper or choice accounts, unless the member has directed otherwise. This is something that some of the super funds have been looking at for some time now. AustralianSuper, the largest industry superannuation fund in the country, actually decided to implement this policy so that members aged under 25 years need to opt in to insurance within their superannuation fund. If they've got balances below a certain threshold, then those provisions kick in as well.


The bill will require the transfer of all superannuation savings with balances below $6,000 to the tax commissioner, if an account related to a MySuper or Choice product has been inactive for a continuous period of 13 months or more. The proposed start date for these changes is 1 July 2019, and the explanatory material reports that the changes are expected to raise savings of $1.75 billion in underlying cash balance terms over the forward estimates and $850 million in fiscal balance terms. The changes in this bill are significant and will impact people's lives and retirement incomes. 


While Labor is certainly sympathetic to the objective, we wish to take our time in ensuring that there are no unintended consequences from this bill and to deeply analyse this legislation. In that respect, we are proposing that a Senate inquiry look at the provisions of this bill and their consequences and hear the views of the Australian people regarding them. Some concerns have been raised by employee representatives, by trade unions and by the operators and administrators of particular funds about the potential unintended consequences of removing insurance for people under the age of 25, particularly where they work in dangerous industries, like the building industry or the mining industry. We want to make sure that we're not unintentionally reducing that coverage. It is pretty important for people, particularly once you start raising a family, once you get married and have kids, that you do have an appropriate level of insurance. We all know that actuarial studies and other surveys have indicated that Australians are hopelessly uninsured when it comes to general insurance and, indeed, life insurance. We want to make sure that there are no unintended consequences of this and that it doesn't result in negative consequences rather than what was intended. So, as I mentioned, we will be referring it to a Senate inquiry.


When it comes to superannuation, this government doesn't have a really good record, to be honest. Of course, we remember the government's disastrous 2016 superannuation changes. After Labor led the way from opposition in 2015 and proposed policies to reform superannuation tax concessions, the government spent much of 2015 and 2016 arguing against the sensible changes to superannuation concessions that Labor had put forward. Then, in the 2016-17 budget, the government announced that it planned changes to superannuation, and they were done in a hurry and without consultation. The government's proposed $500,000 lifetime cap on non-concessional contributions triggered widespread concern that the government was making retrospective changes. Yet, the government ploughed on and, in its hurry to get to an early election, the then Prime Minister, when asked if he could foresee any circumstances in which the policy announced in the budget would change following an election, said, 'It's absolutely ironclad.' That was the Prime Minister's quote: 'It's absolutely ironclad.' They said they wouldn't be changing it. But after one of the longest elections in recent times, the divisions within the government became clear. We saw several members of the coalition raise concerns about retrospectivity, which saw the spectacle of some members of parliament threatening to cross the floor and oppose the government's budget proposals if changes weren't delivered upon. While the government eventually, reluctantly scrapped the flawed changes, it was only after it had undermined the confidence in the retirement system that sparked a civil war within the Liberal Party. Given the government's record, we will take our time to look through the proposed changes in this bill carefully.


Not only have the government made a hash out of their tax changes relating to superannuation but they have consistently shown a poor record when it comes to supporting the right changes around superannuation in this country. They voted against the introduction of universal superannuation when it was proposed by the then Treasurer, Paul Keating, back in the 1990s. They voted against every single increase in the minimum rate of the superannuation guarantee, because we all know that they don't believe in the notion of compulsory superannuation. They have never gotten over the fact that industry funds do a better job at managing people's finances than the retail funds and many of the self-managed funds. That's because there are union representatives working with employers on those superannuation trustee boards. The Liberals don't like that philosophy. They have never gotten over the fact that the industry funds do a better job of managing people's finances, in terms of lower fees and better investment performance when it comes to superannuation returns.


The Liberals delayed the scheduled increase to the superannuation guarantee from 9.5 per cent to 12.5 per cent. If we're going to ensure that Australians have an adequate income to retire on, and avoid going onto the pension in later years, particularly those workers who have breaks from the workforce—most notably women, unfortunately—if we're going to ensure that employees and workers retire with an adequate investment pool, through their superannuation, and can avoid going onto the pension, then we need to increase the compulsory rate of superannuation savings in this country. There is a litany of actuarial studies and other surveys indicating that on current trajectories most people won't make it, particularly those on low incomes—that they won't be able to ensure they have an adequate retirement savings pool, after they finish in the workplace, and thus avoid going onto the pension.


So this government's opposition to further increases in the compulsory superannuation rate is really damning for the budget, as far as increases in outlays associated with the pension are concerned. It therefore reduces the potential for us to run surpluses in the future and to fund programs that will be important, particularly aged care and other programs associated with an ageing population, like Medicare and properly funded hospitals and aged-care beds. So we need to be looking at increasing the compulsory rate of superannuation in this country, but this government has delayed it. On every occasion on which they've had the opportunity to vote for these changes, they have voted against them. They abolished the low-income superannuation scheme, and then they reintroduced it, but only under pressure from the Labor Party and from some within the industry. They reintroduced it one budget later. I think they got rid of it in the 2014 budget, and then in the 2015-16 budget they reintroduced it and renamed it the LISTO.


They undermined our superannuation system with their First Home Super Saver Scheme, which will do nothing to address housing affordability. More recently, the government has proposed a superannuation amnesty that would give a penalty holiday to employers who have not paid superannuation to their employees for as much as 25 years. The notion that under this government people who have broken the law for 25 years will be able to get away with it is completely ridiculous. Imagine if you rocked up to the tax office one day and said: 'You know what? I haven't paid income tax for 25 years. I haven't paid company tax for 25 years. I want you to give me an amnesty.' That is exactly what this government is doing with superannuation. Employers who haven't paid superannuation to their employees, which they are required to do under legislation, and for which there are quite harsh penalties, will be given an amnesty by the government. Labor, of course, has expressed its opposition to this proposal. Superannuation theft is exactly the same as wage theft. Why should dodgy employers get away with stealing hard-earned money from their employees?


In contrast, Labor has a very different philosophy when it comes to superannuation. We all know that it was the Labor Party that built the compulsory superannuation system. It has now developed into the third-largest savings investment pool in the world and it is one of the reasons that our economy had a buffer to protect Australian workers from the ravages of the global financial crisis in the wake of 2008. It was Labor that introduced universal compulsory superannuation. We proposed and legislated all of the increases to the rate of the superannuation guarantee. They were all opposed by the coalition.


Labor introduced the low-income superannuation contribution scheme, under which low-income earners would effectively not pay tax on their superannuation guarantee contributions. We introduced MySuper, the new, simple and cost-effective default superannuation product. Labor made it easier for small businesses to pay their super through the introduction of the Small Business Superannuation Clearing House in 2010. Labor led the way in reforming the payments system. The introduction of SuperStream in 2012 fundamentally improved the superannuation system experience for fund members, employers and funds.


Labor is the party of superannuation, and we'll be checking the bill, as I mentioned earlier, for unintended consequences and to consider whether there are better ways of achieving this objective. We'll take the time to consult with stakeholders and to explore concerns that have been raised, including: that the removal of default insurance could lead to members with high-risk occupations, and others with families and mortgages, becoming uninsured or underinsured; that the changes could lead to an increase in premiums; and that the transfer to the ATO of accounts which have been inactive for 13 months could lead to lower returns for members. We also need to ensure that the changes to the fees will not be able to be circumvented through an increase in other charges.


In conclusion, the objective of trying to protect the balances of people with low balances is one Labor is sympathetic to, but we'll take our time to work through these measures in this bill and we'll reserve our position on it, including on whether any amendments are required, until after the Senate Economics Committee inquiry into the bill has reported.

"O'Brien, Ted, MP",LP,2018-06-28,"



Mr TED O'BRIEN
 (Fairfax) (11:56):  The member for Kingsford Smith has done what Labor do so well: he has said that he is sympathetic to this bill that protects people's hard-earned money, their superannuation. The Labor Party are sympathetic, but what are they going to do? They're going to kick the can down that time-honoured road of analysis paralysis. There they stand, saying: 'We, like the government, believe in protecting super, and you know what we're going to do? We're going to analyse it even further, because there might be unintended consequences, and the Labor Party don't like springing surprises and don't like governing at speed.'


This is at a time when the Leader of the Opposition has surprised everybody, including his own caucus and front bench, with a complete reversal of tax policy. Now they're going after small and medium businesses. This is not just a denial of a tax cut to small businesses; these tax cuts have already been legislated for recently. This is an attempt by the Labor Party to collapse confidence in our economy. It is an attempt by the Labor Party to tax one of the values that this side of the House drives: aspiration. It is a clear tax on aspiration, and the Labor Party has the hide to stand in this chamber and hold back this bill, claiming that it wishes to have further analysis.


The only other bill the member opposite tried to attack was legislation debated in this House last week on providing an amnesty to employers over a 12-month period to pay superannuation that was due but not paid. This is an opportunity for 50,000 Australians to recoup the money they have earned. Did the Labor Party support that? No, they did not. An opportunity for employers to voluntarily fess up, the ones the government isn't already onto, and for over $200 million to go back to the workers—did the Labor Party support that? No, they did not. They want to kick the can again down the road and not deliver. We on this side of the House, the coalition, are different. We stand for many good and noble values firmly planted in the liberal tradition of free enterprise, personal freedom and the rule of law—not least among them is the right to aspire to be the very best you can be.


Key to any society that truly values and promotes such aspiration is one essential ingredient, and that ingredient is confidence—the very thing those opposite are trying to collapse in our economy. We share confidence in a strong Australian economy, an economy now in its 27th year of consecutive growth. It is an economy that creates jobs, thousands and thousands of new jobs, under this government. Last year we averaged more than 1,100 jobs every single day. Now, over one million jobs have been created since the coalition came to government less than five years ago. 


Then there's another level of confidence: confidence in good governance, confidence in fairness and confidence in that notion of the Australian fair go. It's this level of confidence deep within the economy, at the level of institutions and individuals, that motivates Australians to have a go, to have a crack, to work hard, to invest, and to better leverage their means to expand their enterprises and themselves. This is where the jobs and the growth ultimately come from, and it's something that the Labor Party never seems to understand. 


Labor thinks that if we have big taxes, big spending and big unions then everything will just fall miraculously into place and we'll arrive at some economic nirvana, where the iron laws of arithmetic are suspended and magic must just happen. In the real world, a strong economy doesn't just happen. It takes good government. And good government in this country empowers the efforts of all Australians through lower taxes and better protections for their wealth and their wellbeing. 


The Treasury Laws Amendment (Protecting Your Superannuation Package) Bill 2018 aims to do just that. You see, this bill is part of a wider suite of targeted reforms under this government—reforms that safeguard and sustain Australia's huge $2.6 trillion superannuation sector. The reforms introduced into this parliament will improve the governance, transparency and accountability of superannuation funds, while additional reforms will protect Australians' hard-earned savings by ensuring that all workers get their superannuation guarantee entitlements on time and in full. The Turnbull government—led most ably by the Minister for Revenue and Financial Services, who said she was not going to wait for the industry to do this—has taken resolute action to protect the superannuation savings of millions of Australians from undue erosion due to excessive fees, inappropriate insurance premiums and the inefficiencies of people having multiple accounts. 


Firstly, I will look at excessive fees. This bill will prevent the trustees of superannuation funds from charging administration and investment fees that together exceed three per cent per annum of the balance for accounts under $6,000. Trustees will likewise be banned from charging exit fees on all super accounts. I'll say that again, because I love this part of the bill: trustees will be banned from charging exit fees on all superannuation accounts. The benefit of these measures is twofold: preventing low-balance superannuation accounts from being just eaten away by high fees, and, at the same time, removing a clear disincentive to account consolidation and rollovers. The benefit, which is expected to flow to approximately seven million hardworking Australians and is estimated to save them about $570 million in the first year alone, should be obvious to almost everyone—everyone except those opposite and, in particular, the Leader of the Opposition. 


Back in 2013, when the Leader of the Opposition was the then superannuation minister, he deliberately removed protections for low-balance super accounts. These measures address the appalling consequences of the Leader of the Opposition's decision when he was the minister. And he didn't stop there, by the way. In addition to removing protections for low-balance accounts, the then minister, today's Leader of the Opposition, also required trustees to provide automatic insurance products on an opt-out basis, further eroding member account balances, with little or no real benefit in many cases. In so doing, he effectively ripped through the retirement savings of millions of Australians like a wrecking ball. Therefore, to make good on the hapless legacy of the Leader of the Opposition, this bill seeks to address issues associated with the current default insurance arrangements in superannuation accounts—more specifically those accounts held by younger Australians aged up to 25 years or members with account balances below $6,000 or whose accounts have been inactive for 13 months or more. In these cases, schedule 2 of the bill will require that insurance is only offered on an opt-in basis.


Voices within the industry, including the Financial Planning Association of Australia, have pointed to a potential underinsurance risk for young Australians and suggest that total and permanent disability cover—TPD, as it's typically referred to—coverage should remain as an opt-out policy to ensure adequate injury protection for young account holders. While this suggestion could be dismissed as self-interest, the government has carefully considered such advice and has designed the measure to ensure there is no disadvantage, so that any member can easily obtain or maintain insurance cover to suit their real needs and personal budgets. These changes have been estimated to give about five million Australians the option to save a total of up to $3 billion in unwanted insurance premiums annually.


Finally, schedule 3 of this bill will enable a more effective and timely mechanism whereby the ATO may proactively reunite and consolidate inactive accounts that are without insurance cover and have balances under $6,000. This measure in the first year is expected to reunite around $6 billion with the active accounts of about three million members. While the current system for recovering lost super will remain in operation, these new measures will significantly supplement and streamline those existing arrangements. Collectively, all the measures announced in this bill are specifically designed to restore protections lost under Labor—to protect the retirement savings of hardworking Australians against excessive account erosion and to prevent low-balance accounts from being eaten away to nothing by excessive fees, unwanted and inappropriate insurance and multiple accounts that compound inefficiencies and cost to account holders.


This government, the Turnbull government, believes strongly that the superannuation savings of Australians are their money—the Australians' money, the workers' money—and that money deserves to be protected and allowed to grow. For these reasons, I commend the bill to the House.

"Wilson, Tim, MP",LP,2018-06-28,"



Mr TIM WILSON
 (Goldstein) (12:08):  I rise to proudly support this bill, the Treasury Laws Amendment (Protecting Your Superannuation Package) Bill 2018, because it is part of a package of economic bills introduced by this government that seeks to honour the savings, the hard work, of Australians. Deputy Speaker, you may be aware, if you read through my speeches in this place—and maybe one day, like the former member for Fairfax, I might even publish a tome which will end up in the future member for Fairfax's office or perhaps corridor—that there is a consistent theme in every speech I give: the importance of people's freedom and a greater sense of intergenerational justice, where young Australians seeking opportunity are able to secure the chances they wish for in life but, equally, where security is provided for older Australians who are in a position where they can't change their circumstances.


We know, on this side of the House, that superannuation is part of that rich matrix of providing both opportunity and security at different stages of life. But there are thousands of young Australians at the moment who, under the legislative regime, have money taken out of the balance of their superannuation accounts to feed the interests of financial services companies—sometimes banks and sometimes many other agents—who want to extract the value of the hard-earned savings of those young Australians for their own benefit.


I have had constituents come up to me over time and complain about their low-balance accounts, particularly those of young people at the start of their working life, and how the value of their superannuation account balances is being extracted for the benefit of insurance payments that they don't seek, wish or want, because it doesn't reflect their stage of life. All it does is remove the value of their account to the benefit of the companies that hold their balances. Many of the constituents who have raised this with me haven't just raised it in an esoteric way. They've watched themselves or their young children who have got their first job lose the value of their superannuation account balance through these fees and insurance premiums. When you put that in the context of what the Leader of the Opposition did when in his previous role in government, when he deliberately designed mechanisms within the superannuation system to encourage the raiding of young Australians' superannuation accounts, not only does it raise an eyebrow but it also raises the question yet again: does he act in the interests of workers or does he act in the interests of his union friends, allies, comrades, financiers and sometimes acolytes? That is ultimately what this bill is trying to address. It is actually putting consumers and workers at the centre of the superannuation system, not the industry funds run by unions. 


It's a pretty straightforward proposition, which is perhaps why the opposition is so relativist on this piece of legislation. Perhaps the opposition leader and those who surround him, those who sit on the other side of this chamber, in a choice about whether union-controlled superannuation companies should be able to raid and extract every single cent of value out of the superannuation accounts of young Australians and whether funds should be provided to finance the interests of union-backed superannuation funds, are choosing the interests of their union mates yet again. That's what it looks like to me, and I suspect that's what it looks like to thousands of young Australians whose superannuation accounts are being raided by the types of regulations in law at the moment, which were unjustifiably introduced by the Leader of the Opposition and at their expense. 


It is true that there is a very important role for superannuation and people being encouraged to save for their retirement, no matter at what stage of their life. It is also true that underpinning a strong economic environment where people earn wages and contribute to their superannuation accounts is a strong economy. Of course, we know that, under this government, we have made a strong economy the primacy of our focus, because when we deliver a strong economy a human, social and environmental dividend comes with it, as well as an economic dividend. But, of course, a strong economy also heavily depends on having certainty in the market and, in particular, the legislation and regulation. We know that we don't have that with the opposition leader and the legislative agenda that he would aspire to introduce. 


I was reminded of that only this morning when I spoke on a program on 2CC Canberra radio, where the interviewer, Tim Shaw, was asking the member for Canberra simple questions like:


Do you agree and do you support your leader in the winding back of tax cuts for medium business that he announced this week?


And time and time again the member for Canberra dithered and couldn't answer the question. It was like the member for Bass the day before—in fact, it was Bass squared. Her answer was: 


We are continuing to consider businesses up to $10m turnover but we have always been crystal clear that we put schools and hospitals ahead of tax cuts for big business and the banks.


That's the standard line, the rhetoric. It has obviously been poll tested. It's not actually sincere. Then the interviewer, Mr Shaw, was quite right in saying:


Gai—


or, as we refer to her, the member for Canberra—


I asked you specifically, do you support Bill Shorten's position when he said 'yes' to the winding back of tax cuts for medium businesses? And I remind you that you are a former small business person yourself.


She responded: 


Yes I am and a proud former small business person—


good on her on that. She went on:


… as I said, we are continuing to consider … up to $10 million turnover.


Mr Shaw responded:


So the leader was wrong to announce to the media that, yes, the policy of the Australian Labor Party was to repeal already L.A.W. law tax cuts for small business?


The member for Canberra said:


Well there has been internal discussions on this issue, those discussions continue …


And the interview goes on—train wreck day 2.


In the end, we now have an opposition that clearly doesn't understand the importance of a strong economy or the interest of how it delivers for Australian workers and everything else. But the Leader of the Opposition no longer even enjoys the support of his party for his economy-wrecking agenda. I would hope that, when you see a Leader of the Opposition pushing forward an economy-wrecking agenda—whether it is repealing tax cuts, taking money out of the pockets of hardworking Australians, or it is potential meddling in industrial relations, or it is an economy-wrecking emissions reduction target; whatever the economy-wrecking position he takes—at some point the members opposite would actually stand up and defend the rights and interests of ordinary Australians and particularly workers.


That is why they should be supporting this piece of legislation—not the moral relativism that they engage with in the speeches in this place but actually supporting a cap on fees so that young Australians in particular do not have their superannuation accounts raided by union-backed superannuation funds. They should be supporting a piece of legislation that says that, if you do not want an insurance premium, you should have the freedom to choose not to get one from the get-go. You shouldn't have to find out that all this money has been taken out of your account before you turn around and say: 'Actually, I don't think that's right. At 16, I'm not sure it's actually a good financial decision to get a life insurance premium.' It might be, later, but not when you're only earning a few thousand dollars and you certainly have a superannuation account balance of less than six grand.


That's what's at the heart of this piece of legislation. It's just making sure that young Australians and those people with low, duplicate accounts don't get their money raided by the unions. Imagine that! I would have thought that this is a relatively straightforward proposition for everybody in this parliament to support, except for the fact that we know it will be going against the direct agenda of the Leader of the Opposition and the Labor Party in the past, who have actively supported raiding those accounts.


This bill seeks to do very sensible things. It does not require a genius to be able to stand up and realise that the principal benefits of this legislation are for those seeking their opportunity on their way up. They might have multiple accounts and have multiple jobs. They may have low balances because they have not contributed very much over the years, because they have started at a very small base at the start of their career.


But never forget, Deputy Speaker, that there is another big group of Australians—in fact, the majority of Australians—who will gain and secure the benefit from this piece of legislation. Rightly, there has been a focus on the low balances of women in their superannuation accounts, particularly as they enter retirement age, certainly in comparison to men. We all know that there are multiple factors that drive that. But, because superannuation is often one of those matters that are heavily debated, particularly when you see family breakdown or marital breakdowns, women have been exposed to some of the worst cases of egregious gouging because of life circumstances. I never want to get into generic and overgenerous assessment of people's individual circumstances. Every person's life is different. But the other core group of Australians who will benefit from this legislative reform is not just young Australians seeking their opportunity, in that their superannuation accounts will not be raided by union interests; it is women who will get the benefit of this reform.


It saddens me no end that those on the other side of this chamber, who could be supporting sensible, pragmatic reform to support young Australians and women, have chosen to put the interests of their union mates against those of Australians. They have chosen to support those people who fund their campaigns—to support those people who organise and rally to get them elected. Sometimes there's a thing in this parliament where we should rise above the interests of politics and look at the future of the nation. If we say that we are going to sell out young Australians and women, in particular, by keeping in place an unjust, unfair form of legislation and regulation that undermines their interests to the benefit of big-union established interests, the modern Labor Party no longer has any claim to understand what justice means in a free society.

"Marino, Nola, MP",LP,2018-06-28,"



Ms MARINO
 (Forrest—Chief Government Whip) (12:19):  I'm particularly pleased to be talking on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Protecting Your Superannuation Package) Bill 2018 today because some of the young people who will be affected by our measures in this bill are actually sitting up in the viewing area. They are the wonderful young people from Busselton Senior High School, who are here in the chamber gallery today. I welcome them and I really hope they enjoy their time here today and make the most of this opportunity. It's a long way to come from Western Australia, and they've done exactly that. They're most welcome. I'm really pleased that it is young people like these young people sitting here today who will be the beneficiaries of this legislation. It will be young people and, as we heard from the previous speaker, women, in particular. 


We're taking action to make sure that these great young people here will be able, when they go to work, to retain more of their own money, ensuring that these young people retain that through personal income tax cuts as well as through the decisions we are making in this superannuation bill. They will actually be able to keep more of their money, particularly when they're on low incomes at the beginning of their careers. But I'm equally hoping that these young people sitting in the gallery today will take a personal interest in their own superannuation when they go to work. I hope that they will actually take an active interest in what's happening with their superannuation.


Of course, this bill fixes yet another Labor mess: the decision in 2013 to abolish low-balance protection as part of the MySuper changes. Low-balance accounts were very vulnerable to changes through erosion by fees and charges. But, under this particular piece of legislation, we're going to prevent trustees of super funds from charging administration and investment fees exceeding three per cent per annum on the balance of superannuation accounts below $6,000. This is really important for people on low incomes. There are around seven million Australians who will actually save around $570 million in just the first year of this change. That's just extraordinary. The actual figures involved in this are just extraordinary. That's an extra $570 million that will be retained in superannuation for hardworking Australians, helping them to earn more interest and to accumulate more savings for their senior years.


The senior years are not something that's going to affect you young people from Busselton for some time, but, when you get there, I want you to have as much in your superannuation accounts as you possibly can. These measures today are going to help with that. They will prevent trustees from charging exit fees on any superannuation product, no matter what the balance is. According to APRA data, one-third of funds charged an exit fee in 2016-17—that was a total of $52 million across the industry. That's another $52 million of your own funds that will be retained. I think that's great news.


The bill addresses the provision of insurance through superannuation. When you're young, life insurance may not be your top priority. But, when a significant proportion of retirement savings—sometimes an entire balance—is eroded by insurance premiums, it certainly is an issue. Again, this was part of the opposition leader's MySuper default, with automatic insurance on an opt-out basis rather than an opt-in basis. I can't understand why the Leader of the Opposition would have made that decision knowing how badly it would affect—and has affected—those lower paid workers. We will ensure that members who are at the greatest risk of seeing their account balances eroded will not have to have insurance provided on a default basis. It will be on an opt-in basis for members with balances below $6,000, accounts which haven't received contributions for 13 months or more and new members from 1 July 2019 who are under the age of 25. These changes will affect around five million people, with the option to save an estimated $3 billion in premiums a year. What we're doing is giving people choices and options. This is something that is in our DNA. We actually believe in people having choices and having control. This is a really important issue. I encourage people—and these great young people in the gallery today—to take a direct interest in and know exactly what's happening with their superannuation because many people do not. We recognise that some don't take that interest, but we need to make sure that, irrespective of whether people take a direct interest or not, their interests are reflected and they retain as much of their earnings and their superannuation as possible.


A million workers need to have their say on superannuation and their choice of super restrictions, which have been affected and restricted by EBA directions. But in these days of people changing jobs, many millions of Australians have multiple superannuation accounts. Young people in Busselton could have multiple changes of jobs in their lifetime. We want to make sure that, irrespective of how many times they change their jobs, they are able to consolidate that superannuation into an account where they'll know exactly how much they have at their disposal. It's interesting that, of the 14.8 million people who have a super account, 40 per cent of them have more than one account and around 176,000 people actually hold six or more accounts. They need to bring them together. That leads to tens and sometimes hundreds of thousands of dollars less at retirement. When young people retire, they're going to want every cent so that they can do the things they want to do when they're at a more mature age. I want to see that they get that.


Through this bill, the Australian Taxation Office will be given the opportunity for the first time to proactively return the balances of inactive accounts that people might have from past jobs—but they may not know where that super is—to the people who earned it, along with existing unclaimed super moneys. That's what we want. We want your money to stay with you, like personal income tax cuts. The ATO estimates it'll be able to do this within a month of receiving the funds. Like a lot of these young people, one of my staff has had five jobs in 20 years in both the private and public sectors. He did a super search to see what was out there that he didn't know about and he found over $78,000 in a lost super account. Isn't this a great reason for young people to take a very direct interest in their superannuation when they go to work? Make sure you know what's there and that you take control of that. This is a very big issue for one of my staff, and this is a practical example for anybody watching or listening as to why you need to make sure that you know what's happening with your super.


I congratulate the minister for her efforts in getting this particular bill together. We're going to see a lot of Australians in the first year—three million people—automatically getting their money back, being reunited with $6 billion of their own money. What a fabulous outcome! It's a fantastic outcome by this government that we're going to see three million people reunited with $6 billion of their own money. I commend the bill to the House.

"Hayes, Chris, MP",ALP,2018-06-28,"



Mr HAYES
 (Fowler—Chief Opposition Whip) (12:28):  I too would like to make a contribution on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Protecting Your Superannuation Package) Bill 2018. We will be giving qualified support to the passage of the bill through the House. Our position on this bill will be subject to the findings of the Senate Economics Legislation Committee. We want to make sure that this bill delivers what it purports to do and that there are no unintended consequences. Labor will always act to support the hard-earned savings of Australians. As it stands today, superannuation has $2.6 trillion under investment. That's $2.6 trillion of assets for mums and dads out there. I don't know about these young people, but I don't know how many noughts you've got to put on 2.6 to get a trillion—they'll probably work it out for us, Mr Deputy Speaker. But we will always take the side of the workers in ensuring the safeguarding of their earnings and their superannuation, and we will be part of any attempt at legislation that delivers safeguarding from inappropriate fees, insurance arrangements and the inefficiencies that result, as at present, from multiple superannuation accounts.


The more superannuation accounts are out there for a single person, the less accumulated savings are going into that person's asset base for the future. This is particularly so when we consider young people who may be working casual jobs, low-income earners who may move from one job to another, women who may take periodic breaks in their career and, particularly, seasonal workers out there moving from one regional location to another, whether they're cherry picking, working on vineyards or doing other things. The tendency is that those people are more than likely to have multiple superannuation accounts. Treasury analysis in 2016 showed that, at 30 July 2016, there were 9.5 million superannuation accounts in this country with a balance less than $6,000. That accounts for 40 per cent of all superannuation accounts. The ATO, whose role in terms of superannuation this bill will strengthen, found in their super accounts data overview in 2017 that 14.8 million Australians had superannuation accounts, but 40 per cent of those people were holding multiple accounts. If that money could be put into one account, the growth rate would be increased and therefore the asset base for retirement earnings would be similarly increased.


As I say, we will always defend superannuation. We know on this side of the House that superannuation, together with a means-tested and government-funded age pension, forms an integral part of a person's retirement earnings. Australians now rely on it. I advise everyone not to forget that it was the Labor government that created the Australian superannuation system. We are the party of superannuation, and we'll always stand in this joint to defend it. Labor understands that superannuation is now the second biggest saving vehicle of any household. Apart from the house itself that people will purchase and live in, superannuation is already the second biggest asset base and will grow into the future. Seventeen per cent of the household asset base is currently based on superannuation alone.


I'd like to remind everybody that, if it weren't for a Labor government, we wouldn't have universal compulsory superannuation. Universal compulsory superannuation had its initiation, in the first iterations, as a trade-off for productivity. It was award based. I know our colleagues over there don't like talking about awards, enterprise agreements or trade unions, but it was a trade union initiative that forwent a four per cent increase in the productivity payment for, at the start, three per cent compulsory superannuation. It has grown from there. By the way, every measure of growth in compulsory superannuation, which now stands at 9.5 per cent, has been opposed by the coalition. Labor have supported every increase in the rate of superannuation guarantee. It was a Labor government that introduced the low-income superannuation contribution scheme. I remind those opposite: don't forget that you came here under directions from your then leader and repealed that legislation, which gave a measure of support to people on low incomes. You repealed it, only to find out that that wasn't particularly electorally popular and you had to reinstate it. It was the Labor government that brought MySuper—a new, simplified, cost-effective default mechanism—to superannuation products. Again, that was an effort to streamline it and make it a more effective payment system. And, further, it was also a Labor government that in 2012 brought in the SuperStream, which fundamentally improved the superannuation system and the experience that people, would have as members of a super scheme, not only for employees but also for the employers and the funds themselves.


We will always hold this government to account, particularly on matters that involve employees and workers. Those opposite would like you to believe that they have changed their stripes and they are now all about what's best for workers. This is the party of Work Choices, the party that made it legal for the first time in our history to pay people below an award rate of pay, and they would like us to believe that they've changed their stripes!


Don't forget that, back at the 2016 election, they had a policy of a $500,000 lifetime cap to non-concessional contributions. It triggered widespread concern, because people were being encouraged to contribute to superannuation but this had the aspect of retrospectively opposing this restriction, which would fundamentally change the saving plans for many households. But the government at that stage made it very clear that they weren't up for changing. The Prime Minister gave what he described as an ironclad guarantee, and, lo and behold, what did they do? Just like with the low-income superannuation contribution scheme, they backflipped. They didn't backflip because they thought it was a bad idea; they backflipped because of the pressure that came from their Liberal Party base, who thought, 'You are now retrospectively diving into our retirement funds, and we've caught you out.'


They also made further inroads into superannuation—and you could probably put it kindly by saying 'unwittingly'—making another regressive aspect to superannuation with the introduction of the First Home Super Saver Scheme, which allowed people to use their superannuation to buy their way into the real estate market. That was maybe a noble objective in the first place, but it was one which did not have regard to what it would do to the intention of superannuation in providing reasonable retirement earnings for people. And, by the way, it would have absolutely no effect at all on the affordable housing crisis, particularly what's being faced in Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane.


Only last week, there was another thought bubble that came from those opposite. They thought it would be wise to give a 12-month amnesty to employers who failed to make superannuation contributions on behalf of their employees for the last 25 years. Ordinarily, if you didn't pay your tax for 25 years, you would get a penalty. If you didn't pay your superannuation under current law, you would be penalised; as a matter of fact, you'd be penalised 200 per cent. Wipe all that! They're now saying that, under this amnesty, if you want to declare yourself and become an honest broker after 25 years—'Mea culpa; I haven't paid my employees properly'—you've got 12 months to rectify it. But what's unbelievably worse is that they will give that employer a tax deduction on the contributions they make. They're not just going to say, 'Don't do it again.' They're going to give them a tax deduction!


Just compare that to what the treatment would've been if an employee had been ripping off their employer for the last 25 years. They would probably be summarily dismissed in the first place once they were caught, and it is highly likely they would be fronting up before a court on some criminal charges of theft or whatever. So they're happy to look after dodgy employers and reward them with a tax deduction, but not so when it comes to workers.


The former speaker said looking after people is in their DNA. Well, for some of us on our side, looking after people has been in our DNA. I don't mind admitting that, like many on my side, we were formerly workers' representatives. We are working and advocating for workers' rights and looking after them as members of the trade union movement. I actually wear it as a badge of honour, but they want to create a slight about that.


Just think back: when was the last time you ever heard a positive word said by this government about a union or about a union official? I don't know if you can remember it, but there is one time. They spoke about Kathy Jackson, the then National Secretary of the Health Services Union. According to the Leader of the House and the Prime Minister, she was the hero of the trade union movement. She was the defender of workers' rights, a person we should look up to. They used a word: she was a 'doyenne' of the working class. Poor old Kathy at the moment is facing court on corruption charges in Victoria. Adverse findings have been made by the trade union royal commission, which they set up. But that was their hero of the working class. It was not someone who is going out, looking after people, looking after low-income earners and making sure their welfare has been looked after. They pick someone to hold up as an exemplar of trade union official, and the only example they ever have picked up to do that is, as I say, currently defending criminal charges resulting from corruption allegations.


The provisions in this bill, as I said at the outset, are good. We certainly want to be guarded against any unintended consequences. We want to make sure that we do not unnecessarily complicate things for people in high-risk occupations, see a possible increase of insurance premiums or make any change that would result in lower returns for members. We think we need to do everything to protect employees' savings and, in particular, superannuation. Superannuation, quite frankly, I think is one of the key initiatives that were brought in within our generation. It is a mechanism that we should be encouraging all people to be part of, not simply with their own contributions but looking to prop those up where necessary. It's not just about bringing people away from the concept of welfare or being on the old-age pension; it's a matter of making proper provision for their life in retirement. This is a matter of decency. It's a matter that we will always support on our side of politics, and I would caution those opposite to be more restrained when they refer to trade unions.

"Van Manen, Bert, MP",LP,2018-06-28,"



Mr VAN MANEN
 (Forde—Government Whip) (12:43):  I have to admit that I do like the member for Fowler. There's much in his contribution that I could speak on, but, in the interest of staying focused on the bill before us, I won't do so. But I will just outline a couple of things for the member for Fowler and his colleagues over there to consider. One of the reasons we're discussing the Treasury Laws Amendment (Protecting Your Superannuation Package) Bill 2018 is that in 2013, as part of the MySuper changes that those opposite legislated when the Leader of the Opposition was the Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation, they removed the member protections for small-balance superannuation accounts. I haven't heard those opposite mention that in their contributions this afternoon. Those standards protected accounts with balances of less than $1,000 from erosion via fees by ensuring those fees could not exceed the earnings of the superannuation fund. Whilst those opposite talk about protecting people with low balances, in reality when they were in government they did exactly the opposite. As is said many times in this place by my colleagues, it's not about what those opposite say; it's actually about what they do.


This bill is a great step in protecting the hard-earned superannuation contributions of working Australians. They're hard earned because, as the member for Fowler outlined, initially super was a trade-off for a wage increase. Now, with 9½ per cent of people's earnings going into superannuation, for the majority it is their second largest investment, behind their home. It is critically important that we have a system and framework that protects those funds from erosion via unnecessary fees and charges or, in some cases, inappropriate insurance.


The other interesting comment the member for Fowler made was around the importance of super in EBAs. Mandating a superannuation fund in an enterprise bargaining agreement means those employees have no choice whatsoever about where their superannuation goes. Nearly a million employees in Australia have no choice of where their superannuation goes. If they already have a personal or other fund and join an employer that has an EBA, they cannot have that employer put their superannuation into their existing fund. So what do they finish up with? They have multiple funds. We know that some 40 per cent of Australians have more than two funds.


In my experience prior to coming to this place in 2010 I had a client who had eight different superannuation funds, including the one into which contributions were being paid. It took nine months of working with that client and the various superannuation funds to consolidate all of that super into the one fund into which his contributions were going, but in the meantime all of those other funds were collecting fees and insurance premiums. In a number of cases, in those funds where he had income protection cover, he wasn't able to claim on any of that income protection cover and therefore was paying a premium for something he wouldn't ever have received. He wasn't getting any service, advice or anything like that from those funds. They were all funds with small balances. At the end of the day once we tallied them all up it was maybe $9,000 or $10,000.


These are the people this bill is seeking to protect. The measures in this bill, particularly around improving the capacity of the ATO to receive those low-balance superannuation accounts—those below $6,000 that have been inactive and are without insurance—are critically important. The bill will empower the ATO to proactively obtain those funds, then work through its systems to transfer those funds to an existing fund for that member.


Equally, it is important that where we see funds with a low balance—and we've set that limit at $6,000 in this bill—we provide the opportunity, where people are under 25, for default insurance arrangements not to exist on an automatic acceptance basis. Those superannuation members can always opt in to obtain insurance cover. It's about those first few years of accumulating your superannuation fund. When you start out in the workforce, there are two important things: the risk of multiple accounts and the risk of insurance cover that you don't necessarily need or that is way above what you need, and consequently paying unnecessary premiums. There is also a risk, as I've seen in many product disclosure statements, that even if you do have that insurance cover in your fund, particularly with income protection—less so with death and total and permanent disablement—you can't even claim on the income protection policy or, in a lot of cases too, death and total and permanent disablement cover, because you do not meet the relevant thresholds for making a claim within the fund. So why is there a situation where people are apparently covered for something and paying for something that they have no ability to access in the event they actually need it?


I don't think that that is a system that benefits hardworking Australians who are trying to save and accumulate super for further retirement. As has been rightly pointed out by a number of speakers in this place, we want to see people's superannuation grow and accumulate so that they have more in their superannuation funds when they retire, thereby ensuring that the requirement of government for age pensions is reduced. That was the original purpose of superannuation. It was to allow people to accumulate wealth in a tax-advantaged environment where they couldn't touch it until they were age 65—or age 55, in some cases—so that the requirement for the government to help fund people's retirement through the age pension would be reduced. We recognise as our population is getting older that the number of people actually working to support our social security and our age pension system is reducing. So the tax revenues are not necessarily there. That is the whole purpose of superannuation. The more we can do at the outset to create a superannuation system that protects those balances when they are small and ensures that the number of accounts that people have is kept to a minimum, the better it will be for those people in accumulating that superannuation and that wealth for their retirement. I commend this bill to the House. I think it's a tremendous example, again, of what this government is seeking to do to protect people's savings, allowing them to grow wealth and prosperity for the future not only for themselves but for their families and the country.

"O'Dwyer, Kelly, MP",LP,2018-06-28,"



Ms O'DWYER
 (Higgins—Minister for Revenue and Financial Services, Minister for Women and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service) (12:53):  Firstly, I'd like to thank those in the chamber who have contributed to this debate. I particularly thank the member for Forde, who preceded me in speaking, for his passionate advocacy on behalf of so many superannuants. I am a bit disappointed that those opposite have not taken the opportunity in this chamber to back millions of Australians and their superannuation savings by giving support to this bill, the Treasury Laws Amendment (Protecting Your Superannuation Package) Bill 2018. We have heard from them a number of weasel words where they are squirming to try to maintain a position where they are of course protecting vested interests. Let's be very clear on what this bill does. This bill demonstrates the government's commitment to put members first and protect their hard-earned retirement savings from erosion through excessive fees, inappropriate insurance arrangements and the inefficiencies which result from having multiple superannuation accounts.


Schedule 1 to this bill prevents trustees of superannuation funds from charging administration and investment fees exceeding three per cent per annum of the balance of accounts below $6,000. Those listening to this debate will recall that there was a time when there were caps on fees. It was when the Leader of the Opposition was the minister responsible for superannuation that we saw fees become uncapped for low-balance accounts—accounts of below $1,000. This schedule also prevents trustees from charging exit fees, regardless of the account balance, which, of course, makes it so much easier for people to consolidate accounts.


Schedule 2 to the bill will address the provision of insurance through superannuation. The schedule requires that insurance be provided on an opt-in basis only for members with balances below $6,000, for accounts that have not received a contribution for 13 months or longer, and for any new members from 1 July 2019 who are under the age of 25. Again, when the Leader of the Opposition was responsible for superannuation, he presided over a change that saw young people defaulted into superannuation arrangements where they had to take out insurance, whether or not they wanted it or needed it. Under this bill, we are changing this.


Under schedule 3 to the bill, all inactive accounts with a balance below $6,000 and no insurance cover will be transferred to the Australian Taxation Office. The schedule also empowers the ATO, for the first time, to proactively return these amounts, along with existing unclaimed superannuation monies, to their rightful owners' active accounts. The ATO estimates that within a month of receiving the funds it will be able to reunify the amounts it holds with the rightful owners, which is a good outcome for those members. The amendments in the bill all apply from 1 July 2019. I commend the bill to the House.

"Georganas, Steve, MP",ALP,2018-06-28,"



Mr GEORGANAS
 (Hindmarsh) (12:58):  I rise to speak on the Airports Amendment Bill 2016. I indicate my support for the amendments that will be moved by the member for Grayndler. I do so because, as you would probably be aware, Mr Deputy Speaker, I have Adelaide Airport in the middle of my electorate—it is situated at West Beach, six kilometres from the Adelaide CBD, in the heart of the electorate of Hindmarsh, and it is surrounded by housing density all the way around, on every side. Like all members in this place, I recognise that aviation is a significant creator of jobs, and economic activity as well. It is one of the largest employers in the electorate of Hindmarsh. It employs more people than most other industries in the airport precinct.


For example, the South Australian tourism industry supports more than 36,000 direct jobs and is worth more than $6 billion annually to my state of South Australia. Direct tourism jobs have increased by 13.8 per cent to 35,700. That is the data from the tourist research that was revealed. This growth rate is significantly higher than the national average of approximately five per cent. We've beaten every other state in that area.


The Airports Amendment Bill 2016 before us seeks to amend the Airports Act 1996, which sets out the conditions that airport lessees operate under. In South Australia, Adelaide Airport Ltd took over the airport back in 2000. Once upon a time it was operated by the federal government of Australia, and gradually we have seen the privatisation of airports around the country. While this act may spell out the legal conditions, it's important that our airports also operate under a social licence—particularly an airport like Adelaide Airport in my electorate, as it is surrounded by housing on all sides six kilometres from the CBD. This is a licence granted when the community is properly engaged and appreciates the benefits an airport brings, but this is also a licence that is maintained through consultation and dialogue.


I have to say that, because there were so many issues with the airport in my electorate years ago and because we do continue to have the odd issue here and there, we set up a consultative group which included residents, resident organisations, industries, airlines and airport workers. We would meet continually every few months to nut out the issues and problems under the guidance of Phil Baker, who was then the CEO of Adelaide Airport. It created a structure and atmosphere of working together and getting through issues.


I'm pleased to say that, when we on this side of the House were in government, the member for Grayndler looked at our consultative committee in South Australia and how well it worked and decided to ensure that there were consultative committees all around Australia where airports existed. I'm proud to say that the model that we put together with residents groups in my electorate became the model which is currently being used for all of Australia. This was a good and important way to find a good balance between aircraft travel and the thousands of residents who live directly under the flight path like in my electorate. We estimate approximately 25,000 residents are directly under the flight path. I'm one of them. I've lived under the flight path my entire life. My dogs jump up and try to bite the aeroplanes; that's how low they fly over my house.


During my time in this place I've raised this issue many times and I've been proud to represent the interests of my local community when it comes to matters of aviation. I'm very proud of our achievements when we were in the Rudd-Gillard government, through the National aviation policy white paper and having worked with the member for Grayndler to ensure that the community and stakeholder voices were heard and protected, as I said, through a formalised consultative process that airports have.


Also through the national aviation white paper we had greater safeguards for residents living in areas adjacent to airports and flight paths. We had mechanisms for the protection of their interests. For example, we have a curfew in Adelaide Airport between 11 pm and 6 am. I think it's important we maintain that curfew and I've always been a staunch defender of that curfew because, when you have an airport six kilometres from the CBD and surrounded by 25,000 households, it is an issue. You have shiftworkers. You have mothers and fathers with young children. You have people that need some form of peace and quiet between those hours.


The upside for the airport is that it is so close to the CBD. That is a special position to be in when you look at airports around the world, where airports are placed miles and miles—sometimes up to two hours—out of the CBD. We know also that having a curfew is not an unusual thing. We know that major airports around the world have curfews. For example, Hong Kong has a curfew of a sort where planes are not allowed to fly in over residential properties or over land between, I think, 11 pm and 7 am. They have flights that come in but only over the sea. Those are the regulations they have in place. LaGuardia Airport in New York has a curfew, as do many other airports around the world. It's not unusual. We hear of people that want to get rid of the curfew and open it up 24 hours a day. I think that curfew is protecting the interests of the residents that live around the airport. I pushed for that for a long time.


We also saw the creation of the Aircraft Noise Ombudsman to receive and resolve complaints from the general public that relate to aircraft noise. Previously, constituents or residents would ring the airport, me, Aviation Australia et cetera for their complaints. There was no independent body to investigate their complaints and come up with findings. In the history of Australia there have been ombudsmen whenever we have privatised our banks or our telecommunications. There have been ombudsmen in those areas because we need an independent umpire to ensure that, when issues were raised by the public, someone would look at it in a completely independent way. I pushed for the Aircraft Noise Ombudsman and spoke to the minister when we were in government, and the member for Grayndler received those issues and came up with a great policy, where we now have the Aircraft Noise Ombudsman, an independent body that can look at those complaints and queries from residents and can resolve them. This was a great innovation and is continuing to be a terrific success.


We also developed a major development plan trigger—this goes to the body of this particular bill—to ensure that the community has the opportunity to scrutinise developments and their impact, so that the local area is not adversely affected. This bill seeks to increase the current threshold from $20 million to $35 million. The rationale presented to us by the government is that the construction CPI has increased since the threshold was put in place. While we on this side of the House accept that the construction CPI may have increased by about 20 per cent since 2007, the bill proposes to increase the threshold by 75 per cent. This would mean a large-scale project could proceed without consultation, local input or public scrutiny from those affected. This could adversely affect a whole area or suburb, and we have seen this happen when there hasn't been good consultation.


The bill also provides that if the minister decides to do nothing with a major development plan within 15 days then it is deemed approved with reduced consultation. We know the history of this government with this parliament. They couldn't even get their act together to keep this parliament under control at the beginning of the parliamentary three-year term. They lost control of this parliament twice. Those opposite have an aversion to turning up and doing their job. This parliament nearly collapsed because they couldn't even get their act together. If you give the minister only 15 days, how can you trust that they will properly consider major development proposals and their impacts, especially on communities such as mine?


The issue of the curfew, as I said, has been particularly important to my electorate. I'm proud that our government continued to protect the curfew, which from time to time enjoyed bipartisan support. I have to give due credit to one of the former members for Hindmarsh, Ms Chris Gallus, who was a Liberal member but fought very hard for the curfew. I was then chair of the Adelaide Airport residents group, which was a group with over 200 members that lived around the airport, and she worked very closely with us. I was neither a member of parliament nor a candidate at that time, but we worked so closely together that the curfew was enshrined in law.


On the eve of the 2013 election, the former candidate for the Liberal Party put out leaflets saying that the curfew would remain with the bipartisan support of both political parties. It's a pity. They put their hands on their hearts and promised that there'd be no changes. We had promises from the Liberal candidate and from the Liberal opposition about undertaking and maintaining the Adelaide Airport curfew. Guess what? Less than two months after the Liberal candidate won the seat of Hindmarsh and the Liberal government came to power, that commitment disappeared. That broken election commitment allowed aircraft to come in before 6 am, even though we had a promise by the Liberal opposition and the Liberal candidate at the time that this would not happen. They broke their promise less than two months after they formed government—and after they had put out leaflets in the entire electorate promising that this would not be happening. 


I'd also like to raise the importance of keeping Australians safe. I have raised a series of questions in writing with the Minister for Home Affairs. I'm yet to hear back from him, but it was only a couple of weeks ago, so I've given him some time. I look forward to hearing back from the minister regarding these important questions about security at Adelaide Airport and airports around Australia. 


There were reports in newspapers and on radio about workers in our airports. We know they play a tremendously important role, and it's important we provide them with the resources they require and the support they need to carry out their work. I'm very proud of the work I've done with many workers at the airports, through the collapse of Ansett and more recently, with the Australian Services Union. It's so important to ensure that we make workers feel safe at work—and not just make them feel safe but also ensure that they are safe. Our emergency service workers, our security officers, our AFP—they are all hardworking, dedicated people. We have seen recently in media reports that weapons have passed through security screening undetected at Adelaide Airport on multiple occasions. This is deeply concerning, and I've called on the Minister for Home Affairs to investigate these matters. 


Labour strongly support investment in aviation and we are committed to growing the sector, but the simple fact is this investment must be underpinned by a social compact between airports and the communities that live around them. We do a pretty good job in Adelaide, through the auspices of Phil Baker, the former CEO of Adelaide Airport, and now Mark Young. We have a good consultation committee. When issues arise I ring them or they ring me. We brief one another, and we are able to work through the issues. But, as I said, this is so important, especially in Adelaide, where we have a trade-off involving an airport that is six kilometres from the CBD and is surrounded by housing and an urban environment. 


This is why these amendments will be put forward by the member for Grayndler, and I encourage this parliament to support them. I encourage them to do so because what we see in the amendments is that the proposed monetary trigger for requiring major development plans is to be reduced from $35 million to $25 million. A trigger of $35 million means that bigger projects, projects that have a bigger impact on the community, would be able to go through without any consultation. We are told we need this to 'align better with the recent cost escalations', but, in effect, our amendments mean that more projects at airports will require a formal development application process, which means that there could be better consultation and better input from those communities that are adversely affected.

"Perrett, Graham, MP",ALP,2018-06-28,"



Mr PERRETT
 (Moreton—Opposition Whip) (13:13):  Aviation brings people and cultures together like no other form of transport. Air travel reunites Australian families and friends within and beyond our Australian borders. It can also be a lifeline for Australians in remote and regional areas who rely on aviation to receive critical aeromedical services. 


The aviation sector is central to Australia's economy. It is a significant creator of jobs and contributes in excess of $30 billion per annum to the Australian economy. It also plays a vital role in supporting international tourism, which is a key part of Queensland's economy, with over half the international tourists travelling to their destination by air. In particular, Australia's airports are critical pieces of economic infrastructure which support our aviation sector. 


Archerfield Airport is a key part of my electorate of Moreton, with a history dating back to the early 1930s. In fact, Archerfield was originally set up in the late 1920s and it actually replaced Eagle Farm as Brisbane's domestic airport in 1931. During World War II, Archerfield became a hive of activity. My grandfather worked there as a grader driver. During World War II, Archerfield was used by the Royal Australian Air Force, obviously, but it was also used by the Royal Netherlands Air Force because the Dutch East Indies government-in-exile was actually just down the road at Wacol. So there was actually another crown operating in Australia at that time in Wacol. Not many people realise that. It is a tale worth telling, especially when it comes to Indonesian independence. Much of their equipment—naval equipment, aeroplanes and the like—wasn't able to go back to fight the Indonesian independence movement because the Australian union movement black-banned the movement of those vehicles. But that's a story for another time; we're talking about airports. Archerfield was also used by the United States Army Air Forces and the Royal Navy Fleet Air Arm. In fact, they were almost at the end of my street in Moorooka. Many of the houses in my electorate were built by military forces that were there during World War II. Especially after MacArthur moved his headquarters to Brisbane, the use of the rather waterlogged Eagle Farm declined and the focus went to Archerfield. Then, obviously, Brisbane has taken off as the airport, incorporating part of Eagle Farm. If you have flown into Brisbane, you would have seen that they had to put a lot of fill there because it is very swampy territory. That is a little bit of the history.


Archerfield Airport and Brisbane Airport have changed over the years. Obviously, the Archerfield Airport has faced numerous ups and downs. Currently, the airport operates as a general aviation airport under the Airports Act, and, like most, but not all, airports, it's on Commonwealth land with a 99-year lease. Likewise, Brisbane Airport is on Commonwealth land with a 99-year lease, renewed after 50 years. The Archerfield Airport employs the equivalent of 13 full-time staff and has approximately 140,000 aircraft movements per year. As such, Archerfield Airport operates at a much smaller scale than major airports like Brisbane, Melbourne, Sydney or Perth. Currently, however, the Airports Act does not appropriately distinguish between the major airports and smaller airports like Archerfield when it comes to planning and development. This has become a significant problem for Archerfield Airport and prevents the airport from realising its full potential—something its neighbours are probably okay with because, obviously, planes flying overhead cause some disturbance to people in my electorate. It is therefore necessary for the viable management and operation of Archerfield Airport that a more appropriate regulatory framework is applied to it. The proposed Airports Amendment Bill changes multiple aspects of the act in order to achieve a more suitable regulatory framework for general aviation airports like Archerfield. Therefore, I support this bill. However, I believe some amendments are needed to achieve a more appropriate balance in the regulatory framework.


Firstly, the bill seeks to make changes to airport master plan requirements in the Airports Act. The Airports Act provides for the establishment of much-needed airport master plans for federally leased airports. A master plan operates as a 20-year strategic vision for an airport site. The master plan addresses future land uses, types of permitted development and noise and environmental impacts that involve consultation with neighbours. It also includes an environmental strategy which sets out the airport's plan to manage environmental issues. This is vitally important, as airports, if not managed correctly, can have many negative environmental impacts on local communities, such as poorer air quality, poorer water quality and high waste production. I know, Deputy Speaker Claydon, you are well aware of the consequences of PFAS getting into the environment.


Under the act, a new master plan must be prepared every five years for all federally leased airports except the Tennant Creek and Mount Isa airports. Preparing a master plan can be potentially a very laborious and expensive process for smaller general aviation airports like Archerfield, which often do not have the internal resources to carry out this entire process in house, as many of the major airports do. As a result, much of this work is farmed out to external consultants and advisers. The plans themselves take nearly two years to develop, and a significant burden is placed on the staff at the airport during such processes. There is also the prospect of administrative review, which an airport's neighbours are obviously entitled to consider.


Such difficulties are demonstrated by the process undertaken by the Archerfield Airport Corporation in relation to their previous master plan. Consultation for that plan began in December 2008; however, because the plan was subject to a three-year Administrative Appeals Tribunal review, it was not completed until July 2015. Just six months later the process had to start again for the current master plan. This has come at significant distraction to the effective management and operation of the airport by staff.


The Airports Amendment Bill is a significant step towards addressing this issue. Under the proposed changes new master plans will be required only every eight years, instead of every five years, for federally leased airports like Archerfield, with the exception of the major airports—Brisbane, Melbourne, Perth and Sydney. The changes enable an improved balance to be struck between the regulation of airports and effective airport management and operation. This amendment will help to ensure that master plans continue to provide an updated, comprehensive vision for the sustainable use and development of airports, yet the plans will not be produced so frequently as to substantially infringe on the day-to-day operation of airports like Archerfield.


Further, the Airports Act currently requires master plans to include an Australian noise exposure forecast, which forecasts future aircraft noise patterns for the areas surrounding the airport. Such forecasts are very important, as aircraft noise can substantially affect the liveability of Australian homes and neighbourhoods. However, the act currently does not specify that the forecast must be renewed for each plan. I certainly know this as I'm right under the path of the emergency helicopters that are based at Archerfield. Obviously, I know that someone is in a lot of trouble whenever the emergency helicopters go over, so, whilst it might wake me up, I always figure that it's better that I'm in my bed than in that helicopter.


The Airports Amendment Bill proposes to make it a requirement to obtain and include a new Australian noise exposure forecast when preparing a new draft master plan. This ensures that each master plan will include up-to-date information regarding the potential impacts of airport noise in local areas. This is important as these up-to-date forecasts can help to ascertain whether future changes in airport noise will substantially infringe upon local residents and businesses. This has been a concern of some residents in Moreton, particularly for residents close to Archerfield and Acacia Ridge. It's a concern that I take very seriously. It is often aired at the community meetings, thus I support the proposal to require a new forecast for each master plan.


This bill also proposes a number of changes to planning processes for major airport developments, some of which I'm committed to supporting. The Airports Act provides for the establishment of major development plans. A major airport development generally includes any significant building work or any development associated with a substantial environmental impact on the airport site. Major development plans must provide details about these major developments and their likely effects on, for example, noise, flight paths, traffic flows and the environment. These plans must be approved by the minister before any such developments can go ahead.


The act outlines that developments must be completed within five years after major development plans are approved by the minister, unless the approval states otherwise. The minister may also extend that period by up to two years. Whilst a majority of these major developments are completed within the relevant time frame, larger and more complex development projects may be unable to achieve completion within such a time period due to unforeseen delays and exceptional circumstances.


The Airports Amendment Bill proposes to remove the limitation on the number of times an airport can apply to extend the planned completion period. This allows for greater flexibility for developments—such as a new runway, which is currently occurring in Brisbane—and allows for such projects to adapt to changing circumstances. However, by using a two-year extension the necessary control is maintained. Therefore, I support this proposed change to the Airports Act.


This bill also proposes amending the act to allow an airport to withdraw an approved major development plan by giving notice to the minister of its intention not to proceed with the development. This can apply if the project has not yet commenced and the airport considers that exceptional circumstances beyond its control have made it unviable to proceed with the development. The plan ceases to be in force the day after the minister has given the airport written notice acknowledging receipt of the withdrawal notice. 'Exceptional circumstances' is not defined further by the bill, and the explanatory memorandum does not give any further explanation or examples. Whilst more clarity is needed as to what constitutes exceptional circumstances, it is clear that resources should not be wasted on unviable projects, thus, provided the proper oversight occurs in the withdrawal process, I support allowing such withdrawals.


However, this bill also proposes a number of changes to airport development planning processes that I find very problematic. Labor will be proposing two amendments to this bill to address these concerns. One such change includes increasing the trigger for major development plans to $35 million. In 2007 it was determined that a major development plan would only be required for major developments where construction costs exceeded $20 million. However, over time, rising construction costs and inflation have resulted in a larger number of projects triggering the requirement of a major development plan, perhaps sometimes unnecessarily. As such, I support increasing the trigger for major development plans. However, we need to ensure that this increase accurately reflects changes to development costs so that appropriate amount of developments will be subject to a major development plan.


The government's amendment seeks to increase the major development plan trigger to $35 million. However, this increase is too great. It is larger than the increase in the ABS construction CPI, since the trigger was last adjusted in 2007, and is inconsistent with observations of a currently soft market in civil construction activity in most parts of the nation. Increasing the trigger to $35 million would inevitably mean that many more major projects would go ahead without any public consultation or independent assessments concerning the impact of these developments on local communities. I want people in my electorate to understand what is going on at the airport they live around. I believe that residents in Moreton are entitled to have a say on plans for major airport developments that could significantly affect them. I therefore support amending the bill to change the proposed trigger from $35 million down to $20 million.


Another problem change to the Airports Act proposed in this bill concerns consultation periods for major development plans. A key part of the major development plans process is, of course, public consultation. Under the act, a draft major development plan must be published for public consultation. The public consultation period is 60 business days, although the minister may approve a shorter period of no less than 15 business days. These shorter consultation periods can only be approved if requested in writing by the airport company and if the minister is satisfied that the proposed development is consistent with the airport master plan and that it 'does not raise any issues that have a significant impact on the local or regional community'.


However, this bill proposes to insert a new provision whereby if the airport makes a request for a shorter consultation period and the minister does not make a decision on the request within 15 business days, then the minister is deemed to have approved that shorter period. This amendment raises the possibility that the minister could simply not decide on the request and then be deemed to have approved the shorter consultation period, even if the development is inconsistent with the airport master plan or raises issues that have a significant impact on local communities. In other words, it appears that this provision could potentially be used to circumvent the requirements and purpose of public consultation. Obviously, this is deeply problematic. Once again, it is vital that people in Moreton and every community surrounding an airport, all around Australia, can voice their opinions about airport developments that might affect the value of their homes, that might affect their amenity or that might affect the places that they work in. I'm therefore opposed to this provision. The current act already provides adequate scope for reduced consultation and the further relaxation of these rules not justified.


It is important for Moreton that we achieve necessary reforms to the Airports Act. It is important for airports like Archerfield Airport and, to a lesser extent, Brisbane Airport. There are low points in Moreton that are affected by the runway, particularly in Tarragindi and Annerley. When the second runway comes in, people living Chelmer, Sherwood and Graceville will be further affected by planes flying overhead. It's important that we get the change in the regulatory framework right. The Airports Amendment Bill takes important steps towards achieving a more sustainable balance. As I pointed out, some changes are necessary to strike an even better balance.

"Husar, Emma, MP",ALP,2018-06-28,"



Ms HUSAR
 (Lindsay) (13:28):  The attention given to the Airports Amendment Bill 2016 and the reliance on putting some more consultation measures in it are admirable. We know that, from this government on the opposite side, that's absolutely what's required. After you have seen their consultation over the Western Sydney Airport, you know that they would need to strengthen those provisions in this bill. That is because there has been no consultation on Western Sydney Airport with my community.


This was evident at the very first meeting that I attended with Minister Fletcher, who couldn't even name the electorate in which the airport was actually going to be built. He sat there and argued with me: 'What on earth could a backbencher from Western Sydney tell me about her own community? What on earth would she know? She is not only a backbencher but also a woman.' After he got into an argument with me over where this airport was actually located, and he conceded that I was actually right, he then gave me maybe five or 10 more minutes to discuss the airport. That was at four o'clock on a Thursday afternoon, with about 24 hours notice that the meeting was going to take place. That was the way he treated me, regarding where this airport is actually going to be.


We then saw the consultation process, when they were coming out to my community. My community were given just six days notice—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Ms Claydon
):  My apologies, but the debate is now interrupted in accordance with standing order 43. The member can be assured that she will be given leave to continue the debate at a later hour.

"Georganas, Steve, MP",ALP,2018-06-28,"



Mr GEORGANAS
 (Hindmarsh) (12:58):  I rise to speak on the Airports Amendment Bill 2016. I indicate my support for the amendments that will be moved by the member for Grayndler. I do so because, as you would probably be aware, Mr Deputy Speaker, I have Adelaide Airport in the middle of my electorate—it is situated at West Beach, six kilometres from the Adelaide CBD, in the heart of the electorate of Hindmarsh, and it is surrounded by housing density all the way around, on every side. Like all members in this place, I recognise that aviation is a significant creator of jobs, and economic activity as well. It is one of the largest employers in the electorate of Hindmarsh. It employs more people than most other industries in the airport precinct.


For example, the South Australian tourism industry supports more than 36,000 direct jobs and is worth more than $6 billion annually to my state of South Australia. Direct tourism jobs have increased by 13.8 per cent to 35,700. That is the data from the tourist research that was revealed. This growth rate is significantly higher than the national average of approximately five per cent. We've beaten every other state in that area.


The Airports Amendment Bill 2016 before us seeks to amend the Airports Act 1996, which sets out the conditions that airport lessees operate under. In South Australia, Adelaide Airport Ltd took over the airport back in 2000. Once upon a time it was operated by the federal government of Australia, and gradually we have seen the privatisation of airports around the country. While this act may spell out the legal conditions, it's important that our airports also operate under a social licence—particularly an airport like Adelaide Airport in my electorate, as it is surrounded by housing on all sides six kilometres from the CBD. This is a licence granted when the community is properly engaged and appreciates the benefits an airport brings, but this is also a licence that is maintained through consultation and dialogue.


I have to say that, because there were so many issues with the airport in my electorate years ago and because we do continue to have the odd issue here and there, we set up a consultative group which included residents, resident organisations, industries, airlines and airport workers. We would meet continually every few months to nut out the issues and problems under the guidance of Phil Baker, who was then the CEO of Adelaide Airport. It created a structure and atmosphere of working together and getting through issues.


I'm pleased to say that, when we on this side of the House were in government, the member for Grayndler looked at our consultative committee in South Australia and how well it worked and decided to ensure that there were consultative committees all around Australia where airports existed. I'm proud to say that the model that we put together with residents groups in my electorate became the model which is currently being used for all of Australia. This was a good and important way to find a good balance between aircraft travel and the thousands of residents who live directly under the flight path like in my electorate. We estimate approximately 25,000 residents are directly under the flight path. I'm one of them. I've lived under the flight path my entire life. My dogs jump up and try to bite the aeroplanes; that's how low they fly over my house.


During my time in this place I've raised this issue many times and I've been proud to represent the interests of my local community when it comes to matters of aviation. I'm very proud of our achievements when we were in the Rudd-Gillard government, through the National aviation policy white paper and having worked with the member for Grayndler to ensure that the community and stakeholder voices were heard and protected, as I said, through a formalised consultative process that airports have.


Also through the national aviation white paper we had greater safeguards for residents living in areas adjacent to airports and flight paths. We had mechanisms for the protection of their interests. For example, we have a curfew in Adelaide Airport between 11 pm and 6 am. I think it's important we maintain that curfew and I've always been a staunch defender of that curfew because, when you have an airport six kilometres from the CBD and surrounded by 25,000 households, it is an issue. You have shiftworkers. You have mothers and fathers with young children. You have people that need some form of peace and quiet between those hours.


The upside for the airport is that it is so close to the CBD. That is a special position to be in when you look at airports around the world, where airports are placed miles and miles—sometimes up to two hours—out of the CBD. We know also that having a curfew is not an unusual thing. We know that major airports around the world have curfews. For example, Hong Kong has a curfew of a sort where planes are not allowed to fly in over residential properties or over land between, I think, 11 pm and 7 am. They have flights that come in but only over the sea. Those are the regulations they have in place. LaGuardia Airport in New York has a curfew, as do many other airports around the world. It's not unusual. We hear of people that want to get rid of the curfew and open it up 24 hours a day. I think that curfew is protecting the interests of the residents that live around the airport. I pushed for that for a long time.


We also saw the creation of the Aircraft Noise Ombudsman to receive and resolve complaints from the general public that relate to aircraft noise. Previously, constituents or residents would ring the airport, me, Aviation Australia et cetera for their complaints. There was no independent body to investigate their complaints and come up with findings. In the history of Australia there have been ombudsmen whenever we have privatised our banks or our telecommunications. There have been ombudsmen in those areas because we need an independent umpire to ensure that, when issues were raised by the public, someone would look at it in a completely independent way. I pushed for the Aircraft Noise Ombudsman and spoke to the minister when we were in government, and the member for Grayndler received those issues and came up with a great policy, where we now have the Aircraft Noise Ombudsman, an independent body that can look at those complaints and queries from residents and can resolve them. This was a great innovation and is continuing to be a terrific success.


We also developed a major development plan trigger—this goes to the body of this particular bill—to ensure that the community has the opportunity to scrutinise developments and their impact, so that the local area is not adversely affected. This bill seeks to increase the current threshold from $20 million to $35 million. The rationale presented to us by the government is that the construction CPI has increased since the threshold was put in place. While we on this side of the House accept that the construction CPI may have increased by about 20 per cent since 2007, the bill proposes to increase the threshold by 75 per cent. This would mean a large-scale project could proceed without consultation, local input or public scrutiny from those affected. This could adversely affect a whole area or suburb, and we have seen this happen when there hasn't been good consultation.


The bill also provides that if the minister decides to do nothing with a major development plan within 15 days then it is deemed approved with reduced consultation. We know the history of this government with this parliament. They couldn't even get their act together to keep this parliament under control at the beginning of the parliamentary three-year term. They lost control of this parliament twice. Those opposite have an aversion to turning up and doing their job. This parliament nearly collapsed because they couldn't even get their act together. If you give the minister only 15 days, how can you trust that they will properly consider major development proposals and their impacts, especially on communities such as mine?


The issue of the curfew, as I said, has been particularly important to my electorate. I'm proud that our government continued to protect the curfew, which from time to time enjoyed bipartisan support. I have to give due credit to one of the former members for Hindmarsh, Ms Chris Gallus, who was a Liberal member but fought very hard for the curfew. I was then chair of the Adelaide Airport residents group, which was a group with over 200 members that lived around the airport, and she worked very closely with us. I was neither a member of parliament nor a candidate at that time, but we worked so closely together that the curfew was enshrined in law.


On the eve of the 2013 election, the former candidate for the Liberal Party put out leaflets saying that the curfew would remain with the bipartisan support of both political parties. It's a pity. They put their hands on their hearts and promised that there'd be no changes. We had promises from the Liberal candidate and from the Liberal opposition about undertaking and maintaining the Adelaide Airport curfew. Guess what? Less than two months after the Liberal candidate won the seat of Hindmarsh and the Liberal government came to power, that commitment disappeared. That broken election commitment allowed aircraft to come in before 6 am, even though we had a promise by the Liberal opposition and the Liberal candidate at the time that this would not happen. They broke their promise less than two months after they formed government—and after they had put out leaflets in the entire electorate promising that this would not be happening. 


I'd also like to raise the importance of keeping Australians safe. I have raised a series of questions in writing with the Minister for Home Affairs. I'm yet to hear back from him, but it was only a couple of weeks ago, so I've given him some time. I look forward to hearing back from the minister regarding these important questions about security at Adelaide Airport and airports around Australia. 


There were reports in newspapers and on radio about workers in our airports. We know they play a tremendously important role, and it's important we provide them with the resources they require and the support they need to carry out their work. I'm very proud of the work I've done with many workers at the airports, through the collapse of Ansett and more recently, with the Australian Services Union. It's so important to ensure that we make workers feel safe at work—and not just make them feel safe but also ensure that they are safe. Our emergency service workers, our security officers, our AFP—they are all hardworking, dedicated people. We have seen recently in media reports that weapons have passed through security screening undetected at Adelaide Airport on multiple occasions. This is deeply concerning, and I've called on the Minister for Home Affairs to investigate these matters. 


Labour strongly support investment in aviation and we are committed to growing the sector, but the simple fact is this investment must be underpinned by a social compact between airports and the communities that live around them. We do a pretty good job in Adelaide, through the auspices of Phil Baker, the former CEO of Adelaide Airport, and now Mark Young. We have a good consultation committee. When issues arise I ring them or they ring me. We brief one another, and we are able to work through the issues. But, as I said, this is so important, especially in Adelaide, where we have a trade-off involving an airport that is six kilometres from the CBD and is surrounded by housing and an urban environment. 


This is why these amendments will be put forward by the member for Grayndler, and I encourage this parliament to support them. I encourage them to do so because what we see in the amendments is that the proposed monetary trigger for requiring major development plans is to be reduced from $35 million to $25 million. A trigger of $35 million means that bigger projects, projects that have a bigger impact on the community, would be able to go through without any consultation. We are told we need this to 'align better with the recent cost escalations', but, in effect, our amendments mean that more projects at airports will require a formal development application process, which means that there could be better consultation and better input from those communities that are adversely affected.

"Perrett, Graham, MP",ALP,2018-06-28,"



Mr PERRETT
 (Moreton—Opposition Whip) (13:13):  Aviation brings people and cultures together like no other form of transport. Air travel reunites Australian families and friends within and beyond our Australian borders. It can also be a lifeline for Australians in remote and regional areas who rely on aviation to receive critical aeromedical services. 


The aviation sector is central to Australia's economy. It is a significant creator of jobs and contributes in excess of $30 billion per annum to the Australian economy. It also plays a vital role in supporting international tourism, which is a key part of Queensland's economy, with over half the international tourists travelling to their destination by air. In particular, Australia's airports are critical pieces of economic infrastructure which support our aviation sector. 


Archerfield Airport is a key part of my electorate of Moreton, with a history dating back to the early 1930s. In fact, Archerfield was originally set up in the late 1920s and it actually replaced Eagle Farm as Brisbane's domestic airport in 1931. During World War II, Archerfield became a hive of activity. My grandfather worked there as a grader driver. During World War II, Archerfield was used by the Royal Australian Air Force, obviously, but it was also used by the Royal Netherlands Air Force because the Dutch East Indies government-in-exile was actually just down the road at Wacol. So there was actually another crown operating in Australia at that time in Wacol. Not many people realise that. It is a tale worth telling, especially when it comes to Indonesian independence. Much of their equipment—naval equipment, aeroplanes and the like—wasn't able to go back to fight the Indonesian independence movement because the Australian union movement black-banned the movement of those vehicles. But that's a story for another time; we're talking about airports. Archerfield was also used by the United States Army Air Forces and the Royal Navy Fleet Air Arm. In fact, they were almost at the end of my street in Moorooka. Many of the houses in my electorate were built by military forces that were there during World War II. Especially after MacArthur moved his headquarters to Brisbane, the use of the rather waterlogged Eagle Farm declined and the focus went to Archerfield. Then, obviously, Brisbane has taken off as the airport, incorporating part of Eagle Farm. If you have flown into Brisbane, you would have seen that they had to put a lot of fill there because it is very swampy territory. That is a little bit of the history.


Archerfield Airport and Brisbane Airport have changed over the years. Obviously, the Archerfield Airport has faced numerous ups and downs. Currently, the airport operates as a general aviation airport under the Airports Act, and, like most, but not all, airports, it's on Commonwealth land with a 99-year lease. Likewise, Brisbane Airport is on Commonwealth land with a 99-year lease, renewed after 50 years.

Increasing the trigger to $35 million would inevitably mean that many more major projects would go ahead without any public consultation or independent assessments concerning the impact of these developments on local communities. I want people in my electorate to understand what is going on at the airport they live around. I believe that residents in Moreton are entitled to have a say on plans for major airport developments that could significantly affect them. I therefore support amending the bill to change the proposed trigger from $35 million down to $20 million.


Another problem change to the Airports Act proposed in this bill concerns consultation periods for major development plans. A key part of the major development plans process is, of course, public consultation. Under the act, a draft major development plan must be published for public consultation. The public consultation period is 60 business days, although the minister may approve a shorter period of no less than 15 business days. These shorter consultation periods can only be approved if requested in writing by the airport company and if the minister is satisfied that the proposed development is consistent with the airport master plan and that it 'does not raise any issues that have a significant impact on the local or regional community'.


However, this bill proposes to insert a new provision whereby if the airport makes a request for a shorter consultation period and the minister does not make a decision on the request within 15 business days, then the minister is deemed to have approved that shorter period. This amendment raises the possibility that the minister could simply not decide on the request and then be deemed to have approved the shorter consultation period, even if the development is inconsistent with the airport master plan or raises issues that have a significant impact on local communities. In other words, it appears that this provision could potentially be used to circumvent the requirements and purpose of public consultation. Obviously, this is deeply problematic. Once again, it is vital that people in Moreton and every community surrounding an airport, all around Australia, can voice their opinions about airport developments that might affect the value of their homes, that might affect their amenity or that might affect the places that they work in. I'm therefore opposed to this provision. The current act already provides adequate scope for reduced consultation and the further relaxation of these rules not justified.


It is important for Moreton that we achieve necessary reforms to the Airports Act. It is important for airports like Archerfield Airport and, to a lesser extent, Brisbane Airport. There are low points in Moreton that are affected by the runway, particularly in Tarragindi and Annerley. When the second runway comes in, people living Chelmer, Sherwood and Graceville will be further affected by planes flying overhead. It's important that we get the change in the regulatory framework right. The Airports Amendment Bill takes important steps towards achieving a more sustainable balance. As I pointed out, some changes are necessary to strike an even better balance.

Ms HUSAR
 (Lindsay) (13:28):  The attention given to the Airports Amendment Bill 2016 and the reliance on putting some more consultation measures in it are admirable. We know that, from this government on the opposite side, that's absolutely what's required. After you have seen their consultation over the Western Sydney Airport, you know that they would need to strengthen those provisions in this bill. That is because there has been no consultation on Western Sydney Airport with my community.


This was evident at the very first meeting that I attended with Minister Fletcher, who couldn't even name the electorate in which the airport was actually going to be built. He sat there and argued with me: 'What on earth could a backbencher from Western Sydney tell me about her own community? What on earth would she know? She is not only a backbencher but also a woman.' After he got into an argument with me over where this airport was actually located, and he conceded that I was actually right, he then gave me maybe five or 10 more minutes to discuss the airport. That was at four o'clock on a Thursday afternoon, with about 24 hours notice that the meeting was going to take place. That was the way he treated me, regarding where this airport is actually going to be.


We then saw the consultation process, when they were coming out to my community. My community were given just six days notice—

 (Parramatta) (13:30):  Continuing my Youth Voices in Parliament campaign, I would like to introduce Rebecca, a year 7 student in the Gifted and Talented class at Cumberland High School, who is passionate about the need for a swimming pool in Rydalmere. These are her words:


A multipurpose swimming pool located on the previous Macquarie Boys High School to replace the Parramatta War Memorial Swimming Pool, which was knocked down to build a bigger stadium. This solution allows the people living in the Parramatta district a place to swim without travelling all the way to Granville through infuriating traffic just to get some 'me time'. This swimming pool will accommodate all ages and professions with a kiddy pool, a children's pool, a fifty-metre pool and a diving pool that can also be used for water polo, synchronised swimming and other water sports. This pool will also provide swimming lessons and will be for hire from schools and community groups making the pool a social place to be.


Rebecca continues:


To achieve this change, I would contact the Parramatta council through mail, email or attending meetings, put up notices and send around flyers to raise awareness of this change and or start a petition to make a statement to show that we want a swimming pool. This pool would be a social place and have a positive environment to gather, and hold events and have fun. For the children a place to learn and have fun, for the adults a place to relax and get away from responsibility and for the competitors a place to train and compete. 


…   …   …   


… I think this change will change the future of this towns liveability for the better … I think the stakeholders will agree, our community needs a pool! 


Thanks, Rebecca. We certainly do need a pool.

Mr TURNBULL
 (Wentworth—Prime Minister) (14:02):  I thank the honourable member for his question. Speaking about secrets: the honourable member kept his slashing assault on small business a secret from his shadow cabinet, from his caucus and from his mystified colleagues, including the deputy leader. He kept it secret from them until he dropped that bombshell and announced that he was going to put at risk five million jobs: 4.8 million Australians, to be precise, work for businesses with a turnover of under $50 million, and those jobs are put at risk by this Leader of the Opposition in this captain's call, this relentless assault on small and family business.


The parliament will be breaking for six weeks or so, and everyone will be out campaigning hard, no doubt. It's going to be very interesting for the Leader of the Opposition. Where is he going to go? What about—



Honourable members interjecting—




Mr TURNBULL:
  Oh, he says he's going to be visiting small business perhaps—a hi-vis opportunity. Oh, yes, he could be going to Stubbs Constructions in Burnie. He could be going to see Penguin Composites. He could be going to do that with the candidate in Braddon, who announced on her Facebook page how Labor was backing Penguin Composites. She obviously wasn't watching the 7.30 program when that company was denouncing the savage assaults on its business by the Labor Party.


So where is he going to go? He can't go to any family business or any small or medium business—no more hi-vis. Where's he going to go? He could have a cup of tea with some seniors and talk about the 28 per cent of their income he's taking away, or he could talk to some workers in the construction sector and talk about his assault on the property industry, or he could talk to some of the members of what he describes as the top end of town, people on average weekly earnings of $80,000 or $90,000, and explain how he is going to deny them—if he gets into government—the opportunity of a lower tax rate. Right around the country, Australians will know that the Leader of the Opposition and the Labor Party stand for higher taxes. They stand for higher taxes on business, large and small. They stand for higher taxes on families. They stand for higher taxes on property and investment and on retirees. That means the Labor Party stand for less economic growth, fewer jobs and lower wages. I look forward to the Leader of the Opposition's tiptoeing through all the landmines he's created around Australia.

Mr McCORMACK
 (Riverina—Deputy Prime Minister, Minister for Infrastructure and Transport and Leader of The Nationals) (14:19):  I thank the member for Capricornia for her question. When you've actually run a small business, you understand how a little bit of tax relief goes a long way. The people of Rockhampton, Sarina and Central Queensland have got a fighter in the member for Capricornia. She understands, she cares, she's delivering and she's getting results for businesses such as Artisan Gluten Free Bakery in Rocky. Its owner, Simone Lawrie, backs our plans to get on and build the Rookwood Weir and to cut taxes. She told the member for Capricornia: 'I currently employ 11 staff here but I'd love to put on more staff and provide more jobs, and I'm sure that this would be the case once Rookwood Weir is under construction. And tax cuts are such a great help.' That's what she said. The member's getting results in infrastructure as well with the investment in the Bruce, Capricorn and Peak Downs highways. We back jobs. We back confidence, and we're delivering tax cuts. That's what this Liberal and Nationals government is all about. We changed the law to make it easier for small, medium and family enterprises, but now those opposite are threatening to take all of that away.


But Labor is mystified by aspiration. It's against the better deal for small, medium and family enterprises. It doesn't want to get better opportunities for Central Queenslanders. In Longman, Labor wants to hold back the growth of more than 12,000 small, medium and family enterprises. It doesn't want cafes in Caboolture to grow and hire staff. It wants to block brickies on Bribie Island from getting ahead. And we wonder how this so-called party of workers got to where they are. It might have something to do with Labor taking the 'u' out of 'labour' way back in 1912. I borrowed a very interesting book from the Parliamentary Library called A Federal Legislature. It's right up there with the new shadow small business minister's book called Hearts & Minds, published in 2013. It probably sold more copies. Hearts & Minds is still available at bookstores, which are benefiting from tax cuts brought about by the government.


In this particular book, there's a very interesting table about the Labor Party back in 1912. It says that in that Labor Party, primary producers accounted for 4.2 per cent of members; professional, 16.7 per cent; business/commercial, 14.6 per cent; and—listen to this one—tradesmen and workers, 50 per cent. Could you believe that! And union and party officials accounted for 14.6 per cent. Compare that to what we have now: staffers and unionists comprising 80 per cent of those opposite. Most of them have never worked a day in their life. That's right. They don't understand. The small business shadow minister doesn't get it. I say to the people watching this telecast at home, to the farmers listening to the broadcast on the radio, to the people of Longman, Braddon and Mayo, remember this: we know why Labor turned its back in 1912. It's because they've forgotten about you. They've forgotten about you. That's right. (Time expired)

"King, Catherine, MP",ALP,2018-06-28,"



Ms CATHERINE KING
 (Ballarat) (15:21):  The Liberals have cut $2.9 million from Caboolture Hospital. That is a fact. The Prime Minister and the Minister for Health somehow have the gall and temerity to stand up in this place and in the media and accuse Labor of lying about health funding. I'm sure they'll continue to do it every single day between now and the 28 July by-election. They are so desperate to avoid being exposed for who they really are—neoliberal crusaders hell-bent on cutting and privatising the services that Australians rely on and care about. They do all they can so that they can give the top end of town a tax cut. 


Labor won't rest until every single voter in Longman knows the truth. This government has cut $2.9 million from their hospital. Here are the facts. The Liberals promised to fund 50 per cent of the efficient price growth in our nation's hospitals. They did that in their own policy document. They lied. They broke that promise the first chance they got—literally within their first budget. The member for Warringah slashed $57 billion from public hospitals all across the nation just a few short months after promising that he would make no cuts whatsoever to health. He slashed and burned health funding. The Prime Minister reversed some of those cuts, but not all of them. He agreed to fund 45 per cent of the efficient price growth—it was better than Abbott but still well short of their promise.


In Caboolture the difference between 50 per cent and 45 per cent over the 2017-20 agreement is $2.9 million. It's a simple formula. There's nothing tricky about it. The Liberals are delivering $2.9 million less than they promised the Australian people they would, and that's $2.9 million less than would have been delivered under Labor's National Health Reform Agreement—a landmark agreement that the Liberals just could not wait to tear up. So, yes, we're telling the people of Longman about this cut. They have a right to know what this government is up to and how this government is hurting them, even if it does frustrate and anger this arrogant and out-of-touch Prime Minister to be exposed.


The $2.9 million cut to Caboolture Hospital is the equivalent of 4,300 emergency department visits, more than 800 cataract extractions or 480 births. These are real cuts that will have an impact on the capacity of the hospital to meet future demands in the region. And that $2.9 million cut over the three years of the government's current agreement, which runs from 2017 to 2020, is $715 million nationwide.


Now, they've been trying to lock in an even bigger cut from 2020 to 2025 by refusing to change their inadequate funding formula. This would result in a $2.8 billion cut nationwide, including $650 million from Queensland alone. No wonder the Queensland government are refusing to sign up to their agreement. They know this deal is woefully inadequate. We congratulate the Queensland government for holding out and demanding a better deal for Queenslanders and the people of Longman, even though it is denying some budget certainty for the Queensland government.


The Liberals claim there is no cut, because the government funding is increasing year on year. Of course it is. Funding for hospitals always increases with population and health inflation and, because it's an activity based funding system, when services and activities are carried out. If we take population alone, there will be five million more people living in Australia in 2025 than there were in 2015, the year the government uses as the benchmark for its counting. But even on that basis the government is falling short, with funding actually declining on a per capita basis. It doesn't change the fact that it's delivering less than it promised, less than Labor's agreement would have delivered and less than a Shorten Labor government actually will deliver.


Under Labor's Better Hospitals Fund, Caboolture Hospital will benefit from much better funding. That means more beds and shorter emergency department and elective surgery waiting times. The government is peddling other lies and furphies in Longman and misleading claims across the country. When the government says its funding is increasing much faster than the Queensland government funding, there is a simple reason for that. The government is calculating it off the low base of the Abbott government's rock-bottom offering. That's where it is calculating it from.


Again, here are the facts. The National Health Funding Pool report on the Metro North Hospital and Health Service for 2016-17 shows that the Queensland government provided $356 million more to Metro North hospitals than the Commonwealth last financial year—more funding from the Queensland government than the Commonwealth. And the same data from July 2017 to January 2018 shows that the Queensland government provided $310 million more to Metro North hospitals in the first half of this year alone—more funding from the Queensland government than the Commonwealth funding.


This week the government also sought to claim that Labor was lying about a lack of chemotherapy services for Caboolture Hospital. There are no chemotherapy services at Caboolture Hospital. The hospital's own website, in fact, actually confirms that—websites are something the minister likes to check, I heard, from Wikipedia. But, anyway, there you go. People have to travel to Redcliffe Hospital or to another hospital in Brisbane to get access to those services.


We think that is unacceptable for the people of Longman. That's why we have promised to invest $10 million to establish a chemotherapy treatment service at Caboolture Hospital. This investment will see 360 patients receiving around 3,700 treatments every single year. At the moment, people have to travel significant distances to access critical chemotherapy treatment and bypass the Caboolture Hospital because the service isn't available. For a cancer patient living on Bribie Island who needs chemotherapy, this will cut their travel time by half.


We believe it's important that we make these investments now because this is a fast-growing region, and there is going to be a lot of pressure on local health services into the years ahead. It is a region the government have woefully neglected. For example, this is an area that desperately needs a new MRI licence so people can get affordable access to life-saving medical scans without having to travel long distances, but the government have ignored their pleas. While Labor delivered 238 Medicare-subsidised MRI licences when we were last in office, the Liberals have just delivered—I know you'd think, 'We did 238; maybe they might have done half of that.' How many have they delivered? Just five in five years. The latest, of course, is in Kalgoorlie, as part of a dodgy deal with One Nation to win Senate votes for their inadequate income tax cuts. If only Queensland had a One Nation senator who could extract a similar deal with Caboolture! Oh, wait—apparently Senator Hanson isn't capable of making the same deal as her WA colleague for the people of Longman. 


The Liberals have also ignored the people of Bribie Island, who desperately need better access to emergency care. At the moment, the people of Bribie Island have to travel to Caboolture's overstretched emergency department. Almost 10 per cent of the 52,000 people who presented at the Caboolture ED last year were from Bribie Island, but the Liberals have done absolutely nothing for them. 


The Liberals also have a very shocking record when it comes to north-west Tasmania. They've cut funding and services relentlessly, leaving the people of Devonport and Burnie and the rest of the region worse off. Over 6,000 Tasmanians are waiting for critical elective surgery under the Liberals' surgery backlog, with one in 10 waiting almost a year. These are patients waiting for vital procedures such as knee and hip replacements, cataract surgeries and hysterectomies. One in four Tasmanians currently wait outside the clinically recommended time. This is the worst in the country. That is why Labor has committed to a $30 billion investment to slash Tasmania's elective surgery backlog. This will enable 3,000 extra elective surgery procedures—equivalent to half the waiting list. 


Then there are the government's cuts to TAZREACH, a vital service that gives Tasmanians access to better services. It provides access to services that otherwise are not available in that community. I'm proud that Labor has restored that funding, $4.5 million, that the Liberals have failed to match. 


When it comes to health, all this government can do is cut. It's cut hospitals, it's cut prevention, it's cut dental care and it continues to slash Medicare every single day. That is what the Liberals do. The choice at the next election, and the choice at the by-elections, particularly in Longman and Braddon—these critical elections—could not be clearer: more savage cuts under the Liberals, or a record investment under Labor and a record investment in Longman and Braddon

Mr HUNT
 (Flinders—Minister for Health) (15:31):  It's interesting to note that there was no mention of mental health, no mention of the PBS and no mention of medical research. I want to talk today about what this government is doing and what the previous government and the current Labor opposition can never do: guarantee the funding of essential services. We can guarantee that funding because we are able to secure a strong economy based on a deep plan. 


Let me begin with a very simple quote. This quote isn't from us; it's from Labor's health portfolio budget statement in May 2011. What did that statement say? That statement from the health portfolio budget said:


… given the current fiscal environment, the listing of some medicines would be deferred until fiscal circumstances permit.


There were seven medicines. Do you know what happened? It's very interesting. A Senate inquiry followed that, which saw people from all the different sides of the political divide and the medical profession condemn and chastise the ALP and force them to realise that what they had done was utterly unacceptable. As somebody said to me, 'They could fund pink batts, but they couldn't fund the PBS.' It was over $2 billion that they put towards pink batts, but the were unable to fund fundamental medicines—for schizophrenia, for IVF, for endometriosis  for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease—because 'fiscal circumstances' did not permit. Those are their words, not ours. There could barely be a more damning indictment of the inability of one side of this parliament to manage government and to manage the economy—and, therefore, their inability to manage health—than the deliberate deferral of medicines because 'fiscal circumstances did not permit', while at the same time they were funding pink batts. 


Under us, fiscal circumstances will always permit, because we not only manage the economy but manage the federal budget. We manage it as custodians for the people. Delivering new medicines is one of the most significant things that any government can do. Guaranteeing that you can manage the economy to deliver those new medicines is one of the fundamental tests of both honesty and competence upon which the Australian people should base their decision at the next election and upon which we ask the people of Longman, Braddon and Mayo to base their decisions in the coming weeks.


Let me go forward. The result of this management of the economy is record funding for health overall, from $99 billion to $102 billion to $104 billion to $109 billion over the forward estimates of the budget. In Medicare, the first pillar of our long-term national health plan, we will go from $25 billion to $26 billion to $27 billion to $29 billion. That's record funding each year and every year, with new items such as 3D mammography scans coming in for over an anticipated 200,000 women a year, with new MRI tests for prostate coming in this weekend for thousands of males, with new renal dialysis provisions coming in under Medicare and with new treatments for ophthalmology coming in under Medicare. All of these things are critical and fundamental.


But we see more than just that. There are new listings of medicines, as I mentioned earlier today, such as Kisqali, a $700 million investment, one of the largest on record by the Commonwealth, for breast cancer, something that I believe has the support of every member in this parliament. That means 3,250 women a year will have access to a medicine that would otherwise have cost $70,000 and been beyond the reach of virtually every woman and family in Australia. Only a very small number would have been be able to access it. However, what we see as well on so many different fronts is what we're doing with support in relation to HIV and the listing of PrEP, what we've done in relation to Crohn's disease and the listing of Stelara, and what we've done in relation to Keytruda and Opdivo and the extension to new forms of cancer treatment. These are fundamental. Along with mental health, these are probably the two things that are raised with me most often by the public. What do they ask about? They ask about mental health treatment, acknowledging the importance of this fundamental issue, and they ask about and are delighted at the access to new medicines and the guarantee that this government gives.


When it comes to hospital funding what we also see is record funding each year, every year. We're going now from $21 billion to $22 billion to $23 billion to $24 billion a year under this government. What we see is a more than doubling of hospital funding from Labor's last year in office to the end of the new hospital agreement and a $30 billion increase, including an additional $7.5 billion in Queensland alone. There was some discussion about the metro north region, where the Caboolture Hospital is based. It is very, very interesting that Labor has walked away from its campaign. What was front and centre is now an embarrassment. When it was revealed that this government in the last full year alone increased funding to the metro north region in which Caboolture Hospital is based by $120 million at the same time as Queensland Labor reduced funding for that region by $20 million there were looks of horror on the faces of the opposition. They were embarrassed, shamed and caught in a classic Labor lie. But this time we're right onto it, right from the outset, as we were in Bennelong. We have learned not to dismiss Labor lies; we have learnt to deal with them head-on.


What we saw in the papers today is that the people of Longman don't believe them on health either. That must have been a devastating blow for Labor. That must be one of the reasons why they have walked away from their great Caboolture Hospital lie. They were caught out. Patsy said it on radio, and Patsy's indictment of the Leader of the Opposition was simply devastating. She spoke for the people of Longman, the people of Queensland, the people of this parliament and the people of Australia when she made it absolutely clear that you cannot trust the Leader of the Opposition on health and you cannot trust the Labor Party. The reason why is very simple: if you can't manage the economy, you can't manage health. 


We're able to manage the economy. We're able to make investment in the third of our pillars—mental health. There is $338 million being added to mental health in this year's budget. There is $70 million and more for suicide prevention in wonderful programs through Lifeline and beyondblue; over $100 million to support our seniors, many of whom suffer from desperate loneliness, isolation and depression; and $125 million through the million minds mental health mission under the Medical Research Future Fund for the single largest medical research program into mental health in Australian history. We've also been able to support preventative and recovery actions for those who have drug addiction, including, in Caboolture, $11 million for the Lives Lived Well program: $3½ million for detox and recovery and rehabilitation facilities and $7½ million for a residential facility for those needing longer form recovery treatment. 


That finally brings me to medical research. What we've done in medal research has been one of the great achievements of this government. By laying down a $20 billion Medical Research Future Fund, we are able to do things such as fund $250 million for clinical trials for rare diseases and rare cancers, to assist with $80 million for clinical fellowships, to assist with translation of new drugs and devices and to assist with a $100 million and more Australian Brain Cancer Mission and a $500 million national genomics mission. At the end of the day, you can only fund health if fiscal circumstances permit. Under this government, fiscal circumstances will always permit and always allow.

Mr GEORGANAS
 (Hindmarsh) (15:42):  There is only one group of people you cannot trust when it comes to health—only one group—and that is this current government. I say so because, in 2013, we heard the promises of the then Prime Minister, the member for Warringah, who said: there will be no cuts to health; there will be no changes to our system; and the hospital care will be the same. And what happened? They were elected in 2013, and not long after in 2014 they cut billions of dollars from our health system—billions of dollars! The only people you cannot trust when it comes to health is this government and their backbenchers and all involved. 


If it weren't for Labor's campaign on Medicare at the last federal election, these people here would have already privatised it. The only reason they haven't done it is that we campaigned against it—and you know it. 



Government members interjecting—




Mr GEORGANAS:
  You want to privatise it. You might not be saying that to the public, but, deep down in your hearts, you want to privatise Medicare. There is no doubt about it. The Australian public has one choice at these upcoming by-elections, especially in Braddon and Longman. The difference between Labor and the government couldn't be clearer: there would be more savage cuts under this government and record healthcare investment under a Labor government. 


After four years of Abbott-Turnbull cuts and neglect, Australia's public hospitals are in crisis. Let's just look at my own state, South Australia. The state health minister recently signed an agreement with this federal government, which they were touting as additional money for health, expecting the public to applaud them. But this was after the Turnbull-Abbott government cut a billion dollars out of that state's health system in 2014. What a joke! This government wants applause for signing some agreement with the state government in South Australia, which is no different from stealing $50 out of their pocket and putting $20 in the other pocket and saying, 'Please, give me praise for that $20 I've just given back to you.' That's exactly what they've done. What a joke! This government and the Marshall government in South Australia are in cahoots, talking up funding increases, after this government slashed billions out of our hospital system. It's an absolute shame. This is smoke and mirrors, like most of their other policies. The Labor health spokesman in South Australia is all over this. He's exposed them for this. If you look at their last parliamentary session, you will see it. He recognised straightaway that the state Marshall government was caving in to his Liberal bosses here in Canberra in the federal government. By contrast, Labor has a proud record on public hospitals and public hospital funding. We were the architects of Medicare. They were the ones that brought it down and we brought it back in. And they'll do the same again.


The Rudd-Gillard government signed a historic national health reform agreement with the states and territories in 2011. This committed the Commonwealth to fund an equal share of efficient growth in hospitals and it was designed to end the blame game. It was designed to give the public hospitals long-term budget certainty, and it worked. Ahead of the 2013 election, again, the Liberals promised no cuts to hospitals, but we all remember the horror 2014 budget. How can you forget it? The government broke this promise. They tore up this historic agreement and cut billions from hospitals. We shouldn't be surprised because this what is they do. This government can't help themselves. They're pathologically compelled to cut from the health portfolio, whether it's public hospitals, dismantling Medicare or other health services. All they see is a pot of money they can raid, get into and then throw at the top end of town, as we've seen in the billions of dollars of tax cuts.


You can't trust a word they say on health care. They don't take it seriously. So the choice at these by-elections and at the next federal election is very clear. The choice couldn't be clearer—more savage cuts under this government, under the Liberals' record of healthcare investment, or big investment under Labor ensuring that the services that people require in my electorate and in all electorates around the country will be funded properly so people get the adequate health care that they require and the services they require. They know that, if they need to go to a hospital, if they need emergency services or if they need to see a GP, they'll be able to do so. Under this government, we will see more cuts, we will see the dismantling of Medicare, we will see a disgrace— (Time expired)

Mr PITT
 (Hinkler—Assistant Minister to the Deputy Prime Minister) (15:47):  I rise to make a contribution on today's MPI. I've got to say that I think about this often. I sit back and I wonder how it is that the Labor Party approaches their policy and how they reach a decision, and some of things that they say. I'm sure it's something you consider too, Deputy Speaker, but I've come to the conclusion that they announce a policy, they determine what that is, they go out and say what it is that the government has cut from their policy, even though they're not in government and they can't deliver it. In fact, I'm fairly confident they go and have a bit of a giggle out the back, and say, 'We've gone out and done it again.' But I have to agree with the contribution from the shadow minister, and I did note one line in the shadow minister's contribution, and that is that we have increased spending in the budget for health. She said, 'It's gone up, that's right.' And that is—



Opposition members interjecting—




Mr PITT:
  I note the interjection. We can go back and check the contribution on Hansard. The contribution was this: 'The health budget has increased. It has gone up.' And that's right. This is a question about trust. In 2012-13, the federal contribution for health was over $13 billion. In 2021, it is forecast to be over $22 billion.



Mr Champion interjecting—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Hogan
):  The member for Wakefield will stop interjecting.




Mr PITT:
  I'm fairly confident, after four years of engineering and after high school and primary school, which I'm sure you attended, that $22.6 billion is more than $13.3 billion. That sounds like an increase.



Mr Champion interjecting—




Mr PITT:
  How substantial would that be? I know the opposition struggles with numbers, and I note the interjections from the member for Wakefield. I have said to the member for Wakefield that I have some sympathy for his situation. We certainly find ourselves on a unity ticket in some things. But this is an increase. You may well recall from your schooling that there were these coloured blocks and they would demonstrate when one thing is bigger than another. In fact, they'd demonstrate if it was twice as big or three times as big. It may well be a worthwhile investment for those opposite, because the reality is quite straightforward. In my home state of Queensland, in 2012-13, it was $2.66 billion; in 2024-25, that will be $6.5 billion. That is an increase. You cannot go out on radio and say to the people of Australia that there is a cut when there is an increase. It is an absolute outrage. I know they're bad at maths. I'm not sure if it's incompetence. I'm not sure if it's just plain deceit. I'm not sure how they sit there with a straight face and say to the Australian people that it's a reduction when in fact it's an increase. But we've got to say they've got form—and I note the previous contribution—from when they raised 'Mediscare'. 'Mediscare' was a completely deceitful campaign. It was false. It was untrue. It did not happen. I say to those opposite: you really should consider some of the people who listen to what you say. You went out and you scared people in my electorate, those seniors who are concerned about their health. You ran a false campaign. It was untrue.


I think they've got form. Let's look at the Leader of the Opposition. He goes to Melbourne and, when he talks about mining, he says: 'I'm against mining. I'm with the Greens position.' When he flies to Moranbah, he says: 'I love miners. Miners are my kind of people. We'll back you guys up.' But, as the leader of the AWU, what did he do? He gave $100,000 to GetUp! to campaign against the resources industry. I think you should be ashamed of yourselves. They were your people. They were and they are no longer. You only have to listen to Patsy from Caboolture. Patsy had a fantastic line. She was absolutely right. She spoke to the Leader of the Opposition on radio and what did she say? 'I am frustrated because you are not telling the truth.' So the people of Caboolture have got you lined up. They know exactly what is going on. They do not believe you.


It's a long line of people who do not believe them. There is a long line of people who want to get rid of the Leader of the Opposition. I noted the contribution from the member for Grayndler. He's certainly got form. He wants to line up. The member for Bass—I noted his interview yesterday, and, once again, I have some sympathy for him; we all find ourselves in those positions at times when working with journalists. But I didn't hear any support for the Leader of the Opposition—none, not a single bit. And today the member for Canberra had a run, on radio with Tim Shaw, and wasn't getting on board, wasn't supporting the Leader of the Opposition and certainly wasn't supporting the proposition that they wind back tax cuts for hardworking people in this country.


We come back to the ultimate issue, and that is that health funding in this country is increasing and it is increasing substantially. It is increasing substantially in my electorate. In the Wide Bay region in 2014-15 it was $114 million. In 2016-17 it was $152 million. That is an increase, and you should all get out your maths books, work out what it is, stop telling lies and tell the people the truth.

"O'Toole, Cathy, MP",ALP,2018-06-28,"



Ms O'TOOLE
 (Herbert) (15:52):  Firstly, let me say this. The Minister for Health made a comment that Labor has done nothing and made no mention of mental health. Let me tell him quite clearly: I came into this job from 15 years of mental health experience, and the best mental health programs we ever got came from a Labor government. We had the first federal minister for mental health, in Mark Butler, and the best programs we have ever seen in this country. How dare he say that Labor doesn't talk about mental health? He should withdraw his comment, and quickly.


History clearly demonstrates that Labor is the party of health reform and investment, and it's not at all surprising that the people in Longman and Braddon are concerned about their health care. Labor believes that, when people are sick, they should receive the care that they need in a timely manner, regardless of their credit card. In contrast, the LNP is the party of cuts to healthcare services, hospitals and Medicare, which it would love to privatise. The Turnbull government wants you to pay more when you visit your doctor and pay more for your private health insurance.


The Herbert community has had enough of the LNP's cuts. This government has inflicted massive cuts on the hospitals in Herbert, which hurts, because our public hospital is the only tertiary hospital in Queensland outside of the south-east corner. The Townsville Hospital and Health Service will receive a $9 million cut under the Turnbull government. What does that mean? It means four fewer beds a year for three years, 12 fewer doctors a year for three years, 25 fewer nurses a year for three years, 21,825 fewer outpatient appointments, 30,468 fewer emergency department visits, 2,491 fewer cataract extractions, 1,488 fewer births and 345 fewer knee replacements.


Where will the women go when they are in labour if the hospital does not have a bed for them in the labour ward as a result of the Turnbull government cuts? Where will pensioners go when they need knee replacement surgery, when the hospital has no funding for their surgery because of the Turnbull government cuts? Where will the veterans go when they want to visit the emergency department? Because of the Turnbull government cuts, the emergency department is now overcrowded. The Turnbull government has no understanding of what its cuts mean on the ground, especially in rural and regional centres. Allow me to read an email from a Townsville constituent that clearly explains how these cuts hurt. Karen from Townsville wrote on 2 June this year:


Hi Cathy I need your help.


In fact the whole state & country needs your help.


My carer just had his 3rd heart attack on Wednesday.


He was stabilised & scheduled for a procedure on Friday.


All prepped & ready but the queue was so long he was bumped to Monday.


Instead of being home today, it'll now be Tuesday or Wednesday.


Cathy can something be done to reduce the queue, increase staffing (no one - except nurses - works on weekends)


Yes, Karen, something can be done; we can vote out this out-of-touch Turnbull government at the next federal election. I am here every day fighting hard against this top-end-of-town government. I will fight for people like Karen and her carer because their hospital needs are really important and these cuts are not fair. All of this is in a community where the unemployment rate has almost doubled under the consecutive LNP governments. How can the Turnbull government think that cutting 12 doctor positions or 24 nurses is a good idea? My community is already hurting, yet the Turnbull government is hell-bent on creating more hurt by cutting doctors and nurses. It's disgraceful.


Let's not forget the axe that is being taken to Medicare. More than $3 billion has been cut from Medicare by LNP governments. This has increased out-of-pocket costs to see a GP. The average out-of-pocket cost for seeing a GP is now more than $38. That's a $4 increase since Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull's pre-election promise that no-one would pay more to see a GP. Out-of-pocket fees to see a specialist have soared even higher, up to almost $88, an increase of more than $12 since the election. The Bureau of Statistics' figures show that those cost increases are forcing many Australians to skip basic health care. Those cost increases have resulted in one million Australians saying they cannot go to see a GP—they're avoiding it; they can't afford it—and 1.7 million people are saying, 'I can't afford to see a specialist.' Labor will fund our hospitals and fund Medicare because we won't be giving $80 billion tax cuts to big business and the banks. Labor created Medicare and we will protect it.

Mr TIM WILSON
 (Goldstein) (15:57):  Sometimes there are emotions or debates in this place that, frankly, reduce the public's appetite and support for our democracy because what they hear is deception. They hear lies. They hear information or ideas that underwrite or corrode the very integrity of the institution that I, at least, ran to serve. The objective of this parliament should and must be to serve the best interests of the people of Australia with honesty and integrity. I would hope that most members would come into this place believing that, when they left, our democracy would be healthier, more successful and carry greater trust.


And then we get motions like the MPI today, which is built on a lie, a deception, a falsehood about what is happening in health care in this country and what this government is seeking to do. Make no mistake that the objective of this government is to make sure that every Australian, whether they walk into their primary healthcare clinic to see their GP, into a hospital run by a state government or into a private hospital, gets the opportunity to get the support and the care they need to live their best lives. Yes, sometimes there's a debate around money—and there is around health care—but our focus is and has been consistently focused on making sure we get dollars in and outcomes out. What we have in this motion today is a deception that there is some decline in funding. In fact, it is the complete opposite of what this government has sought to achieve. As you'll have heard consistently throughout this government, our focus is on what we can do to grow the economy.


But we know that growing the economy is not an end of itself. Growing an economy is good. Yes, there's a larger pie. Yes, it means everybody's standard of living can rise. But it is about delivering a social, environmental, economic and human dividend, and a critical part of delivering a human dividend is, of course, providing health care for the Australian people. We do this against a backdrop of incredible challenges.



Mr Champion interjecting—




Mr TIM WILSON:
  Of course we know that one of the biggest areas of increasing expenditure that faces us regardless of who is in government, the member for Wakefield, is around the ageing population—people at a time when they need the most healthcare support because the vast majority of healthcare service provision is towards the end of life. It's not just health care directly in getting support and assistance from doctors; it's the increasing costs associated with aged care and, of course, an increasing dependence on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, particularly in dealing with some chronic conditions.


At every point this government is actually delivering precisely what the Australian people need, and it's no clearer than from the record amount of investment that is going into the public hospital system. From 2013-14 to 2020-21 we have increased the investment by $13.3 billion, but apparently this is a cut. Under the new hospitals agreement, the government has committed an additional $30.2 billion in public hospital funding from 2020-21 to 2024-25, taking overall funding during this period to $130.2 billion. And we know this. In the wonderful Goldstein electorate we have one of Melbourne's best local community hospitals, as part of the Alfred Health group, at Sandy hospital. The Alfred Health group has had an increase from $219,913,309 in 2013-14 to $318 million in the last financial year—growth of $98 million. That's a fair amount. That's a big increase.


What we're seeing more and more because of the focus on the economy to deliver for the human dividend is the amount of money we're able to contribute in increasing access to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme so that people can manage their health condition. Yes, there have been approximately $9 billion in increased listings in this government, but increasingly we are seeing innovative new drugs like Kisqali and the whooping cough vaccine for pregnant mothers, which are being added as of 1 July, and we should be immensely proud of that.

"Freelander, Mike, MP",ALP,2018-06-28,"



Dr FREELANDER
 (Macarthur) (16:02):  I would really like to say one thing before I commence on this matter of public importance, and that is that I am utterly ashamed at the way the minister has attempted to politicise the PBS. The PBS, since its inception in the 1940s, has had bipartisan support, and the attempt to politicise it is shocking. It is completely wrong. The minister and those opposite, if they attempt to politicise it, which is what they're doing, do not understand the basis of how the PBS and the PBAC work, and it is just shameful what this minister has attempted to do.


I will say something else that has relation to this matter of public importance, and that's not about the health care provided to Australians. It's about the health care provided to our near neighbours. It is shocking the way this government has cut our foreign aid budget. Evidence of this can be seen in the really horrible outbreak of polio in Papua New Guinea. I would urge this government, through the Minister for Foreign Affairs, to urgently increase our aid budget looking at health care in our northern neighbours.


The government clearly has no understanding of public health policy, and it is in their DNA to slash this crucial portfolio. Time and again they've demonstrated their ignorance about health policy, and it's quite clear to me from their other policies around housing, education and social supports that they have a very poor understanding of the social determinants of health. Their response to drug and alcohol problems seems to me one of blame and punishment and really very little fundamental understanding of health as it evolves around addiction.


Regardless of whatever spin those opposite attempt to pull off in this chamber today and in the outside world, you cannot trust a single word they say on health care. They've taken an axe to Medicare and failed to rein in soaring private healthcare insurance costs. The Prime Minister and this government have a very warped agenda for and perception of public health and indeed all social services. When the Liberal National government look at our public hospitals, Medicare and other health services, all they see is a stack of cash to raid and give to their mates. I cannot put this more succinctly: this is a twisted government, content to rip essential funding from our healthcare system only to throw it at big business and their mates. It seems completely paradoxical to me that this government thinks it's fine to give millions of dollars in tax cuts to some of our biggest companies such as Healthscope, Ramsay Health Care, Primary Health Care, Sonic Healthcare, Medibank Private, NIB and many more, yet not fund our public hospitals adequately to provide comprehensive public healthcare measures for chronic diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, obesity, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, et cetera. The profits go to these major companies, and they pay bigger dividends to their shareholders, but those requiring health support are left to wait.


We get longer waiting lists, ballooning gap costs to see specialists for interventional care, and lack of funding for essential best practice services, yet businesses seem to be given a blank cheque. Our public hospitals are clearly in a state of crisis. I've worked in hospitals for decades. I see longer waiting lists in emergency and people unable to access the best care, and I worry about what's going to happen to my children and grandchildren. Only about 60 per cent of urgent individual patients presenting to emergency departments in my state are seen within appropriate time limits. I reiterate: health care in Australia is in a state of crisis. The minister is attempting to politicise many of the issues, particularly the PBS, and there is a lack of understanding of proper public health policy about chronic illness. Australians are furious with the current government over their handling of the healthcare system. The cuts extend all over Australia, particularly in areas of rapid growth, like Caboolture Hospital, which is getting almost $3 million cut by the coalition.

Ms FLINT
 (Boothby) (16:07):  I'm pleased to speak on this matter today. I want to congratulate the Minister for Health and the Minister for Aged Care on the wonderful work they are doing in the health and ageing sectors. The Minister for Health demonstrates such care and compassion in speaking to patients suffering from conditions like endometriosis or chronic pain. It makes me very proud to be a member of the Turnbull government. The Minister for Aged Care has helped me convene and conduct several fora for my senior Australians. He is a truly inspiring senior Australian himself and is doing wonderful work to look after all our senior Australians.


We, the Turnbull government, are achieving record funding for our healthcare system in Australia. We have record GP bulk-billing rates of 85.8 per cent, which in my electorate alone means residents can visit their doctor without any out-of-pocket cost, thanks to the introduction of an additional 22,000 GP services. In the 2018-2019 budget we announced a $2.4 billion investment for new medicines on the PBS, including $1 billion set aside for the provision of future medicines. In fact, since coming to government we have listed one new medicine per day on average—and these are often life-saving medications—with an overall investment of about $9 billion. These are things like treatments for stage IV clear cell variant renal cell carcinoma, which would otherwise cost one patient $129,000 per year—completely out of reach for most Australians. Through Kisqali, we're investing $703 million to support women with breast cancer. Otherwise, these women would have to pay $71,000 each to access this medication. The medication Spinraza, for spinal muscular atrophy, would cost patients $367,000 each per year. These are life-changing, life-saving medications that this government is funding.


Unfortunately, those opposite have a terrible track record, whether it's the federal Labor Party or the state Labor Party in my home state of South Australia. I need to once again remind the House of the dreadful things that the now, thankfully, former Weatherill state Labor government did in South Australia. They cut $7.4 million of funding for public hospitals between 2015 and 2016 and a further $20 million of funding between 2014 and 2016. The state Labor government shut down the iconic Repat hospital. That was a devastating decision for veterans in our community, many of whom had been treated there. It was a devastating decision for my community, and I'm so pleased to see that the Marshall Liberal government in South Australia is already reopening services on the Repat site so that people in my community can once again use the hydrotherapy pool, for example, which is absolutely critical for rehabilitation services.


I want to reflect on one of the incredible things that the Minister for Health has worked with me on and that I'm very passionate about, and that's the issue of endometriosis. Once again, because we are the party of responsible government, because we are balancing the budget, we've been able to begin to invest in finding cures and better treatments for this terrible disease that affects women.



Opposition members interjecting—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Hogan
):  Members on my left will cease interjecting.




Ms FLINT:
  Already we have committed $1 million in the May budget towards awareness and education within the medical profession because we know there are a lot of medical practitioners who are still not aware of what endometriosis is, the sorts of support and treatment that women need to access and how critical early intervention and treatment is. We announced a further $2.5 million from the Medical Research Future Fund, which will be used to accelerate research and make areas of endo research a priority once the National Action Plan for Endometriosis is launched, which will occur very soon. I'm very proud of our record in the health space.

"Kearney, Ged, MP",ALP,2018-06-28,"



Ms KEARNEY 
(Batman) (16:12):  I rise today to speak about the government's abject failure to properly fund public health care for all Australians and its failure to control the spiralling costs of the private health insurance industry. Just this morning I read an article about the rising number of women who opt to use public rather than private hospitals to give birth because of the high out-of-pocket costs involved in the private system. This is just one more example of the soaring costs of private health insurance and the growing number of Australians who are choosing to ditch their cover in response to relentless price rises, unexpected out-of-pocket costs and growing exclusions.


Australians are paying a lot more for their health insurance policies and getting a lot less. Ten years ago only 8.6 per cent of health insurance policies contained exclusions; now it's 40 per cent. These exclusions, often hidden in the fine print, mean that people are paying for insurance without being covered. It's turning health insurance into a con. I've had personal experience. We all have. My elderly mother-in-law has had lengthy periods in private hospitals with chest infections. She's paid her private health insurance premiums for decades, and we are always pleasantly surprised on discharge to be told we don't have to pay anything there and then. But, over the following weeks, the bills roll in—pharmacy costs, pathology costs and other tests not covered—to the point where we start to wonder when they will stop.


I know this is a familiar story. We know that Australians pay some of the highest out-of-pocket costs in the OECD to the for-profit health insurance industry, which made around $2 billion in profits last year. Some of the biggest health insurance providers make a return of over 20 per cent. And, as we know and have heard in this House before, this is an industry that's holding about $6 billion over and above the legal capital requirement and gets $6 billion in taxpayer-funded subsidies each year. Still, despite all this, the industry continues to increase its costs, year after year. For decades, in fact, Australians who have opted to buy private health insurance have been getting hit with price rises double or even triple inflation from an industry that enjoys generous government subsidies, and this is just plain wrong.


Labor, on the other hand, has a strong policy to cap premium price increases at two per cent for two years, effectively tying them to general inflation, a policy that will put $340 back into the pockets of Australian families. But private health insurance is a choice—a choice that more and more people can't afford. The article I read this morning about mums deserting private health insurance quoted Libby Nuttall, a 32-year-old mother of three, who said she'd heard stories about the private system such as that, when a doctor at 5 pm on Friday wants to go home and the woman's in labour, they will do a caesarean rather than let the pregnancy take its natural course. Of course, not all doctors and not all hospitals in the private system are like that. But it seems to me that the trust in the private system is waning. It is waning due to excessive out-of-pocket costs and poorer quality of care, and more and more people are turning to their trusted public health system.


It tells us that our public health system is vital for so many Australians. We cannot afford to starve our public health system of funding. The Liberals have cut billions of dollars from our public hospital system, putting stress and strain on our hospitals and causing anguish for patients and their communities and for the people who work tirelessly in our public health system to keep it going. We are lucky indeed to have such a wonderful health system. I myself worked there as a nurse for years and totally appreciate the importance of the services. I congratulate our doctors, nurses, allied health workers and all the auxiliary staff who keep the system running with fewer and fewer resources, but they can't do it forever. They can't keep doing more with less.


We need to reinvest in our public hospitals, and I'm proud to say that Labor will reverse the government cuts, giving vital resources to our hospitals, because we deserve a public health system that stays the envy of the world. As for our primary healthcare system and our beloved Medicare, out-of-pocket costs are beginning to become a barrier to people seeing their GP. What does that mean? It means that more and more people stay sicker and present to our emergency departments, putting more and more pressure on our public hospitals and, in fact, increasing costs, because, as we all know, our tertiary healthcare system is far more expensive than doing good, decent primary health care.


The pressure on our public hospitals means that fewer and fewer people can get there. Fewer and fewer people will be receiving the care they need. Trashing the promise of universal health care exacerbates this. So the choice at the next election and in next month's by-elections could not be clearer: more savage cuts under the Liberals or record healthcare investment under Labor.

Mr LAMING
 (Bowman) (16:17):  Obviously, we reach silly season at the end of a sitting week, and then out rolls the health MPI from the opposition. It's remotely disappointing to have to engage every third or fourth week, when they run out of agenda, in an industrial revolution debate about Medicare, because Australians sitting up watching today and Australians sitting in the galleries understand that we have an excellent GP-centred system. We've got public hospitals doing an incredible job under trying financial circumstances that they've had under any government, not just a blue or a red one. We have an independent and successful private health system. We have a functioning PBS and MBS that are the envy of the world.


We can go back and engage in a 1970s debate about who founded Medicare and who is the defender of Medicare, but you can't debate the figures that were presented by my colleague just a few minutes ago—that is, big jumps in the number of bulk-billed services; 6.2 million more services in remote and regional Australia, an absolute priority for this government. These kinds of increases—1.19 million more bulk-billed specialist services—are the true indicators that access to medical professionals, be they general or specialist, is about the same as it has always been.


We have new regional medical schools producing graduates who are staying in the bush—train in the bush; stay in the bush. That's heading in the right direction. No-one's pretending today that all the problems are fixed the minute you change the government or that we've massively changed the direction of health policy, but I tell you what: when there's a hard problem, increasingly, when you have a Labor government in place, they really don't do much about it. That is because, as I pointed out before, when a government is utterly fixated on how many dollars are pumped into the system, it actually loses sight of value and quality. What we're asking is that both sides of this chamber, as we debate the national direction for health, really focus on the quality of spend. But, no, we can't do that, because we have the industrial revolution mob over there, the Medicare Luddites, who think it's just about the total amount of dollars pumped into a system. Increasingly, as we look around the world at the quality of hospital and health performance, we see it's not all about the dollars. It's actually about how it's directed into areas of people's lives and into health investments that truly make a difference. We need both sides of the chamber to be engaging in that debate, and we simply don't have it. So, no matter how many times you sit in the gallery or turn on the television, you will simply hear this general traducing of each other at the end of a sitting week, but actually no engagement on what really matters, which is how we purchase with our dollars the best possible health outcome we can. No, it is not just about how many dollars we spend and how many services are delivered. It is about being responsible and talking to general practice about the rate of servicing. You can only look after patients at a particular rate before quality declines—when time becomes a proxy of quality.


We've talked about GPs. Give them the incentive to stratify their patient population and say, 'These 200 people genuinely need my extra care and I need to be reimbursed for that extra amount of time.' Don't have them practising what we call 747 medicine—the person who had seen a single patient 747 times in a year. That can't be quality practice—it's never been engaged with over on the other side. What happens when the Labor Party comes into government? They scurry around in an almost rodentesque manner, seeking to do deals with individual sectors and governments, both in health and education. You're left with this farrago of health funding confusion, where there are tiny bits of money chucked in here and a bit more there and a bit of clever play with the numbers. But we know that the fundamental challenge of Australia's double-tiered health system—moderately unique in the developed world—is that there is a simple moral hazard: the more we put in, the more the states pull out. It is very simple. We write up four-year agreements and the states, to save money, simple turn the switch up or down.


It was good to have the member for the Townsville area talking about the Townsville Hospital, because the Commonwealth contributions for Townsville just keep going up, up and up. But it is the state contribution that goes up, down, up and down again as they try to save a little money, because they've got an $80 billion debt in Queensland. State funding to Townsville has gone from $329 million to $346 million to $374 million and then down again to $346 million last week. So the health funding doesn't go up. The Commonwealth contribution to the Townsville region went from $166 million to $181 million to $200 million to $226 million. Clearly, the guilty party isn't down here in this chamber. But you've got the Labor Party completely unable to talk to their mates in Queensland and get a dollar-for-dollar contribution. If the state Labor money to Townsville was actually replaced and you still had the Commonwealth contribution, you'd have more doctors, more nurses and more services, and you'd have less stress on your ICU and a better functioning health system. But we don't sit here and nickel and dime that side of the chamber about whether or not there's an extra dollar, because we keep asking about quality. In the developed world and in the international contest on health quality, we know that the truly effective systems take hard decisions and don't focus purely on the money.

Ms HUSAR
 (Lindsay) (16:23):  I speak in continuation on the Airports Amendment Bill 2016. The lack of consultation is a key fact in anything this Liberal government does. My community knows that too well after the recent decision by the New South Wales state Liberal government to bulldoze their homes and then cause months and months of anxiety to these communities—500 people, in fact, having bulldozers come right through their businesses and homes—because the state government decided not to have any consultation with them and announced that there would be a new corridor, which was a complete departure from the 1,951 reservations that were made.


When you talk about community consultation, you actually have to deliver on it. We see time and time again when it comes to Western Sydney Airport that there is absolutely no difference. We've had six days notice to attend a community meeting, with only two days notice to make an RSVP. That would hardly be considered a reasonable or amenable time frame to anybody. Some of the more outspoken members of this House who would like to be part of the FOWSA board, or the FOWSA communications directory, or whatever they call it—me; Susan Templeman, the member for Macquarie, which is up in my back yard; and the member for Chifley, Ed Husic, whose electorate is on the other side of mine and who is known to have been quite strongly opposed to this airport for a long time—were denied access. If you're denying access, you're denying consultation for those members and those members' communities—about 300,000 people.


What we're going to see with this airport is a $10 billion investment. That's $10 billion of taxpayers' money that's going into Western Sydney. Ordinarily, we might be excited about that, but all it's going to do is add miles and miles of congestion. There is no plan for local jobs. There is no plan for people movement. Sorry, I must say this. Imagine how it was for me sitting there, reading the budget papers, and reading about the 'great' investment this government was going to make in the Western Sydney airport infrastructure and the rail line which will take people from the airport and move them onto a more congested line or an already congested line that is only going to get more congested with these extra passengers. Imagine my surprise when I read that there is only $50 million for another study. This government is not serious on delivering anything of any concrete value to my community, with $10 billion going into this.


Maybe government members should come to Western Sydney occasionally. It might be hard for them to find where it is! The minister didn't even know which electorate this airport was going to be in. After he argued with me for five minutes, he then decided that I was right and that it was going to be in the electorate of the honourable member for Werriwa, the hardworking Anne Stanley, and not in the electorate of Angus Taylor, who is the member for Hume. If the minister doesn't even know where the airport is going to be, he's hardly the right person to be delivering consultation to the communities it is going to affect. We have $10 billion going into one single project to deliver goodness knows how many jobs. We heard 90,000. Then we heard 26,000. Then it went down to 9,000. Then it went back up to 26,000 again. Nobody has been able to come out and say, 'This is how many jobs will be created from the establishment of this airport.' People in my electorate have been told, 'This is going to be the greatest saviour you've ever seen.'


This is $10 billion of taxpayer money going to a single project. If you wanted to know what that money might be better spent on in my electorate of Lindsay, you might look at some of my schools, which have some of the highest numbers of demountable classrooms. We have some of the oldest infrastructure. Every school in my electorate is bursting at the seams with enrolment. And we have brand-new suburbs in Jordan Springs being opened and people moving in without any new infrastructure in the schooling system whatsoever. So we've got a huge number of projects that you could essentially pick up and better spend that money on, and that's what the people in Lindsay want. They don't come up to me in the street and say: 'Can you hurry up on that airport, Emma? I'd like to get out of here a bit quicker or I'd like to get my freight delivered a bit quicker.' That's essentially what this airport is going to be for. They don't come up to me and ask about that. They ask about infrastructure for the train line. They ask about infrastructure for the roadways. They ask why they're paying tolls on the motorways again. They want their schools fixed and they certainly want a better hospital system.


Every time this government talks about the Western Sydney Airport being the saviour for Western Sydney, without a curtsy, by the way, we are being told a furphy—every single time. We've never once seen a member of this government or a Liberal turn up with a shovel and a chequebook and ask, 'What does this community actually need?' That's what consultation would entail. It would entail asking, 'What does this community actually need, and what does it want?' When they arrive with their shovels and their chequebooks they could ask us, instead of ramming an airport down our throats or ramming an incinerator down our throats—which the member for McMahon well knows about—or rounding home some toxic waste that they wanted to bring in from Hunter's Hill and give us another toll perhaps. When they come with their chequebooks and their shovels and they're ready to give us what we want, there might be some more trust in our community for these Liberals on the other side and, quite frankly, also those on Macquarie Street. That is absolutely not what's been happening and not what will happen under this government moving forward.


The government see Western Sydney as a place to take for granted and to deliver anything other than what we actually need. My community deserve to be treated as equals with those who enjoy the amenity over on the other side of Sydney. They deserve the opportunity to have a curfew put on their airport so that aircraft are not flying over their houses 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Minister Fletcher, who is miles and miles away from that sort of airport, has been on the public record whinging about aircraft noise in his own electorate. He is on the record whinging about that. Where the airport is going to be built will be far closer to many of the homes of the people I represent, but he has cut me out of consultation at every single opportunity and refuses to come out and front the people of Western Sydney or to allow me to be a voice for them in any kind of forum. I shouldn't be shocked, but I am. I live in a world of optimism, but I am constantly shocked by how this is the norm for this government and how a lack of consultation is going to lead to really poor outcomes and really poor decisions.


We are already home to two million Australians and the third-largest economy. We're going to be home to three million Australians by 2050; there will be more people living west of Parramatta than will be east of Parramatta. There is no plan. There is no jobs target. There is absolutely nothing in this for the people of Western Sydney. I ask for leave to continue my remarks at the next sitting.

"Bowen, Chris, MP",ALP,2018-06-28,"



Mr BOWEN
 (McMahon) (16:30):  The week before last, I visited Iraq for a two-day trip, and I welcome the opportunity to report to the house. I had wanted to go to Iraq for a long time as a representative of so many Iraqi Australians in this place, having worked very closely with the Iraqi Australian community in my electorate, particularly members of the Assyrian and Chaldean communities as well as the Mandaean community, the Assyrians and Chaldeans being the Christian indigenous people of Iraq.


I first visited Baghdad. When I visited Baghdad I was struck by the scale of the task of rebuilding Baghdad before the people of Baghdad and the international community all these years after the liberation of Iraq from the Saddam Hussein regime. Baghdad is still, it's fair to say, in a very bad way and needs very considerable support to rebuild. I met with the vice minister for foreign affairs, Mr Nizar Al-Khairalla, in Baghdad and discussed with him the importance of ongoing international support for Iraq and, of course, received an update from him and other interlocutors on the recent Iraqi election and the implications thereof for Iraq.


I had dinner with His Beatitude Louis Raphael I Sako, the Patriarch of the Chaldean Catholic Church, and I have noted previously in the House that this week he is being made a cardinal of the Catholic Church in his capacity as Patriarch of the Chaldean Catholic Church.


I did then visit, in Iraq's north, Erbil, a home of many Australians of Iraqi heritage. There I met with His Holiness Mar Gewargis III, the Catholicos-Patriarch of the Assyrian Church of the East. I had a very lengthy conversation about him about the Christians of the Nineveh Plains and the potential for the rebuilding of the north.


I visited the Hashem displaced persons camp, which is run by the UNHCR and several charities. I've visited many refugee camps over the years as a former minister for immigration. I know what to expect at these places and, even though I know what to expect, they nevertheless remain shocking. I met with a particular family in that camp who had been forced out of Mosul, Mosul of course being effectively destroyed by the scourge of ISIS. I met with the father, the mother and the two children. I had a very good conversation with them. I asked them a simple question: 'Can you return to Mosul?' The father said to me through the translator, 'There is nothing left.' Their house has been destroyed. Their entire city has been destroyed. Schools have been destroyed. There is nothing left—no future in Mosul.


There are hundreds of thousands of people who are in a very similar situation to that family and, of course, while we celebrate the fact that ISIS is on the retreat, that ISIS is on the verge of defeat—certainly in Iraq—the scale of destruction that they have caused will last for a long time. It is not just the physical destruction, the destruction of important historical artefacts et cetera, but also the human destruction that they have wrought: the people they killed, the women they have raped, the families still suffering today, the little boys I met whose school was destroyed and no longer exists, their home destroyed. They're living in an old steel container from a container ship. They've made it very nice; they've got cushions, curtains and electrical wires up connecting the microwave, but that is their home, and they have little prospect, little plan for them to have a more permanent arrangement. As I said, I've seen these things before. I've visited many refugee camps around the world, but, when you're there and interacting with those people, it's nevertheless shocking indeed.


But I must say that, at the same time, I saw hope and cause for optimism. In Erbil in particular the security environment was better than Baghdad. It was possible to walk around Erbil without the sort of protection that a visiting Western politician needs. I understand I'm the first member of parliament to visit the north of Iraq for very many years. That is understandable; it has not been safe to do so. In Erbil, I saw a thriving city. It had an economy that was very troubled. Construction which had been previously sought was not happening. Nevertheless, there was cause for hope. Iraq has artefacts and buildings which are older than the pyramids. It has the capacity for a tourism market, for people to go and visit the great religious and historical sites, but, until it is secure, the Iraqi economy won't improve.


I want to thank the department of foreign affairs, the minister, the secretary, Ambassador Joanne Loundes and the deputy ambassador, Dr Chris Watkins, for facilitating the visit and for assisting me. It would have been simply impossible without their assistance. Despite the fact that I have no Iraqi heritage, it was nevertheless an emotional visit for me, having represented so many Iraqi Australians in this House for so long. I thank all those who made me feel so welcome on my visit to Baghdad and Erbil.

Mr SNOWDON
 (Lingiari) (10:00):  On 12 June 1988 during Australia's bicentennial year, Prime Minister Bob Hawke was presented with The Barunga Statement at the annual Barunga cultural and sporting festival at Barunga, about 80 kilometres south-east of Katherine. This year, over the weekend starting Friday, the 8th, there was a commemorative event at Barunga to mark the 30th anniversary of the presentation of The Barunga Statement. Present there, including me, were our leader Bill Shorten, Linda Burney, Patrick Dodson, Malarndirri McCarthy, Madeleine King and Sharon Claydon. I want to thank them for making the journey to Barunga to celebrate this historic event.


Importantly, I want to read what that statement said:


We, the Indigenous owners and occupiers of Australia, call on the Australian Government and people to recognise our rights—


This was 30 years ago. It continues:


to self-determination and self-management, including the freedom to pursue our own economic, social, religious and cultural development;


to permanent control and enjoyment of our ancestral lands;


to compensation for the loss of use of our lands, there having been no extinction of original title;


to protection of and control of access to our sacred sites, sacred objects, artefacts, designs, knowledge and works of art;


to the return of the remains of our ancestors for burial in accordance with our traditions;


to respect for and promotion of our Aboriginal identity, including the cultural, linguistic, religious and historical aspects, and including the right to be educated in our own languages and in our own culture and history;


in accordance with the universal declaration of human rights, the international covenant on economic, social and cultural rights, the international covenant on civil and political rights, and the international convention on the elimination of all forms of racial discrimination, rights to life, liberty, security of person, food, clothing, housing, medical care, education and employment opportunities, necessary social services and other basic rights.


We call on the Commonwealth to pass laws providing:


A national elected Aboriginal and Islander organisation to oversee Aboriginal and Islander affairs;


A national system of land rights;


A police and justice system which recognises our customary laws and frees us from discrimination and any activity which may threaten our identity or security, interfere with our freedom of expression or association, or otherwise prevent our full enjoyment and exercise of universally recognised human rights and fundamental freedoms.


We call on the Australian Government to support Aborigines in the development of an international declaration of principles for indigenous rights, leading to an international covenant.


And we call on the Commonwealth Parliament to negotiate with us a Treaty recognising our prior ownership, continued occupation and sovereignty and affirming our human rights and freedom.


That work has yet to be done. We have an obligation in this parliament to make sure we follow the lead from the voice from the heart to have a treaty and set up a national representative body to represent the views of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians, as was demanded 30 years ago, and repeated recently at Uluru.

"Hill, Julian, MP",ALP,2018-06-28,"



Mr HILL
 (Bruce) (11:00):  I've spoken before, and I need to speak again, about the shocking crisis that is the delay in citizenship applications that we're seeing. We've had private members' motions. We've had the issue raised in adjournment and grievance debates, and other statements to the House. I've lost track of how many letters we've sent to the minister, and the garbage we get back. But even I was shocked at the responses to the questions on notice that I received last week, where, finally, the government fessed up that this is now affecting hundreds of thousands of Australian residents. For three months, I didn't get answers to the questions, but they did come last week—and it is an unbelievable mess. I'd also note that I've spent time reconciling the answers received last week from Minister Tudge with those received from Minister Dutton, and this is showing all the signs now of a cover-up between the two ministers, and I'll explain why.


The numbers are important. When this government came to power, it had 20,000 to 30,000 people in the citizenship queue—so, about 20,000 to 30,000 a year. In 2015-16 that went up towards 50,000. In 2016-17 it hit 106,000. The latest figures provided, as at the end of February, are that 188,848 people, permanent residents of this country, are waiting for their citizenship applications to be processed. When you pro rata that for the year, the government are on track to have, by the end of this week, 283,272 applications hanging around in the minister's black hole of a department. That's a 10-times blowout of the queue since they came to office. 


These are not just numbers. These are people, permanent residents, living in Australia for years, working and paying taxes. They're parents, workers and carers. They've fallen in love. They've married Australians. They've come here on skilled visas, business visas, humanitarian visas and spouse visas—you name it. They are people who want to formalise their commitment to this country. We should expect them to do so if they've been living here for that long. We should expect it and we should welcome it. 


The impact of the delay in human terms is appalling. Citizenship delays are one of the big four, as we call them in my electorate office: Centrelink stuff-ups, NBN stuff-ups, migration problems and citizenship problems. They are now the bread-and-butter issues in my electorate. Every week, in the foyer of my office, we have grown men crying. That is not an exaggeration. They come in in a state of hopelessness and despair—



Mr Evans interjecting—




Mr HILL:
  You may laugh, Member for Brisbane, but I challenge you to come to the office and look into the eyes of the man who's been here for 10 years without the ability to go home, without the ability to see his family, without the ability to study and to complete his degree. You may think that's funny; I do not. It is disgusting. It is absolutely disgusting. How can you honestly defend a system where, in a government department, you have 288,000 pieces of paper queued up, with no end in sight? 


What we get told by the minister is that this is a caseload issue. Well, put some more resources on it. We get told there's an identity issue. Most of them are not complex; they're routine. Then we get told it's a security issue. They live here. They are permanent residents who live here. If they're so bloody dangerous, why don't you just chuck them out—or process their citizenship applications? Is it incompetence? It could be, when you have a look at the performance of the minister's department. It could be cruelty, with Hanson having come into the parliament. It could be disenfranchisement, a secret agenda, or part of your agenda to create a two-class society of people living in Australia but never being able to fully participate as Australians. You're happy to take their labour, you're happy to see them exploited in the workplace, you're happy to take their taxes, but you won't let them formalise their commitment to this country. Shame on you. 


Most vulnerable workers in Australia—indeed, all Australians who migrated here—learnt last year what you really think of them, with your racist university-level English language test. And, yes, I say 'racist' because of the little carve-out for the Anglosphere—your much beloved Anglosphere. If you come from a white country, that's okay; you don't have to sit the test. If you come from anywhere else, university-level English grammar for you. Disgusting! There's real anger by Chinese Australians in particular. They know now that the Liberal Party wants to stop Chinese people from coming to Australia or becoming Australians. You're happy to line them up at your donor functions with the election on the rise, telling them how much you love Chinese Australians. You'll take their money, but you won't let them become Australians. Well, they're warming up to you. 


The final thing I'd note is there's a worrying sign of a cover-up. In a 2016 Federal Court case, Minister Dutton's evidence was: 'There are 10,000 applications that require thorough analysis or further assessment.' He said the same thing in an answer to me on 9 May 2017. Yet last week Minister Tudge suddenly claimed:


The department does not attribute applications into broad designations or categories as indicated in the question. 


What's going on? It stinks like a cover-up, and if it's not you should fix it. (Time expired)
