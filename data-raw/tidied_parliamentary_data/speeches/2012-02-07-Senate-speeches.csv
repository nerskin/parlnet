MINERALS RESOURCE RENT TAX BILL 2011


Every Australian knows the mining boom is delivering tremendous benefits to our nation.


But the mining boom won’t last forever. The resources can only be dug up and sold once.


We know we need to make the most of our opportunities while the sun is shining. 


We also realise that not everyone is feeling the benefits of the boom.


Many households are struggling to make ends meet.


And many businesses are struggling with a high Australian dollar, and struggling to get the workers they need.


Some of these businesses can take heart that the expanding middle class in Asia will bring opportunities well beyond mining—in sectors like tourism and other services.


But other businesses recognise that conditions are tough.


So our nation faces a fundamental choice.


We could do nothing and sit on our hands. This is the easy choice.


The government has chosen the other path. We will act to seize the opportunities and respond to the challenges of our patchwork economy.


We will not let the coming boom be squandered like the last.


That is why we’re building a fairer, simpler tax system and a stronger economy that delivers for all Australians. 


The reforms that I present today are the cornerstone of that vision. They are an ambitious step in a long term reform agenda. 


We recognise that many businesses are struggling with the pressures of a patchwork economy. 


The Minerals Resource Rent Tax makes it possible to deliver a billion dollar tax break for Australia’s 2.7 million small businesses and cut company tax. 


We recognise that many parts of the country, especially our great mining regions, have extra infrastructure needs.


The MRRT will fund billions of dollars of new roads, bridges and other critical infrastructure, such as the Gateway project in Western Australia. Much of this infrastructure will benefit the regions where the resources come from and where the workers and their families live, such as the great coal mining regions of NSW and Queensland. 


We recognise that this time around Australia needs to save some of the gains of the boom.


The MRRT makes it possible to increase the superannuation guarantee from nine to 12 per cent, boosting super savings of 8.4 million Australian workers by $500 billion by 2035.


The MRRT also makes it possible to deliver fairer super concessions for 3.6 million low-income earners, who currently get little or no concession on their employer superannuation contributions.




Mining Boom Mark II



Australia is experiencing an unprecedented boom in our resources sector which has delivered record profits to mining companies year after year. 


Mining profits have jumped 262 per cent in the last decade. Along with the coal and iron ore, a large share of these profits are also shipped off overseas. 


The current arrangements fail to provide an appropriate return for these non-renewable resources to the Australian community, who own the resources 100 per cent. 


Royalties just don't keep up with the booming profits of our miners. 


Royalties often take a flat amount of revenues or production regardless of profitability.


Taxes on profit mean the higher your profit, the more tax you pay.


Taxes on mining profit are better for the nation and the mining industry. 


Taxes on profit return more to the nation when times are good, but they also relieve the tax burden on the industry when times are bad. Taxes on profit automatically relieve struggling mines and their communities of tax when times are tough, unlike royalties.


We will see volatility in MRRT revenue, particularly as prices and investment plans change, but that is good for the nation and for the industry.


The need for improved resource charging arrangements is clear. That is why we are introducing these bills today. 




The Minerals Resource Rent Tax



These reforms ensure that the Australian community receives a fairer return for its non-renewable iron ore and coal resources. 


The Australian people will get a better share in the bounty of this mining boom, and the government will use this share to develop a stronger and broader economy. 


We will ensure that the dividends of the boom are directed to where they can make the greatest contribution to jobs, to infrastructure, to national savings and to sustainable economic growth.


The new resource tax arrangements also represent a cooperative approach between industry and government in the process of tax reform. 


Indeed, these bills have been developed in partnership with the resource sector through one of the most comprehensive stakeholder consultation processes ever conducted by an Australian government. 


Industry was directly involved in the development of these reforms through the Resource Tax Consultation Panel, the Policy Transition Group, the Resource Tax Implementation Group and numerous public submission processes. 


So the bills that I present to the House today are the direct result of the strong cooperation of industry in the legislative process.


The bills before the House provide for a robust resource rent tax regime and ensure that the long-term attractiveness of investment in Australian iron ore and coal is maintained.


You only have to look at the massive $430 billion pipeline of investment in our mining sector—and $82 billion in this year alone—to see that the industry has great confidence in the future.


Mining companies are investing in the future in full knowledge of the commencement of the MRRT on July 1 next year.


The MRRT will apply, at a rate of 30 per cent, to all new and existing iron ore and coal projects. 


An extraction allowance of 25 per cent will recognise the miner’s use of specialist skill in the extraction of resources. 


Because the MRRT only taxes the most highly profitable mines, Australia will remain an attractive destination for resource investment. 


At the same time, Australians will receive an appropriate return on their non-renewable resources, which they own 100 per cent.




Supporting Mining Investments



Unlike royalties, the MRRT recognises the massive investments that miners make. 


The tax doesn't apply to the value added by miners through processing. It applies only to profits attributable to the resource at the valuation point just after extraction.


Under the MRRT, projects will be able to immediately write-off new investment and immediately deduct expenses. 


No MRRT will be payable until the project has made enough profit to pay off its upfront investment. 


We expect the big miners to pay the bulk of the MRRT, and to pay it from year one. This is based on extensive consultations with the mining industry.


The big miners are expected to pay the most because they are the most profitable. 




Supporting Small Miners



Small miners have been well-served by the design of the MRRT.


Companies with MRRT profits of less than $50 million a year will have a low profit offset that wipes out their MRRT liability. 


Small miners who know that their profits will never exceed this threshold will not have to account for the tax or maintain MRRT records—simplifying compliance and administration. 


Miners with annual MRRT profits between $50 million and $100 million will benefit from a partial reduction in their MRRT liability.


Small miners investing to grow will also benefit from the immediate deductibility of upstream capital investments.


They will only pay MRRT after the project has made enough profit to pay off these upfront investments. 


The government will refer this bill to the House Economics Committee, to report by 21 November, and I hope to see passage through this chamber this year.




The Right Reform, at the Right Time



This is a proud day for every Australian. 


Our nation will finally lock in the gains from our nation’s mineral endowment. 


We picked this challenge long before it became popular. We picked it and we acted on it. 


No reform is easy—this one has been very difficult. 


But the most important reforms, those that strengthen, broaden and modernise our economy most markedly, are always the most difficult. 


This was the case when far-sighted Labor governments of the past fought tooth and nail to put in place the nation-building reforms that have underpinned our current prosperity.


And it is so today, as the Gillard government gets on with the job of introducing major reforms like the MRRT—to build a stronger economy that delivers for all Australians.


With the consent of other far-sighted members of this parliament, we will pass it.


The package of bills I introduce today mean that for the first time in this nation’s history, we can be sure that every Australian will benefit from our valuable mineral heritage. 


Our non-renewable natural resources will finally benefit ordinary Australians. 


Our coal often fires overseas furnaces, our iron ore supports towers under different stars and a large part of the profits flow to foreign shareholders.  


From now on, our resources will also contribute to better infrastructure, more productive businesses and more secure retirements for ordinary Australians. 


Now is the time for our nation to choose to get a fairer return for the resource wealth in the ground.


And now is the time to reinvest that return in a stronger economy, in vital regional infrastructure, and in our national savings for the future.


This landmark legislation is part of a reform package that will build and strengthen our economy.  


Legislation which will do so much for our nation and which deserves the full support of the parliament, the business sector and the community. 


It is up to us here today, to recognise that now is the time to act in the long-term interest, to seize these opportunities for the sake of all Australians—in this generation and those to follow.


I commend this bill to all Australians today and for the generations to come.


 


MINERALS RESOURCE RENT TAX (CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS AND TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS) BILL 2011


This bill is the second of five bills related to the imposition of the Minerals Resource Rent Tax that I am introducing to this session of parliament.


The bill provides for amendments to a range of acts that are necessary to facilitate the operation of the Minerals Resource Rent Tax.


The bill also provides for transitional matters relating to the enactment of the Minerals Resource Rent Tax.


 


MINERALS RESOURCE RENT TAX (IMPOSITION—GENERAL) BILL 2011


The bill imposes Minerals Resource Rent Tax to the extent that it is neither a duty of customs nor a duty of excise.


Minerals Resource Rent Tax is payable under the Minerals Resource Rent Tax Act 2011 from 1 July 2012. It is imposed at a rate of 30 per cent, less a 25 per cent extraction allowance to reflect the contribution of miners' expertise in extracting the resources.


The bill does not impose tax on property of any kind belonging to a State.


 


MINERALS RESOURCE RENT TAX (IMPOSITION—CUSTOMS) BILL 2011


The bill imposes Minerals Resource Rent Tax to the extent that it is a duty of Customs.


Minerals Resource Rent Tax is payable under the Minerals Resource Rent Tax Act 2011 from 1 July 2012. 


It is imposed at a rate of 30 per cent, less a 25 per cent extraction allowance to reflect the contribution of miners’ expertise in extracting the resources.


The bill does not impose tax on property of any kind belonging to a State.


 


MINERALS RESOURCE RENT TAX (IMPOSITION—EXCISE) BILL 2011


The bill imposes Minerals Resource Rent Tax to the extent that it is a duty of excise.


Minerals Resource Rent Tax is payable under the Minerals Resource Rent Tax Act 2011 from 1 July 2012. 


It is imposed at a rate of 30 per cent, less a 25 per cent extraction allowance to reflect the contribution of miners' expertise in extracting the resources.


The bill does not impose tax on property of any kind belonging to a State.


 


PETROLEUM RESOURCE RENT TAX ASSESSMENT AMENDMENT BILL 2011


This bill is part of establishing a new way to tax Australia's valuable non-renewable resources. 


This bill extends the existing Petroleum Resource Rent Tax regime to all oil and gas production in Australia.  


The Petroleum Resource Rent Tax Assessment Amendment Bill 2011 establishes a tax that keeps pace with our booming resource sector. 


Last year, the government announced new resource taxation arrangements to build a stronger economy and a fairer tax system.


Extending the PRRT to all Australian oil and gas production is another component of that vision.


It is an ambitious step in a long-term reform agenda that will provide all Australian oil and gas projects with a certain and consistent tax regime that takes account of the varying circumstances and profitability of individual projects. 


Australia is experiencing an unprecedented boom in its resources sector.  


Australian oil and gas production is expected to continue to grow as new projects come on line.


Over $140 billion of investment has been committed to Australia's booming LNG industry, putting Australia on track to becoming the world's second largest exporter of LNG in 2015. 


Just as the application of the PRRT in offshore areas has not prevented investments in offshore oil and gas projects, the extension of this regime to onshore oil and gas projects and the North West Shelf project is not expected to affect investment levels onshore. 


Resource charging arrangements have not been keeping pace with resource profits and resource taxes have been declining as a share of resource profits.  


For the first time, the Australian community will share in the profits of this resources boom to develop a stronger and broader economy, through investments in jobs, infrastructure and sustainable economic growth. 


Like the MRRT, the PRRT extension has been developed in a cooperative manner between industry and government.   


These bills underwent the same comprehensive consultation process as the MRRT, with industry involved in the policy, legislative development and design process.   


Extensive consultation has occurred through the Resource Tax Consultation Panel, the Policy Transition Group, the Resource Tax Implementation Group and a public submission process.  


The PRRT has been operating successfully offshore since 1987.  


The bill before the House extends this efficient profit based tax to onshore oil and gas, including the growing onshore coal seam gas industry, while ensuring that the long-term attractiveness of investment in Australian oil and gas extraction is not impaired. 


It was true back in 1987 and it is true now. 


I quote Hansard back when the PRRT was first introduced: 


Petroleum resources are, in their most basic sense, community property and the government believes that the community as a whole should share in the potentially high returns from the exploitation of these scarce, non-renewable resources. 


The government believes that a resource rent tax related to achieved profits is a more efficient and equitable secondary taxation regime.


In contrast to production-based secondary tax regimes, the petroleum resource rent tax will be payable only in respect of projects earning a high rate of return on outlays…and  


[The PRRT] strikes a reasonable balance between the objectives of satisfying the right of the community as a whole to share in the benefits of profitable offshore petroleum projects, and of providing the participants with adequate returns for the risks they accept in undertaking exploration and development activities.


The PRRT is applied at a rate of 40 per cent on the taxable profit derived from a petroleum project.   


Broadly speaking a petroleum project's profit is calculated by deducting expenses from the assessable revenues derived from the project.   


Project expenditure is immediately deductible and exploration expenditure may be transferable to other petroleum projects.   


Assessable revenue primarily comprises the receipts received from the sale of petroleum or marketable petroleum commodities recovered or produced from a project.   


Where deductible expenditure exceeds assessable revenue from a project in a financial year, the excess expenditure is carried forward and uplifted to be deducted against project earnings in future years. 


From 1 July 2012, the PRRT will apply to all new and existing oil and gas projects in Australia.  


The core design features of the PRRT will remain unchanged, and offshore projects currently operating under the PRRT will be largely unaffected by the PRRT extension. 


To accommodate onshore projects and the North West Shelf project into the PRRT the bill makes the following key amendments. 


The project combination certificate criteria are expanded to allow onshore projects with integrated downstream operations to be treated as a single project. 


Consolidated group companies will have the choice to treat interests held by different group companies within a petroleum project as a single interest for PRRT purposes. 


Project expenditure related to the environment is made explicitly deductible. 


A new category of assessable incidental production receipts will include revenue generated using petroleum project facilities. 


Deductible expenditure is expanded to include resource taxation expenditure to avoid the double taxation of petroleum projects subject to crude oil excise and State based royalty regimes. 


And finally, existing petroleum projects that are transitioning to the PRRT are entitled to a starting base to shield historical investment and prevent the retrospective application of the extended PRRT.   


The starting base is non-transferable, and unused starting base expenditure will be uplifted, consistent with the treatment of unused general project expenditure, to be deducted in future years. 


Like the MRRT, under the extended PRRT the state and territory governments will continue to receive a stream of royalty revenues.   


To ensure that taxpayers are not double taxed, the PRRT regime provides a deduction equivalent for state royalties paid by a taxpayer in respect of a petroleum project.   


Unused resource tax credits are not transferable between petroleum projects and will be uplifted at the long-term government bond rate plus five per cent, consistent with the treatment of other losses.   


The bill includes amendments to ensure that, in circumstances where onshore coal seam gas producers have an integrated gas to liquids project, they will be able to access the pricing methodologies contained in the Petroleum Resource Rent Tax Assessment Regulations 2005.   


It is the government's intention to undertake subsequent consultation on the PRRT regulations to ensure they operate effectively in an onshore context. 


The PRRT will ensure a more consistent share for all Australians of the returns generated from our non-renewable resources while maintaining a healthy pipeline of investment and job creation. 


Like the MRRT, the PRRT extension is landmark legislation.  Legislation that will do much for our great nation and it deserves the full support of the parliament, the business sector and the community. 


 


PETROLEUM RESOURCE RENT TAX (IMPOSITION—GENERAL) BILL 2011


The bill imposes a tax in respect of the profits of certain petroleum projects, so far as that tax is neither a duty of customs nor a duty of excise and sets that rate at 40 per cent from 1 July 1986.


The Petroleum Resource Rent Tax is administered under the Petroleum Resource Rent Tax Assessment Act 1987. 


The bill does not impose tax on property of any kind belonging to a state.


 


PETROLEUM RESOURCE RENT TAX (IMPOSITION—CUSTOMS) BILL 2011


The bill imposes a tax in respect of the profits of certain petroleum projects, so far as that tax is a duty of customs and sets that rate at 40 per cent from 1 July 1986.


The Petroleum Resource Rent Tax is administered under the Petroleum Resource Rent Tax Assessment Act 1987. 


The bill does not impose tax on property of any kind belonging to a state.


 


PETROLEUM RESOURCE RENT TAX (IMPOSITION—EXCISE) BILL 2011


The bill imposes a tax in respect of the profits of certain petroleum projects, so far as that tax is a duty of excise and sets that rate at 40 per cent from 1 July 1986.


The Petroleum Resource Rent Tax is administered under the Petroleum Resource Rent Tax Assessment Act 1987. 


The bill does not impose tax on property of any kind belonging to a state.


 


TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (STRONGER, FAIRER, SIMPLER AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2011


This bill contains long-term reforms that will bring benefits to small business and lift the superannuation savings of millions of low income Australians and make our superannuation system fairer. 


Schedule 1 removes the entrepreneurs' tax offset in order to deliver more effective assistance for small businesses. This is consistent with recommendation 6 of Australia's Future Tax System (better known as the Henry Review).


The entrepreneurs' tax offset, which according to AFTS 'provides problematic incentives related to business structure' makes way for better targeted small business assistance.


Through schedules 2 and 3 the government is delivering on its commitment to improve cash flow and reduce compliance costs for Australia's 2.7 million small businesses.


Under schedule 2, from the 2012-13 income year, small businesses will benefit from being able to immediately write-off depreciating assets that cost less than $6,500. This increase from a threshold of $1,000 will allow small businesses to claim a deduction for more expensive assets—those costing less than $6,500 instead of less than $1,000—providing a cash flow benefit. Small business will benefit from this initiative when they purchase assets such as a computer, photocopier and printer. 


The government will also simplify the depreciation regime for depreciating assets costing $6,500 or more. Instead of having to allocate assets to one of two depreciation pools, each with a different depreciation rate (five per cent and 30 per cent), small business will now be able to allocate assets to a single depreciation pool with a single rate of 30 per cent (and 15 per cent in the first year).


In addition to the benefits that come with simplifying the pooling arrangements, small businesses will also benefit from being able to depreciate some assets more quickly, at an increased rate of 30 per cent instead of five per cent—again, providing a cash-flow benefit.


In addition to these measures, which were announced as part of the government's response to the AFTS Review and the Clean Energy Future package, the government has continued to deliver for small businesses through the 2011-12 Budget. 


Schedule 3 will do this by providing an accelerated initial deduction for motor vehicles purchased by small businesses from the 2012-13 income year.


This means that small businesses that purchase a motor vehicle costing $6,500 or more from the 2012-13 income year will be able to immediately write-off up to $5,000 and will be able to depreciate the remainder of the value at 15 per cent in the first year and 30 per cent in following years.


As motor vehicles are primary assets for many small business operators, this increased initial deduction will improve cash flow for a large number of small businesses.


It will mean that a tradesman on a 30 per cent marginal tax rate buying a new ute worth $33,960 will receive a tax benefit of $1,275 in the year they purchase the vehicle. This means more money in the pocket of small business. 


These changes improve cash flow for businesses and makes investing in and growing their business more achievable.


Businesses with an annual turnover of less than $2 million will benefit from this small business package. That is 96 per cent of Australia's 2.7 million small businesses. 


The government is committed to assisting small business and has already reduced quarterly Pay As You Go (PAYG) income tax instalments for the 2011-12 income year for taxpayers using the GDP adjustment method, providing a $700 million cash flow benefit to small business. 


The government is providing extensive assistance to small business through the small business support line, business.gov.au website, the small business advisory service program and enterprise connect. These services are all about helping small businesses with their day-to-day running.


In addition to these measures, the government will reduce the company tax rate for small business companies from 30 to 29 per cent from 2012-13. This will assist up to 720,000 incorporated small businesses, allowing them to reinvest more of the profits to grow their businesses. 


This government values small business, it has a plan to assist small business and it is delivering on this plan.


These changes are about making a real difference to the 2.7 million small businesses in Australia.




Superannuation



Australians should not have to work hard and retire poor. 


How to enjoy a fulfilling and prosperous retirement is one of the great conversations in Australian life. 


I've talked about our significant reform to lift superannuation from nine per cent to 12 per cent, but we need to do more for low-income Australians. 


It's of great concern to me, and I know of great concern to the Prime Minister and Treasurer, that whilst women live longer than men, their super balances are in fact on average about 40 per cent lower. 


This is a serious challenge to Australian women's financial independence. It is important that we address structural imbalances such as equal pay and today the government is also addressing a structural imbalance in the superannuation system. 


Currently, 3.6 million low-income Australians, including around 2.1 million women get no (or minimal) tax benefit from contributing to superannuation, due to the fact that the15 per cent superannuation contribution tax is above or equivalent to  their income tax rate. 


Let's reflect for a moment on these numbers—3.6 million Australians. That is around three out every 10 workers who do not get a tax benefit from contributing to superannuation; 2.1 million of them are women, that is three in every eight women in the workforce. 


Put another way the 3.6 million Australians includes:


Around 1.1 million workers in New South Wales


Around 910,000 workers in Victoria


Around 800,000 workers in Queensland


Around 260,000 workers in South Australia


Around 360,000 workers in WA


Around 90,000 workers in Tasmania


Around 30,000 workers in the Northern Territory


Around 50,000 workers in the ACT


The Gillard government is acting on the recommendation of the Henry Review which said that superannuation tax concessions should be distributed more equitably.


From 1 July next year, we will make the system fairer by ensuring no tax is paid on the superannuation contributions for Australians earning up to $37,000 and that the money is instead directed into their superannuation. This tax reduction is limited to $500 per person which covers the tax due on nine per cent SG at $37,000.


Sixty per cent of the beneficiaries of this policy are women. 


The superannuation savings of 2.1 million women earning less than $37,000 will be boosted by $550 million in 2012-13 alone. 


Importantly, the government has also simplified the application process for low income earners individuals who are not required to submit an income tax return. They will not need to fill out any extra paperwork. Instead the ATO will do the calculations for them using information available to the Commissioner of Taxation such as payment summaries. 


This streamlined process reduces the paperwork burden on low-income Australians, while ensuring the integrity of the system. 


This will be one of the most significant wealth creation reforms targeted at low income earners in modern Australian history.


Put simply, the government is lowering the tax burden on low-income Australians and directing this forgone tax revenue into their superannuation accounts to help them build for the future. 


The revenue from the Minerals Resources Rent Tax will go towards filling the resultant gap in tax revenue. It is the right way to share the benefits of the mining boom and ensure our country is well prepared for the gift of longer life.


 


SUPERANNUATION GUARANTEE (ADMINISTRATION) AMENDMENT BILL 2011


I am in introducing this bill because the parliament should pass laws which are optimistic and hopeful about Australia's future.  


It proposes to increase the Superannuation Guarantee charge from nine per cent to 12 per cent.


And this bill abolishes the Superannuation Guarantee age limit.


This bill passes the test of being positive and constructive.  


We are living longer than ever before.  So we must change with the new rhythms of life.


Those of us over 65 now are only three million in number, but by 2050 there'll be 8.1 million. 


Today there are 50 of us in work for every 10 of us in retirement. By 2050, there will be 27 of us in work for every 10 of us in retirement. 


These days we're probably at school and in college until we're 20 or 25. 


We then work for 35 years, and after that we have another twenty or even thirty years to think about things, play bowls, go fishing, join reading groups, write family histories, and the rest of it. Thirty years, perhaps.  Forty, maybe. 


Life itself, our life in the best country on earth, has been redefined by these new unchangeable figures of a long and largely healthy life. 


Longer life full of quality and meaning is the great gift of 20th century Australians to 21st century Australians.  And we should celebrate it.


Therefore the goal of lifetime income security celebrates a long and quality life.


This bill declares that the Australian people understand change is inevitable.  


This bill declares Australians reject the proposition that Australians should stay frozen in the moment.


This bill declares that Australians do not believe change is too hard.


This bill declares that Australians understand that as we are living longer, we need to smooth our prosperity over longer life.


Until 1985, private retirement income under the superannuation provisions applied to the very wealthy and some well-paid employees in the public sector.  


Until 1985 the great majority of working Australians had no viable access to the generosity of the superannuation tax provisions.


Until 1985 most Australians had to rely upon had relied on the taxpayer provided age pension as their principal post-employment income system.


The first move towards universal access under the superannuation provisions came as part of the Hawke government's Accord with Australian trade unions.  


Government and unions agreed that the profit share in the economy had to be restored to re-ignite private investment.  At the time, unemployment and inflation were both hovering around 10 percent.


In return for this restraint the government supported the ACTU's claim that three percentage points of wages should be contributed by employers to a superannuation account in the name of each worker.


This was 1985.  Then on 20 August 1991; in the Hawke government's ninth budget laid the groundwork for the superannuation industry as we know it now.  Not long after becoming Prime Minister, Paul Keating announced the introduction of the Superannuation Guarantee Charge.  


Under this path-breaking legislation, employer contributions to superannuation would rise from three percentage points of ordinary time earnings in 1992-93 to nine percentage points of ordinary time earnings by 2002-03.  


Over the period when the Superannuation Guarantee Charge grew from three to nine per cent of employer contributions, unit labour costs fell.  This meant that the cost of superannuation was rarely borne by employers.  It was absorbed into the overall wage cost.


Had employers not paid nine percentage points of wages as superannuation contributions to employee super accounts: they would have paid it in cash as wages.


As Keating said in 2007: 'when you hear conservatives these days speak of superannuation as a tax on employers they are either ill-informed or they are lying. The fall in unit labour costs and the upward shift in the profit share during the period of the Superannuation Guarantee Charge is simply a matter of statistical record.  It is not a matter of argument.'


Today the savings pool is worth more than $1.3 trillion to the nation.  


Our retirement savings system is the fourth biggest pool of funds under management on the planet.


The original Superannuation Guarantee legislation has since proven fundamental to the sustainability of our private retirement income.


Superannuation has proved to be a terrific idea; blessing Australia with a national institution that almost every developed economy in the rest of the world would give their eye teeth for.


It is now a mature idea. 


Yet in terms of providing an adequate retirement nest egg, the system still has great capacity to grow, to mature and perform even better for individuals who get to retire after a whole working life of superannuation behind them.


Compulsory superannuation's gradual introduction between 1992-93 and 2002-03 has smoothed the transition path and demonstrated how long run reforms can be successfully introduced in our country.


But adequacy remains the challenge, and task of providing for retirement is getting bigger as we live longer and as weak investment markets slow growth of fund balances, necessitating higher contribution levels.


Running the system as efficiently as possible is essential as it grows bigger balances and maximizes the return to the taxpayers of the 15 per cent concessional tax rate.


I think it obligatory to recognise the future's lament if we in the federal parliament don't take this opportunity to pass the law that will deliver 12 per cent compulsory superannuation contribution.


Of all the human emotions, it is perhaps regret we should fear the most.


It is both instant and long lasting.  


In politics, the worst regret is always the regret for the path not taken, the timidity of a moment that cost us the skirmish, the skirmish that cost us the battle, the battle that cost us the war.


Too often in politics we deal, or we end up dealing, not with the problem, but the politics of the problem. 


The rhetoric of the problem. Dare I even say—the spin.


We try to paper over with bravado the fragility within.


We lose the moment, and in doing so—the future.


No big economic reform is easy.  


I understand that no change to our public life, no social contract—indeed no progress—could be taken for granted.


It has to be fought for, with all the guile and persistence of Fred Hollows, and all the brash force of Henry Chauvel, racing his horses for Beersheba water.


Victory is never certain. 


And to be fair, probably all of us - whatever our political stripe—who have the privilege to serve fully in this place, sooner or later realize that the big public policy struggles are inevitable, and intricate, and close-fought, and exhausting.


Long-lasting economic change—whether floating the dollar or deregulating the financial markets require all the powers of political persuasion.


We believe nine to 12 per cent is profoundly necessary, and we wish to calm the anxiety and explain the detail of what this reform would do.


This bill is pressing the advantage of doing the right thing by the nation, even if vested interests and loud voices opposite yelling 'no' make the going all the slower, all the tougher.


But this bill has an army of good voices and minds behind it.


Just as an army of commonsense, real world voices raised their game to advocate for and help deliver compulsory superannuation two decades ago.


I am inspired that always and every time, the agents of change in our national story already written—from both sides of the political divide—have had to consistently and persistently argue the merits of the case and keep a firm grip on the detail and sketch out—with daily alacrity—what would happen when the changes were actually implemented.


The superannuation reforms the Gillard government has announced—lifting the Super Guarantee from nine up to 12 per cent and how it's afforded through the mining tax—has been met with a fiercely hostile opposition. And so once again we find the going harder than such good ideas deserve.


Yet as the Minister for Superannuation I am finding that the strongest argument for these retirement savings reforms is not purely through a recitation of the details. 


But a simple plea that we must, for dignity of hardworking Australians in retirement and to place less pressure on the age pension, secure the goal of adequate lifetime retirement savings.  


A 70 per cent replacement rate in post work life—of average earnings prior to retirement constitutes the winning tape for adequate retirement.  


This plea is especially applicable now because of the arithmetic we are in, in this parliament, compared with the years, in the 1980s and 1990s, of large majorities in the lower House, and of civilised reason in the Senate.


When it comes to lifting super to 12 per cent, I know that most of our nation absolutely get it.


Australians get it right in their bones.


We believe that longer life is a gift that should be celebrated.


We believe there's little point in working hard and retiring poor. 


We want Australians to live long lives that have quality and meaning. 


We want those lives that go up to and last beyond a hundred years to have been well-lived, both at the start and at the end. 


Which means, as the numbers of the old go up, we want to deliver a better deal, a new deal, on superannuation.


Our starting point is that nine per cent is simply not enough, especially for women, who have breaks in their career rearing the next generation, when they are not earning, and therefore not putting in their nine per cent away for the nest egg. 


It's why we are taking, as Paul Keating planned many years before, the nine per cent up to 12 per cent.  And in doing this we are strengthening superannuation. 


The Superannuation Guarantee charge percentage will be increased gradually with initial increments of 0.25 percentage points on 1 July 2013 and 1 July 2014. Further increments of 0.5 percentage points will apply annually up to 2019-20, when the SG rate will be set at 12 per cent.  


These superannuation measures and others contained in the Stronger, Fairer, Simpler package of reform, along with the increases in the age pension which the government introduced in 2009, and the Stronger Super package of reforms will allow Australians to secure higher standards of living in retirement than ever before.


This bill also makes superannuation fairer for Australians of all ages.


From 1 July 2013, the Superannuation Guarantee will be payable for eligible employees over 18.  


Currently, the Superannuation Guarantee only applies to people under 70. The amendments will align the SG age limit with the age limit for voluntary and self-employed contributions.  


The increase in the Superannuation Guarantee age limit means that eligible individuals aged 70 and beyond will have superannuation guarantee contributions made on their behalf for the first time.  


Making superannuation contributions compulsory for these mature-age workers will improve the adequacy and equity of the retirement income system, and provide an incentive to older Australians to remain in the workforce for longer.  


The actuaries tell us the average Australian needs a 70 per cent replacement rate of his or her accustomed income to live in retirement comfortably. For example, the Melbourne-Mercer Global Pension Index recommends this. 


Being satisfied with just nine per cent compulsory superannuation means being satisfied with a big percentage of Australians outliving the money set aside to see them through the Third Age. 


As we live longer—nine per cent just doesn't build enough.


It's why the Minerals Resource Rent Tax is so important to our nation's future.  


The MRRT pays for the tax concessional treatment of the additional three per cent Superannuation Guarantee—with workers retirement contributions taxed at 15 percent instead of their marginal personal income tax rate.


It's of great concern to me, and I know of great concern to the Prime Minister, that whilst women live longer than men, their super balances are in fact on average around 40 per cent lower. 


This is a serious challenge to Australian women's financial independence.  


Currently, around 2.1 million women get no tax benefit from contributing to superannuation, due to the 15 per cent superannuation contribution tax being at or above their income tax rate.


The Gillard government is therefore acting on the recommendation of the Henry Review which said that superannuation tax concessions be distributed more equitably.


From 1 July next year, we will make the system fairer by ensuring no tax is paid on the nine per cent superannuation contributions for Australians earning up to $37,000 and that the money is instead directed into their superannuation.


Sixty per cent of the beneficiaries of this policy are women. 


The superannuation savings of 2.1 million women earning less than $37,000 will be boosted by $550 million in 2012-13 alone. 


So a 30-year-old woman on full-time average wages will have an extra $108,000 in retirement savings providing her with an extra $2,900 to spend each year of her retirement.


This is what good law—from a government that is confident in Australia's future—is all about.


In August 2011 looking at the great economic reforms of Hawke and Keating and Kelty—reforms like superannuation—can be a bit like looking at the silverware in our nation's economic trophy cabinet.  


But I believe each generation has to make its own history.


To build new achievements.


We can respect our history—as families, as tribes, as nations—while still making our own history as a generation.


Surely we don't want to look back in 20 years time and regret not raising superannuation to 12 per cent. 


We want to say, 'Do you remember when we lifted it to 12 per cent—to where it needed to be.'


Do any of us really think we would have saved $1.3 trillion without compulsory super? 


I believe there are four pillars which today assure a quality of Australian life for all our fellow citizens:


the minimum wage;


the age pension;


Medicare; and


compulsory superannuation. 


I might add that I think a National Disability Insurance Scheme has the potential to be the new fifth pillar. So early August was a wonderful time measured by the significance of first big steps.


In mid-2011, two decades after compulsory superannuation was introduced, superannuation stands as one of Australian Labor's most enduring and far sighted reforms.


The mission of adequate retirement savings is not yet completed, but the journey here has been a great national direction.


We will know that we have succeeded when all Australians recognise that superannuation is as vital a pillar for our quality of life as Medicare or the minimum wage.  


And let me say when that happens, after 12 per cent is achieved, governments need to step right back and stop the tinkering with the tax treatment of superannuation. 


I truly believe we are not quite there yet, but the government's reform agenda together with the good work the industry is doing on building the brand will help us get there. 


Our superannuation reforms will deliver a great good to Australians upon their retirement and the Australian economy more generally.


The great good of a more comfortable post work life.  


The great good of Australians retiring on a 70 per cent replacement rate.


The great good of concessional tax, compound interest and dividend imputation.


The great good of seeing Australia become even better at financial services.  


The great good of reducing the cost of capital.


The great good of more capital becoming available for nation-building infrastructure.  


The great good of low inflation, high savings and a future some Europeans now dream of.


The Gillard government understands the forces of change that we have to navigate to secure future waves national prosperity.


That the ageing of our population is one of these forces is undeniable and the need for greater retirement savings is therefore irresistible.  


And I submit, is logically inevitable.


We always hear a lot from financial planners and investment strategists about savings and investment but it is politicians who can make the real difference. And it is the politicians who need to grasp the relative immediacy of longer life spans—with it's all too predictable dislocating consequences. 


Under Prime Minster Gillard's leadership our national government is acting for the long term and we are strategically placing the nation where the challenges and opportunities of the future can be met with confidence and conquered with commonsense.


Lifting the Superannuation Guarantee change to 12 per cent is profoundly sensible.


Australians need not fear the future—we should be optimistic.


This bill keeps faith that Australians should and can live long lives full of quality and meaning.  This bill keeps faith that the goal of lifetime income security for Australians is achievable. 


And this parliament, I believe, should not miss the opportunity to do good.

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia) (12:36):  I seek leave to move a motion in the terms circulated in the chamber relating to the government's failure to comply with Senate orders on the mining tax package.


Leave not granted.




Senator CORMANN:
  Pursuant to contingent motion and at the request of the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Senator Abetz, I move:


That so much of the standing orders be suspended as would prevent Senator Abetz moving a motion to provide for the consideration of a matter, namely a motion to give precedence to a motion relating to the Government's failure to comply with the order of the Senate for the production of documents concerning the Mineral Resource Rent Tax.


I agree with Senator Bob Brown and the Greens. The coalition agrees with Senator Bob Brown and the Greens that the govern­ment's secrecy and its refusal to provide information about the mining tax—in particular, about the mining tax revenue assumptions and the cost of associated measures—is unsatisfactory and that it is time for the Senate to flex its muscle. The Gillard government is treating the Senate with absolute contempt.


The coalition view, and this is where we part company with the Greens, is that the mining tax is a bad tax which came out of a bad process. It is a tax which was negotiated exclusively and in secret between the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and the Minister for Resources and Energy and the managing directors of the three biggest mining companies in Australia, excluding from that process all of their competitors and all state and territory governments. It is a tax which gives the three companies who had privile­ged access to that negotiation an unfair competitive advantage. We were promised root-and-branch tax reform which would make our tax system simpler and fairer—what the government has delivered is manifestly more complex and less fair.


There are serious question marks around the mining tax revenue estimates. They have been jumping around. Every couple of months the mining tax revenue estimates go up or down. There are serious question marks as to whether the mining tax would actually raise what the government says it would—the reason being that, in the way the mining tax has been designed by the government, it gives a significant up-front tax deduction to the three biggest mining companies, a tax deduction that is not available to most of their competitors.


There are also serious question marks around the interaction between state royalty arrangements for iron ore and coal product­ion and the federal minerals resource rent tax. It is absolutely obvious that Prime Minister Gillard and Treasurer Swan have something to hide, because order of the Senate after order of the Senate requiring the release by the government of information about how they calculated the mining tax revenue estimates has not been complied with.


Then we have all of the promises that Labor have attached to their mining tax. Even if you look at it at a high level, it is obvious that the spending commitments that the Labor Party have attached to the mining tax are far greater than even what the government suggest would be raised in revenue through the mining tax. Only the Labor Party could come up with a new multibillion-dollar tax which would have huge ramifications for the most successful industry in our economy right now, huge ramifications for Australia as an investment destination and huge ramifications for jobs, and would actually leave the budget worse off.


It is no wonder the government has been bending over backwards to refuse to provide that information to the Senate. We have a job to do. We, as the Senate of Australia, have a job to do—to scrutinise government legisla­tion and to expose the flaws in bad government legislation. When we ask for information from the government, in order to do our job, the government should provide that information unless they have a very good excuse not to.


This is where I agree with Senator Bob Brown and the Greens. The government's conduct when it comes to Senate requests for information in relation to the mining tax has been unsatisfactory. Those are his words, but they could have come from me. It is time that the Senate flexed its muscle in the context of a government that is being inappropriately secretive. The only leverage the Senate has in the face of a government that is secretive and is refusing to provide the information that we have legitimately asked for is to refuse to deal with legislation until such time as the government has complied. That is why I recommend to the Senate a motion which would see the deferral of these MRRT related bills and the further listing of these bills as an order of the day until such time as the Senate agrees that the govern­ment has complied with its relevant outstanding orders for information.

"Fifield, Sen Mitch",LP,2012-02-07,"



Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate) (12:42):  On this side of the chamber we take very seriously the Senate's role as a place of scrutiny and as a place of accountability. I think all in this chamber have a sneaking suspicion that on occasion we are the first people in this building to actually look closely at legislation, that perhaps they do not always do so over in the other place. That is just a sneaking suspicion, but we do have an important role to play here.


I remember listening to Labor senators during the years of the Howard government saying how committed they were to appro­priate scrutiny, how committed they were to evidence based policy, how outrage­ous the then government was and how, when they won office, they were going to usher in a glorious new period of sunlight in public administration. In fact, they have a policy called Operation Sunlight in the Department of Finance and Deregulation—such is their commitment to openness and transparency, to airing all things which should be considered in the development of public policy.


So, quite frankly, I was a little shocked when the Labor Party formed government that this approach did not come to pass. We saw that with the carbon tax, one of the most outrageous examples of the denial of the rights and duties of this chamber. This place was denied the opportunity to set up Senate committees to examine that legislation—putting to one side, of course, the fib, the bald faced lie, to the Australian people that there would be no carbon tax. Even in the face of that, this chamber was denied the opportunity for scrutiny.


We are seeing that again here today with this package of legislation. Senator Cormann, who has done a very comprehen­sive job in looking at this legislation through various committees over many, many months, is quite right to seek a suspension of standing orders in order to move his motion. His motion is merely calling upon the government to do that which the Senate has already directed it to do—that is, to provide information that goes to the heart of policy formation and to the heart of the actual, real-world impact of this legislation.


The Senate has already passed orders requesting that information and the govern­ment have not complied. So we on this side of the chamber are at a great disad­vantage in being able to fully examine this legislation and its implications. I think it is very reason­able of the opposition to seek that the Senate suspend standing orders so that a motion can be put to this chamber that there be no further consideration of this legislation until the previous Senate orders have been complied with. 


We have heard a great deal from the Australian Greens about the need for sun­light on the development of public policy, on the need for integrity and on the need for evidence based policy. This suspension motion should provide an opportunity for them to follow through on their fine words in actions. I hope they do. There is a pattern developing with this government where, despite their claim of the importance of evidence based policy and despite paying lip service to the role of this chamber as a place of scrutiny and accountability, they do not. We saw that the with the NBN—the worst example of non-evidence based policy you have ever seen. It was drafted between Mr Conroy and then Prime Minister Rudd on the back of an envelope whilst on a VIP flight. We saw it with the carbon tax. We saw it with the BER. There was no evidence based policy there. We saw it with the roofing insulation policy. There was no evidence base for that policy. We do not want to see that happen again. We need that information. We want that information. The Senate is entitled to have that information. The Senate has ordered the government to deliver that information and they should do so. 


We will canvass at great length in the debate on the legislation itself how complex, how unfair and how fiscally irresponsible this package of legislation is. But we have before us at the moment a very simple matter—that is, the Senate should suspend standing orders so that Senator Cormann can move his motion to defer further considera­tion of this legislation until the government complies with the Senate order.

Senator JOHNSTON
 (Western Australia) (12:47):  The very least this parliament is entitled to is to know upon what assumptions this vast array of legisla­tion attacking our most successful industry is based, whether the revenue is positive, negative or neutral. This government refuses to disclose the most fundamental and basic responsible information to this legislature. 


The genesis of this tax comes, as we know, in the $900 given to all and sundry—the school halls, the pink batts. It is the drunken-sailor approach to fiscal responsi­bility. What happened? The government ran out of money. So the former Prime Minister devised the superprofits mining tax. Our biggest export earners—coal, iron ore and LNG—were attacked because they were the most profitable. This is an industry that pays very high remuneration to ordinary and unskilled workers. It is the biggest employer of Indigenous people throughout Australia. It is the biggest regional developer. Kalgoorlie, Esperance, Geraldton, Port Hedland, Karra­tha, Tom Price, Paraburdoo: these are all names of places that generate vast amounts of revenue and wealth. Members opposite do not even know those names; they do not even relate to them. They have never heard of them before. 


There is all this bungled incompetence from those opposite. They had to ask the Western Australian Premier on the phone: 'How do we do this? How do we do a mining resources rent tax? And can you tell us, by the way, what state royalties are and who owns the minerals?' The minerals are owned by the Crown in the right of Western Austra­lia. This is a tax on Western Australia. The incompetence was met by further incompe­tence by saying to BHP and Rio: 'How shall we tax you? How shall we take money off you?' They were told things that now mean that this tax is going to cost the taxpayer money. They have had to rewrite this legisla­tion at least four times. They have had secret deals with the Independents and the Greens. Everything that is relevant to this legislature has been kept secret; it has been kept from this legislature. This incompetent govern­ment has no idea what it is doing to our best industry. The reality is that it simply refuses to tell the parliament what is going on. 


The mining industry in Australia is facing hot competition from Brazil, Colombia, Mongolia and Mozambique in coal and iron ore. All mining is capital intensive. Forty-two per cent of iron ore productivity costs are capital. cost. Forty-three per cent of coal costs are capital. What have those opposite done to the magnetite industry, our potential­ly best, blossoming, young mining industry? They have extinguished the investment in that industry and the good jobs that go with that, including the Indigenous employment, in one fell swoop. This govern­ment has put its foot upon the hose of hundreds of billions of dollars in investment and jobs. It will not disclose the basic assumptions and the modelling upon which this tax is based—the estimates and the costings. 


This government is an incompetent, scandalous disgrace, taxing Queensland and Western Australia to pay for its pink-batts fiasco and its drunken-sailor fiscal manage­ment. That is what is happening here. Those opposite sit over there wringing their hands, saying, 'I hope nobody is listening to this, because we are as guilty as sin.' They have no idea what they are doing. 'Please, Mr Barnett, could you explain the royalty system in Western Australia to us? Please tell us how it works, because we have no idea. We do not understand mining. We all come from Sydney and Melbourne. Please tell us how we can tax your state out of existence, because we have spent everything we have ever found in the Treasury.'

Senator ARBIB
 (New South Wales—Assistant Treasurer, Minister for Small Business, Minister for Sport and Manager of Government Business in the Senate) (12:51):  I think all senators on this side of the chamber and all Australians hoped that, after the break, coalition senators would come back with a different attitude to their jobs, because over the past 12 months all we have heard is no. All we have heard is no to every reform the Labor government has tried to put in place to secure the future of Australia, to help families and to make this country a better place to live in. That is exactly what this legislation is about. It is about ensuring that Australians get a fair share, a fair deal and a fair return from the mining boom. We know that the coalition did very little with the first mining boom. In fact, during that period of rapid growth of the mining sector investment in education went down, invest­ment in health went down and investment in infrastructure was static. This Labor govern­ment wants to ensure that Australians get the benefits of this mining boom. The big beneficiaries of the MRRT will be workers, who will get a superannuation increase from nine per cent to 12 per cent. The big beneficiaries will be small businesses, which will get a $6,500 accelerated depreciation asset allowance on the assets they purchase. The big winners will be the people of Australia, who will see greater funds going into infrastructure, which will increase the productivity of this nation. That is what this debate is about.


Today we are again seeing an attempt by coalition senators to defer these bills and to continually debate these bills to ensure that we run out of time to implement the legislation and ensure that Australia benefits. We saw this time and time again last year, when every day the coalition would take up as much time as possible, introducing MPIs and speaking on most procedural matters, often with virtually open-ended debates. That means there was less time for the chamber's vital legislative review functions. Instead, committees have been working flat out to cover all issues in their hearings. The government is also providing extensive briefings to parties on legislation. These bills are currently before the Senate economics committee. Most of the work of examining the bills is taking place in that committee now. Senator Cormann and Senator Fifield are pursuing a quite deliberate strategy. They know that their approach to chamber management forces our hand at the end of sittings and means that the government must consider gagging or guillotining debates. That is not something we wish to do. That is not a strategy that Labor senators wish to pursue, but it is a policy that coalition senators are forcing us to follow.


On the issue of the point of the Information Commissioner, I can assure the Senate that the government is continuing to talk to parties who are genuinely interested in developing a mechanism to arbitrate over orders for the production of documents. This contrasts with those opposite, who, when they were in government, took absolutely no notice of orders for the production of documents. Those opposite claim that the government is not taking seriously the requirement for accountability. That is not the case. The government has overhauled freedom of information legislation and is working to establish a mechanism to arbitrate on returns to orders.


This legislation is in the country's interest. These resources, these minerals and these metals are owned not by the mining compa­nies but by Australians—every Australian. We get one chance to ensure that we get a fair share, a fair return, from those resources. Australians are relying on this parliament to ensure we secure our future to ensure that Australians get the very best infrastructure, the very best incomes and the very best superannuation and help for the thousands of small businesses that operate so successfully in this country.

Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (12:56):  That was an inauspicious start for the new Manager of Government Business. He said that this debate is about the mining tax. I am sorry, Senator: this debate is about the procedures for debating these bills and about debating them in such a way that everyone can understand the parameters of the debate. I assume the Greens will be supporting us in this motion, which is about getting to this chamber before we debate these bills the information that this chamber has demanded of the government over the last 18 months. This is a chamber of the Parliament of Australia. We are supposedly, in a democracy, the representatives of the people in this chamber of the parliament who actually control what happens. This chamber has said to the government on a number of occasions over the past 18 months that there are certain documents and there is certain information in relation to the mining resource rent tax that it must give to the Senate so that the Senate can understand all of the parameters of these bills when it debates them.


In a direct negativing of the will of the Senate, the government has refused time and time again to present the information that the Senate has demanded. I say to the Greens party, who will I am sure be debating with us, although none of them has spoken on this contingent motion: I am sure you will support us, because in the past you have supported us and we have supported you when we have asked the government to provide this essential information. Indeed, your leader, Senator Bob Brown, said,


… the lack of information on the mining tax was ""increasingly unsatisfactory.


""The time is coming when the Senate is going to have to flex its muscle.


I am sure the Greens, having agreed with us that it is time that the Senate did seek to enforce the motions that have been passed by a majority of senators that the government should present this information, will join with us in making sure that, as Senator Bob Brown says, the Senate flexes its muscle and gets the government to comply with the legitimate requirements of the majority of senators. So, contrary to what the new Manager of Government Business has said—and I worry if that is the best he can do—this is not a debate about the mining tax bills. We are only too keen to get into those debates, but we do need the information. We want to know what the deal was that Ms Gillard and the three CEOs of the three major mining companies in Australia put together.


The Greens are often saying to us about these multinational mining companies that they are not even Australian. I just pause to say that when it came to the flood tax the Greens joined with the Labor Party in exempting those multinational companies from paying a tax which ordinary Austra­lians have had to pay.


There was a deal done by the CEOs of these three major international mining companies with the Prime Minister, and we do not know what was in that deal. Wouldn't it be relevant for the Parliament of Australia, before it debates these mining tax bills, to know what deal has been done by Ms Gillard and the three CEOs of the major mining companies with, I assume, Senator Brown's imprimatur? Perhaps we would have a better debate if we had that information and all of the other information which Senator Cormann has rightly asked the government to produce. The Greens have supported Senator Cormann in doing that, meaning that it is the Senate that has asked the govern­ment to produce this information so that it can properly, adequately, sensibly, honestly and openly deal with this.


Mr Acting Deputy President, you might remember that after the last election this government had a new paradigm of openness and accountability. Where is the openness and accountability when the government refuses to acknowledge the Senate's request for this further information?

Senator STERLE
 (Western Australia) (13:01):  I look forward to making my five minutes worth of contribution to this debate because I am trying to think of nice words I can use when I look at some of this lot on the other side. What a crock of codswallop. Let me make this very clear to the poor devils in the chamber who are listening to this rubbish and the misleading lies and deception coming from that side of the chamber. As a Western Australian I want to lay a few things on the table, because I sat and watched Senator Cormann when a minerals resource rent tax was first announced a couple of years ago. He was holding hands—not physically, as far as I could see, because I only saw a clip on the TV—with some of the poor miners from Western Australia. There was Ms Rinehart. I do not know what was bigger, her pearls or Senator Cormann's head. I take that back—the pearls were certainly just as big. He said, 'Axe the tax. These poor miners are going to go broke if they have to pay their bit.' But they only have to pay their bit once they have made a $50 million profit. If they have not made a $50 million profit, the minerals resource rent tax does not apply to them.


But then you have a cacophony of other misleading figures from Western Australia—




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order on relevance. This is a debate about why the government will not produce the informa­tion. It is not a debate about Ms Rinehart's pearls or the mining tax itself. It is about why the government will not provide this information that the Senate has asked for. Mr Acting Deputy President, I ask you to draw the senator to the debate before the chair.

(
Senator Marshall
):  Thank you, Senator Macdonald. You are right. The question before the chair is that standing orders be suspended. I refer you to that question, Senator Sterle.




Senator STERLE:
  I will take this opportunity to correct some untruths. It is all right for that side to tell blatant lies; that is what has been happening in this chamber. Nobody jumped up and pulled them into line. The truth and the facts are not being portrayed here.


I have to correct a statement I just made. I misled the Senate. I said it was a $50 million profit. I got confused. It is $75 million in profit. I apologise.


Let us get back to transparency. You lot on the other side are not transparent. You are far from being transparent. As I was saying, not only are they sticking up for the big end of town; they just do not want to see the big end of town pay their way because they could not wait to hold hands with another poor miner who is going to do it so tough in Andrew Forrest.


Let us talk about what is actually going on in this great country. The mining companies have recorded a quarterly profit of $24.6 billion and a record annual profit of $92.8 billion in the year to June 2011. While this lot are trying to portray that all these miners are going broke, the outlook for mining in Australia is very bright. The industry is investing no less than $82 billion this financ­ial year alone. There is a massive investment pipeline, no less than $430 billion, flowing through to the resources sector. In WA alone, I think it is about $211 billion.


Let us get back to what this tax is all about. Let us make it very clear what this tax is about. This is a tax on non-renewable commodities. This is a tax on our resources, the Australian country's resources—




Senator Boswell:
  I rise on a point of order, Mr Acting Deputy President. I put it to you that Senator Sterle is defying your order to stick to the question. You gave a very distinct and clear order. You recognised this side of the parliament when you accepted the point of order that Senator Sterle was not debating the relevant matters before the Senate. I ask you again to pull him into line and draw his attention to what the Senate is now debating.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  I remind all senators of the question before the chamber.




Senator STERLE:
  I still will take the opportunity to correct wrongs. There are untruths being spoken and blatant lies coming across from that side of the chamber that have to be corrected. These bills are in front of a committee now as we speak. No matter what the outcome of the committee hearings are, that side over there are beholden to the major billionaires in this country. They are the mouthpieces for people like Clive Palmer, Andrew Forrest and Gina Rinehart—these poor, poor billionaires who wonder how dare the government tax them and how dare the government actually say: 'You are digging up our non-renewable resources. You are making a very huge profit. There is nothing wrong with making a huge profit, but you have to pay your way, because once you've finished mining there are just holes left in our landscape.'


Let us get another mistruth corrected here. I heard Senator Johnston talking about Kalgoorlie. I was in Kalgoorlie not long ago, talking to goldminers who did not even know that the minerals resource rent tax does not even affect them. All they get on their two seconds worth of GWN or whatever televi­sion station they are watching in Kalgoorlie is Tony Abbott defending billionaires in this country and telling lies about how Australian mining jobs would go. These are the same miners who do not want to employ Austra­lian workers. How dare they? (Time expired)



The PRESIDENT:  The question is that the motion moved by Senator Cormann be agreed to.

"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2012-02-07,"



Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia) (12:36):  I seek leave to move a motion in the terms circulated in the chamber relating to the government's failure to comply with Senate orders on the mining tax package.


Leave not granted.




Senator CORMANN:
  Pursuant to contingent motion and at the request of the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Senator Abetz, I move:


That so much of the standing orders be suspended as would prevent Senator Abetz moving a motion to provide for the consideration of a matter, namely a motion to give precedence to a motion relating to the Government's failure to comply with the order of the Senate for the production of documents concerning the Mineral Resource Rent Tax.


I agree with Senator Bob Brown and the Greens. The coalition agrees with Senator Bob Brown and the Greens that the govern­ment's secrecy and its refusal to provide information about the mining tax—in particular, about the mining tax revenue assumptions and the cost of associated measures—is unsatisfactory and that it is time for the Senate to flex its muscle. The Gillard government is treating the Senate with absolute contempt.


The coalition view, and this is where we part company with the Greens, is that the mining tax is a bad tax which came out of a bad process. It is a tax which was negotiated exclusively and in secret between the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and the Minister for Resources and Energy and the managing directors of the three biggest mining companies in Australia, excluding from that process all of their competitors and all state and territory governments. It is a tax which gives the three companies who had privile­ged access to that negotiation an unfair competitive advantage. We were promised root-and-branch tax reform which would make our tax system simpler and fairer—what the government has delivered is manifestly more complex and less fair.


There are serious question marks around the mining tax revenue estimates. They have been jumping around. Every couple of months the mining tax revenue estimates go up or down. There are serious question marks as to whether the mining tax would actually raise what the government says it would—the reason being that, in the way the mining tax has been designed by the government, it gives a significant up-front tax deduction to the three biggest mining companies, a tax deduction that is not available to most of their competitors.


There are also serious question marks around the interaction between state royalty arrangements for iron ore and coal product­ion and the federal minerals resource rent tax. It is absolutely obvious that Prime Minister Gillard and Treasurer Swan have something to hide, because order of the Senate after order of the Senate requiring the release by the government of information about how they calculated the mining tax revenue estimates has not been complied with.


Then we have all of the promises that Labor have attached to their mining tax. Even if you look at it at a high level, it is obvious that the spending commitments that the Labor Party have attached to the mining tax are far greater than even what the government suggest would be raised in revenue through the mining tax. Only the Labor Party could come up with a new multibillion-dollar tax which would have huge ramifications for the most successful industry in our economy right now, huge ramifications for Australia as an investment destination and huge ramifications for jobs, and would actually leave the budget worse off.


It is no wonder the government has been bending over backwards to refuse to provide that information to the Senate. We have a job to do. We, as the Senate of Australia, have a job to do—to scrutinise government legisla­tion and to expose the flaws in bad government legislation. When we ask for information from the government, in order to do our job, the government should provide that information unless they have a very good excuse not to.


This is where I agree with Senator Bob Brown and the Greens. The government's conduct when it comes to Senate requests for information in relation to the mining tax has been unsatisfactory. Those are his words, but they could have come from me. It is time that the Senate flexed its muscle in the context of a government that is being inappropriately secretive. The only leverage the Senate has in the face of a government that is secretive and is refusing to provide the information that we have legitimately asked for is to refuse to deal with legislation until such time as the government has complied. That is why I recommend to the Senate a motion which would see the deferral of these MRRT related bills and the further listing of these bills as an order of the day until such time as the Senate agrees that the govern­ment has complied with its relevant outstanding orders for information.

"Fifield, Sen Mitch",LP,2012-02-07,"



Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate) (12:42):  On this side of the chamber we take very seriously the Senate's role as a place of scrutiny and as a place of accountability. I think all in this chamber have a sneaking suspicion that on occasion we are the first people in this building to actually look closely at legislation, that perhaps they do not always do so over in the other place. That is just a sneaking suspicion, but we do have an important role to play here.


I remember listening to Labor senators during the years of the Howard government saying how committed they were to appro­priate scrutiny, how committed they were to evidence based policy, how outrage­ous the then government was and how, when they won office, they were going to usher in a glorious new period of sunlight in public administration. In fact, they have a policy called Operation Sunlight in the Department of Finance and Deregulation—such is their commitment to openness and transparency, to airing all things which should be considered in the development of public policy.


So, quite frankly, I was a little shocked when the Labor Party formed government that this approach did not come to pass. We saw that with the carbon tax, one of the most outrageous examples of the denial of the rights and duties of this chamber. This place was denied the opportunity to set up Senate committees to examine that legislation—putting to one side, of course, the fib, the bald faced lie, to the Australian people that there would be no carbon tax. Even in the face of that, this chamber was denied the opportunity for scrutiny.


We are seeing that again here today with this package of legislation. Senator Cormann, who has done a very comprehen­sive job in looking at this legislation through various committees over many, many months, is quite right to seek a suspension of standing orders in order to move his motion. His motion is merely calling upon the government to do that which the Senate has already directed it to do—that is, to provide information that goes to the heart of policy formation and to the heart of the actual, real-world impact of this legislation.


The Senate has already passed orders requesting that information and the govern­ment have not complied. So we on this side of the chamber are at a great disad­vantage in being able to fully examine this legislation and its implications. I think it is very reason­able of the opposition to seek that the Senate suspend standing orders so that a motion can be put to this chamber that there be no further consideration of this legislation until the previous Senate orders have been complied with. 


We have heard a great deal from the Australian Greens about the need for sun­light on the development of public policy, on the need for integrity and on the need for evidence based policy. This suspension motion should provide an opportunity for them to follow through on their fine words in actions. I hope they do. There is a pattern developing with this government where, despite their claim of the importance of evidence based policy and despite paying lip service to the role of this chamber as a place of scrutiny and accountability, they do not. We saw that the with the NBN—the worst example of non-evidence based policy you have ever seen. It was drafted between Mr Conroy and then Prime Minister Rudd on the back of an envelope whilst on a VIP flight. We saw it with the carbon tax. We saw it with the BER. There was no evidence based policy there. We saw it with the roofing insulation policy. There was no evidence base for that policy. We do not want to see that happen again. We need that information. We want that information. The Senate is entitled to have that information. The Senate has ordered the government to deliver that information and they should do so. 


We will canvass at great length in the debate on the legislation itself how complex, how unfair and how fiscally irresponsible this package of legislation is. But we have before us at the moment a very simple matter—that is, the Senate should suspend standing orders so that Senator Cormann can move his motion to defer further considera­tion of this legislation until the government complies with the Senate order.

"Johnston, Sen David",LP,2012-02-07,"



Senator JOHNSTON
 (Western Australia) (12:47):  The very least this parliament is entitled to is to know upon what assumptions this vast array of legisla­tion attacking our most successful industry is based, whether the revenue is positive, negative or neutral. This government refuses to disclose the most fundamental and basic responsible information to this legislature. 


The genesis of this tax comes, as we know, in the $900 given to all and sundry—the school halls, the pink batts. It is the drunken-sailor approach to fiscal responsi­bility. What happened? The government ran out of money. So the former Prime Minister devised the superprofits mining tax. Our biggest export earners—coal, iron ore and LNG—were attacked because they were the most profitable. This is an industry that pays very high remuneration to ordinary and unskilled workers. It is the biggest employer of Indigenous people throughout Australia. It is the biggest regional developer. Kalgoorlie, Esperance, Geraldton, Port Hedland, Karra­tha, Tom Price, Paraburdoo: these are all names of places that generate vast amounts of revenue and wealth. Members opposite do not even know those names; they do not even relate to them. They have never heard of them before. 


There is all this bungled incompetence from those opposite. They had to ask the Western Australian Premier on the phone: 'How do we do this? How do we do a mining resources rent tax? And can you tell us, by the way, what state royalties are and who owns the minerals?' The minerals are owned by the Crown in the right of Western Austra­lia. This is a tax on Western Australia. The incompetence was met by further incompe­tence by saying to BHP and Rio: 'How shall we tax you? How shall we take money off you?' They were told things that now mean that this tax is going to cost the taxpayer money. They have had to rewrite this legisla­tion at least four times. They have had secret deals with the Independents and the Greens. Everything that is relevant to this legislature has been kept secret; it has been kept from this legislature. This incompetent govern­ment has no idea what it is doing to our best industry. The reality is that it simply refuses to tell the parliament what is going on. 


The mining industry in Australia is facing hot competition from Brazil, Colombia, Mongolia and Mozambique in coal and iron ore. All mining is capital intensive. Forty-two per cent of iron ore productivity costs are capital. cost. Forty-three per cent of coal costs are capital. What have those opposite done to the magnetite industry, our potential­ly best, blossoming, young mining industry? They have extinguished the investment in that industry and the good jobs that go with that, including the Indigenous employment, in one fell swoop. This govern­ment has put its foot upon the hose of hundreds of billions of dollars in investment and jobs. It will not disclose the basic assumptions and the modelling upon which this tax is based—the estimates and the costings. 


This government is an incompetent, scandalous disgrace, taxing Queensland and Western Australia to pay for its pink-batts fiasco and its drunken-sailor fiscal manage­ment. That is what is happening here. Those opposite sit over there wringing their hands, saying, 'I hope nobody is listening to this, because we are as guilty as sin.' They have no idea what they are doing. 'Please, Mr Barnett, could you explain the royalty system in Western Australia to us? Please tell us how it works, because we have no idea. We do not understand mining. We all come from Sydney and Melbourne. Please tell us how we can tax your state out of existence, because we have spent everything we have ever found in the Treasury.'

"Arbib, Sen Mark",ALP,2012-02-07,"



Senator ARBIB
 (New South Wales—Assistant Treasurer, Minister for Small Business, Minister for Sport and Manager of Government Business in the Senate) (12:51):  I think all senators on this side of the chamber and all Australians hoped that, after the break, coalition senators would come back with a different attitude to their jobs, because over the past 12 months all we have heard is no. All we have heard is no to every reform the Labor government has tried to put in place to secure the future of Australia, to help families and to make this country a better place to live in. That is exactly what this legislation is about. It is about ensuring that Australians get a fair share, a fair deal and a fair return from the mining boom. We know that the coalition did very little with the first mining boom. In fact, during that period of rapid growth of the mining sector investment in education went down, invest­ment in health went down and investment in infrastructure was static. This Labor govern­ment wants to ensure that Australians get the benefits of this mining boom. The big beneficiaries of the MRRT will be workers, who will get a superannuation increase from nine per cent to 12 per cent. The big beneficiaries will be small businesses, which will get a $6,500 accelerated depreciation asset allowance on the assets they purchase. The big winners will be the people of Australia, who will see greater funds going into infrastructure, which will increase the productivity of this nation. That is what this debate is about.


Today we are again seeing an attempt by coalition senators to defer these bills and to continually debate these bills to ensure that we run out of time to implement the legislation and ensure that Australia benefits. We saw this time and time again last year, when every day the coalition would take up as much time as possible, introducing MPIs and speaking on most procedural matters, often with virtually open-ended debates. That means there was less time for the chamber's vital legislative review functions. Instead, committees have been working flat out to cover all issues in their hearings. The government is also providing extensive briefings to parties on legislation. These bills are currently before the Senate economics committee. Most of the work of examining the bills is taking place in that committee now. Senator Cormann and Senator Fifield are pursuing a quite deliberate strategy. They know that their approach to chamber management forces our hand at the end of sittings and means that the government must consider gagging or guillotining debates. That is not something we wish to do. That is not a strategy that Labor senators wish to pursue, but it is a policy that coalition senators are forcing us to follow.


On the issue of the point of the Information Commissioner, I can assure the Senate that the government is continuing to talk to parties who are genuinely interested in developing a mechanism to arbitrate over orders for the production of documents. This contrasts with those opposite, who, when they were in government, took absolutely no notice of orders for the production of documents. Those opposite claim that the government is not taking seriously the requirement for accountability. That is not the case. The government has overhauled freedom of information legislation and is working to establish a mechanism to arbitrate on returns to orders.


This legislation is in the country's interest. These resources, these minerals and these metals are owned not by the mining compa­nies but by Australians—every Australian. We get one chance to ensure that we get a fair share, a fair return, from those resources. Australians are relying on this parliament to ensure we secure our future to ensure that Australians get the very best infrastructure, the very best incomes and the very best superannuation and help for the thousands of small businesses that operate so successfully in this country.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2012-02-07,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (12:56):  That was an inauspicious start for the new Manager of Government Business. He said that this debate is about the mining tax. I am sorry, Senator: this debate is about the procedures for debating these bills and about debating them in such a way that everyone can understand the parameters of the debate. I assume the Greens will be supporting us in this motion, which is about getting to this chamber before we debate these bills the information that this chamber has demanded of the government over the last 18 months. This is a chamber of the Parliament of Australia. We are supposedly, in a democracy, the representatives of the people in this chamber of the parliament who actually control what happens. This chamber has said to the government on a number of occasions over the past 18 months that there are certain documents and there is certain information in relation to the mining resource rent tax that it must give to the Senate so that the Senate can understand all of the parameters of these bills when it debates them.


In a direct negativing of the will of the Senate, the government has refused time and time again to present the information that the Senate has demanded. I say to the Greens party, who will I am sure be debating with us, although none of them has spoken on this contingent motion: I am sure you will support us, because in the past you have supported us and we have supported you when we have asked the government to provide this essential information. Indeed, your leader, Senator Bob Brown, said,


… the lack of information on the mining tax was ""increasingly unsatisfactory.


""The time is coming when the Senate is going to have to flex its muscle.


I am sure the Greens, having agreed with us that it is time that the Senate did seek to enforce the motions that have been passed by a majority of senators that the government should present this information, will join with us in making sure that, as Senator Bob Brown says, the Senate flexes its muscle and gets the government to comply with the legitimate requirements of the majority of senators. So, contrary to what the new Manager of Government Business has said—and I worry if that is the best he can do—this is not a debate about the mining tax bills. We are only too keen to get into those debates, but we do need the information. We want to know what the deal was that Ms Gillard and the three CEOs of the three major mining companies in Australia put together.


The Greens are often saying to us about these multinational mining companies that they are not even Australian. I just pause to say that when it came to the flood tax the Greens joined with the Labor Party in exempting those multinational companies from paying a tax which ordinary Austra­lians have had to pay.


There was a deal done by the CEOs of these three major international mining companies with the Prime Minister, and we do not know what was in that deal. Wouldn't it be relevant for the Parliament of Australia, before it debates these mining tax bills, to know what deal has been done by Ms Gillard and the three CEOs of the major mining companies with, I assume, Senator Brown's imprimatur? Perhaps we would have a better debate if we had that information and all of the other information which Senator Cormann has rightly asked the government to produce. The Greens have supported Senator Cormann in doing that, meaning that it is the Senate that has asked the govern­ment to produce this information so that it can properly, adequately, sensibly, honestly and openly deal with this.


Mr Acting Deputy President, you might remember that after the last election this government had a new paradigm of openness and accountability. Where is the openness and accountability when the government refuses to acknowledge the Senate's request for this further information?

Senator STERLE
 (Western Australia) (13:01):  I look forward to making my five minutes worth of contribution to this debate because I am trying to think of nice words I can use when I look at some of this lot on the other side. What a crock of codswallop. Let me make this very clear to the poor devils in the chamber who are listening to this rubbish and the misleading lies and deception coming from that side of the chamber. As a Western Australian I want to lay a few things on the table, because I sat and watched Senator Cormann when a minerals resource rent tax was first announced a couple of years ago. He was holding hands—not physically, as far as I could see, because I only saw a clip on the TV—with some of the poor miners from Western Australia. There was Ms Rinehart. I do not know what was bigger, her pearls or Senator Cormann's head. I take that back—the pearls were certainly just as big. He said, 'Axe the tax. These poor miners are going to go broke if they have to pay their bit.' But they only have to pay their bit once they have made a $50 million profit. If they have not made a $50 million profit, the minerals resource rent tax does not apply to them.


But then you have a cacophony of other misleading figures from Western Australia—




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order on relevance. This is a debate about why the government will not produce the informa­tion. It is not a debate about Ms Rinehart's pearls or the mining tax itself. It is about why the government will not provide this information that the Senate has asked for. Mr Acting Deputy President, I ask you to draw the senator to the debate before the chair.

"Fierravanti-Wells, Sen Concetta",LP,2012-02-07,"



Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS
 (New South Wales) (13:15):  I continue my remarks from the last occasion on which we debated the Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Amendment Bill 2010. The coalition believes that preventative health should be on the national agenda. Treating people with chronic preventable diseases leads to substantial economic and social costs and is a significant burden on Australia's healthcare system, a system that is already under considerable pressure—the social costs of which are estimated to be $31.5 billion each year. Approximately 32 per cent of Austra­lia's burden of disease is attributable to modifiable risk factors, and tobacco smoking is one of the leading causes of preventable chronic disease amongst Australians. In 2004-05 this came at a tangible net cost of $12 billion to our economy. For every 1,000 smokers who quit at least 40 will be spared a diagnosis of chronic illness.


The Australian tobacco industry does not oppose this bill. There is a general consensus that it will remove the ambiguity which currently exists with regard to how the provisions of the act apply to the advertising of tobacco on the internet. The Australian tobacco industry is pleased to see that more effort is being made to ensure tax evasion is minimised. The internet sale of tobacco products is more prone to tax evasion. These companies also approve of measures that assist in combating counterfeit products.


The major manufacturers of tobacco products believe that they are already taking the necessary action in this space. Internet service providers are, however, of the view that the enforceability and practicability of this bill will be an issue. Health stakeholders are supportive of tighter regulations for tobacco. The coalition are supporting the passage of this legislation because we recognise that there is more to be done in the area of preventative health. The challenge will be to ensure that we still leave people with the choice and we do not become a nanny-state bureaucracy.


It is informative to look at key milestones in tobacco control and some statistics from the Cancer Council of Victoria for the period 1980 to 2007, when the federal bans on tobacco sponsorship of sport and arts was introduced. At that stage approximately 25 per cent of males smoked and 18 per cent of females smoked. These figures went down to 16.4 per cent and 13.9 per cent respectively.


Of course, the internet today plays a very important role, particularly for our young people. The Australian Bureau of Statistics 1989-90 and 2007-08 national health surveys found some interesting statistics. They found:


People in their teens may take up smoking as part of a social activity that is perceived to be well suited to their youth culture and allows them to better fit in with or rebel against friends or family.


People who started smoking daily at a younger age were less likely than others to have reduced their frequency of smoking or to have kicked the habit altogether at the time of interview.


They also state:


Of people who had ever smoked daily, 61% first took up the habit on a daily basis when aged 15-19 years. About one in five (18%) of those who had ever smoked daily had first started doing so under the age of 15 years. 


Of people aged 25-54, those who first started smoking daily as a child aged under 15 years were more likely to have also been a daily smoker at the time of interview (55%) than those who first started at an older age (46%).


In terms of the internet, statistics from the Australian Bureau of Statistics show:


In 2009, two in five children (42%) who used the internet at home reported that they spent two hours or less online at home per week, while 17% spent 3-4 hours online, 21% spent 5-9 hours online and 13% spent 10-19 hours online.


Therefore, this legislation is very important because it makes it an offence to advertise tobacco products on the internet and in other electronic media. The restriction on Austra­lian internet advertising of tobacco products goes some way to targeting smoking and its harmful effects. There is a lack of clarity over regulations governing advertising on the internet, and this legislation will align tobacco advertising in the electronic media with restrictions in other media and at other retail points of sale.


I will refer to some comments that were made by then Minister Roxon in reply when this matter was dealt with in the other place. At the time, while she welcomed the com­ments made by the relevant shadow minister, the member for Boothby, Dr Southcott, in relation to our support for this legislation, she just could not help herself in having a go at the Liberal Party in relation to her allegation of 'breaking our expensive habit with big tobacco' and then she went on to list the donations that the Liberal Party had received from 'big tobacco', as she put it. She said that there was a big chunk of money which was going to the Liberal Party 'and we are concerned this may have an impact.' What hypocrisy! One of the lasting memories that we will have of Minister Roxon will be the sheer hypocrisy with which she dealt with this tobacco issue. When we dealt with tobacco legislation last year, I canvassed this issue. I take the Senate back to 15 June 2011, when tobacco legislation was before the House of Representatives. Minister Roxon did not even front up. Why didn't she front up? She was very embarrassed. There she was, at every opportunity having a go at the Liberal Party for their supposedly cosy deals with big tobacco, when she was in there herself—she herself was seeking donations from big tobacco. On 15 June last year, when this legislation was up for debate in the lower House, she did not even front the Main Committee in order to allow the coalition to ask her questions or herself come clean about her cosy relationship with big tobacco. She was running and hiding. That would have been an opportune time for then Minister Roxon to put on the record her relationship with big tobacco, but she was embarrassed. She had obviously and continually misled the Australian public by publicly saying one thing while privately taking another course of action entirely: she was seeking donations from tobacco companies. On the one hand—the hypocrisy of it all!—she was having a go at the coalition because we were supposedly taking donations from big tobacco, while on the other hand she was privately writing to tobacco company executives seeking their financial support. It was really irresponsible of Minister Roxon at the time not to turn up in the House, but then we have seen this irresponsibility time and time again.


What is Minister Roxon's legacy? For the answer, one only has to look at comments made by former Labor member of the House of Representatives Barry Cohen on 5 December last year, the headline of which was 'ALP must rediscover the core value of healthcare'. Why wouldn't you be critical of Labor's record on health? On 22 November 2011, Nicola Roxon fronted up to the National Press Club with a speech, the title of which was 'Why policy and politics matter to patients'. But her record as health minister was merely a litany of failed policy and petty politics, with patients as little more than the props for Labor's so-called health reform saga.


I take you back to early 2010, when Kevin Rudd himself was standing before the National Press Club detailing what was then described as Labor's 'radical, historic' health reform plan—the much lauded National Health and Hospitals Network. But time has definitely shown that the Rudd-Roxon policy proposals have absolutely turned to dust. Like most things that this government does, they were about spin and not substance; politics, not the patients.


Minister Roxon left a legacy of many unanswered questions. It is little wonder that Prime Minister Gillard has now moved her on to another portfolio, because she did more damage than good, and I am sure that patients will not remember her very fondly. She has left so many questions unanswered. She made exaggerated and unfounded claims about the Gillard government's now so-called historic reforms in health. I take the Senate back to 2007. Remember Kevin Rudd? Yes, you are all remembering him now. In 2007, there was the promise to fix hospitals and end the blame game. During her time as health minister, the question that former Minister Roxon should have been asking was, 'What is the difference between today and 2007?' The answer is that there is very little—very little has changed.


The agreement that Prime Minister Gillard signed with the states in August last year says:


This Agreement


…   …   …


recognises that:


… the States are the system managers of the public hospital system …


Where does that leave the promise that Kevin Rudd made in 2007 by which the Commonwealth was to be the majority funder of hospitals and to fix them or, if they were not fixed, to take them over? How fixed are our public hospitals? It turns out that this was another broken promise—a combined broken promise not just by then Prime Minister Kevin Rudd but also by now Prime Minister Gillard. Where exactly are:


… the most significant—


reforms—


of Australia's health and hospital system since the introduction of Medicare almost three decades ago—


which Kevin Rudd promised at the National Press Club in March 2010? Minister Roxon prattled on at the National Press Club about the new bureaucracies that Labor was creating in the interests of real reform, but how much from those new bureaucracies with their layers of additional reporting is going to translate into new beds for state public hospital systems? Very little—as we have seen in New South Wales, there has been very little change.


Other aspects of health have also been a debacle. The government is trying to shut down the Medicare Chronic Disease Dental Scheme. With its ill-considered rebate systems, this government is hell-bent on inflicting damage on the private health insur­ance system. In my own shadow portfolio of mental health, the mental health plans announced last year actually take money out of mental health treatment, and we have seen the impact that that has had on patients. It is yet another instance of backflipping. Minister Roxon was backflipping then by making a decision to cut Medicare rebates for occupational therapists and social workers dealing with vulnerable mental health patients. Of course, now the Minister for Mental Health and Ageing, Mr Butler, has had to go down the same route and undertake a backflip. Why? Because what­ever this government has touched in health has turned to custard. If it had not spent and wasted so much money on pink bats and the Julia Gillard memorial halls, it would have the money. It would not have had to go down this route to close Medicare access points, to cut better access and to make a whole lot of other cuts in health.

"Di Natale, Sen Richard",AG,2012-02-07,"



Senator DI NATALE
 (Victoria) (13:30):  I make some remarks on behalf of the Australian Greens. The Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Amendment Bill 2010 is very easy to support. Before coming to this place, as I have said before, I worked in general practice and I saw firsthand the terrible effects that smoking has on the lives of people and their families. In this country one in six Australians still smoke and their individual stories add up to both an enormous cost in the misery inflicted upon themselves and others and an enormous economic cost. The costs from smoking are estimated at over $31 billion each year. We should put that in some sort of perspective. I will say that number again: $31 billion each year is the cost associated with tobacco smoking. That is about 50 per cent more than the entire defence budget and it is about half of what we spend on the total health budget. For the many thousands of Australians who have experienced firsthand the death of a mother, a father, a spouse or, tragically, a child, these numbers have very, very real meaning. If there is anything we as a nation can do to reduce the toll from tobacco consumption, to improve the health of the general community, then we should do it. 


This bill is part of a much wider range of measures that have been implemented in an attempt to reduce tobacco consumption. The passage of the government's plain-packaging legislation last year was a significant milestone and a world-leading reform. The government is to be congratulated for implementing that reform. It is an initiative that over the long term will save lives. 


We have also learned that the tobacco industry will stop at nothing to prevent reform. They do not want this reform or other reforms unfolding because they fear not just what those reforms might do in this nation but also what they might do in other nations. That is particularly a problem when their current business model is predicated on encouraging people to smoke in those least developed nations. Already Philip Morris has challenged the plain-packaging law under investor provisions of a bilateral trade treaty between Australia and Hong Kong. As we enter into further negotiations—the multilat­eral treaty currently being negotiated bet­ween the nations of the Pacific in the form of a trans-Pacific partnership—we need to be very careful we do not give another toehold to big tobacco to challenge these incredibly important reforms.


Addressing tobacco is just one part of what the Greens believe is an important preventative health agenda. Yes, we agree that Australia does need more health profess­ionals, it needs hospitals that work efficiently and that we deserve access to the latest medicines, and we need them to remain healthy, but there are much bigger gains to be made in keeping people from becoming unwell in the first place. We have said that on many occasions and it is critical that we continue working on that preventa­tive health agenda. There is work to be done, for example, on the issue of obesity: making sure we address food labelling—we are concerned that not enough is being done in that area; ending the advertising of junk food to young kids; and promoting active lifestyles. In the area of alcohol, for example, we need to ensure that we get a much more rational and public health focused system that addresses the pricing regime around alcohol and getting better labelling—all very important. But smoking remains the No. 1 preventable cause of disease in this nation and any agenda focused on preventative health cannot afford to ignore it.


The bill updates the laws surrounding the advertising of cigarettes and it ensures that the internet will not be a loophole that tobacco manufacturers and retailers can use to advertise their wares and to lure potential new customers. It makes it very clear that the existing bans on tobacco advertising apply to new media as well as traditional forms. It means that the internet, social media and mobile phones will now be off limits to tobacco advertisers. Regulations stemming from the bill will control how online tobacco merchants can present their wares. It will include how they describe the product; it will specify when and how images can be used, if at all; and it will ensure that health warnings are prominently displayed. However, the bill does not outlaw the sale of cigarettes online and grocery stores and other retailers will still be able to sell online what they can sell in their physical stores. We are concerned about this aspect of the legislation because it is crucial that mechanisms exist to ensure that products, particularly dangerous products like tobacco, are only ordered by and delivered to adults. We have got to keep a very close eye on this component of the legislation. We have to make sure it is effectively administered and we look forward to seeing very tough regulations on this aspect of the bill being rigorously enforced. The bill is also very timely. We know that online commerce is exploding and we know that online tobacco retailing is an area of certain future growth in tobacco retailing. More young people spend time online. They spend very long periods of time when they go online. Tobacco is easier for minors to access on the internet because they remain unseen by the vendors and there is no identification required. So if this bill restricts the ability of current and future online merchants to recruit or sell to young customers as well as existing smokers then the public health benefits from that are all the greater.


We know that marketing and advertising is very powerful. It impacts on consumer behaviour—on the behaviour of all of us. We are often reluctant to acknowledge just how powerful it is, but there is a lot of money spent on advertising and marketing because it works. So further tightening of the restrictions around advertising of dangerous products like tobacco is good public policy.


Unfortunately, the tobacco industry in this country still has a lot of clout. I am very pleased to say that the Australian Greens do not accept donations from big tobacco, or indeed from any tobacco. I am also pleased that the Labor Party—although a little later than many of us would have liked—stopped accepting donations from big tobacco in 2004. It is something the Liberal and National parties should have done a long time ago, yet they continue to accept hundreds of thousands of dollars in tobacco industry donations. They remain hopelessly compromised on this issue. It is a little rich to hear Senator Fierravanti-Wells talk about hypocrisy in this area of public policy when she is part of a political party which continues to benefit from the largesse of an industry that kills people.


On 15 June, the leader of the Australian Greens introduced the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment (Tobacco Industry Donations) Bill 2011 in the Senate to seek an end to big tobacco's buying influence in the parliament. It is a bill that should not be necessary. There will be a time at some point in the future, I am sure, when all sides of politics refuse to accept donations from big tobacco. I am sure there will be people who come after us—people on all sides—who will look back on a time when political parties were accepting those donations and wonder about the morality of that decision.


There is a lot more to be done. As we speak, the Future Fund—a fund that exists to pay for the unfunded superannuation liabilities of Australians; a fund in which ordinary Australian taxpayers contribute—invests in the tobacco industry. It invests $36.5 million in Philip Morris, $46.4 million in British American Tobacco and $26.1 million in Lorillard, and it has a number of other tobacco investments. As a nation we cannot reconcile this large investment of public money in companies that profit from damaging the health of Australians at the same time as we implement important, sensible and—in the case of plain packag­ing—courageous reforms that cut in the opposite direction. It makes no sense, and the sooner the Australian government divests itself of holdings in the Future Fund, the better off we will be. That is why the Greens have introduced the Government Investment Funds Amendment (Ethical Investments) Bill, which would force the Future Fund and other government funds to divest themselves of their holdings in tobacco companies. It is something that other nations have done. Ordinary Australians are horrified to learn that their hard-earned money is contributing to this industry. 


Finally, the Australian government is a signatory to the World Health Organisation Framework Convention on Tobacco Control. That framework calls on all of us to restrict tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship on radio, television, print media and other media, such as the internet. This bill is in line with our fulfilling our obligations under this treaty. At a time when international obligations seem to mean very little and we are prepared to flout our obligations under international law, it is pleasing to see, again, that the government has taken this issue on and is doing something that is entirely consistent with the World Health Organisation Framework Convention on Tobacco Control.


Ordinary public opinion is firmly in favour of this bill. Major public health advocates approve of this bill and are grateful to see this reform before the parliament. The bill will go a long way to improve the health of ordinary Australians. But this bill is not the end of the road in the fight against the harms associated with tobacco. There is more to be done. I know the government is intent on doing it and I commend it for its work in this area. It is an important step in the road towards a nation where fewer people are dying from smoking related diseases. It is an important step and for that reason the Greens are very pleased to be able to support it.

"Urquhart, Sen Anne",ALP,2012-02-07,"



Senator URQUHART
 (Tasmania) (13:43):  I rise to speak in support of the Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Amend­ment Bill 2010. It is a bill that will remove an ambiguity in current legislation that allows advertisements for tobacco products on the internet and in other electronic media. This brings electronic means of advertising, whether on the internet or by mobile phone, in line with restrictions already in place for other mediums. Tobacco smoking remains one of the leading causes of preventable deaths and disease amongst Australians. Smoking kills over 15,000 Australians every year and costs our nation over $31 billion each year. 


Australia has much to be proud of in this area. Sustained and coordinated actions from the Australian government and state govern­ments have seen smoking rates cut in half over the past 30 years. Now only about 15 per cent of Australians smoke daily. I am pleased that all levels of government have committed to reduce the harm caused by tobacco and aim to lower smoking rates to 10 per cent by 2018. This is a commitment not only to give Australians support in kicking the habit but, importantly, to seek to prevent Australians from taking up the smoking of tobacco in the first place. The bill will make it a specific offence to advertise or promote tobacco products on the internet and all other electronic media and future technologies unless compliant with state or territory legislation or Common­wealth regulations. Consider that, in 2009, 79 per cent of young Australians were regularly accessing the internet. That is four in five young Australians having regular acc­ess to a medium where there are no controls and no regulations over the advertising of tobacco products. This exposure, which I am told includes the glamorising of tobacco products in a manner that makes them subconsciously appealing to young people, could lead to a 'curious puff' in the playground and a terrible addiction. If we can limit this exposure and the perceived normality of tobacco smoking, we will limit the damage done to young Australians.


In 2010, approximately four per cent of teenagers smoked tobacco—that is, one in 25 children, or at least one child in each high school classroom across this country, regularly smoked tobacco. People who start smoking when they are young are more likely to smoke heavily, to become more dependent on nicotine and to be at increased risk of smoking related illness or death. And more people tend to smoke in the lower socioeconomic regions of the country, such as parts of my home state of Tasmania. In the 2010 National Drug Strategy Household Survey, Tasmania was one of two states to record a statistically significant decrease in the proportion of daily smokers over the period from 2007 to 2010. The rate was down over 6.5 per cent—from 22.4 per cent of Tasmanians to 15.9 per cent. This is the first time in 10 years that Tasmania has recorded a decline in the proportion of people smoking daily.


There is still much work to be done, though, as unfortunately there are some worrying statistics in this report for Tasmania. The proportion of daily smokers, while down on 2007, is the third worst amongst the states and territories. More than 500 Tasmanians die each year as a result of smoking. Alarmingly, over 25 per cent of those aged between 20 and 29 smoke daily—the second worst rate in the nation, only marginally behind the Northern Territory and a lot higher than the national average. These people grew up during the 1990s, after the act was legislated. Tobacco advertising and sponsorship was being seriously wound back in Australian society when they were child­ren. Also, these people become adults after it became mandatory for graphic health warn­ings to be displayed on cigarette boxes. This figure is down from a constant rate of about a third of this age group throughout the 1990s and 2000s, which is a positive thing.


The measures the Australian and Tasman­ian governments have put in place are working. However, we must continue to make positive reforms and invest in positive programs to see this rate decrease further. Alarmingly, a large number of Tasmanian women—around 24 per cent—continue to smoke during pregnancy. This is a major concern not only because of the impact on the health and wellbeing of these women but also because of the impact on babies and small children.


This bill is part of the Gillard Labor government's comprehensive anti-smoking action package, headlined by the mandatory plain packing of tobacco products, which passed the parliament last year and comes into effect later this year. This is the latest package in a 40-year effort to inform Austra­lians about the harms of tobacco smoking. Reforms to tobacco advertising started in 1973 with the banning of tobacco advertising on television and radio and the introduction of mandatory health warnings on cigarette packets. And then in 1989 tobacco adverti­sing was banned from newspapers and magazines.


The Keating government introduced the Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Act in 1992, which sought to ban tobacco advertis­ing in this country. The act makes it an offence to give publicity to, or promote, tobacco products but is not clear in its application to internet and mobile phone advertising of tobacco products. Since 1992 the use of the internet and other electronic means of advertising has increased. There is not much point in regulating other forms of advertising while allowing tobacco to be advertised on the internet and mobile phones without regulation. This unregulated loop­hole also undermines the effectiveness of the rest of the act and fosters the false perception that smoking is the norm.


Several Australian websites sell cigarettes, while there are many where advertising is prevalent. These retail sites often do not post health warnings, nor do they comply with state and territory based legislation around point-of-sale advertising. I have come across Australian websites that offer large discounts on boxes of cigarettes. On these websites all of the packets are neatly presented; but there are no health warnings, let alone graphic health warnings, to be seen. It is not until you try to purchase a box that the 'not for sale to Australian residents' notice appears. These websites export Australian-made ciga­rettes across the globe. But the glamorous advertising is the damager here, and ending it is the crux of this bill.


My concern with these websites is the ambivalent manner in which the health effects of tobacco smoking are treated; the advertised labels are a throwback to the 1960s, when no health warnings were displa­yed at all. As these shops are on the internet and currently not covered by the act, they do not have to show the appropriate graphic health warnings and they are able to show the packets in all their glory. This legislation will remove this loophole.


A content analysis study of pro-tobacco websites revealed that only 11 per cent of the sites contained health warnings. The pro-tobacco sites frequently associated smoking as glamorous, with images of attractive young males and females. This raises concern that young people, who may not have seen a cigarette packet before, will stumble across these websites and interpret the pictures as the norm. They may not understand the effects of tobacco smoking. We must provide them with the same amount of protection from tobacco advertising as is provided through other mediums.


People do not need to smoke many cigarettes to become addicted to smoking. Young people can be at risk of becoming addicted to smoking even if they only smoke occasionally, such as at parties or on holi­days. Tobacco smoking is the single most preventable cause of ill health and death in Australia, contributing to more drug related hospitalisations and deaths than alcohol and illicit drug use combined. Diseases such as lung cancer and heart disease tend to occur in people who have smoked tobacco for a number of years. However, there are immediate and obvious effects from smoking just one cigarette. If a person has not smoked for 12 hours and then has a cigarette, the following things may happen: carbon monoxide levels in the lungs increase, vision and perception are impaired, coordination slows and the risk of an accident increases. Nicotine from tobacco smoke reaches the brain and muscle tissue soon after being inhaled. When nicotine is present, a number of things occur: the heart rate increases, blood pressure increases, skin temperature lowers, hands tremble, stomach secretions increase and brain activity spasms.


Tobacco smoke increases resistance in the airways leading to the lungs and reduces lung capacity. This is why most smokers have heavy coughs and often struggle to walk up a small hill. Tobacco smoking is a leading cause of emphysema and chronic bronchitis. Emphysema, or lung rot, is a degenerative disease of the lung tissue. It destroys the tiny air sacs in the lungs slowly over many years. The lungs cannot repair this damage. Chronic bronchitis is the excess production of mucus in the air passages of the lungs.


This bill seeks to go some way to stopping young or, indeed, any Australians from starting or returning to tobacco smoking. Lowering smoking rates will lower the number of people who are affected by these health problems I have just outlined. I commend the bill to the Senate.

"Singh, Sen Lisa",ALP,2012-02-07,"



Senator SINGH
 (Tasmania) (13:53):  I rise to speak to the Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Amendment Bill 2010. This bill seeks to bring advertising of tobacco prod­ucts on the internet or on hand-held devices such as mobile phones, tablets or any future technologies in line with the restrictions already in place in other advertising forums. 


The Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Act 1992 had a number of objectives, which are as relevant today as they were when they were first introduced. The act's objectives were to limit the exposure of the public to messages or images that may persuade them to start smoking or continue smoking, to use or continue to use tobacco products and to improve public health. The Gillard Labor government is very serious when it comes to tobacco control, and rightly so, as it remains one of the leading causes of preventable death and disease amongst many Australians.


I would like to take a moment to share with senators a few frightening statistics related to tobacco. We know that tobacco is responsible for more than $31 billion a year in costs to the Australian community. Sadly, we also know that tobacco is responsible for around 15,000 deaths every single year. Tobacco accounts for 56 per cent of total drug abuse cost. Perhaps surprisingly, this is more than alcohol and all other drugs combined. Tobacco costs Australia more than $15 billion in workplace costs. This is twice as much as the workplace costs associated with alcohol and other drugs combined. Tobacco is responsible for more than 750,000 hospital bed days, with eight per cent of these beds occupied by children under the age of 15.


How can we as a nation let tobacco affect our youth like this? How can we let it affect anyone, when the dangers associated with this product are so well known and have been known for so long? Simply put, we cannot do so. No longer is it okay to stand back and let big tobacco ruin so many lives in exchange for its big profits. So the Gillard Labor government is taking a comprehensive approach to tobacco control. In April 2010, a 25 per cent tobacco excise was introduced by the Gillard Labor government. There have also been record investments—$27.8 million—in anti-smoking campaigns. The government has also provided an additional $700,000 to the World Health Organisation to help the global fight against tobacco smoking. We also had the opportunity to vote on and successfully pass legislation on plain packaging in this very place just last year. This is legislation that will lead the world, and the world is most definitely watching. It is an honour to be part of a Gillard Labor government that is not afraid of tackling the tough issues and talking to big tobacco companies. These measures, together with this legislation I speak on today, will make a difference when it comes to reducing smoking rates and reducing the burden of tobacco related disease. We cannot stop the fight, and it is a fight that will not be over for many years to come. Big tobacco will fight us all the way, but we cannot and we will not let them win. We have to keep fighting.


While national statistics show a quite dramatic decrease in smoking rates, it is, sadly, still a different story in my home state of Tasmania. In 1995, Tasmanian smoking rates were 1.5 per cent higher than the national average, at 25.5 per cent. In 2007-08 they were 4.8 per cent higher than the national average of 20.1 per cent. But I would like to take a moment to acknowledge some of the work that has been undertaken by the state Labor government in Tasmania, who have been working hard to rectify this scenario. They too understand that we cannot sit back and do nothing and that we must act in concert with one another.


Some of the most innovative non-smoking legislation has been passed in Tasmania over the last decade with more to come regarding smoke-free areas, including banning smoking in sporting venues, playgrounds and all outdoor dining areas. This will not only continue to denormalise smoking but also protect our community from the dangers associated with second-hand smoke. There is no safe level of exposure to second-hand smoke, and only 100 per cent smoke-free environments provide that effective protection. It may not be a surprise to senators to know that, of more than 400 chemicals present in tobacco smoke, more than 60 are cancer causing. The anti-smoking campaigns are true: every cigarette you smoke is doing you damage.


Tobacco has long been known as a deadly substance, and a national ban on tobacco advertising on radio and television first came into effect in Australia way back in 1973. A decade later, the Smoking and Tobacco Products Advertisements (Prohibition) Act 1989 banned advertising in newspapers and magazines. And it was in 1992 that a more rigid ban was introduced, making it an offence to publicly promote tobacco products. 


Scientific evidence tells us that images and mentions of tobacco normalise smoking to our most vulnerable and valuable, our youngest generation. It is vital that we limit such images and conversations and protect this generation from the addiction of tobacco. Given that we have known for decades that tobacco is deadly, there can be no more excuses.

 (Western Australia) (15:01):  I move :


That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Manufacturing (Senator Carr) and the Minister for Finance and Deregulation (Senator Wong) to questions without notice asked by Senators Birmingham and Williams today relating to the carbon tax.


What has become obvious again today is that Labor's carbon tax is a bad tax. It is the world's largest, hardest-hitting, most comp­lex carbon tax. It is a tax which is anti-manufacturing, it is a tax which is anti-jobs, it is a tax which is anti-workers, it is a tax which is anti-working families and it is a tax which will do nothing to reduce emissions either here in Australia or in the world. We of course know from the government's own figures that the carbon tax will push up the cost of everything. It will make Australian manufacturing businesses less competitive internationally. It will cost jobs. It will lead to lower real wages when compared to a situation without a carbon tax. This is, again, according to the government's own Treasury analysis. It will do all of that without doing anything to help reduce global greenhouse gas emissions.


Manufacturing in Australia is already under pressure. Yes, manufacturing is doing it hard because of the high Australian dollar and because of the fragile state of the global economy. This is the worst time of all times to impose the world's largest, hardest-hitting and most complex carbon tax on the Australian economy. There is never a good time to make Australian businesses less competitive internationally without doing anything beneficial in the process, but this is the worst time of all possible times. If the Labor Party cared about manufacturing, if the Labor Party cared about jobs and if the Labor Party cared about Australian working families it would scrap the carbon tax today. But, of course, the Labor Party does not care about manufacturing, the Labor Party does not care about workers, it does not care about jobs it does not care about working families. It is quite happy for working families to be confronted with increasing costs of living. It is quite happy to impose a tax which will lead to lower real wages over time. It is quite happy to impose a tax which will take $1 trillion out of the economy between now and 2050 without doing anything to help reduce global greenhouse gas emissions. 


Why would the Australian Labor Party do that? Because that is the price it has to pay in order to stay in government and because that is the price that the Australian Greens extracted from the Labor Party. The Austra­lian Labor Party has sold out workers, has sold out working families across Austra­lia to the Australian Greens and it absolutely knows it. The government says to us: 'Don't worry. On 1 July 2012 it will become obvious that the sky has not fallen in and that things are going to be okay.' Let me make this point: I agree and the coalition agrees that the sky will not fall in on 1 July 2012. But what will happen on 1 July 2012 is that, at the direction of this Labor-Greens govern­ment, Australia will take another step in the wrong direction, another step towards push­ing up the cost of living for working families across Australia, another step towards putting manufacturing jobs under more pressure and another step towards lower real wages without doing anything to help reduce global greenhouse gas emissions.


The Minister for Finance and Deregula­tion, Senator Wong, again said today that the economy will continue to grow despite the carbon tax. Sure, that is true, the economy will continue to grow, but the economy will grow by much less, by $1 trillion less betw­een now and 2050, according to the govern­ment's own Treasury analysis. That is mak­ing the assumption that both the US and China will have an emissions trading scheme in place by 2016, and we all know that there is no chance that this will happen. It is very clear that the government is completely dis­interested when it comes to manufacturing and jobs, because otherwise they would not be proceeding with this tax, which will hurt working families, which is anti-manufac­turing, which is anti-jobs and which will do nothing to help reduce global greenhouse gas emissions.

Senator MOORE
 (Queensland) (15:06):  We have seen excitement in the chamber today, which is great on the first day. In Senator Polley's question earlier, there was so much excitement on the other side of the chamber they were all trying to answer the question. It was a wonderful moment. If you close your eyes you would think we had gone back seven months in this place to the extensive debate we had around the introduction of carbon pricing. There was nothing new, no new questions. It was just the same old focus. We have had people from the opposition standing up in this place and saying that there is no-one on the government side who cares about manufact­uring, working families and the Australian economy. That shows why we are incredulo­us about the nature of the basis of their argument. 


We know and we understand that the opposition is opposed to carbon pricing. There is no surprise in that. We had that debate and that is on the record. The opposi­tion can run that argument but they should not confuse it by bringing in arguments about whether this government works for the economy when we have an economic record which has been acknowledged universally. We have had that situation. The only group that has been reluctant to acknowledge the role of the Australian government in protect­ing the Australian economy over the last period has been the opposition. We have the record of the international press and internat­ional economic fora, and we have seen the processes that show that this government is doing a responsible and effective job. 


Then we have had, in their arguments about carbon pricing—there is no surprise about this—the opposition bringing in issues around manufacturing. We had the debate. Senator Carr answered several questions today. He put the question right back to the opposition about what they are doing for the manufacturing industry in this country. Standing there and blaming all the ills in manufacturing on the carbon price is not effective. We should be looking at an appropriate way forward to engage with manufacturers across this country. And we should be looking at the clean technology programs that are going to be brought in rather than running the scare argument of blame and telling the manufacturers that things are going to be worse and that there is no future. Look at the programs that have already been introduced by us to encourage people to compete in ways to change processes and change manufacturing so that manufacturing will be effective and successful in the new economy.


This is what this government is about. It has now introduced into this place a series of legislation on carbon pricing. It is not just the price on carbon; there are supplementary processes for looking at support packages for everyone in this country. Senator Wong, in some of her answers today, began to identify those. There is so much information out there that indicates what the support packages are for individuals, families and businesses—people who want to engage in moving into the future. Those on the other side just say that the world has ended and there is no value in looking at carbon pricing. We do not agree, and I doubt we ever will. What we propose—what we have now—is a road map for the future. That information is available for people. 


It is really interesting when you hear people from the opposition quoting Treasury papers selectively. In the debate we had in this place earlier, the role of the Treasury was demonised. People who produced Treasury papers were seen to be biased. Their credibility was not seen to be real. So we had, again, Senator Wong and Senator Carr putting forward information, which is all on the public record, about what the processes are and about the future projections for our economy—the growth of our economy, the growth of individual wages—and where we are going to stand, not just in Australia but in the international network. Again we have heard the complaint that we are the only people taking action on carbon pricing. It is not true. That argument is out there. Certainly other countries are doing things in different ways. No-one has pretended that there is a standard approach but there must be an approach.


Senator Cormann said that there was no good time to introduce a carbon pricing process. There is definitely a good time to make change in our country, because we must. We have argued this in this place. The arguments will continue. I expect that we will have the same discussions day in and day out—fine!—but let's make sure that we are going to have the facts on the table and not consistently debate issues that have been argued here, and about which the informa­tion is available. We need to look at the issues and qualify where we are going to go in the future.

"Birmingham, Sen Simon",LP,2012-02-07,"



Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia) (15:11):  The day 1 July 2012 will be the day on which Australian businesses start paying the world's biggest carbon tax. There should be no doubt about this as, in the months since we debated it, we have seen the Australian dollar continue to strengthen relative to the European Union currency, the euro, and we have seen the value of the Australian carbon tax getting bigger and bigger when compared with the only other comparison going around town. So the Labor government's world's biggest carbon tax is just getting bigger by global standards. And that is going to mean that we will see an even greater impact on the competitiveness of Australian businesses from 1 July this year, when this carbon tax comes in. 


I am pleased to note that I gather that in the other place the Prime Minister has finally—after being asked the question again and again—acknowledged that she accepts the Treasury modelling of the carbon tax. In accepting the Treasury modelling she is accepting the reality that in future, under the carbon tax, real wages for Australians will be lower than they otherwise would have been. Economic growth in Australia will be lower than it otherwise would have been. These are direct consequences of the carbon tax. It is a reality highlighted and exposed by my colleague Senator Cormann during the countless hours of debate on this. It has a real flow-through throughout the economy. But let's deal with the facts here. We know, as a result of the Treasury modelling, that real wages will be lower than otherwise would have been the case and that the Australian economy will be smaller and will grow by less than would otherwise have been the case.


The government's retort and response is always to highlight the compensation—the claimed compensation—within this package. Senator Carr today spoke about $1.2 billion in industry compensation, but when challenged as to how many of Australia's manufacturing businesses would get it—whether most Australian manufacturing businesses might get some share of this compensation—Senator Carr was silent. He was unable to give even the slightest hint of commitment as to what proportion of Australian manufacturing businesses might share in this elusive compensation. We know from the steel industry fund that ultimately the overwhelming majority of any of this compensation for business will go to just a handful of businesses. Most of the manufact­uring businesses in Australia will miss out. But they will not be the only ones, because then there is the small business sector, and in the small business sector they all miss out. On 1 July every small business around Australia will wake up and face significant rises in their electricity costs. The Treasury modelling, which I am pleased the Prime Minister accepts, indicates at least a 10 per cent rise in electricity costs, a nine per cent rise in gas costs and a rise in water costs. Senator Edwards, in his question today, highlighted research that has been released in South Australia indicating a potential 16 per cent rise in electricity costs. For small businesses, for which electricity is a significant cost impact, this is a massive hit. Small businesses are not able to negotiate contracts with electricity providers for significant discounts or for longer term price certainty; they just have to take the same type of terms and conditions as every other Australian. They will simply have to wear this vast cost impact on their inputs. They will all miss out on any of this elusive compensation. So it will be this key part of the Australian economy where we will see growth held back, real wages held back and job growth in the future held back. As a result of that, we will see a weaker Australian economy in the future.


This will be a year of shame for this government as they introduce the world's biggest carbon tax, by far and away greater in terms of its scope and impact on business and industry than anywhere else around the world. We should not allow them to hide behind a fig leaf of compensation that has a limited life span and limited accessibility for those who get it and ultimately will do nothing to change the reality, found in that Treasury modelling, that the Australian economy will be worse off with a carbon tax than it would be if it did not have a carbon tax.

Senator SHERRY
 (Tasmania) (15:16):  It is a pleasure to participate in this debate. It is unsurprising, on the first day of the return of the Senate, that the Liberal-National Party should continue their doom and gloom scenario predictions that the world as we know it is going to end on 1 July with the introduction of a carbon tax. It is unsurprising that they predict that the economy will collapse, that real wages will go backwards, that jobs will be lost et cetera. It is a well worn theme and a well worn scare campaign. We have seen it in other areas of major reform undertaken by the Labor government. We saw it in respect of the introduction of compulsory superannuation all those years ago. We saw it in respect of the mining tax. Where was the end of the world with the introduction of a mining tax in Australia? We all remember the doom and gloom being predicted by those opposite about the end of investment and mining employment et cetera. We all saw those arguments advanced last year. But, of course, it did not happen, and it will not be happening when the mining tax legislation comes into this place.



Senator Boswell interjecting—




Senator SHERRY:
  I am just reminding you, Senator Boswell, of the constant scare campaigns, the negative attacks and the factually incorrect campaigns that the Liberal-National Party has continued to run against all major economic and social reforms that a Labor government has made. We even had it in respect of maternity leave some years ago. Of course, we now have the Liberal-National Party supporting maternity leave. I predict that the Liberal-National Party will not be reversing the mining tax as they have promised to do.


It is unsurprising that they focus on and predict gloom and doom and disaster come 1 July. Let us see what happens on 1 July. Let us see if the Australian economy goes backwards. Let us see if unemployment rises as a consequence of the carbon tax. I predict with some certainty that the disasters that the Liberal-National Party are predicting—as they predicted with the mining tax, as they predicted with compulsory superannuation in this country and as with all of those predictions that they have made—will not come true.


It is unsurprising that we come here on the first day of the new sitting year for the Senate and the Liberal-National Party wants to talk about anything but the strength of the Australian economy: the fact that there have been over 700,000 jobs created in this country in the four years of a Labor government, the fact that real wages over the last four years have grown by 7.4 per cent cumulative on average weekly ordinary time earnings, the fact that the budget will be returning to surplus over the 2012-13 financial year and the fact that mortgage repayments are $3,000 a year less under this government than they were under the previous government. It is unsurprising that the Liberal-National Party wants to predict doom and gloom from 1 July when they do not want to acknowledge the economic strength of this country.


I remind the Senate chamber about the economic strength of this country. It is certainly in stark contrast to what is happening in Europe and the US. We have an unemployment rate of 5.3 per cent. Contrast that to the eurozone, where it is over 10 per cent, and the US, where it is still over eight per cent. And they have massive fiscal deficits. I remind the Senate chamber of the strength of the Australian economy because, come 1 July, the strength of the economy, which has been delivered very effectively by this Labor government over the last four years, will continue. It will continue. The forecasts from Treasury show that our economic strength will continue with a carbon tax. We will continue to have good economic growth. We will continue to have good jobs growth. We will continue to be one of the strongest economies, if not the strongest of all advanced economies, with a carbon tax, just as we have been one of the strongest economies in the entire Western world over the last 20 years with a superannuation guarantee of nine per cent. And we had the doom and gloom prediction that small business and industry would collapse. We had all the same predictions, which did not come true. (Time expired)

Senator BOSWELL
 (Queensland) (15:21):  We have all returned from a break. One of the great things about having a break of four weeks is that it gives us a chance to reconnect with our families, do all those sorts of things and relax. It also gives us the opportunity to go out and talk to some of our constituents. I have done that over the past two weeks, and I can tell you: there is a disaster looming out there. I have spoken to food processors, fishing operators, fish processors, and people right across the whole spectrum of the manufacturing industry, and there is a universal cry: 'The dollar is high and it is killing us. I cannot make my factory work anymore.' When we put the carbon tax on—and I have been able to tell them that the carbon tax on industrial use is far more than 10 per cent—they say, 'This won't work anymore.' One particular person told me, 'I am going to take all of my primary product, I am going to put it in a fridge, I am going to send it to China to have it processed and I am going to bring it back, and I will be able to sell at a cheaper price than I can at the moment.' He does not get any joy out of putting 200 people out of work, but he says, 'I can't make it work. I've got investments that will not give me a return, and I can't make it work.' That is happening all over the manufacturing area.


To prove my point, 130,000 manufacturing jobs have been lost since 2008. This is the highest number ever recorded. Yes, we have a great economy. It is a great economy; it is one of the best economies in the world. It is so great that even you people cannot kill it. You do your best to drive the economy down. You do your best to put a carbon tax on it. You do your best to increase costs. But this economy is so great and this country is so tremendous that even the Labor Party—a wholly owned subsidiary of the Greens—cannot kill it. But do not come in here with crocodile tears and say, 'Aren't we terrific.' The economy is going well despite you, and it could go a lot better without you. Everyone knows that. To prove my point, by 2020 $32 billion is going to have to come off the GDP. That means the economy will not grow by $32 billion. But when you get to 2050, it is $1 trillion—and these are government figures. We are not fudging the figures; these are government figures. I can refer you to the papers where the government has issued them. That is what the carbon tax is going to cost Australia: $1 trillion by 2050 and $32 billion by 2020.


Even the Treasury modelling that the government holds up so high is saying that carbon tax will reduce real wages by one per cent by 2020, or the equivalent of $600 a year for someone earning $70,000. These are the tradies—the aspirational voters the Labor Party want to win back. I can tell you: you are wasting your time. It is $460 million to the car industry. What is the point of putting a $460 million tax on a car industry and then crying that you are going to have to subsidise it? Don't you see that a $460 million impost on a car industry is a tax? That is why they are coming to you and asking for some support. There is $460 million worth of lead in the saddle of the car industry. And then there is Qantas with tax of $115 million. All of this adds on to costs. I can tell you: the economy will not have collapsed on 1 July, but it will be sandbagged and there will be a lot of weight in the economy's saddle, but it will survive despite the Labor Party and the Greens.

Senator CHRIS EVANS
 (Western Australia—Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills, Science and Research and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (15:33):  by leave—I move:


That the Senate expresses its deep regret at the death, on 8 December 2011, of the Right Honourable Sir Zelman Cowen AK, GCMG, GCVO, QC, former Governor-General of Australia from 1977 to 1982, places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service, and tenders its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement.


There is a great deal of sadness across the chamber at the loss of this great Australian, but he was someone who lived a very full and productive life and what we are doing today is recording the parliament's apprecia­tion of that contribution. I know I will be followed by Senator Brandis, who I think knew Sir Zelman and I am sure will be able to make a better contribution than I. It is always better if you had personal interaction with the person. I look forward to that.


Sir Zelman was born on 7 October 1919 in Melbourne. His mother, Sarah, had a vision of success for her son from an early age, reportedly telling him he was destined to become a King's Counsel. Sir Zelman was educated at local primary schools and then at Scotch College, where he graduated dux in 1935. He then went on to the University of Melbourne, where he studied arts and law, receiving the Supreme Court prize for coming first on the final honours lists. Sir Zelman won a Rhodes scholarship, but delayed further studies so he could serve with the Royal Australian Navy. He was serving in Darwin at the time of the Japanese attacks in 1942. 


In 1945 Sir Zelman completed his war service, married Anna—which is a marriage of some 66 years—and commenced his bachelor of civil law degree at Oriel College, Oxford. On completion of his degree he was a lecturer and fellow of the college. In 1951 he returned to Australia to take up the position of Professor of Public Law at the University of Melbourne. At the age of 31 he broke all British Commonwealth records with his appointment as Dean of the Faculty of Law, a position he held until 1966. Sir Zelman is remembered as driving a remarka­ble transformation and modernisation of the faculty as dean. 


It came as a surprise to his colleagues when after 16 years at the helm he accepted the position of Vice-Chancellor of the University of New England. In 1970 he moved again, this time to take up the vice-chancellorship at the University of Queens­land. It was a tumultuous time, especially for university leaders. Campuses across the country were a hotbed of political agitation and student protests. As VC, Sir Zelman brought calm to volatile, sometimes hostile, protest situations. His considered, calm approach and rational conversations worked with students and gained him the nickname 'Super Zel'. In 1973, the University of Melbourne awarded Sir Zelman an honorary doctor of laws degree. In 1976, he became the Law Reform Commissioner of the Commonwealth of Australia and was also knighted.


In 1977, Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser's announcement that Sir Zelman would be Australia's next Governor-General was, I think, greeted enthusiastically around the country. He became Governor-General at a time when the foundations of Australia's political system had been severely shaken. He became quickly known as a healer, bringing wisdom and dignity to the role he occupied until 1982. He served with great distinction and noted that the appointment was the greatest experience of his life. Sir Zelman turned down the offer of a second term, choosing to return to Oriel College, Oxford, where he became Provost, a position he held until 1990.


On his return to Melbourne in 1990, he became an active member of the Jewish community and a patron of the St Kilda Football Club—which was probably his only mistake, given its record as a successful football side. He also became a member of the board of Fairfax newspapers for some five years. He continued his community engagement and his passion for higher education, helping to establish a law school at Griffith University and to establish the National Academy of Music. He made a great contribution to academia across many institutions and throughout his whole life.


He leaves an enormous legacy. He stood as an international scholar, a healer of the nation and someone who contributed passionately and fully to the public, intellectual and cultural life of Australia and the world. He was someone I always respected from a distance. His passing was a great loss for Australia. On behalf of the government, I extend to his wife, Lady Anna, and to his family our sincere sympathy in their bereavement.

"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2012-02-07,"



Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (15:38):  There can be few who have served the people of Australia with greater distinction, in a variety of fields, than Sir Zelman Cowen. He was a scholar of international eminence, a public lawyer with few equals in his field, a university leader on two continents and, most importantly for us, the 19th Governor-General of the Common­wealth, who brought the balm of his wisdom and moderation to a particularly difficult passage in our national life.


Zelman Cowen was born in Melbourne on 7 October 1919—by a remarkable coinci­dence, the very day that, elsewhere in the same city, Alfred Deakin died. He was educated at Scotch College and the University of Melbourne, where he enjoyed a brilliant academic career, graduating with the highest honours in arts and law. He won the Supreme Court Prize, the prize awarded to the law school's best graduate, in 1940 and, in the same year, he was elected the Victorian Rhodes Scholar for 1941.


When he gave a moving eulogy at Sir Zelman's state funeral on December 13 last year, the current Warden of Rhodes House, Professor Don Markwell—one of the many distinguished Australians to whom Sir Zelman had been a mentor over the years—delved deep into the Rhodes archives to unearth the reference which Professor George Paton, then Professor of Jurispru­dence at the Law School, wrote in support of 20-year-old Zelman Cowen's application for the Rhodes Scholarship. It gives us an early and accurate foretaste of the man he would become. Professor Paton wrote of him:


His academic record … is one that has rarely been equalled. It is frequently the case that those who do brilliantly in Arts do not show quite the same aptitude for law, but Mr. Cowen shows the same skill in both fields. His mind is very keen and remarkably mature for one of his age.


… … …


He has a rounded personality, broad interests and cultivated tastes … He has great energy and … intellectual integrity … 


… … …


He has the assured courtesy of a much older man, and, while he has no reticence in urging his own opinions, I have found him both respectful and willing to abandon his point of view, if its weakness could be shown … 


… … …


In short, I feel he has that quality which would benefit most from a period at Oxford. I have written many of these testimonials for the Selection Committee, but this is the first time that I can write for a candidate who has that intellectual flair of which great things can be predicted.


Because of the war, he deferred taking up his scholarship until 1945, and in the meantime saw service in the Royal Australian Navy, working in naval intelligence. He then went up to Oriel College, Oxford and read for the BCL. In 1947, he was awarded the Vinerian Prize—the Olympic gold medal of legal scholarship, awarded to the top BCL student of his year—and was appointed a fellow of the college. He would later be awarded the exceptionally rare honour of DCL, Doctor of Civil Law.


In 1950, at the unheard-of age of only 31, he was appointed Professor of Public Law and Dean of Melbourne Law School at his alma mater, the University of Melbourne. He held that post for the next 16 years, combining the development of one of Australia's best law schools with significant contributions to legal scholarship. His magnum opus, Federal Jurisdiction in Australia, belongs to those years. He also collected and published a series of essays which he had written when at Oxford in collaboration with his friend Peter Carter. Cowen and Carter's Essays on the Law of Evidence was still authoritative 30 years later, when I did my BCL. His long biographical essay on Sir John Latham, which remains the only significant biographical study of that insufficiently appreciated Australian, and his authoritative biography of Sir Isaac Isaacs, our first Australian born Governor-General and something of a hero for Sir Zelman, also belong to that period.


He was a frequent participant in public discussion, as a champion of worthy causes. He opposed the 1951 referendum to ban the Communist Party because of its potential impact on political freedom. He was active in support of the 1967 referendum on the recognition of Indigenous Australians. He campaigned against the death penalty. He became well known to the broader public, beyond the university, as a broadcaster—then a rare occupation for a professor. His judicious commentary on current affairs in a radio program called 'Notes on the News' began in the 1950s and ran regularly on ABC Radio for many years.


In 1969, when he delivered the Boyer Lectures, he took as his topic 'The Private Man', one of the earliest Australian contribu­tions to what is now sometimes called privacy studies. At various times during this period, he was a visiting professor at the Harvard Law School, at the University of Chicago, which offered him a permanent chair, and at several universities in the British Commonwealth. He was consulted on, and was the principal draftsman of, the constitutions of several of the newly independent British colonies. In 1966, Zelman Cowen became the Vice-Chancellor of the University of New England in Armidale. Then, in 1970, he was appointed as Vice-Chancellor of the University of Queensland. It was there that I first came to know him. His vice-chancellorship coincided with a very difficult period for the university. Sir Zelman found himself standing between a belligerent student protest movement, at the height of the Vietnam War, and a state government led by a Premier who had little interest in universities and little sympathy for freedom of speech. Relations between the Vice-Chancellor and the then Mr Bjelke-Petersen were, to say the least, difficult. It is a credit to Sir Zelman Cowen's leadership that he was able to prevent the student protests from becoming violent, as they did in some other Australian universities. 


The climax of that tension occurred on 30 July 1971 when, at some personal risk, Sir Zelman addressed a crowd of some 5,000 student protesters in the Great Court. Standing beneath the great lapidary inscription which proclaimed, in Disraeli's words, the university to be 'a place of light, of liberty and of learning', he was able to win their confidence and calm their anger. He would later describe it as the speech of his life. It was a classic instance of the triumph of reason over passion, of moderation over belligerence. I have no doubt that one of the main reasons Sir Zelman prevailed that day is that the students knew that he respected their right to protest, so long as that protest remained peaceful, and that he would defend both their freedom of expression and the independence of the university. They trusted his good faith and they were won by his integrity and his appeal to their better instincts. He is remembered to this day as one of the University of Queensland's greatest ever vice-chancellors, during which it grew into the first rank of Australia's universities—a position which it maintains to this day. 


So when, in 1977, the government of Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser was looking for the best person to succeed Sir John Kerr as Governor-General, Zelman Cowen was a perfect choice. He was respected and trusted by both sides of politics. He had never been a political partisan, though he left no-one in any doubt that he was a humane and enlightened liberal, in the classical and best sense of that word. Don Markwell described the liberal values of which Sir Zelman Cowen was a beacon in these words: 


… individual liberty under law, including the rights to privacy and to free speech in a civil and tolerant society; the rule of reason, with a preference for moderation, collegial leadership and consensus-building, and even-tempered public and private discourse, with disagreement without rancour; uncompromising and scrupulous integrity; and education—in a college, a law school, or the wider university—that both broadens and sharpens the mind.


Sir Zelman spoke of democracy as depending upon 'a fragile consensus', and it was that fragile consensus he sought to restore, in particular by reaching out to the Labor Party, which had yet to come to terms with the resolution of the 1975 crisis and seemed almost estranged from the constitutional polity—certainly, from the office of Governor-General.


Another of Sir Zelman's many protege, Steven Skala, who also delivered a eulogy at his state funeral, caught the quality which Sir Zelman brought to the office of Governor-General—as to every other phase of his glittering career—in these words:


To understand how—


he—


achieved this, we should remember his authenticity. He was an exemplar of decency, unfailing courtesy, generosity, openness to reason, grace and constancy. He afforded everyone their dignity.


His life’s work, in public and in private, reflected the deepest concern for the dignity of every person.


When Sir Zelman left the office of Governor-General in 1982, the strong emotions of 1975 were, if not forgotten, nevertheless a thing of memory. The emollient style of Sir Zelman was, I believe, one of the principal reasons why that was so. Retirement from the office of Governor-General did not see the end to Sir Zelman Cowen's career. He returned to his other alma mater, Oriel College, which appointed him as its provost. His provostship coincided with my own time in Oxford and I renewed my acquaintance with him. He was, as ever, a liberalising influence and a force for good. Oriel was, at the time, the last Oxford college to refuse to admit women; under Sir Zelman's influence, it became co-ed. Such was the respect in which he was held in the United Kingdom that he was much sought after for high appointments. It was during those years that he served as chairman of the British Press Council.


But Australia was always his home, and it was to Melbourne that he and Lady Anna returned for good in 1990. He renewed his active involvement in Australian public life in a variety of ways. He served, for several years, as the chairman of Fairfax newspap­ers. He was instrumental in the establishment of the law schools at both Griffith University and the Victorian University of Technology. Although he had not always held that view, he became convinced that it was time for Australia to become a republic, and advocated that cause in the 1999 referendum. He continued to be a mentor to talented young Australians. In particular, Joshua Frydenberg, now the member for Kooyong, became a particular protege and close friend, and Sir Zelman discreetly encouraged him in his political career.


We remember Sir Zelman Cowen with affection and gratitude. He was both a good and a great man—qualities often not comb­ined within the same person. He excelled in everything he did. He occupied his variety of very high offices with distinction and grace. He saw us through one of the most difficult times in our nation's story. He was generous, temperate, moderate, liberal and wise. There have been few greater Australians than he. The opposition supports the condolence motion moved by the Leader of the Government in the Senate and extends its sympathies to Lady Anna Cowen and the family of Sir Zelman Cowen.

I did but meet Sir Zelman in passing in Melbourne with Lady Anna, but for much of my life I have looked for role models and admirable people. One could not go past this great Australian as a person who, without creating division, contributed greatly to the intellectual and social commentary and development of Australia. He will, as the previous speakers have said so well, be marked down as one of the most remarkable, humane, liberal and generous thinkers and contributors to Australian society in recorded history. We have lost a wonderful Australian who will go down in the annals of this nation's history as someone to whom we can look as an exemplar of what it is to be a contributing human being in a world and a country which have their troubles but which nevertheless look for stability, intellectual rigour and—I mean this in the full sense of the word—a moral authority that gives us centring as we each undertake to contribute to public life. Vale Sir Zelman Cowen, a great Australian.

Senator SCULLION
 (Northern Territory—Deputy Leader of The Nationals) (15:55):  Sir Zelman Cowen passed away on 8 December last year, aged 92. December 8 was a significant date, being the 34th anniversary of his swearing-in as the 19th Governor-General of Australia in 1977. Sir Zelman Cowen, who was once famously quoted as saying his achievements were simply down to luck, was humble and understated throughout his life. He left a legacy of which his family can be justifiably proud and a nation grateful.


When Sir John Kerr's turbulent period of office as Governor-General ended with his early resignation in 1977, the Prime Minister, Malcolm Fraser, offered Cowen the post. He served 4½ years as Governor-General, from December 1977 to July 1982, and was instrumental in reunifying the country and our political institutions with his poise and his intellectual command of all things constitutional and through the respect he received from all Australians. Malcolm Fraser said of Sir Zelman that he 'restored Australia's faith in the office of Governor-General'.


Sir Zelman Cowen was born in Melbourne on 7 October 1919. During the Second World War he served with the Royal Australian Navy. As a Territorian I should recognise that he was stationed in Darwin during its bombing in February 1942. After the war he went on to become a distingui­shed constitutional lawyer, academic, Oxford Rhodes scholar and respected leader of the Australian Jewish community. Later in life, Sir Zelman became dean of law at the University of Melbourne and later Vice-Chancellor of the University of New England and then the University of Queensland. Sir Zelman Cowen's contribu­tion to the law was not limited to Australia. He was regarded as one of the leading constitutional lawyers in the English-speaking world, an achievement highlighted by the number of colleagues who travelled from England and many other parts of the world to attend his state funeral in Melbourne.


Some beneficiaries of Sir Zelman Cowen's expertise and presence were the British Colonial Office, where he advised on constitutional matters to the governments of Ghana and Hong Kong and provided a wide range of advice on the formation of constitu­tions across a number of emerging nations. Sir Zelman was also a frequent visiting professor at American universities, including the University of Chicago, the University of Illinois and the University of Washington. Sir Zelman was also a member of the board of Fairfax, including a period as chairman.


As a Victorian, he was passionate about Aussie rules football and served as patron of St Kilda Football Club. In an honour the true magnitude of which can perhaps only be fully understood by fellow Victorians, after his death St Kilda placed a notice which said simply, 'Farewell, St Zelman'. On a personal and family note, Sir Zelman was married to his wife, Lady Anna, for 66 years. He had four children—Shimon, Yousef, Kate and Ben—and 16 grandchildren and was, at the time of his death, the proud great-grandfather of six—a family that can trace their heritage back to a truly great Australian. Vale Sir Zelman

Senator CHRIS EVANS
 (Western Australia—Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills, Science and Research and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (15:59):  by leave—I move:


That the following address to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth the Second be agreed to:


YOUR MAJESTY: 


We, the President and Members of the Senate of the Commonwealth of Australia, in Parliament assembled, and on behalf of the people of Australia, offer our warm congratulations on the occasion of the Diamond Jubilee of Your Majesty's accession to the Throne. We express our respect and regard for the dedication Your Majesty has displayed in the service of the Commonwealth and Your Majesty's deep and abiding commitment to Australia and her people.


Today we acknowledge a remarkable achievement: the diamond jubilee of the reign of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II. It is a contrast today, having acknowledged the death of one of her most distinguished representatives in this country, that we celebrate her remarkable period as Queen. It is not often that the Senate pauses to officially mark such regal occasions, but it is equally rare that as a nation we have the opportunity to celebrate six decades of continuous service by our monarch. I am sure all senators will join me in expressing our congratulations to Her Majesty and in extending our warmest regards on the occasion of the 60th anniversary of her accession to the throne. It is also of note that we are joined by the community of nations we know today as the Commonwealth as we pay tribute to Her Majesty for the dedication with which she has served.


On 31 December 1900, the six colonies of the continent of Australia were united by one special bond: the crown of Queen Victoria. One day later, on 1 January 1901, a new united Australian nation reaffirmed its special bond to the Crown. Since that much celebrated founding of our Federation 111 years ago, a total of six monarchs have served as our head of state. I think it is fair to say that no monarch in Australia's history has been held in such deep affection as Queen Elizabeth II.


That affection was clearly displayed last year when Her Majesty visited Canberra, Brisbane, Melbourne and, of course, Perth for the Commonwealth heads of government meeting. It was her 16th visit to Australia, but as always the crowds turned out. On a personal note, my mother-in-law was very excited when I took her to the reception in Perth. It was the best thing her son-in-law had ever done as far as she was concerned. She does not always have a good word for me, but on this occasion she did! A sign of the welcome that Australians gave the Queen was that all of the events she attended were so well attended and that so many Austra­lians were keen to meet her.


During those visits to our nation, Australians have watched Her Majesty as she has grown from a young, shy sovereign to a woman of wisdom, elegance, grace and compassion who has served with unwavering dedication. During Her Majesty's reign, Australia too has grown and matured into a modern, dynamic and sophisticated nation. Her Majesty has been with us in person for some of those moments that have defined us as a nation. The Queen opened the Opera House in Sydney in 1973. In 1980 she opened the High Court of Australia and in 1988, on 9 May, Her Majesty opened this building, the new Parliament House.


She was the first reigning monarch to visit this land and she has seen it go from strength to strength. In this, her diamond jubilee year, it is important for us to reflect on how both Her Majesty and our nation have grown together, maturing with wisdom and understanding but not defying change. We have become a nation which welcomes people from all over the world, a nation which has embraced diversity and celebrates multiculturalism, a nation which takes pride in its enviable tradition of parliamentary democracy and a nation mature enough to debate a constitutional future of our own and the future of monarchy itself.


Whatever the future may be, Australians regard Her Majesty with enormous respect and affection. It is with great fondness that we mark her diamond jubilee, a celebration which all Australians can participate in. Australians will all have the opportunity to participate in those celebrations. In October of last year the Prime Minister joined with British Prime Minister David Cameron to announce the establishment of the Queen's diamond jubilee trust. The trust will support charitable organisations and projects across the entire Commonwealth. The Prime Minister will announce today that Australia will contribute up to $5 million to the trust, which will provide a lasting legacy of the Queen's reign, a fitting tribute for a woman whose commitment to service has been unwavering.


I encourage all Australians to take the time to reflect on all we have achieved during the reign of Queen Elizabeth. On behalf of the government, I extend to Her Majesty our most sincere congratulations for her celebrated reign of 60 years. I am sure the Senate will join with me in offering our best wishes for her diamond jubilee year.

"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2012-02-07,"



Senator ABETZ
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (16:04):  Those who have sung and prayed 'God save the Queen' over the decades have had their supplications richly answered and rewarded, for yesterday marked the 60th anniversary of the unexpected accession of a quietly spoken young lady—indeed, a princess—to the throne. The untimely death of King George VI saw Princess Elizabeth become Queen Elizabeth II.


Imagine a world without Prime Minister Gillard or, for that matter, Leader of the Opposition Abbott, a world with no computers or iPhones, indeed a world into which most of us have not yet been born. Imagine the world in the year when the ANZUS Treaty came into being, Qantas Empire Airways commenced their first service between Australia and South Africa, Joan Sutherland debuted at Covent Garden and Lang Hancock discovered the world's largest iron ore deposit in the Hamersley Range. That is the world in which Her Majesty became our Queen.


During the ensuing 60 years, the world has seen immense change—immense social change, immense technological change and immense political change, including the collapse of communism. In our own country we have seen 12 Australian prime ministers come and go, and one wonders how many more may come and go during the Queen's reign. Fourteen governors-general have come and gone and so have even more leaders of the opposition. Through all this change Australia and the Commonwealth of Nations have been blessed with one constant, one certainty, one source of stability: Her Majesty the Queen. I cannot help but recall that at Balmoral some 18 years ago a former prime minister told Her Majesty that most Australians regarded the monarchy as an 'anachronism' which had 'drifted into obsolescence'. Eighteen years on, that prime minister has long departed the political stage himself, drifting into obsolescence, while the Queen is still standing—and standing exceptionally strongly.


Queen Victoria is the only other monarch to have celebrated a diamond jubilee. This is therefore the first diamond jubilee in the history of Australia as a nation. As a nation we are 111 years old. Our Queen has been our Queen for well over half of our life as a nation, and she has served us with distinct­ion, style and genuine concern. I detect that, while support for our monarchy may have waned for a time some decade or so ago, the enduring symbolism and value of our monarchy and monarch are resonating yet again, especially with the young. There is a clear resurgence of support for the institution of the monarchy. A part of that resurgence is undoubtedly because people do seek anchors and constancy in institutions, especially in an era of an ever rapid increase in the pace of change. I also venture that Her Majesty has been the main cause of the resurgence. Sixteen visits from 1954 onwards have clearly helped.


Her Majesty is clearly a standout exemplar of the benefits of a constitutional monarchy. Having had the privilege of meeting her on a number of occasions, I have witnessed firsthand her genuineness, her graciousness and her sense of service. Whilst huge privilege attaches to our monarch, so too does the countervailing obligation which Her Majesty performs with such a strong sense of service to community.


I recall Her Majesty's visit to a work for the dole project in my home state. One participant, overawed by the occasion, did very well to try to make himself inconspicu­ous—but not well enough for Her Majesty not to notice. With a beaming smile, she deliberately sought the participant out and spoke with him. He was touched by our Queen's sensitivity. That work for the dole participant is just one of thousands of Aust­ralian lives that our Queen has personally touched. Her Majesty's support for charities and communities all around the world, inclu­ding here in Australia—in a non-political, unifying manner—has done much good for our people and the peoples of the world. On taking the oath of office, the Queen swore to, among other things, serve her people—and she has done so impecca­bly. No other person in living memory has been held with such high regard for such a period of time, according to David Murray. I agree.


Apart from domestic obligations, Her Majesty is an international Queen, a genuine world leader and an international figurehead held in high esteem for many decades now—a reputation that no other world leader can boast. This well deserved reputation and respect that Her Majesty enjoys is not a result of slavishly following a blueprint. As Prince William has said: 'I think she's carved her own way completely. She's not had a blueprint.' This makes Her Majesty's achievements all the more remarkable.


In recognising our monarch's achieve­ments, it would be remiss not to acknowl­edge the wonderful role and support of His Royal Highness Prince Philip, who brings an earthiness and a great sense of humour to our monarchy. His longevity is of course a cause for celebration as well.


The occasion of Her Majesty's diamond jubilee is a good, a right and a proper time for us to give thanks for our constitutional arrangements and the wonderful current holder of the office to celebrate her longevi­ty, both personal and as monarch. It is also an opportunity to reflect on the benefits of our monarchy as part of our constitutional arrangements. Our monarchy and its heritage has provided stability, certainty and numer­ous advantages. One such advantage is that the monarchy's tenure reposes outside of the political cycle. It is a monarchy whose role is above the cut and thrust of daily partisan politics, a monarchy which acts as a unifying focus in times of national trouble and indeed international strife, a monarchy that is genuinely inde­pendent and a monarchy that is genuinely supportive of our community.


The strength of our constitutional arrange­ments is found in their longevity, having been tested over time, and in their gradual forging over the centuries. The monarchy is an integral and central part of those arrangements. Her Majesty has lived up to the obligations put upon her some 60 years ago in a manner for which all Austra­lians—and indeed all members of the Common­wealth of Nations—should be thankful.


As we congratulate Her Majesty and celebrate and give thanks for our Queen's long and successful reign of service, we do well to recall the second verse of God Save the Queen, which is the coalition's prayer for Her Majesty:


Thy choicest gifts in store,


On her be pleased to pour;


Long may she reign:


May she defend our laws,


And ever give us cause


To sing with heart and voice


God save the Queen

Senator BOB BROWN
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (16:14):  I give the concurrence and support of the Greens to this motion recognising such a noble and dignified lady and globally known personage as Her Majesty the Queen, whose 60th year of accession to the throne was noted yesterday. I think I might be one of the few people in this parliament who remembers the death of King George VI.




Senator Boswell:
  I remember, I was there.




Senator BOB BROWN:
  Yes, Senator Boswell. I said one of the few. I join you. I do not see too many other hands raised. I remember well the news coming through of the death of the king and the enormous sympathy for the burden that came upon the young then Princess Elizabeth and Prince Philip as they made their way back to Britain. Within a couple of years they went on to fulfil the engagement that was aborted by the death of the king and that was their trip here to Australia.


I remark on the extraordinary reception in this parliament last year when Her Majesty showed extraordinary resilience in an event that put huge pressure on her and the prince. That is something we must think about should they visit our shores again. They are an aged couple of very gentle people who I think should not be subject to hours of presentations from people wanting photographs and a moment of their time when they should be given much more time to relax after extraordinary lifetimes of service to their communities.


That said, I also am a republican, as Sir Zelman Cowen became during his lifetime. I have changed from being a monarchist to a republican. I do believe this great nation has many Australians who have the qualities and the wherewithal to be our head of state. Her Majesty is the Queen of the United Kingdom and she is only the Queen of Australia when she is here, which has become a very, very rare occurrence. I think there must be days, weeks and maybe months that pass where her mind rarely, if ever, devolves upon the affairs of Australia and the people of Austra­lia and the events that are unfolding in this country.


It is time that we matured—as Jamaica is doing at the moment, as the latest in a long stream of countries inevitably moving towar­ds appointing their own head of state—to something similar to Ireland. We should have a head of state who comes from the extraordinary wealth of human talent within our own ranks. I think I have a strong comp­onent of romanticism within my own soul, but the practicalities and my fealty to this country and to the people of this country say that when we do move to become a republic—it is an inevitability—it will be a great day of maturation for us as a people. That said, I congratulate Her Majesty and Prince Philip for a long life of service. I wish them well in the years that they will be with us and I hope that they find a little more time to reflect upon that life, to relax in peace and equanimity in the years that they are granted yet to live.

"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2012-02-07,"



Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia) (16:37):  Labor members and senators are very divided. The Gillard Labor government is deeply dysfunctional and so obsessed with itself that it has forgotten what it is there for. They are there to provide good government for our nation. They are there to act in the public interest, to serve Australians, to respond to the challenges we face as a nation, and to lead the nation in maximising our opportunities. 


Instead, all we have had over the summer break are senior ministers at each other's throats and putting the knife into each other's backs. We have had Mr Rudd stalking the Prime Minister. We have had Mr Crean insulting Mr Rudd. We have had Mr Dick Adams from Tasmania making the observation that the Prime Minister has a credibility problem. Let me quote exactly what he said. He said:


She has a bit of a credibility issue with some of the decisions that she's made.


That is a bit like saying that Senator Arbib and Mr Shorten were a bit involved in the knifing of Mr Rudd, or that Michael Clarke plays a little bit of cricket. If ever there was an understatement that the Prime Minister has 'a bit of a credibility issue with some of the decisions that she's made', this is it. There has been such a plethora of self-obsessed, self-indulgent, self-centred commentary on the record and off the record from Labor members and senators on the other side that you wonder whether they have time left to think about what they are there for, which is of course to provide good government for our great nation.


I will just give you a couple of examples at random. This is what Mr Rudd's colleagues say about him. We have the comment from Mr Crean that he is not a team player, referring to him as a 'prima donna'. We have got the comment from a senior Victorian ALP figure: 


Unfairly or not, Kevin killed the Labor brand.


We have got the comment from an unnamed senior Labor Party source from Western Australia:


Rudd destroyed our brand and boosted Colin Barnett all at the same time.


We have got the comment from a Labor figure in New South Wales—perhaps that was Senator Thistlethwaite, or maybe Senator Arbib. Who knows, because they were not prepared to put their name to it? This is what was said:


Our big mistake when he was rolled was to not show the public what a truly odd person Kevin is. The guy is a bully. He has some skills but leading the team is not one of them. 


I wonder, Senator Arbib, whether you will make a confession in this chamber here today and tell us whether you were the source of that particular quote in the Sydney Morning Herald. Here is another good one. This might have been said by Senator Arbib, or was it Senator Thistlethwaite:


There are people that would rather chew their right arm off than go back to [Mr Rudd].


I see you smiling, Senator Arbib; it seems as if you recognise the authorship of that particular comment.




Senator Arbib:
  It's not me.




Senator CORMANN:
  Not to be outdone, there is a lot of vileness and poison and division targeted at the Prime Minister too. One factional boss who is loyal to Ms Gillard said yesterday:


… there has been quite a shift over summer … she's in trouble.


Another quote from another unnamed source from New South Wales—again note, Senator Arbib—said:


'She needs a flawless three months,' the factional boss said of Ms Gillard.


How many factional bosses are there in New South Wales, I wonder, who would make a comment like that? 


'She needs a flawless three months,' the factional boss said of Ms Gillard. 'Her danger zone is between Queensland and the budget.'


Senator Arbib, you should tell this chamber whether you have actually put the Prime Minister on notice.


The only obsession of this government that competes with the obsession that it has with itself is Labor's obsession with Mr Abbott and with tearing him down. We have seen in recent weeks the completely incredible turn of events where the Prime Minister's office initiated a rally against the Leader of the Opposition, which led to a security threat to the Prime Minister—an extraordinary turn of events. And to think that these are the jokers that are responsible for the good government of our great nation.


In recent days the Prime Minister has said that she wants to shift the debate onto the economy. 




Senator Williams:
  Bring it on!




Senator CORMANN:
  We say on this side of the chamber, Senator Williams: bring it on! In recent days we have seen the Prime Minister and Mr Swan continuing to try to trade on the strong record of the Howard government, the strong economic and fiscal inheritance left behind by the Howard government, and of course the greatest Treasurer we have ever had, Mr Peter Costello. There is one reason and one reason only why the Australian economy and our fiscal position is in so much better shape than other parts of the world and that is because the coalition left a strong economy and a strong budget position behind back in 2007. This government inherited a budget position with about a $20 billion surplus, with $70 billion worth of net government assets. And what has this Labor government done with that over the last four years? It has given us $167 billion of accumulated deficits and it has turned a $70 billion net asset position into $133 billion net debt position. It was Prime Minister Howard and then Treasurer Costello who paid off $96 billion of Labor debt between 1996 and 2007. So when you have got Labor Party people out there bragging about how 'our net debt position' and 'our deficit position' are not as bad as they are in other parts of the world, they should remember that it was not Labor which did the hard yards there; it was the Howard-Costello coalition government. What has this government been doing over the last four years? Over the last four years the Labor government here in Canberra has done exactly the same as what governments in parts of Europe have been doing for the last 30 or 40 years—that is, tax too much, spend too much, impose too much red tape and so it goes on. If we continue to go down the path that has been set by this Labor government, we will end up in the same disastrous position that Europe has ended up in. If we continue to go down this path that Labor has set for this nation—higher taxes, wasteful spending and excessive red tape—that is exactly where we will end up. That is, of course, why there is a desperate need for a change of government.


The Howard government delivered genuine surpluses, paid off Labor's debt and delivered personal income tax cut after personal income tax cut. People across Australia know that whenever Labor are in government they stuff up our public finan­ces, and people across Australia instinctively know that it always comes down to the coalition to fix up the Labor mess.


Here we are: we had Minister Wong again today talking about the need for fiscal discipline. We agree with her on that. But let us have a look at what Labor does rather than what Labor says. You may remember that Labor delayed the release of the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook in order to avoid scrutiny by this parliament. The Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook, which is normally released in November, was releas­ed in December. Why? Because Labor was worried about the scrutiny that it would face here in this parliament. And we now know why: because by the time of the MYEFO release in December 2011 the deficit for this financial year, which we were told in November 2010 would be $12.3 billion and which by the time of the May budget last year was $22.6 billion, had gone up to $37.1 billion. The deficit for this financial year under this incompetent, divi­ded and dysfun­ctional Labor administra­tion has more than tripled in 12 months. From MYEFO 2010 to MYEFO 2011 the deficit for this year has more than tripled. And this is a government that wants to give us lectures about fiscal discipline and sound fiscal policy. This is a government that stuffs up our public finances whenever it gets its hands on the levers of Treasury. It does it again, again and again. That is, of course, why there has not been a surplus delivered by a Labor government since back in 1989-90. That is, of course, why people across Australia instinctively know that we need to change the government before we can restore our public finances. They know that it is the coalition that always fixes up Labor's financial mess.

"Thistlethwaite, Sen Matt",ALP,2012-02-07,"



Senator THISTLETHWAITE
 (New South Wales) (16:47):  Senator Cormann says that the opposition are happy to debate economics and that he wants to bring on a debate about economics. He makes outrage­ous, unjustified accusations about Labor's management of public finances. Well, let us bring on a debate about the management of public finances. Let us bring on a debate in this country about economic management, because when we do the Australian people will see that it is Labor that has been honest about our nation's public finances and it is Labor that is managing our economy in the best interests of working Australians.


But do not believe me. Let us look at what some of the experts in the field are saying. I would like to begin with a quote:


There are two possible explanations for how an opposition presenting itself as an alternative government could end up with an $11 billion hole in the cost of its election commitments.


One is that they are liars, the other is that they are clunkheads. Actually, there is a third explanation: they are liars and clunkheads.


But whatever the combination, they are not fit to govern.


They are not my words. They are not the words of a Labor member of parliament. They are not the words of a Labor member of the party, or indeed a union member in this country. They are the words of none other than the respected economic comment­ator for the Australian Financial Review, Laura Tingle, published in the Australian Financial Review on 3 September 2010. Of course, Ms Tingle was referring to the opposition's attempt at costing their election commitments leading into the 2010 election.


What happened in the wake of that farce that was brought on by the then opposition? Justifiably, there was outrage in the Australian community and questions were asked by the commentariat of the opposition economics spokesman, Joe Hockey. When asked what his response was, and about the fact that the opposition would not submit their election costings for independent review and that when they did they came up $11 billion short—a massive black hole in their election costings—his response was that they had been audited. They had been audited by a team of accountants in Perth. Mr Hockey's quote was:


You know what if the fifth biggest accounting firm in Australia signs off on our numbers it is a brave person to start saying they're accounting tricks. I tell you it is an audit, this is an audited statement.


They were the words of the shadow Treasurer. They were followed up by the shadow finance spokesperson, Andrew Robb, when he said:


… if they make a mistake with the auditing of accounts for companies or prospectuses or mislead they're …


…   …   …


… at risk of being punished and going to jail.


Unfortunately, by teaming up with the Liberal opposition they almost did go to jail! In the wake of this team of accountants teaming up with the Liberal opposition and providing so-called audited accounts of their election costings they were fined. They were fined $5,000 by the Institute of Chartered Accountants. They appealed to the independent ICA appeal tribunal, and even the independent ICA appeal tribunal found that the original decision was justified. They said that the fines were imposed because their costings of coalition policies failed to contain:


… a statement that the procedures performed do not constitute either an audit or a review …


It is quite clear that this accounting firm knew that they were not performing an audit. Joe Hockey thought that they were performing an audit. The Australian people knew that they were not performing an audit, that their figures did not stand up to scrutiny, yet those opposite tried to mislead the Australian public into believing that their accounts and their figures were accurate and correct. What they have done is make a joke of public finances from their side of the chamber. What they have done is make a joke of what, until your side teamed up with them, was probably the well-respected good name of this accounting firm in Perth.


They lie and they twist the truth when it comes to public policy. They have opposed every nation-building scheme and reform without developing or explaining their ideas and alternatives and, in doing so, they belittle and show disrespect for the intelligence of the Australian people. Yet they seek to come into this chamber today and criticise this government for getting on with the job of delivering good government in the interests of working Australians.


Yet again, over the course of the last couple of weeks, we have seen the Liberal Party in action refusing to commit to their so-called promise to deliver a budget surplus. We saw Andrew Robb, their finance spokes­person, say this week, 'It depends on the numbers.' Just last week we saw the Leader of the Opposition, Tony Abbott, addressing the National Press Club. He began to back them away from the commitment to deliver tax cuts to the people of Australia; he is now describing this as an aspiration rather than a policy. We have also seen him begin to back the coalition away from its support for a National Disability Insurance Scheme. And they come into this chamber and seek to criticise what is a good government doing a good job and getting on with governing in the interests of working Australians.


What about when it comes to the economy? When the global financial crisis hit Australia we acted quickly and decisive­ly, saving 200,000 workers' jobs in this country. Because there had been an underin­vestment in education and social housing during the years of the Howard government, we invested in schools and social housing throughout this country. We have invested $16.2 billion, through the Building the Education Revolution, in a better education and a better future for our students, and I have been privileged to visit some of those facilities in my work as a senator during the course of the last six months.


Faced with the dilemma of the mining boom and the two-speed economy, we found corporations taking resources that are owned by the people of Australia, making record profits from them and sending those profits overseas. We have acted to implement a minerals resource rent tax to ensure that all Australians are sharing in the benefits of the minerals boom. We are ensuring that we are providing for retirement incomes for Australian workers, ensuring that we are putting the conditions in place to support small business and ensuring that we are investing in rural and regional infrastructure.


Faced with the prospect of the slowest internet speeds in the OECD, we have acted quickly and decisively to implement the National Broadband Network because we believe that, regardless of where you live, your background and your income, you should have access to world-class internet and broadband services in this country. That is why we are building the National Broadband Network.


We face the prospect of skill shortages in our economy, particularly in those sectors that are performing well in the mining and resources sector. They are bottlenecks to productivity and growth in our economy. We have implemented a massive reform to vocational education and training service delivery in this country, making it easier for young people to begin and continue trades in Australia. This is leadership. This is not only getting on with the job of managing our economy in the interests of working Australians but also making our nation a fairer place to live. Those opposite plan to cut $70 billion worth of services from our economy. It will destroy growth, it will destroy our economy and, most importantly, it will make families worse off. Once again, in the words of Laura Tingle:


… they are not fit to govern.

"McKenzie, Sen Bridget",Nats,2012-02-07,"



Senator McKENZIE
 (Victoria) (16:57):  I rise to speak on this matter of public importance. As Senator Thistlethwaite lauds the Gillard government's apparent capacity for managing the Australian economy, the workers in food bowls such as the Goulburn Valley, those in power stations down in the Latrobe Valley and the farmers and the irrigators of regional Australia would beg to differ.


To govern you need a plan. It can be a grand plan, but if that is beyond you then just stick to the basics. For a government to be successful it needs a vision. It knows where it wants to take people, it needs the capacity to inspire confidence by maintaining order and security, and it must have the commitment to get the job done in an orderly manner. Get this mix right and you will take the people with you to great heights, to success and to prosperity, which is what Australia needs and deserves. People look to governments and community leaders to protect and guide them, especially in times of tragedy. Look at what is happening in flood affected areas of Queensland and New South Wales: local communities are being ably led by locally elected councillors and staff, by emergency workers and community volunteers and even by senators, as is the case in St George, where my colleague Senator Joyce is working alongside his local community leaders to minimise damage where possible to property.


The leadership in towns and rural communities throughout the Murray-Darling Basin and beyond will inspire ordinary people to return to homes that have been flooded, some of them for the third time in three years, and to begin the long process of rebuilding. Whole communities pitch in and help those who need it—it is the Australian way—and on this anniversary of the Black Saturday bushfires we remember that these are the same people who inspired communi­ties to face the devastating trauma of bushfires and to rebuild shattered towns, villages and lives. One hundred and seventy-three people died and more than 2,000 homes were destroyed. But, while the pain and memories never disappear, people are beginning to recover.


Australians are resilient, and on a national level they want people to pull together in times of need and help their fellow citizens. They want the same commitment to excell­ence from their leaders. They want to be inspired to do their best—like the dairy farmer who gets up early to milk their herd; they do it day after day to provide the freshest product for their fellow Australians. This government should lead by example, with a steady hand, if it is to inspire people to invest in a business and have the confi­dence that it will support them and their families. But the Australian people have been lumbered with a ratbag mob that vacillates between broken policy promises and cheap political stunts—designed, if there is any degree of thought in them at all, to capture a headline.


The Labor Party claims Ben Chifley's 1949 'Light on the Hill' speech as its beacon, but at present there is not even a glimmer on a mound. Where is the vision that Chifley spoke of, the 'movement bringing something better to the people, better standards of living, greater happiness to the mass of the people'? It is nowhere in the Gillard government. There is no leadership in breaking promises. Saying one thing and then signing worthless agreements to form government—agreements that can be torn up on a whim, and just ask Andrew Wilkie about that one over the summer break—does not inspire confidence. It looks mean and tricky. It shows that there is no long-term plan to lead this nation anywhere, other than in ever-decreasing circles of ineptitude.


On a national scale, the Gillard govern­ment is a policy failure—and on so many fronts. The greatest of all is the insidious carbon tax. This was the Prime Minister's greatest about-face: that she would never introduce a carbon tax under the government she led. Regional Australians and the owners of small businesses will be hit so hard by this tax. Modelling from the Victorian govern­ment shows that dairy farmers, for instance, will have to pay an extra $6,000 a year in a very energy-intensive agriculture pursuit—and for no environmental gain.


I have given these examples before, but obviously the government needs to be reminded—because another of its failures is that it does not listen. It does not focus on the core functions of government. Health is bogged down in so-called reforms that are adding yet another layer of bureaucracy. Education is gripped by the wasteful spend­ing on the Building the Education Revolu­tion. Regional infrastructure—which Senator Thistlethwaite mentioned earlier—is an absolute joke under this government. Last year the government announced $200 million in regional development funding. Two-thirds of that went to the one-third of regional seats held by Labor and Independents. From 500 worthy applications developed by local and regional governments around this nation, fewer than 10 per cent were funded. I hope we get a better deal out of round two.


This government focus only on short-term political gain. So I will remind them that a pizza shop will pay up to an extra $1,000 for electricity under the carbon tax, as will the hairdresser, and a country pub will pay close to $1,000. These are the same businesses in the same towns facing the impact on their local communities of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan—another Gillard government inspired source of uncertainty.


The world's population reached six billion in 1999 and in October 2011 it passed seven billion. The ability to feed ourselves and to feed other nations is part of Australia's prosperity and part of our future. The Goulburn Valley in Victoria provides nearly 20 per cent of our state's agricultural production and 80 per cent of that is reliant on irrigated agriculture. To work the land to produce food is one of the most honest forms of labour and one that is vital to life. But this government wants to keep its grip on power, however tenuous, for as long as it can. The Murray-Darling Basin Plan—revised—still takes water from food production areas.


Today the vast inland is awash with floodwater, but where will it be going? Where will the Commonwealth Water Holder store its H2O? Australia produces enough food for 60 million people. But, as the head of the coalition's task force on dams, Andrew Robb, has explained, a mosaic of agricultural opportunities across the north could double this production within two to three decades. The government only turned its attention to food security when the coalition reported on its inspections. The core function of governing Australia, to provide security and certainty, to give the framework for people to achieve their hopes and the capacity to earn a living, is at stake.


Yet another example of the Gillard government's inability to focus on these core aspects of living in a civil society is the live cattle export fiasco. The Gillard government has done its best to kill off exports, with the banning of live cattle exports to Indonesia in response—get it; wait for it—to a TV program, of which it had had advance notice but only acted when it was broadcast. It acted without consulting Indonesia. Our northern neighbour has understandably cut live export permits from 520,000 cattle to 280,000. In January we learned that boxed meat permits were reduced as well—from 99,000 tonnes to 20,000 tonnes. How could this government possibly have thought that boxed meat could replace live meat exports in Indonesia when most buyers of the meat are in villages and small communities without access to reliable power supplies for refrigeration?


The government have departments and advisers to explain this to them, but they must not be listening. If they do not listen to their own departments and their advisers, is it any wonder that they are not listening to the Australian people? The government change their direction faster than a rabbit stuck in headlights. They are not focused on governing, on leading the people. They are caught up in a whirlwind of speculation about which MPs support the Prime Minister and which MPs may jump sides to back the foreign minister in a coup against his leader.


This is what the Gillard Labor government does. Its faceless men and women plot late-night coups to keep themselves in jobs—yes, Senator Thistlethwaite, it does depend on the numbers—whilst the average Australian is concerned about keeping their job in the current economic climate, especially those in the regions and those in manufacturing, as Australian businesses struggle to absorb the additional costs of the coming carbon tax and the uncertain economic times globally.


There are so many examples of how this Gillard government takes its eye off the ball—and a growing majority of Australians, particularly in the regions, are sick and tired of it. This focus on internal machinations rather than the very real and growing challenges to our great nation is clear evidence of this government's absolute inability to focus on the core functions of executive leadership. The government is, in its own words, 'a rabble'. Australians deserve so much more than the blurred, insipid and uncertain governance of the current Gillard government.

"Bilyk, Sen Catryna",ALP,2012-02-07,"



Senator BILYK
 (Tasmania) (17:07):  I find it rather ironic that, on the first day of sitting for the new year, we instantly get this MPI pulled up. The opposition has brought this forward today, and who can say what the reason is? They constantly go on at us on this side about our economic achievements and our ability to put focus on the core function of government, and I am going to explain to them today why I think this is such a time-wasting MPI. This government understands very clearly just how serious governing is; even the crossbenchers understand how serious governing is, and I thank them for their continued efforts they make to help negotiate the passage of government legislation. The opposition, on the other hand, do not understand at all how serious governing is—they have no idea at all. This MPI is just another petty circus—a carnival—from an opposition who for the last year and a half have been an absolute sideshow. They have been a shambles; they have been a shemozzle.


If you want evidence of the government's ability to focus on governing, you need go no further than looking at the record of the government in this place and in the other place. More than 250 bills have been passed through the House of Representatives and over 200 through this parliament despite the negative, harping approach of the opposition. Among these bills are some of the most important reforms that Australia has ever seen. We will be delivering broadband infrastructure to every home, business, school and hospital premises in the country. Ninety-three per cent of premises will be connected to optic fibre with speeds of up to one gigabyte per second, and the remaining seven percent will be connected through wireless and satellite with speeds of up to 12 megabits per second. That is historic. That has not been done before. That is important to the future of Australia.


We have implemented income tax cuts, and, through the minerals resource rent tax, we will fund a tax cut for small business and a boost to the retirement savings of Austra­lian workers through an increase to the supe­rannuation guarantee. We have put in place a price on carbon. We are rolling out a national curriculum to schools across the country. We are providing 9,500 schools with 21st century infrastructure through the Building the Education Revolution program. What did those on the other side do for education in the 12 years they were in government?


We are building 64 GP superclinics and 288 trades training centres because we know on this side how important skills develop­ment is to the future of Australia. We have passed through parliament historic reforms which make Australia the first country to have plain packaging on tobacco products, and this will help to reduce the attractiveness of and harm done by cigarettes. We have implemented the nation's first paid parental leave scheme, ensuring that parents can afford time off work to spend quality time with their newborn children. No objective commentator can look at our achievements in government or our plans for the future and say that we are not focused on governing in the best interests of all Australians.


You cannot avoid a recession and have an economy that is the envy of the developed world without a focus on governing. You cannot create 750,000 jobs without a focus on governing. Those opposite cannot seem to fathom that governing Australia requires a unity of purpose, but there is no question on this side of the chamber about what our plan is for Australia's future. Every senator here and every member in the other place on our side is committed to that plan.


We will deliver a surplus budget by 2012-13, but those opposite have no idea where they stand on the surplus. When the shadow finance minister, Andrew Robb, was asked on ABC News 24's Capital Hill program whether the coalition would deliver a surplus in their first term, his answer was, 'Well, it just depends. As I say, there's so much uncertainty around the numbers.' Last night, I saw shadow Treasurer Joe Hockey, when confronted with the question on Q&A, refuse to say whether the coalition would deliver a surplus. The deputy opposition leader, Julie Bishop, on ABC Radio National's Breakfast this morning also refused to commit the coalition to delivering a surplus. Bizarrely, Ms Bishop claimed that the coalition would improve Australia's debt and deficit position. How can you claim to be able to improve the debt and deficit position of the country if you cannot commit to delivering a surplus in your first term and have a $70 billion black hole in your costings? This government will deliver a surplus in 2012-13.


How much confidence can Australians have in the coalition to govern the country when they would have the equivalent of the Three Stooges in charge of the nation's finances? How much confidence can Australia have in the opposition's alternative budget when they need to find $70 billion of savings to get their budget back into the black? How much confidence can we have if they cannot even tell us whether or not they would deliver a surplus in their first term? The federal opposition are not fit to govern because, apart from saying no to every positive proposal we have put up, their only focus seems to be the leadership of the Labor Party. The opposition and the media may have an obsession with our leadership, but on this side we do not—it is not an obsession that we share. We have a leader, Prime Minister Julia Gillard, and she will lead us to the next federal election.




Senator Bushby:
  So you're in Julia's camp?




Senator BILYK:
  If you are referring to the article in the Australian, Senator Bushby, how they come to those conclusions out of no comment absolutely amazes me, but it does not surprise me with the Australian whatsoever. I am happy to take your interjection, but once again your research newspaper is a little bit wrong on a whole lot of things and a whole lot of people—so there we go.


The only leader in this parliament who should be worried about his position is the Leader of the Opposition. Mr Abbott's colleagues are starting to see that his relentless negativity and his lack of vision for Australia are demonstrating to the public that he is not fit to be the Prime Minister of this country. There is no better example of the approach that Mr Abbott would take to governing Australia than his address to the National Press Club which I watched last week. It was supposed to be a speech in which he would outline his vision for the nation; instead he delivered more invective and more relentless negativity against the government and our positive plans for Australia's future. Yet I did not notice any indication of his alternative vision for Australia—no new policies, no plans for the future.


The best summing up of his address to the Press Club came, however, not from me but from social researcher Hugh Mackay on ABC's 7.30 program. He said: 


He—


meaning Mr Abbott—


has now dug himself in this trench of negativity from which he doesn't seem to be able to emerge. So, it's always about what's wrong with the Government, the negative line, oppose, oppose, oppose. 


What Mr Mackay picked up about Mr Abbott was not just his relentless negativity about the government's plans for the future but also his lack of a coherent alternative. Here is what he said: 


Also, I think there's the problem of a kind of opportunism about Tony Abbott which is going to be hard for him to address; a lot of people have judged him as a man who sounds strong, tough—the classic conviction politician—but the convictions seem to change. 


I read from that transcript because it goes to the heart of something that the Australian public expect from people who put themselves forward to take on possibly the toughest job in Australia: governing this great country of ours. They just do not want to know what you are against, what you are going to oppose. They want to know what you stand for and what you are going to do. For example, would Mr Abbott deliver a surplus in the coalition's first term of government? Does he believe in the science of climate change or does he still think it is 'absolute crap'? Is he in favour of putting a price on carbon? Is he still in favour of an emissions trading scheme? Does he stand by his statement in 2009 of 'Why not do it with a simple tax'? Which of the coalition's 18 failed broadband plans does Mr Abbott support, or is he planning to come up with even more? Does Mr Abbott support unfair dismissal protections for workers or will he bring back Work Choices? 


If we are going to talk about governing Australia, then the last word should come from a Prime Minister who undertook some of the most substantial economic reforms in Australia's history. In the run-up to the 1990 election campaign, Bob Hawke said about the federal coalition, 'If you can't govern yourselves, you can't govern the country.' The federal opposition cannot govern themselves. They have shown their consistent failure to present as an alternative government, their consistent failure to put forward a coherent policy and a vision for Australia. No-one in Australia knows what the federal opposition stand for other than saying no, no, no. (Time expired)

"Sinodinos, Sen Arthur",LP,2012-02-07,"



Senator SINODINOS
 (New South Wales) (17:17):  What a privilege it is in this matter of public importance debate to follow Senator Bilyk, who reminded us of the view of Bob Hawke on the eve of the 1990 election. She is right, he did say that about the then opposition, yet today on the front pages of Australian newspapers it is the government which is the story. That is not the making of Tony Abbott. Perhaps Tony Abbott made it more difficult for the government, but the fact of the matter is that we have a riven government, a dysfunctional government. That is the topic on the front page of all of our papers. That is not the doing of the opposition; that is the doing of people within the Labor Party, this government. 


The reason this is a dysfunctional govern­ment does not simply go back to the character of the Prime Minister or the character of the former Prime Minister; it actually goes back to 1996 when Labor went into opposition. One of their first acts in opposition was to forsake the reform program, the reform ambitions and the reform achievements of the Hawke and Keating governments. They did not want to talk about them. They let them go. They then spent 11½ years in opposition waiting for something to turn up. I can remember Kim Beazley, when he was Leader of the Opposition, saying when the then coalition government introduced the GST: 'We will surf into office on the back of the GST.' In other words, 'We will wait for the GST to be implemented; some people may feel upset but we will capitalise on that misery and we will get back into government.' On it went for 11½ years. The only Leader of the Opposition who had a go at coming up with a new Labor policy—a third way, if you like, and this he did largely before he became opposition leader—was Mark Latham. When he wrote about enterprise workers and the like he showed he was doing some thinking in opposition, but when he became opposition leader the machine men of the Labor Party said: 'No, that's not the way to win. You've got to look at the polls; you've got to look at exploiting the negatives of the government of the day, and if you do that really well you'll become the government.' It did not work. It did not work then; it has never worked. You have to come to government with some conviction, some framework for governing.


Even though I had left by then, I remember well the 2007 election campaign. The Labor campaign was essentially based on the longevity of the then government, on the age of the then Prime Minister and on the fact that the Labor opposition would do some things that the government had not wished to do such as signing the Kyoto protocol. That was it, that was the policy platform, and then a few gimmicks like Fuelwatch and GroceryWatch. Do you want to go through the list? They held out the hope that they could do something about the cost of living, but it was a false hope. They were all gimmicks. That was not a framework for government; that was not a vision for changing the country or a vision for reform. Then they were blessed with a Prime Minister who decided he would try to do everything at once because he was the smartest person in the room. No problem had been adequately dealt with unless Kevin Rudd had looked at it. So we had all these reviews. Initially, we wondered what sort of government this was with all these reviews. Then all of a sudden we had a plethora of things that were on the agenda for COAG. We were going to have big health reforms—big this and big that. 


Then the saviour came along for this government—the global financial crisis. It finally gave them an objective outside of themselves, outside the political framework. Something real was happening that they had to address. What did they do? They spent and they spent up big. The coalition support­ed some spending in response to the global financial crisis. We had to be prudent, but we did not support the full extent of spending that the government had in mind. We did not support the pink batts and we did not support the Building the Education Revolution, because it became clear after a while that the global financial crisis became an excuse for spending for spending's sake—spending for ideological reasons. I do not have anything against building school halls, but the priority in education in this country today is to improve the quality of the curriculum. Senator Bilyk talked about the work that Labor is doing on the curriculum, but that is simply a continuation of the work initiated by Brendan Nelson and Julie Bishop. I can remember Kevin Rudd, and even Kim Carr, at a higher education function talking—boasting almost—about how the global financial crisis was the last nail in the coffin of neoliberal ideology. It was going to be the last nail in the coffin of capitalism. And Rudd boasted that he would put government at the centre of the economy. He went back to his maiden speech, where he talked about government at the centre of the economy. If you want the economy to prosper you put people at the centre of the economy—the entrepreneurs, the risk takers, the workers of Australia—not the dead hand of government. 


What I am saying is that this is a government which, from the beginning, had no real program for government. It was just reacting to events. And this has gone on and on. And when Kevin Rudd was finally dispatched it was not because of some great clash of principle within the parliamentary Labor Party. He was dispatched because the polls said he had to go. And in many ways that also sealed the fate of his successor, Julia Gillard. She came to power simply off the back of the fact that if you live by the polls you die by the polls. What sort of aspiration to leadership is that?


Ms Gillard made statements before that feted election in 2010 such as, 'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead,' and then, for the sake of retaining power, she broke that promise so quickly after the elect­ion. Then she dissembled and was forced, after an extended period, to admit: 'Okay, we did make a promise. But circum­stances changed: we had to get around the roadblock set up by the other side.' That is not leader­ship. The Prime Minister made a commit­ment to the Independent Andrew Wilkie and then, when the going got tough, she welshed on it. No wonder he is ready potentially to support a no confidence motion against this government! He does not trust them. He is not the only one; the Australian people do not trust this govern­ment. They have come to that view and they keep expressing it—even in the polls so beloved of certain members of the Labor Party.


Going forward, the challenge over the next period for the next, coalition govern­ment will be what to do about the mess that it potentially inherits. Tony Abbott the other day at the Press Club gave what he called a landmark speech. It was a framework speech where he brought together many of the policies he has had for the last 18 months as leader.




Senator FEENEY:
  What an orator!




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Ludlam
):  Order!




Senator SINODINOS:
  Yes, he had a critique of the government but it was largely a speech about the positives—what he would do as Prime Minister. And he talked about the importance of cutting spending. He did talk about cutting spending. He said:


The first object of any government is to do no harm. 


That is what he said. He also spoke of government doing fewer things better.




Government senators interjecting
—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order! Senator Sinodinos, resume your seat. This debate has mostly been reasonably respectful. I ask that Senator Sinodinos be heard in silence.




Senator SINODINOS:
  Recently, Tony Abbott spoke of government doing fewer things but better. The next, coalition govern­ment will forensically examine government spending and reduce that spending in an intelligent and strategic manner. We will ask the questions. What is the problem that this spending is meant to address? Is the public sector best equipped to deal with it and are there better, more cost-effective approaches? We do not just believe, for ideological reasons, that the public sector should do it. 


I come to the NBN, the National Broadband Network, which was hatched on a coaster on a VIP aircraft by Senator Conroy and the then Prime Minister Mr Rudd because that is the only way they could get face time to talk about the matter. How can you determine that a $30 billion, $40 billion or $50 billion major national infrastructure project can be agreed in those terms? Some people say, 'Look, it's blue sky. You've got to spend the money because there will be big benefits.' But we are talking about $40 billion or $50 billion worth of public revenue.


Tony Abbott is committed to an approach on infrastructure where there will be a rolling 15-year program, with projects being priorit­ised using published cost-benefit analysis. Transparency in this project assess­ment will improve confidence in government decision-making and promote better outcomes. And this approach will ensure that major progra­ms are not treated in a cavalier fashion and are not, like Labor's NBN, approved without adequate scrutiny from a public interest perspective. 


These are major issues. The Australian people regard the government as they regard their own housekeeping, and when they see the government splurging, spending too much or not thinking about what it is spend­ing on, they think, 'What are the consequen­ces at the household level of doing that?' And they then think, 'We don't want those consequences at the national level. We want a government that will live within its means—a government that will not be ideological but will be pragmatic about the best way to deal with a social problem; a government, ultimately, which keeps all of its election commitments.'


On that last note may I say that under the Howard government we had a charter of budget honesty. In the future, if there are Labor governments, we will need a charter of election commitment honesty, because the experience of the last few years is that Labor cannot be trusted to keep its word.

Senator FAULKNER
 (New South Wales) (17:27):  This afternoon the oppositi­on invites us to waste an hour of the Senate's valuable time debating the government's capacity to focus on the core functions of government! One thing is certain in such a debate: unlike the Liberal Party, the Austra­lian Labor Party is able to put the interests of the nation above the demands of politics. And that is no better demonstrated than by the way in which the government has managed the Australian economy. The Australian economy is strong. Consider how our economy compares with that of other advanced economies. Unempl­oyment is low. Growth is steady. Debt is low. Interest rates under the Labor govern­ment have reached lows not seen by the previous, coalition government. Inflation is contained. All of this has happened while there has been a huge investment pipeline and at a time of unprecedented international economic insta­bility. That is focusing on the core functions of government. The Labor government has steered Australia through the worst global recession since the Great Depression, well over 70 years ago, and it has done it with solid employment growth, a strong invest­ment pipeline and a budget position that is literally the envy of every other nation in the Western world. That is focusing on the core functions of government.


Unemployment in Australia is currently at 5.2 per cent, lower than every major advanced economy in the world bar one, at a time when unemployment has reached 10.4 per cent in the euro area and 8.3 per cent in the United States. Since Labor was elected four years ago, 750,000 jobs have been created, including 100,000 jobs in the last year alone, and the government is on track to create another 300,000 jobs this year. That is focusing on the core functions of government.


After back-to-back interest rate cuts in November and December last year, the official cash rate today is at 4.25 per cent, down from 6.25 per cent when the previous coalition government left office. That is focusing on the core functions of government. For the first time in our history, this country has received a AAA rating from all three global ratings agencies, something that was never achieved by the coalition government. That is focusing on the core functions of government.


This government has made really vital investments in infrastructure to expand the capacity and productivity of the economy. We have doubled investment in roads, railways and ports. Investment now stands at $36 billion. That is focusing on the core functions of government. We have imple­mented the largest national infrastructure project in Australia's history, the National Broadband Network, which will deliver increased economic growth and productivity in the years ahead. That is focusing on the core functions of government.


The Labor government is giving Austra­lians a fairer share of the benefits of the mining boom. The MRRT will boost retire­ment savings through increased superannu­ation contributions, provide tax breaks for small businesses and cut the company tax rate. That is focusing on the core functions of government.


Sound economic management has enabled this government to deliver Australia's first paid parental leave scheme, bringing Australia up to date with the rest of the developed world after years of inaction from the previous government. That is focusing on the core functions of government.


The Labor government has modernised 9½ thousand Australian schools, with a doubling of investment in new classrooms, halls, laboratories and the like through the Building the Education Revolution program. That is focusing on the core functions of government.


This government has ended the blame game in health by providing proper funding for hospitals, achieved through a historic deal with the states at COAG. It will mean more doctors, more nurses, more beds and less waste, together with better accounta­bility and community control. That is focus­ing on the core functions of government.


The Labor government has increased the age pension, is improving aged care to give older Australians more choice and control, and has invested $2.2 million into a mental health package that delivers additional services with a greater focus on prevention and early intervention. That is focusing on the core functions of government—as is, in my view, the repealing of the draconian and unfair Work Choices laws.


We have recently seen a historic fair pay decision for 150,000 of Australia's lowest workers in the social and community servi­ces sector. As we know, 120,000 of those workers are women who perform valuable roles in our community working with people with disabilities and assisting the homeless and victims of domestic violence. And, of course, that is focusing on the core functions of government, as is what the government has done in starting to build the foundations of the nation's first ever National Disability Insurance Scheme. It is a very strong record. Instead of this endless carping, whingeing and negativity, perhaps it is about time the opposition started to acknowledge it.

Senator MASON
 (Queensland) (18:54):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the document.


I will make just a few remarks about the annual report of the Australian Curriculum Assessment and Reporting Authority, known as ACARA, for 2010-11. In particular, I refer to pages 10 and 11 of the report, which say:


The Australian Curriculum needs to be relevant to the lives of students and to address the contemporary issues they face. With these considerations and the Melbourne Declaration in mind, the curriculum gives special attention to three priorities:


Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander histories and cultures


Asia and Australia’s engagement with Asia


sustainability.


These cross-curriculum priorities have a strong but varying presence depending on their relevance to the learning areas.


By way of explanation, the Melbourne declaration, which charted the particular three cross-curriculum perspectives to be given to Australia's schoolchildren, was drafted by education bureaucrats—not by teachers or parents or elected officials. Not at all; it was drafted by education bureaucrats. Do they reflect community opinion? I would hazard a guess that they do not. Rather than a mainstream document representing broad community consensus, we have ended up with a product that one might say neatly distils rather trendy views about education.


Without any public consultation we now have a national curriculum that will be saddled with the three cross-curriculum perspectives I mentioned: Aboriginal, Asian and environmental. You might ask whether in fact the national curriculum needs these overarching perspectives. I suspect it does not, but, even if it does, why those three? You are right. There is nothing at all wrong with Indigenous, environmental and Asian themes. Indeed, they are valid. But there are plenty of other ones that are equally or perhaps even more valid and that are not mentioned in the Melbourne declaration by the trendy bureaucrats who drafted it. For example, why wouldn't Australia's national curriculum echo themes such as the role and importance of liberal democratic institutions in shaping the society students live in? Wouldn't you think that was more important? Apparently it is not. What about, perhaps, the heritage and impact of the Judaeo-Christian western tradition that touches on every aspect of life in a modern Western country such as Australia, on everything from the arts to literature to science and the law? Wouldn't that be a more appropriate or comprehensive overarching theme for Australia's natural curriculum? I would have thought so, but the professional bureaucrats do not. Indeed, what about the role of science and technology in the material progress of humankind, including its contri­bution to both creating and then solving the problems inherent in such progress? That is not a bad overarching theme either, is it? But, no, what the professional bureaucrats decided on was that Aboriginal, Asian and environmental themes were more important. Becoming very practical—not too concept­ual or theoretical—what about the national curriculum including a theme that prepares students to face the challenges of life and work in the 21st century? That is a very practical overarching theme, but of course we could not have something mainstream and practical, could we? No, we have these trendy and politically correct values that have been put there not by politicians, not by the public, not even by teachers but by the professional education bureaucrats. This always worries me. It has worried me from the beginning of ACARA's existence that our national curriculum is subject to these three overarching themes.


I could go into the recent debate about getting rid of BC and AD as the date stamps for our history. We have to stop using BC and AD, to cleanse Christianity out of the national curriculum. This is all happening because a group of trendy bureaucrats have a narrow and politically correct view of Australian history and culture. It is wrong, it is not mainstream and it is not what is best for our children. (Time expired)

"Marshall, Sen Gavin",ALP,2012-02-07,"



Senator MARSHALL
 (Victoria) (18:59):  I would like to respond very briefly, particularly to some of the last comments. Senator Mason used as an example the so-called proposal to get rid of AD and BC. As he well knows, as that was brought up in the last estimates, that is not the proposal at all. There are additional terms that are used commonly across the world in academia to describe different years and different dates. All the curriculum was doing was to add those things so students would know what they are when they come across them.




Senator Mason:
  That's not right!




Senator MARSHALL:
  That is right. That was the evidence given and it was clear. There was no attempt to get rid of these terms. They were sorry that they did not make it perfectly clear at the time because they did not know there would be people out there being mischievous by trying to beat up some story about it. That was all they were trying to do. They did not feel that every time they wanted to add something new to the curriculum they would have to explain that that did not mean they were taking anything away. You would expect that to be quite self-explanatory.


It gives me some concern when Senator Mason, in mocking terminology, described these people as 'professional educational bureaucrats', as if mocking the responsibility they have.




Senator Mason:
  They're not elected!




Senator MARSHALL:
  They are professionals who study these things. I must say I would be more confident about having these professionals, who engage in what is required in the profession of education, setting the curriculum than Senator Mason, who has a very biased and political view of life, setting the curriculum from a political perspective. I think it is dangerous when politicians get involved in writing the curriculum for our students and ignoring the advice of the professionals. Senator Mason ran this line constantly through the estimates process. He ought not keep doing it. Senator Mason, yours is a very old-fashioned view of life, and I do not think you should be imposing your biased views on everyone else and simply ignoring those who have studied and have the professional expertise to develop these things.




Senator Mason:
  Liberal democracy is old-fashioned, is it?




Senator MARSHALL:
 Acting Deputy President Crossin, Senator Mason seems to be getting in more words than I am.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Crossin
):  Order! I have called Senator Mason to order a number of times. I think because you are yelling across the chamber you have not quite heard what I have said. Continue, Senator Marshall.




Senator MARSHALL:
  I do not say for a minute that Senator Mason is not passionate about these things, because he raises them on a regular basis. I do not question his commit­ment to education, because I know he is deeply committed to it. But I do caution him against simply saying that, as a politician coming from a political view, we should be making decisions about professional educa­tion without taking the appropriate advice. We have professional bodies set up to advise government and to advise educa­tional syst­ems on the appropriate curriculum.


This country needs a national curriculum. It has been so long coming, we have different standards and different curricula in every state. Finally this government has the courage to set some of these reforms in process. Senator Mason, you should not take that as an opportunity to impose on the rest of the world in the educational system your particular political view of life. Quite frankly, politicians should butt out and leave it to the professionals who have done this job and will continue to do this work.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Marshall, are you seeking leave to continue your remarks later?




Senator MARSHALL:
  No.

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2012-02-07,"



Senator FAULKNER
 (New South Wales) (19:05):  At 10:30 am on 3 January this year, the Sydney Cricket Ground celebrated a special milestone. When the Australians took to the field against India at the SCG, it was the 100th test match to be played at that ground. The SCG joined Lords and the Melbourne Cricket Ground as one of the only three grounds in the world to have hosted 100 cricket tests. As I promised last year, I was a face in the crowd for this historic occasion and I can inform the Senate that that 100th test match was a success. It was a success for the spectators who were there, a success for the ground, a success for the SCG staff and the SCG Trust, and it was a success for the Australian cricket team who beat India convincingly by an innings and 68 runs and went on to win the series and the Border-Gavaskar Trophy. A special mention must go to the Australian captain, Michael Clarke, who scored a historic 329 runs not out. It was his fourth test century as captain, his highest test score and also the highest test innings ever scored in an Australia-India test and the highest test innings ever scored at the SCG.


On the Indian side, the champion Indian batsman Sachin Tendulkar was very warmly received by the SCG crowd. Despite his batting average from seven previous innings at the ground being an incredible 221, the Little Master failed to score his 100th century in international cricket at the SCG. This was a disappointment to many, and I would have to admit they included me. This tour may well be the last time we see Sachin play test cricket in Australia, and it also might be the last time we will see those other champion Indian batsmen Rahul Dravid and VVS Laxman.


It was not just performances in the middle that made this 100th test a success. The Sydney test has become an important focal point for raising awareness of breast cancer and money to fight it. The third day of the Sydney test, now popularly known as Jane McGrath Day, was a sea of pink shirts, hats, bandanas, clothing and accessories of all kinds, all in aid of the McGrath Foundation. No other ground in the world can boast such a day, with such an important message. The growing success of Jane McGrath Day is a credit, I think, to the McGrath Foundation, to Cricket Australia and to the SCG Trust. Since its inception three years ago, over $2.2 million has been successfully raised at the ground to assist over 10,000 Australian families experiencing breast cancer and to support 68 breast care nurses in communities across Australia. The 100th test at the SCG was commemorated by 12 talented Austra­lian artists tasked with capturing the historic occasion on canvas. The finished works were donated to the 100th test art auction, which itself successfully raised over than $20,000 for the McGrath Foundation.


I must say that you do not make it to 100 test matches without showing your age, and the Sydney Cricket Ground is no exception. The SCG Trust used the occasion of the 100th test to announce work to build a state-of-the-art modern pavilion to replace the 78-year-old MA Noble Stand, as well as the Bradman and Dally Messenger stands, and that work is going to begin soon. The $186 million facelift will offer patrons seats closer to the field of play and more seats under cover, and no part of the new structure will obstruct any spectator's view of play. The SCG's new video screen will be twice the size of the existing screen at the ground and the largest at any sporting ground in Australia. The new development will also include improved media facilities, corporate suites, AFL dressing rooms, bars and eateries with views of the Sydney skyline, and secure player entry. The iconic clock tower will be retained and the new modern pavilion's style, I am assured, will complement the historic members and ladies stands. Tonight I want to acknowledge the support of both the New South Wales and federal governments in making funds available for this development. The development is anticipated to lift the capacity of the ground from 45,758 to just below 48,000. It will be finished ahead of the Ashes test match between Australia and England in January 2014.


Here is a final word about the SCG from a man considered to be one of the greatest batsmen in the history of cricket, who has scored more runs and more centuries than any other player in either test cricket or one-day internationals but who will inevitably be disappointed with his two innings of 41 and 80 in the SCG's 100th test match and his 186th test match—that is, Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar. To finish, I quote him:


It's a terrific ground, a special place. I love the atmosphere inside. It's wonderful.
