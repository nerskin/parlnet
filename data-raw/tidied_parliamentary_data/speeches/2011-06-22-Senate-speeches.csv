That this bill be now read a second time.


I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard.


Leave granted.




The speech read as follows—



The Intellectual Property Laws Amendment (Raising the Bar) Bill 2011 is a major reform of the intellectual property system. It is the culmination of two years of extensive consultation with interested parties. The bill will improve many parts of the intellectual property system, including the Patents, Trade Marks, Copyright, Designs and Plant Breeder's Rights Acts. The bill will ensure that Australia maintains a world class intellectual property system: an IP system that fosters Australian innovation in the modern global economy.


Australian innovation is critical to the resilience of the economy through changing times. Innovation makes our economy more competitive. But the extent of innovation necessary to keep our economy competitive can't happen on its own. In addition to requiring support and investment, innovation requires a strong intellectual property system. 


A strong IP system underpins investment in innovation. This was recognised in Powering Ideas, the Government's innovation agenda for the 21st century. A strong IP system provides investors an opportunity to recoup the investments necessary to bring their ideas to the marketplace. The IP system also gives the public and innovators the tools necessary for further innovation, through published information about new technology.


As also recognised in Powering Ideas – ""The trick is to get the balance right: too little protection will discourage people from innovating because the returns are uncertain; too much protection may discourage people from innovating because the pathways to discovery are blocked by other intellectual property owners"". 


The reforms set out in this Bill seek to improve that balance by addressing six key areas:


Patent standards;


Research freedom;


Reducing delays in resolving patent and trade mark applications;


Improvements to the attorney profession;


Trade mark and copyright infringement; and


Technical improvements to the IP system. 




Schedule 1 
-
 Patent Standards



First, the Bill seeks to raise patent standards. This addresses concerns that Australia's standards are lower than standards elsewhere, which discourages export of the technology we develop and inhibits growth of Australian business. Lower Australian patent standards actually disadvantage Australian patent holders, who should be able to take their inventions overseas with confidence that they will qualify for patent protection in Australia's major trading partners. Lower patent standards may also clutter the Australian innovation landscape with broad patents that would not meet the standards of our major trading partners, getting in the way of Australians who might otherwise be able to develop inventions in new areas. 


A theme in this Bill is one of recalibrating and raising Australian standards, to align them more closely with those of other major trading partners around the world. Some patent standards around the world have developed to the point where there is an aligned approach internationally. In such cases where there is an aligned global approach, the Bill raises Australian patenting standards to that common approach. 


The Bill raises patent standards in three important areas.


First it raises standards with respect to the information provided in patent applications and specifications. Disclosure is a cornerstone of the patent system. Patents are an exchange between inventors and the public. In exchange for a 20 year monopoly on commercialisation, the innovator must tell the public how their idea works.  This disclosure, allows for potential follow-on innovators to build on initial work to produce even better innovations.


The Bill raises standards to require that the patent right is consistent with the information provided in the patent specification. There must be enough information disclosed for the public to make and use the invention. Also, a specific, substantial and credible use for the invention must also be disclosed and the scope of the claims for patent protection must not extend beyond what has been disclosed.


Importantly, the amended provisions mirror similar provisions in the United Kingdom and Europe. It is intended that Australian courts will have regard to developments in the law in the courts of these other jurisdictions when interpreting the new provisions, and will develop Australian law in a consistent fashion. This will help Australian exporters have the confidence that a patent granted in Australia is likely to be matched by a patent granted in major overseas markets.


Secondly, the Bill raises the standards for inventiveness. Raising the standards for inventiveness allows the patent system to better recognise the global innovation environment and reflect the modern economy's improved access to information. We must not grant a patent for something that has been done before. The Bill ensures that the patent system takes into account all published information that is reasonably available and accessible to the public. It will also ensure that this information is assessed against the background of knowledge of the skilled person, regardless of where that person resides. 


Thirdly, the Bill ensures that a consistent standard of proof is applied by the Commissioner of Patents in all decisions and expands the grounds that the Commissioner can consider during examination and re-examination. Someone who seeks a patent will bear the burden of showing that they are entitled to patent protection. The Bill requires the Commissioner to be satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, that a patent, if granted, will be valid. 


Taken together, these changes ensure that only high quality patents are granted in Australia. They make sure that the scope of disclosure is commensurate with the monopoly granted. They will make sure that patents are only granted for innovations that warrant patent protection. They will also ensure that the Commissioner of Patents can apply robust standards when assessing whether or not a patent should be granted and whether or not a patent should be revoked.




Schedule 2
 -
 Research freedom



The second category of reforms responds to concerns that patent rights can sometimes deter or block innovation by discouraging researchers from developing further innovations or spin-offs. We need to set our researchers free and ensure that the patent system encourages further innovation. The key reform in this category introduces an explicit provision permitting experimentation to be conducted without infringing patent rights. This amendment will give comfort to researchers in Australia, and is strongly supported by Australia's research sector.


The amendment strikes a balance between the rights of patentees and the rights of subsequent researchers. The exemption protects researchers and follow-on innovators as long as what they are doing is predominantly for research and experimental purposes. The exemption is intended to allow for some areas of commercial activity—for example, where the researchers are doing their work under contract, and are accepting payment to do experiments to improve on, or test a patented invention to see how it works. However, if the purpose is primarily commercial—such as where the researcher is seeking to commercialise the patented invention—the amendment protects the interests of patent owners because it will not apply where the main purpose is to commercialise the invention or manufacture it for sale.


A second reform introduces an amendment to exempt research activities necessary for gaining pre-market or pre-manufacturing regulatory approval from infringement. This ensures that a patent owner gets no more than the statutory period of protection. Such an exemption already exists for particular regulatory activities in the pharmaceutical industry. The amendment expands this exemption to apply to all technologies. Currently, a patentee can delay a competitor's entry into the market when the patentee's patent expires by threatening the competitor with infringement proceedings if they seek to do the work necessary to gain regulatory approval during the patent term. This gives the patentee a de facto extension on the term of their patent. The amendments will enable competitors to make the preparations necessary to enter the market as soon as a patent has ceased or expired. The amendments will not, however, allow the competitor to stockpile their product during the patent term, or make or use it in any way that detracts from the patentee's exclusive rights to commercial advantage from their invention during the term of the patent.




Schedule 3 - Reducing delays in resolving applications



The third category of reforms is aimed at making the patent and trade mark application process more efficient. These changes will speed up the processes for determining applications for IP rights. They will also prevent tactical use of the system by those who profit from delay. The amendments target two key areas.


The first area is the process of opposing patent and trade mark applications. Opposition processes permit any person who might be adversely impacted by issue of an IP right to come forward and oppose it. Oppositions are intended to provide for a swift and efficient administrative resolution where a third party has concerns about the grant of an IP right. However, oppositions have become increasingly more complicated and protracted. The Bill introduces a series of reforms aimed at resolving opposition proceedings more efficiently while still ensuring a fair outcome, and ensuring that any delays are truly unavoidable ones.


The second area relates to what are called 'divisional' patent applications. Patent systems around the world permit a patent application to be divided into one or more divisional applications, primarily to account for circumstances where more than one invention is claimed in the original application. However, the provisions are not as clear as desirable and sometimes divisional applications are used to delay finalisation of a particular invention or frustrate a third party. The reforms tighten the provisions for divisional applications, particularly timeframes for making applications. This will reduce opportunities to delay finalisation of applications. 




Schedule 4 - Improvements to the attorney profession



A fourth category of reforms improves various aspects of Australia's intellectual property profession. If we expect more from intellectual property attorneys—to meet the higher standards provided for in the Bill, it is reasonable to extend to them the privileges available to other professions. The Bill makes two key changes to the patent and trade marks attorney professions in Australia.


The first change will permit patent and trade mark attorneys to conduct all aspects of their business through a corporate structure. Patent and trade mark attorneys are currently unable to do this, and this restriction is enforced through criminal sanctions. This is at odds with how other professions are regulated and are able to conduct their businesses in Australia. The Bill amends the Patents and Trade Marks Acts to allow a company to act and describe itself as a patent attorney. The new provisions are modelled closely on corresponding provisions of the Model Law for the regulation of the legal profession around Australia, with some variations necessitated by the different function and structure of the two professions. This is a reform that has been long sought-after by the patent attorney profession, and aligns that profession more closely with other professions in Australia.


The second change will extend the privilege that attaches to certain communications. At present, only certain communications to and from attorneys who are registered in Australia are privileged. In a globalised economy, in which IP rights are sought and prosecuted around the world, it is important that the privilege in Australia extends more broadly than only to Australian registered attorneys. The Bill extends privilege to overseas attorneys who are authorised to provide intellectual property advice and better aligns patent and trade mark attorney privilege with that attaching to communications to and from lawyers.  Similar amendments, applying to privilege attaching to communications to and from legal practitioners, were introduced by this government through the Evidence Amendment Act 2008.




Schedule 5 - Trade mark and copyright infringement



The fifth category of reforms introduced by the Bill will improve the ability of trade mark and copyright owners to enforce their rights. The overall objective of these reforms is to strengthen copyright and trade mark rights. Copyright and trade mark rights will be strengthened by improving the mechanisms for enforcing the rights. Trade mark rights will also be strengthened by improving the remedies available when the rights have been found to have been infringed. We are setting higher standards for the granting of intellectual property rights. It is reasonable that, where rights are granted, that higher standards also apply to their enforcement. There are three areas for improvement.


The first relates to the criminal penalties available for infringements of registered trade marks. Criminal penalties play an important role in trade mark enforcement, by deterring infringements and punishing infringers. There have been concerns expressed that Australia's criminal penalties are too low to operate as an effective deterrent. The Bill addresses this concern by increasing the criminal penalties for existing offences. Higher penalties will be more effective in deterring infringement of trade mark rights. The changes also introduce some summary offences, but with lower fault elements and lower penalties. This will provide greater flexibility to law enforcement agencies when prosecuting trade mark crimes. These changes also bring the criminal penalties under the Trade Marks Act into closer alignment with those under the Copyright Act.


The second area of improvements to IP enforcement relates to the civil remedies available for infringements of trade marks. These amendments will introduce a further remedy in civil actions for trade mark infringement. At the moment, the trade mark owner can seek damages, an account of profits, or injunctive relief. This is out of step with the remedies available under other IP laws, which also allow the IP rights owner to obtain what are called 'additional' or 'exemplary' damages. The aim of awarding additional damages is to increase the deterrence for infringers. The Bill amends the Trade Marks Act to introduce exemplary damages as an additional remedy to trade mark infringement.


The third area of improvements relates to the powers of the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service to intercept goods that infringe copyrights or registered trade marks at the border. The Bill improves the existing arrangements by permitting Customs officials to provide more information to copyright and trade mark owners about goods that are seized at the border. The Bill also requires that Customs only release seized goods if the importer lodges a claim for return, which must include the identity and address of the importer and be filed within a specified time period. These changes will help rights owners in deciding whether or not to commence an infringement action. And then they will also help in the commencement of infringement proceedings. 




Schedule 6 - Technical improvements to the IP system



The sixth category of reforms is a collection of technical improvements and changes, clarifications and updates to the Patents, Trade Marks, Plant Breeder's Rights and Designs Acts. The measures implemented in this category share the common themes of modernising aspects of Australia's IP system, increasing transparency in the decision-making process, and generally making the system easier to use.


In particular the amendments include a number of changes that improve the flexibility of the IP rights system for users. Examples of changes in this area are the changes to improve processes for resolving ownership disputes. Current processes can be unduly complex, making it difficult for the Commissioner to resolve disputes and correct ownership details in the patent register. The changes proposed by the bill will give the Commissioner greater flexibility to decide disputes and correct the register, ensuring that the public has correct information about who a patent has been granted to.  


Another example is extending the jurisdiction of the Federal Magistrates Court to hear trade mark and design matters. This provides innovators with the option of a less formal, speedy and cost effective alternative for considering less complex trade mark and design matters.


This Bill represents a comprehensive package of improvements to the IP system. It is the most comprehensive package of reforms in the lifetime of the current Patents Act. These changes bolster support for innovation in Australia and better equip Australians to commercialise their innovations in the evolving modern economy.

"Fifield, Sen Mitch",LP,2011-06-22,"



Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate) (11:44):  I rise to speak on the Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and Other Legislation Amendment (Further Election Commitments and Other Measures) Bill 2011.


Schedule 1 of this bill amends the A New Tax System (Family Assistance) Act 1999—A New Tax System (Family Assistance) (Administration) Act 1999—to provide for altered arrangements for advance payments of family tax benefits. It modifies the rules for determining whether an individual is eligible for an advance for family tax benefit and the amount of that advance. It also alters the rules toward reducing an individual's rate of family tax benefit part A when it comes to repayment of that advance. It also changes the terms and conditions regarding the raising of debts for the unpaid amount of the FTB advance.


The amount of the FTB advance will be more flexible than is currently the case and will function with an upper limit maximum advance of $1,000 and a lower limit minimum of $160.96 in 2011-12. From 2012-13 onwards, the maximum and minimum limits will be linked to the family tax benefit child rate for a single FTB child who is under the age of 13 years and will be indexed on 1 July of each year. In the event that an individual is repaying a previous amount, the maximum amount will be reduced by the original amount of the previous advance.


At present, fixed repayment periods apply. This bill changes the repayment periods, such that an individual can request an advance on any day and can have some flexibility toward the length of time they have to repay and the rate at which they repay. The default repayment period over which the advance will be repaid via a reduction of an individual's FTB part A instalment rate will be 26 weeks. The period of repayment can span up to two financial years and consideration is made for an individual's personal circumstances. Rather than a debt arising through the payment of an advance, an individual will repay the debt through reductions in FTB part A rate. 


Schedule 2 of the bill introduces a condition that, in order to receive the FTB part A supplement, a child turning four must undertake a health check. This measure is to commence from 1 July 2011. 


Schedule 3 amends the Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989, which introduces changes to the rules that currently apply to the child support registrar in determining an individual's adjusted taxable income when a parent's taxable income has not been formally assessed. The new rules will use a parent's previous taxable income, factoring indexation in growth of wages, in cases where a tax return has not been lodged through the ATO.


Schedule 4 would have significant implications for the regulation of insurance and compensation payments, and I am advised that the schedule would have thrown Commonwealth law into direct conflict with the law of the states and territories. This schedule comes from a government that talks about harmonising interstate business operations but, ironically, this schedule would have made it harder for business to undertake their activities. The coalition has indicated to the government that we have significant concerns about this schedule, and we indicated to the government what we thought would be the wise approach of splitting schedule 4 from the bill due to the potentially disastrous design of the schedule and the massive compliance burden that it could dump on the shoulders of business. Thankfully, the government has decided to split schedule 4 to separate it from the rest of the bill. We think that is a sensible thing to do to enable further consideration of this matter. 


Schedule 5 of the bill makes some minor amendments to the family assistance law and child support legislation to clarify some technical issues and to ensure that the legislation operates as intended. I can indicate that the opposition will support the separation of schedule 4 from the bill and, if that does occur, then we will not be opposing the legislation.

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2011-06-22,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (11:50):  The Greens have concerns with schedule 2 of this bill. This is the schedule that makes a payment for a child turning four contingent on that child having a health check, but the measure applies only to families where either parent has received income support for any part of that year. I have concerns about this part of the bill. 


As part of the government's mental health package there is funding for health checks—for social and emotional wellbeing—for children turning three. As I understand it, and after talking to various child development experts, this is a positive move. I have spoken to the government about this and about the fact that it is going to take a little while to implement—and I understand the arguments about that from the government. But now we have this legislation which ties health checks to children turning four, but only for those people who are on income support. I think that is quite discriminatory. It says, 'We think that only people on income support are not able to look after their children, so we are going to focus on them.' I also understand the government's argument that they believe, based on some of the evidence, that children from lower socioeconomic families may have more developmental problems or other health issues and that is why they are tying it to income support. However, I have spoken to child development experts, and they are saying health checks are important for all children, not just those of families on income support. So we believe that, in fact, what we should be doing if we are going to tie the supplement to family tax benefit part A is doing it for everybody so that everybody is required to have a child health check.


Not only have I been talking to child development and child health experts on that issue, I have also been looking at timing. They are saying that timing is better at three, because developmental issues are starting to develop and become manifest at that age and you are better off doing those checks earlier. What the government is doing with the social and emotional wellbeing checks would be better at three than to start at four. So here we have a piece of legislation that is getting it wrong in terms of the child health checks at four, or so the emerging evidence suggests, and ties it to those families on income support, further, in come community members' eyes, demonising those on income support and saying, 'You can't look after your children.'


We believe there is evidence to suggest that every family would benefit from having a child health check, so why not do so if the government has a mechanism where they can encourage—and what they are doing here is basically making it mandatory—having a child health check for those on income support? I know lots of families on income support who are looking after their children extremely well. They are the centre of their world. The centre of what they do is to look after the health and development of their child. What you are saying with this discriminatory mechanism is, 'We think only you people on income support may have children with development issues and are not accessing health checks for your children.'


We do not believe that is an appropriate way to look after the families of this nation. We believe that, if you are going to bring this in, you bring it in for everybody who is receiving family tax benefit part A supplement, not just those on income support. We recognise the importance of child health checks and understand that they should be when a child turns three, not when a child turns four. The government is very clear about the importance of health checks. The EM says:


… may detect developmental delays and conditions, such as problems affecting hearing and vision, which are problems that make it more difficult for children to learn when they start school. These checks will allow for early identification of health issues and intervention strategies before the child starts school.


We acknowledge that. When the Senate Community Affairs References Committee did its inquiry into hearing health in Australia, the evidence received from hearing health experts was that, although the newborn test has been introduced and is very strongly supported—I, along with many others, congratulated the government for bringing that newborn hearing test in—that does not catch all the hearing problems. There are a significant number that are not caught. So the advice that the committee received was that there should be another check of a child at some stage either before they go to school or as they start preschool. That was a recommendation that had unanimous support of the committee. There should be a preschool or second follow-up hearing test.


Let me tell you one thing. Hearing—there is an exception here which I will go into—loss and impairment does not just affect those on income support. So what are you going to do about all those other families who, for example, will not have a mandatory or compulsory child health check because they are not on income support? I know that many families do access health checks, but not all of them do. So what about those families? You are discriminating against those families because you are not then requiring it of their children, because they do not happen to be on income support. There are conditions that are not tied to those lower socioeconomic families where the government says that they have identified a larger number of developmental delays. That is another reason why we do not believe this is an appropriate approach. You can tie it to all families.


All children of Australia deserve equal treatment. The government is about identifying very early developmental delays and other conditions—as the government pointed out, hearing and vision, which are problems that make it difficult for children to learn. If the government and the state think that, as is recognised in this, it is the responsibility of the government to ensure that happens, why doesn't the government think it has responsibility for all children of all families who receive family tax benefit part A so that all children, if the parents have not been able to access or have not thought about accessing a health check, are also identified early so their developmental problems such as hearing or vision impairment or loss are identified as well?


I personally understand the importance of this. My vision problems were identified after I started school. So I do actually understand how, once you have your vision problems identified and addressed, you go from bottom of the class to significantly improved and near the top of the class. I get it. It happened to me, so I get the issue of child health checks. It is the discriminatory nature of this just applying to those on income support that we strongly object to. When you compare it to other measures this government is bringing in that we believe will have a detrimental impact on those on income support, you can see there is a pretty strong collective approach by this government to pick on and demonise those families. In the not too distant future, we will be debating in this chamber the family tax benefit supplement index freeze, which will adversely impact low-income families and those on income support. We will also be talking about the disability support pension and what you will be doing to people who apply for that that we believe discriminates against people on low incomes and income support.


We do not believe it is appropriate to focus this measure just on those on income support. All children in Australia should be the focus of the government's effort to improve the assessment of developmental delays and any conditions that may not have been picked up earlier. As I said, it is particularly important for conditions such as hearing and vision problems. We do not believe it is appropriate to make distinctions between which Australian families will be forced to get health checks and which will not.


We have concerns about the age at which this health check is being implemented. I have taken on board what the government said about that and the fact that it is going to be hard to correlate at this stage the three years and the four years because, as I understand it, the tests for social and emotional wellbeing have not been finalised and developed. Normally I would have suggested postponing the implementation of this particular schedule while you develop the coordination of these tests. However, I understand the importance of child health checks—but I understand the importance of child health checks for all Australian children and families. That is why the Greens are seeking to amend this schedule so as to delete the clauses that refer to those on income support and promote child health checks for all Australian children from families that receive the family tax benefit part A supplement.

"Arbib, Sen Mark",ALP,2011-06-22,"



Senator ARBIB
 (New South Wales—Minister for Sport, Minister for Indigenous Employment and Economic Development and Minister for Social Housing and Homelessness) (12:02):  In the Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and Other Legislation Amendment (Further Election Commitments and Other Measures) Bill 2011, the government is pleased to deliver on three further commitments made during the 2010 election to Australian families. In the first of the election commitments, we are overhauling the arrangements for advance payments of family tax benefit to better meet family needs. From 1 July 2011, the system will be much more flexible and families will have more scope to choose the size and timing of their advance payments. Under the new system, families will have help in meeting unexpected costs such as having to replace a broken down fridge or damaged school uniform and generally managing their family budget around unexpected expenses such as car registration. This new flexibility could mean some families will avoid higher credit card bills or high-interest small loans.


Between certain minimum and maximum amounts, families will be able to choose the value of their own advance payment. The minimum amount will be the same for all families: 3.75 per cent of the maximum standard rate for a child aged under 13, giving a minimum advance amount of around $160. The maximum amount will be linked to each separate family's usual rate of payment. Generally this will mean that a maximum of 7.5 per cent of that rate will be available for advance payment. For a family with one child under 13 and not receiving rent assistance, this would give a maximum advance amount of around $320. For a family with two children under 13 and not receiving rent assistance, the maximum advance would be around $640. The maximum advance would be higher for a family that is receiving rent assistance. An overall maximum will apply for all families. This will be set initially at $1,000 in 2011-12 and will be maintained at the same percentage of the maximum standard rate for one child under 13 as in the first year. Repayment of the advance will be through adjustments to families' ongoing fortnightly family tax benefit part A entitlements.


This new system will free families from the current confines of receiving and repaying advances within two set periods of the year: 1 January to 30 June and 1 July to 31 December. Families will be able to request more of their entitlements in advance at any point in the year and the advance will be recovered in the following six months. However, advance payment requests will not be approved by Centrelink if they would result in financial hardship. Families making repeated requests will also be assessed to see whether they may benefit from financial advice or financial counselling.


In the second of the election commitments delivered by this bill, a new requirement will be set up for income support recipient parents or carers of four-year-olds to give their children a healthy start for school. This initiative will make the family tax benefit part A supplement conditional for these families on their children going through a health assessment such as the Healthy Kids Check. In this way, we will ensure that children are healthy, fit and ready to learn when they start school. The check will help early detection of lifestyle risk factors and delayed development and illness such as vision and hearing problems. The health check will also offer guidance for families on healthy lifestyles and early intervention strategies. Research tells us these opportunities will be particularly important for low-income families, where a good education is so important in helping to break the patterns of disadvantage. In working with this new arrangement from 1 July 2011, parents will need to show Centrelink that the check has been done. There will be provision to waive the new requirement in exceptional circumstances such as when the child has a severe disability or terminal illness.


In the third election commitment delivered by this bill, the current policy of child support assessments of using a default income figure when a parent fails to lodge or is late with his or her tax return will be replaced with a more accurate process. Under current arrangements, the child support assessment for a parent in these situations is based on a figure equal to two-thirds of male total average weekly earnings. However, this figure often understates the parent's actual income. A more accurate child-support assessment and therefore better support for children will be produced by the new process, which will generally be the parent's last known taxable income indexed by the growth in average wages. However, if the current two-thirds method would produce a higher income, that figure will be used instead. Lastly, there are some minor clarifications that will be made to several family assistance and child support provisions. These minor amendments do not change existing policy.

Senator ARBIB
 (New South Wales—Minister for Sport, Minister for Indigenous Employment and Economic Development and Minister for Social Housing and Homelessness) (12:07):  I table a supplementary explanatory memorandum relating to the government amendments to be moved to this bill. The memorandum was circulated in the chamber earlier today. I move government amendment (1) on sheet AE217:


(1)   Clause 2, page 2 (table item 3), omit the table item.


We also oppose schedule 4 in the following terms:


(2)   Schedule 4, page 39 (line 1) to page 50 (line 11), to be opposed.


The government is committed to a targeted and efficient social security system. We remain committed to streamlining the process of notifying Centrelink when payments are made by compensation payers and insurers. This initiative is contained in schedule 4 of the bill in its current form.


The government has worked constructively with the insurance sector to ensure that the initiative can be implemented as intended. Schedule 4 will be withdrawn from the bill to allow further consultation and discussions with the insurance sector to finalise some outstanding issues. We remain committed to the initiative. Once implemented, it will help ensure people are paid their correct Centrelink entitlements and avoid debt and other payments.

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (12:09):  by leave—I move Greens amendments (1) and (2) on sheet 7099 together:


(1)   Schedule 2, item 3, page 27 (lines 25 to 27), omit subparagraph 61A(1)(b)(iii).


(2)   Schedule 2, item 3, page 28 (lines 30 to 32), omit subparagraph 61A(2)(b)(iii).


I will not speak for very long on these amendments because I articulated in my speech in the second reading debate our concerns about schedule 2. We believe that it focuses unfairly on just those on income support, in that it attempts to say that only those families on income support need to be or should be required to have mandatory health checks in order to access family tax benefit part A supplement, and we believe that this should be extended to all families who receive that particular supplement.


I did listen to the minister's second reading summing up comments and I would point out that development delays and various other conditions, as we talked about earlier, such as hearing and vision, do occur in children other than just those children who are from families on income support. We believe that, to make this fair, this amendment should apply to all Australian families who receive that particular supplement. I commend the amendments to the chamber.

Senator ARBIB
 (New South Wales—Minister for Sport, Minister for Indigenous Employment and Economic Development and Minister for Social Housing and Homelessness) (12:11):  From the government's perspective, the amendments are not acceptable. The new requirement will start on 1 July this year and will help ensure that 92,000 children each year get a preschool health assessment. The government's measure focuses on income support families because there is clear evidence not only that children from low-income families begin school less well prepared but also that that early gap persists and even widens as children progress through school if not addressed early. For example, a 2010 review of the research evidence by the Australian Medical Association concluded that:


Poor families also may have inadequate or limited access to community resources that promote and support children’s development and school readiness. Poor children are at greater risk than those from higher income families for a range of problems, including detrimental effects on IQ, poor academic achievement, poor socio-emotional functioning, developmental delays, behavioural problems, poor nutrition, low birth weight, and respiratory disease.


Data from The Longitudinal Study of Australian Childrenalso showsthat children from financially disadvantaged families have a lower readiness for school and are at greater risk of development delay than those from higher-income families. Further, there is evidence that socioeconomic background can be a factor in whether children are likely to access health services.


The evidence supports the government's moves to use the family tax benefit part A supplement to encourage these families to make sure they get their child to do a health check provided free by the states and territories and the Commonwealth through the MBS.

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (12:12):  Minister, I understand that there are many families in this country who would be described as the working poor who are not on income support but would still be classed as lower socioeconomic. If the argument is that you are only targeting poor families, it may come as a surprise to some in government but there are many families in this country who are working poor, who are not on income support, who should also, under your definition, benefit from these measures. How many families who have low incomes and who are not on income support does the government think could benefit from compulsory child health checks—which is what this measure requires?

What the government is attempting to do here is to target the policy to areas of greatest need, with the backing of evidence through the research I have mentioned.

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (12:14):  For a start, I always find the governments costings quite entertaining. I would like an explanation as to why it would double the cost. It is my understanding that families can access MBS child health checks. There is the requirement for the provision of additional health checks. I am wondering where that data is coming from when, as I understand it, families can access MBS child health checks. I do understand the issue around various states having different requirements and different health checks, but, firstly, why will it cost double; and, secondly, given your explanation of why they are so important, is that investment for additional families not worth while, given the importance of child health checks?

I wonder whether the government has looked at whether that is, in fact, going to have an impact on some families and whether some families will say, 'We're not going to do this because you're requiring this of me, as someone on income support, because (a) you're implying that I cannot look after my child and (b) there is the impact it has had by being required to do something in the same way that income management has had an impact on a number of people.'

This is my final question because I realise that time is short. It is my understanding of the requirements for child health checks in the Northern Territory that a lot of the conditions have not been followed up. There has not been a significant improvement in child health for various reasons. Developmental delays are identified. Is the funding in place for the 92,000 that you say will be assessed under this particular provision? Will there be support to deal with any issues that are identified, given that we have seen some significant problems with child health checks in the Northern Territory?

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate) (11:44):  I rise to speak on the Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and Other Legislation Amendment (Further Election Commitments and Other Measures) Bill 2011.


Schedule 1 of this bill amends the A New Tax System (Family Assistance) Act 1999—A New Tax System (Family Assistance) (Administration) Act 1999—to provide for altered arrangements for advance payments of family tax benefits. It modifies the rules for determining whether an individual is eligible for an advance for family tax benefit and the amount of that advance. It also alters the rules toward reducing an individual's rate of family tax benefit part A when it comes to repayment of that advance. It also changes the terms and conditions regarding the raising of debts for the unpaid amount of the FTB advance.


The amount of the FTB advance will be more flexible than is currently the case and will function with an upper limit maximum advance of $1,000 and a lower limit minimum of $160.96 in 2011-12. From 2012-13 onwards, the maximum and minimum limits will be linked to the family tax benefit child rate for a single FTB child who is under the age of 13 years and will be indexed on 1 July of each year. In the event that an individual is repaying a previous amount, the maximum amount will be reduced by the original amount of the previous advance.


At present, fixed repayment periods apply. This bill changes the repayment periods, such that an individual can request an advance on any day and can have some flexibility toward the length of time they have to repay and the rate at which they repay. The default repayment period over which the advance will be repaid via a reduction of an individual's FTB part A instalment rate will be 26 weeks. The period of repayment can span up to two financial years and consideration is made for an individual's personal circumstances. Rather than a debt arising through the payment of an advance, an individual will repay the debt through reductions in FTB part A rate. 


Schedule 2 of the bill introduces a condition that, in order to receive the FTB part A supplement, a child turning four must undertake a health check. This measure is to commence from 1 July 2011. 


Schedule 3 amends the Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989, which introduces changes to the rules that currently apply to the child support registrar in determining an individual's adjusted taxable income when a parent's taxable income has not been formally assessed. The new rules will use a parent's previous taxable income, factoring indexation in growth of wages, in cases where a tax return has not been lodged through the ATO.


Schedule 4 would have significant implications for the regulation of insurance and compensation payments, and I am advised that the schedule would have thrown Commonwealth law into direct conflict with the law of the states and territories. This schedule comes from a government that talks about harmonising interstate business operations but, ironically, this schedule would have made it harder for business to undertake their activities. The coalition has indicated to the government that we have significant concerns about this schedule, and we indicated to the government what we thought would be the wise approach of splitting schedule 4 from the bill due to the potentially disastrous design of the schedule and the massive compliance burden that it could dump on the shoulders of business. Thankfully, the government has decided to split schedule 4 to separate it from the rest of the bill. We think that is a sensible thing to do to enable further consideration of this matter. 


Schedule 5 of the bill makes some minor amendments to the family assistance law and child support legislation to clarify some technical issues and to ensure that the legislation operates as intended. I can indicate that the opposition will support the separation of schedule 4 from the bill and, if that does occur, then we will not be opposing the legislation. 

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,4,2
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2011-06-22,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (11:50):  The Greens have concerns with schedule 2 of this bill. This is the schedule that makes a payment for a child turning four contingent on that child having a health check, but the measure applies only to families where either parent has received income support for any part of that year. I have concerns about this part of the bill. 


As part of the government's mental health package there is funding for health checks—for social and emotional wellbeing—for children turning three. As I understand it, and after talking to various child development experts, this is a positive move. I have spoken to the government about this and about the fact that it is going to take a little while to implement—and I understand the arguments about that from the government. But now we have this legislation which ties health checks to children turning four, but only for those people who are on income support. I think that is quite discriminatory. It says, 'We think that only people on income support are not able to look after their children, so we are going to focus on them.' I also understand the government's argument that they believe, based on some of the evidence, that children from lower socioeconomic families may have more developmental problems or other health issues and that is why they are tying it to income support. However, I have spoken to child development experts, and they are saying health checks are important for all children, not just those of families on income support. So we believe that, in fact, what we should be doing if we are going to tie the supplement to family tax benefit part A is doing it for everybody so that everybody is required to have a child health check.


Not only have I been talking to child development and child health experts on that issue, I have also been looking at timing. They are saying that timing is better at three, because developmental issues are starting to develop and become manifest at that age and you are better off doing those checks earlier. What the government is doing with the social and emotional wellbeing checks would be better at three than to start at four. So here we have a piece of legislation that is getting it wrong in terms of the child health checks at four, or so the emerging evidence suggests, and ties it to those families on income support, further, in come community members' eyes, demonising those on income support and saying, 'You can't look after your children.'


We believe there is evidence to suggest that every family would benefit from having a child health check, so why not do so if the government has a mechanism where they can encourage—and what they are doing here is basically making it mandatory—having a child health check for those on income support? I know lots of families on income support who are looking after their children extremely well. They are the centre of their world. The centre of what they do is to look after the health and development of their child. What you are saying with this discriminatory mechanism is, 'We think only you people on income support may have children with development issues and are not accessing health checks for your children.'


We do not believe that is an appropriate way to look after the families of this nation. We believe that, if you are going to bring this in, you bring it in for everybody who is receiving family tax benefit part A supplement, not just those on income support. We recognise the importance of child health checks and understand that they should be when a child turns three, not when a child turns four. The government is very clear about the importance of health checks. The EM says:


… may detect developmental delays and conditions, such as problems affecting hearing and vision, which are problems that make it more difficult for children to learn when they start school. These checks will allow for early identification of health issues and intervention strategies before the child starts school.


We acknowledge that. When the Senate Community Affairs References Committee did its inquiry into hearing health in Australia, the evidence received from hearing health experts was that, although the newborn test has been introduced and is very strongly supported—I, along with many others, congratulated the government for bringing that newborn hearing test in—that does not catch all the hearing problems. There are a significant number that are not caught. So the advice that the committee received was that there should be another check of a child at some stage either before they go to school or as they start preschool. That was a recommendation that had unanimous support of the committee. There should be a preschool or second follow-up hearing test.


Let me tell you one thing. Hearing—there is an exception here which I will go into—loss and impairment does not just affect those on income support. So what are you going to do about all those other families who, for example, will not have a mandatory or compulsory child health check because they are not on income support? I know that many families do access health checks, but not all of them do. So what about those families? You are discriminating against those families because you are not then requiring it of their children, because they do not happen to be on income support. There are conditions that are not tied to those lower socioeconomic families where the government says that they have identified a larger number of developmental delays. That is another reason why we do not believe this is an appropriate approach. You can tie it to all families.


All children of Australia deserve equal treatment. The government is about identifying very early developmental delays and other conditions—as the government pointed out, hearing and vision, which are problems that make it difficult for children to learn. If the government and the state think that, as is recognised in this, it is the responsibility of the government to ensure that happens, why doesn't the government think it has responsibility for all children of all families who receive family tax benefit part A so that all children, if the parents have not been able to access or have not thought about accessing a health check, are also identified early so their developmental problems such as hearing or vision impairment or loss are identified as well?


I personally understand the importance of this. My vision problems were identified after I started school. So I do actually understand how, once you have your vision problems identified and addressed, you go from bottom of the class to significantly improved and near the top of the class. I get it. It happened to me, so I get the issue of child health checks. It is the discriminatory nature of this just applying to those on income support that we strongly object to. When you compare it to other measures this government is bringing in that we believe will have a detrimental impact on those on income support, you can see there is a pretty strong collective approach by this government to pick on and demonise those families. In the not too distant future, we will be debating in this chamber the family tax benefit supplement index freeze, which will adversely impact low-income families and those on income support. We will also be talking about the disability support pension and what you will be doing to people who apply for that that we believe discriminates against people on low incomes and income support.


We do not believe it is appropriate to focus this measure just on those on income support. All children in Australia should be the focus of the government's effort to improve the assessment of developmental delays and any conditions that may not have been picked up earlier. As I said, it is particularly important for conditions such as hearing and vision problems. We do not believe it is appropriate to make distinctions between which Australian families will be forced to get health checks and which will not.


We have concerns about the age at which this health check is being implemented. I have taken on board what the government said about that and the fact that it is going to be hard to correlate at this stage the three years and the four years because, as I understand it, the tests for social and emotional wellbeing have not been finalised and developed. Normally I would have suggested postponing the implementation of this particular schedule while you develop the coordination of these tests. However, I understand the importance of child health checks—but I understand the importance of child health checks for all Australian children and families. That is why the Greens are seeking to amend this schedule so as to delete the clauses that refer to those on income support and promote child health checks for all Australian children from families that receive the family tax benefit part A supplement.

"Arbib, Sen Mark",ALP,2011-06-22,"



Senator ARBIB
 (New South Wales—Minister for Sport, Minister for Indigenous Employment and Economic Development and Minister for Social Housing and Homelessness) (12:02):  In the Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and Other Legislation Amendment (Further Election Commitments and Other Measures) Bill 2011, the government is pleased to deliver on three further commitments made during the 2010 election to Australian families. In the first of the election commitments, we are overhauling the arrangements for advance payments of family tax benefit to better meet family needs. From 1 July 2011, the system will be much more flexible and families will have more scope to choose the size and timing of their advance payments. Under the new system, families will have help in meeting unexpected costs such as having to replace a broken down fridge or damaged school uniform and generally managing their family budget around unexpected expenses such as car registration. This new flexibility could mean some families will avoid higher credit card bills or high-interest small loans.


Between certain minimum and maximum amounts, families will be able to choose the value of their own advance payment. The minimum amount will be the same for all families: 3.75 per cent of the maximum standard rate for a child aged under 13, giving a minimum advance amount of around $160. The maximum amount will be linked to each separate family's usual rate of payment. Generally this will mean that a maximum of 7.5 per cent of that rate will be available for advance payment. For a family with one child under 13 and not receiving rent assistance, this would give a maximum advance amount of around $320. For a family with two children under 13 and not receiving rent assistance, the maximum advance would be around $640. The maximum advance would be higher for a family that is receiving rent assistance. An overall maximum will apply for all families. This will be set initially at $1,000 in 2011-12 and will be maintained at the same percentage of the maximum standard rate for one child under 13 as in the first year. Repayment of the advance will be through adjustments to families' ongoing fortnightly family tax benefit part A entitlements.


This new system will free families from the current confines of receiving and repaying advances within two set periods of the year: 1 January to 30 June and 1 July to 31 December. Families will be able to request more of their entitlements in advance at any point in the year and the advance will be recovered in the following six months. However, advance payment requests will not be approved by Centrelink if they would result in financial hardship. Families making repeated requests will also be assessed to see whether they may benefit from financial advice or financial counselling.


In the second of the election commitments delivered by this bill, a new requirement will be set up for income support recipient parents or carers of four-year-olds to give their children a healthy start for school. This initiative will make the family tax benefit part A supplement conditional for these families on their children going through a health assessment such as the Healthy Kids Check. In this way, we will ensure that children are healthy, fit and ready to learn when they start school. The check will help early detection of lifestyle risk factors and delayed development and illness such as vision and hearing problems. The health check will also offer guidance for families on healthy lifestyles and early intervention strategies. Research tells us these opportunities will be particularly important for low-income families, where a good education is so important in helping to break the patterns of disadvantage. In working with this new arrangement from 1 July 2011, parents will need to show Centrelink that the check has been done. There will be provision to waive the new requirement in exceptional circumstances such as when the child has a severe disability or terminal illness.


In the third election commitment delivered by this bill, the current policy of child support assessments of using a default income figure when a parent fails to lodge or is late with his or her tax return will be replaced with a more accurate process. Under current arrangements, the child support assessment for a parent in these situations is based on a figure equal to two-thirds of male total average weekly earnings. However, this figure often understates the parent's actual income. A more accurate child-support assessment and therefore better support for children will be produced by the new process, which will generally be the parent's last known taxable income indexed by the growth in average wages. However, if the current two-thirds method would produce a higher income, that figure will be used instead. Lastly, there are some minor clarifications that will be made to several family assistance and child support provisions. These minor amendments do not change existing policy.

Senator WORTLEY,ALP,2011-06-22,"



Senator WORTLEY
 (South Australia) (12:44):  I want to put on record today as a matter of public interest the following statement on the federal government's Building the Education Revolution initiatives:


News of the funding through Building the Education Revolution was like ""winning the lottery"" for thousands of Australian schools.


The money was something school principals and teachers could only dream about. It was a dream come true.




Senator Bernardi:
  And builders.




Senator Conroy:
  Cory, Cory, Cory!




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Forshaw
):  Order! It has been very quiet for a little while. Let's keep it that way.




Senator WORTLEY:
  But, before those opposite criticise me for pushing the government's line on the BER projects, let me enlighten you: these are not my words. They are not my description of the BER funding. These words of praise and gratitude come straight from Janine Milsop, the Principal of Mulga Street Primary School in Mount Gambier in South Australia's south-east. As a result of the BER funding, Mulga Street Primary School now boasts a brand-new and very impressive state-of-the-art learning centre with eight classrooms; a multipurpose room; 44 computers in specially constructed hubs; laptops for staff; new furniture; interactive whiteboards; and a covered outdoor learning area. They also have a wet area for science and technology, new toilets and a kitchenette.


Still in Mount Gambier, the 1,310 students at Tenison Woods College are thoroughly enjoying the very impressive Barrie Holmes Stadium. This $3.2 million project delivered the extension of the school's single-court gym into a two-court stadium used by students for sport and training, assemblies, drama, group sessions and musicals. And it supported the employment of approximately 100 workers. The federal government's contribution in these areas was $13 million. The total BER funding for Barker alone is almost $166 million.


It is vital that the Australian public know the real story behind the BER projects, despite the complaints being put forward by those opposite, who seek time after time to denigrate the value of the federal government's Building the Education Revolution and all the while ignore the fact that schools throughout Australia—public schools, Catholic schools and independent schools—of all shapes and sizes and in all geographical regions have been reinvigorated by the funding. I know this because I have seen firsthand the joy and optimism this funding has brought to South Australian city and country schools. It is immeasurable, and it is fantastic to see the difference the BER funding has made. School pride is flourishing across Australia, and in country areas too.


But I do not expect anyone to simply take my word for it. I am happy for the principals to do the talking, and I would now like to continue to share some of that feedback that I received from those principals. Mulga Street principal Ms Milsop says the $3.2 million her school received in BER Funding was an amount 'we could previously only dream about, and we knew this time would probably never come again'. She said that, if the school had had to raise the money by itself, it would have had to hold 10 fundraisers every year for the next 100 years to raise the amount of money allocated through the funding, and at each of those 10 annual fundraisers the school would have had to raise a minimum of $3,000. The Mulga Street Primary School project was meticulously planned and administered, and the results are absolutely outstanding, and it supported the employment of 64 workers.


McDonald Park Primary School Principal Mrs Sandy Davey said her Mount Gambier school received $5.3 million in BER funding, which was used to build a new classroom block with eight new classrooms, covered outdoor learning areas, refurbished classrooms and sporting facilities. Mrs Davey said:


The BER gave us the opportunity to bring everything up to a top standard.


This project supported the employment of approximately 25 workers.


Now let us move to the Adelaide suburb of Parkside, where Parkside Primary School students and teachers are enjoying a new hall and a refurbished classroom after receiving $1.125 million in BER funding. Principal Dennis Harris said it was not long ago that the school had given up all hope of ever having a hall which could be used as a gym and a performing arts centre and for school assemblies. For 10 years the school tried unsuccessfully to raise enough money for the deposit. That dream was about to come to an end when the BER money came through. 'It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity' for these schools, Mr Harris said.


North Adelaide Primary School Acting Principal Mike Thurston and his school community welcomed the construction of their $2.125 million gymnasium through the BER funding. This project supported the employment of approximately 50 workers in the local community, and I again quote from the acting principal:


As a public school, we are so thankful … we feel the whole management process in South Australia was run well and … the Department of Education and Children's Services in South Australia … was very supportive. No mumbles or grumbles from schools in South Australia.


This is Mr Thurston's view on their BER project. Again, it is not mine or the Gillard government's; it is that of the school principals. This is from the very people who have seen the difference in their schools and the benefits reaped by students. There is an added bonus for the community. The North Adelaide Primary School gym is also used by the community for activities ranging from yoga and pilates classes to belly dancing classes.


I move now to Reidy Park Primary School in Mount Gambier. Reidy Park Primary School received $3.2 million in BER money for its new library and building refurbishment and it employed 43 workers. Reidy Park Primary School Principal Mrs Barbara Munt describes the school's BER project as:


… a magnificent initiative which gave money and employment to people when the global economy was volatile.


She went on to say:


It also left our school with a legacy. It was like winning the lottery for our school. It's 54 years old and the classrooms were tired and old-fashioned and in desperate need of refurbishment.


Mrs Munt also said:


… politics aside, the BER is an outstanding initiative, absolutely outstanding. Idon't know any primary school principals who are not utterly grateful.


No wonder Mrs Munt, the students and teachers are happy. Their classrooms have been transformed from a fifties environment to one which is conducive to 21st century learning, with computer hubs in classrooms.


Mrs Barbara Skillin, the Acting Principal of Yahl Primary School in Mount Gambier, said the school's new BER funded library is 'absolutely beautiful' and has 'made a huge difference'. She said:


In our old library we couldn't even fit a class in. It was really, really small. This new library has made such a difference to the children's learning. There are computers in there as well as laptops and we're planning to get iPads. Space conducive to new technology. We can now hold whole-school assemblies in the library.


The new Yahl Primary School library received $925,000 in funding and it supported the employment of over 40 workers.


Mil Lel Primary School in Mount Gambier received $925,000 for the construction of four classrooms and two smaller work-preparation areas which have replaced transportable buildings that were dated and in need of ongoing repairs. Principal Stephen Jolley said the new classrooms made an excellent environment for teaching and learning and the project supported the employment of 25 workers.


Compton Primary School near Mount Gambier also received $925,000 in Building the Education Revolution money. This project supported the employment of approximately 15 workers. They built four cosy and comfortable classrooms, complete with interactive whiteboards, as well as a new library. The school's old library was transformed into an art gallery. The school said they had hired an excellent builder and received very good value for money. The school is almost 150 years old. It was run-down and, in the words of the principal, Sandy Mullen, it was a real poor country cousin of a school. Ms Mullen, who has now been there for six years, said:


The District Director of Education remarked to me that I wasn't at Compton Primary School for the facilities.


But Ms Mullen said that today the facilities are much improved. The staff room is no longer a cubby hole, and the students are more engaged because they have a beautiful new area to work in. They are also very conscious of maintaining the new look and respecting property as well as people's possessions because it is all so new.


The BER project at Belair Schools—Belair Primary and Belair Junior Primary schools—in Adelaide's southern suburbs supported the employment of approximately 125 workers. Co-principals Christine McDonald and Susan Copeland cannot wipe the smiles off their faces because these schools now have a new library, a state-of-the-art gymnasium, refurbished classrooms and a covered outdoor learning area. Transportable classrooms were taken away, playgrounds upgraded and more roof-top solar panels have been added. Students can even see how much power they are putting back into the electricity grid. Ms McDonald also praised the Department of Education and Children's Services in South Australia for a 'brilliant job'. She also asked me to pass this on to my colleagues in parliament and let them know what a difference the BER project has made to the schools and how 'exciting' it is.


I could go on for a long time. I could talk about the BER project at St Martin's Primary School at Greenacres which was 'well managed, on budget and on time', according to Principal Maria D'Aloia. Or I could talk about the year 7 learning centre and multipurpose hall extension at Scotch College. This $2.69 million project employed 16 workers and, in the words of the principal, Mr Tim Oughton, 'went smoothly and was well administered'. Or I could talk about the Mount Gambier High School's newly refurbished science laboratory, which is now, as Principal Peter McKay explained, big enough to fit everyone in. He said that prior to this the students were literally 'jammed' in, but today that is no longer the case. The science laboratory has been extended so a whole class can fit in comfortably and enjoy the interactive whiteboards, architecturally designed benches and modern facilities for practical science lessons.


The federal government had the foresight to ensure Australia escaped largely unscathed from the global financial crisis by implementing our $42 billion Nation Building Economic Stimulus Plan, which included Building the Education Revolution projects. In fact, through the Building the Education Revolution program, the government has invested $16.2 billion in schools right across Australia. But there is no denying the views of principals, students, teachers and parents. All in all, the message is the same: these projects have made a huge difference to many schools across Australia. At the schools I have visited, the comments and responses I have received from the students have all been very positive. They are now learning in environments which have new halls, new gymnasiums, new classrooms and are much improved. 


I have felt privileged to be a member of a government that introduced the largest school modernisation program in Australia's history. It was not just in one state or for one sector, but right across Australia and for all sectors—Independent, Catholic and public schools. I have met these school communities in my home state and, to say the least, they are very pleased with the outcomes. It has been a great opportunity for teachers, for schools and for school communities to receive what is really deserved in our school education system. I also take this opportunity to say it has been a privilege to have been able to serve as a senator for South Australia in the past six years and to have represented the people in Barker as well.

Senator LUDWIG
 (Queensland—Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Minister Assisting the Attorney-General on Queensland Floods Recovery) (15:04):  I have provided a response to questions asked by Senator Milne today about audit reports relating to the Tasmanian Community Forest Agreement. As the senator is aware, the Tasmanian Auditor-General has commented on Forestry Tasmania's administration of Commonwealth funding. For further information about this report, which is public, it can be obtained from the Tasmanian Auditor-General.


In addition, my department has commissioned an audit into the administration of the industry development program under the Tasmanian Community Forest Agreement. The report is not finalised. It will be made public after its finalisation. I will get back to her with a date on when that is likely to be. My department is also working with the Tasmanian government on an audit of the Intensive Forest Management Program, part of that Tasmanian Community Forest Agreement. This audit has not commenced at this point. If there is a time line in relation to that, I will provide that in addition to those comments.


Can I also indicate there is an additional response to Senator Bob Brown's questions without notice on 15 June 2011 dealing with Tasmanian forestry issues relating to browsing animals. I seek leave to incorporate that into Hansard.


Leave granted. 




The answer read as follows—





Additional response to Senator Bob Brown, Question without Notice 15 June 2011





TASMANIAN FORESTRY ISSUES





Browsing Animals



I have consulted with my colleague, the Minister for Sustainability, the Environment, Water, Population and Communities, the Hon. Tony Burke MP and submit the following additional information in response to Senator Brown's questions of 15 June 2011.


Forest management on public lands is the constitutional responsibility of states and territories and is primarily subject to the state's regulatory framework.


Specific queries relating to Forestry Tasmania operations in Tasmania forestry coupes should be directed to the Tasmanian Government and relevant state authorities.




Tasmanian Forestry Statement of Principles — Ta Ann supply arrangements



The Government is not a signatory to the Statement of Principles and any questions on about topics of negotiation should be directed to the signatories themselves.




Assistance to Gunns Limited



Following on from Question Time on 15 June, I have been advised that Gunns Limited has made preliminary inquiries with the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation in the Trade Portfolio.


Decisions about the use of EFIC's commercial account are the responsibility of the EFIC Board. Under the EFIC act, the Minister cannot direct EFIC in respect of a particular transaction in the Commercial Account.


Further questions about EFIC should be directed to the Minister for Trade.

Senator MASON
 (Queensland) (15:06):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answers given by ministers to questions without notice asked by Opposition Senators today.


Last night at the departing senators' valedictory addresses Senator McGauran likened politics to opera, with love, hate, lust and betrayal all featuring—but, fortunately, no singing. 'Operatic' actually isn't a bad start to describe this Labor government. But, let's face it, The Magic Flute it ain't; it is more like some operatic farce from 18th-century Italy.


When I think back to the 2007 federal election, enter stage right—or should I say stage left!—the member for Kingsford Smith, Mr Garrett. Remember he said, 'Don't worry, once we get in we'll just change it all.' All of us in the opposition know that Labor will do or say anything to get elected, that is true, but the problem over the past four years is not just dishonesty—it is actually far more dangerous than dishonesty—it is incompetence. It is bad enough that Labor makes popular and populist election promises, but it is far worse: they actually take those promises seriously and then—for God's sake!—they try to implement them. The dishonest promises are bad enough, but to take them seriously is a crime and it is a crime on the taxpayer.


Labor governs through a series of brain snaps, glib slogans and, always, broken promises. Remember, Deputy President—how could you forget?—the education revolution, the slowest revolution in recorded history. Its earliest manifestations were the computers in schools fiasco. Mr Rudd holding a laptop—you will recall that—said it was the toolbox of the 21st century. He promised one for each student. What happened? The maintenance and the upkeep of those laptop computers cost three times the capital cost. What had to happen in the end? The parents and schools had to pay more for them. Now what did we learn at the last estimates? In fact schools are charging students to take home those laptops. So, in any case, they are not free. Have any of those laptops been connected, as promised, to high-speed broadband after four years? No. We are waiting for the NBN. Don't worry, Senator Conroy and the NBN will fix it. By the time they are connected the laptops will be redundant.


Remember the trade training centres promised for every school—there were supposed to be 2,650. How many are there after 3½ years? Eighty-nine. At this rate it will take 100 years for there to be a trade training centre in every secondary school. Another abject failure. It goes on. Who could ever forget the farce of GroceryWatch and the horror of Fuelwatch—the theory being, apparently, that if you watched the carrots and pumpkins and the bananas, prices would not go up; that if you fixed an aggressive stare on a bunch of bananas, the bananas wouldn't dare go up in price! And what happens now? They are 13 bucks a kilo. So that didn't work either. Another failure of the Labor government. The granddaddy of all broken promises is the carbon tax. Hopefully that dishonesty will prove terminal.


What all these slogans and brain snaps have in common is this: they sounded pretty cool to Mr Rudd's 26-year-old advisers, but when it came to implementation it was apparent there was no planning, no detail, no costings, no cost-benefit analysis and no business case . It was a total and utter shambles. We have government by brain snap, glib slogan and broken promises.


I know that many are leaving the Senate—many great senators—so on this historic moment I cite Karl Marx, Senator Carr's friend and mentor and grooming inspiration, who once said, 'History repeats itself, first as tragedy, second as farce.' With modern communications and the perpetual news cycle, we now have them occurring in fact simultaneously. This government is clearly a farce and it is a tragedy for Australia taxpayers.

"Bilyk, Sen Catryna",ALP,2011-06-22,"



Senator BILYK
 (Tasmania) (15:11):  To call this government 'a farce' is just typical scaremongering and another silly comment and stunt put up by those on the other side. It does not quite match the stunt of wanting to have a plebiscite and then saying that they wouldn't take any notice of the result. What must the people of Australia think about that? Here they go: 'We want to have a plebiscite, we want to spend millions of dollars'—all that money that goes into running a plebiscite—but then their leader says, 'But I won't take any notice of it.' I don't think the people of Australia are conned for one moment with the scare campaign and the silly tactics we see coming from the other side.


The first question of the day in today's question time was probably, in my three years in this place, one of the most bizarre I have heard. If that is what their first question of the day is going to be about they really need to look at their tactics committee. We are seeing the scare campaign and we have seen it before. We have seen it in a number of areas. It is exactly the same one we saw through the global financial crisis. The scare campaign then was that a large number of people in Australia were going to lose their jobs. I think Mr Hockey said that 300,000 Australians were going to lose their jobs. Instead, what happened? We have 700,000 more Australians in jobs today than when the government took office. That is despite the impact of the GFC. 


Those on that side completely waste question time. I know that you, Mr Deputy Speaker, personally have a great interest in how question time is run. I listened intently to your speech the other night regarding how question time should be run. For those on your side to have so little respect for what you have to say and for your philosophy and beliefs does not augur well for them as a group or as individuals.


Recently we had 13 of Australia's most prominent economists, including a former deputy governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia and several financial market economists, come out in support of a carbon price. The group of economists included Grattan Institute director Saul Eslake, St George chief economist Besa Deda, Citigroup Global Markets' Paul Brennan and Westpac chief economist Bill Evans. Still those on the other side deny the need for a carbon price. Those people I just mentioned declared that putting a price on pollution is the best way to reduce carbon pollution. They described a price on carbon as 'a necessary and desirable structural reform for the Australian economy'. This reinforces yet again is that every credible participant in this debate knows that the only responsible thing for our nation to do is to put a price on carbon. As former Liberal leader John Hewson said:


Australia needs to take substantive, urgent and apolitical action on carbon pricing for the sake of our economy and our environment. The failure of our generation to act will cost future generations dearly.


That is the important thing. It is the cost to the future generations that is of key concern to us on this side of the chamber. Those on the other side come in here and it does not matter what we want to put up they say: 'No, no, no.' As I said earlier in the week, their policy on climate change should not be called direct action; I believe it should be called direct no-action because that is what they are the party of—direct no-action on everything.



Opposition senators interjecting—




Senator BILYK:
  They remind me of the two-year-olds I used to care for, their little tantrums and two-year-olds who say no all the time. I am so often reminded of that when I come in here and all I hear is negativity, harping and interjections that I can talk over because, as the senator knows, I used to work with children. I can talk over 30 screaming three-year-olds and I am happy to keep doing that here. It is interesting to note what other people on their side have said about the carbon price.

"Adams, Sen Judith",LP,2011-06-22,"



Senator ADAMS
 (Western Australia—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (15:17):  Senator Bilyk thinks we are a party of no action. I have about 23 broken promises by the Gillard government since the 2010 election.


In taking note of answers to questions, I rise to speak on issues mentioned by the ministers. Firstly, Senator Arbib told us about the very good training programs for Indigenous people. I wish that I had asked just what he is going to do about the 700 Aboriginal employees on the cattle stations in the Kimberley. There are 30 stations owned by Aboriginal corporations and families. A number of employees, and a lot of these are trainees, based at Roebuck Plains Station, where the Federal government has put a lot of money into training, are desperate. They do not know where they are going with the live export trade being suspended and no indication, even though the minister tried to tell us today, of when that trade might start again. It is very worrying. That might be a question for Senator Arbib tomorrow.


It is time that this chamber was reminded of the election promises broken by the Gillard government since election day in 2010. We start with the carbon tax, then the citizens assembly that was a great idea but we never, ever saw it. There was a community consensus on taxing carbon; I do not know where that went. There was a new era of openness and transparency; we are not going too well there and it seems even the ministers and the government at the moment have to put all their media and any interviews through to the Prime Minister's office before they are allowed to go out and tell the public. How do we go there? Is that evidence of an era of openness and transparency for government ministers? 


Then there was onshore processing which was going to take place at Curtin and the Scherger RAAF base, and processing refugees at Broadmeadows, which is the Melbourne immigration transit accommodation. Then there was the offshore processing centre in East Timor; what has happened to that? There was cash for clunkers; I think that came and it went. Then there was the mining tax royalties; that is very dear to my heart and to Senator Cormann's, and it is an absolute mess. If I have time, I will quote Sam Walsh saying how they thought they had done a deal with government and then it all backfired. Senator Mason spoke about the cost of the BER and the failure to implement Orgill's recommendations. There was the solar credits scheme. There was the delay of the national curriculum and the delay of the new My School website. Then there was reform of health and hospitals, goodness me, just before the budget; what happened there? The whole health reform was turned on its head and that made it very difficult for us in budget estimates to really work out if it was reform or just what was going to happen. It is still not worked out and, looking at some of the legislation that is coming through, no wonder it is being sent to Senate committees to sort it out.


Then we go on to the convening of a tax summit before 30 June 2011. I think that is in eight days time. Are we going to have a tax summit? I do not know what happened there. There was sparing the Public Service from budget cuts. There was sending asylum seekers to Malaysia; we are still not there with that and one wonders if it will ever happen. There was the hypocrisy about the Pacific solution, temporary protection visas and now reinvesting the Defence budget savings into Defence and increasing Defence spending. I think we have a lot of things to follow up. In the House Hansard on 10 May 2005, Julia Gillard said— (Time expired)

"Stephens, Sen Ursula",ALP,2011-06-22,"



Senator STEPHENS
 (New South Wales) (15:22):  I, too, rise to take note of answers to questions without notice asked today, particularly given who is in the chamber today—both you, Mr Deputy President and Senator Scullion. I think that the issues arising out of questions to Minister Ludwig around the live cattle export industry and its future are pretty important. I think we are all in furious agreement that we need to have public confidence in that industry and we are also in furious agreement about the outrage of the animal cruelty that we witnessed on the television program that led to the suspension of the live export trade by the minister.


In the first instance, congratulations go to the minister for taking the action that he did and for going to Indonesia to negotiate some outcomes. As we have just heard from the previous speaker, there are some real vested interests in this industry that are looking for some security and certainty. It is very clear what the suspension of the live export trade is seeking to achieve, and the minister highlighted those today. First of all there is the strengthening of the export licences, strengthening the supply chain security and reinvesting in confidence in the system, which I think has been seriously depleted by the actions of Meat and Livestock Australia and by the actions that we witnessed on the television program. We also all want to see adherence to the international animal welfare guidelines that should underpin good stewardship in this regard. The minister said today that trade would reopen when the set of mutual standards have been established and he is working to ensure that happens as quickly as possible.


I am sure I am not the only one in this chamber who has received over 15,000 emails in a concerted campaign that is actually about closing down the live export industry. For those people who have been orchestrating that campaign, it has certainly been one that has clogged up the parliamentary email system beyond belief, but we are very realistic and, in fact, most Australians are very realistic about the importance of our pastoral industry and our live animal exports. Most Australians support the continuation of trade if there are guarantees that cattle will be treated humanely. A recent report substantiates that. An Essential Report that was recently released indicates that 72 per cent of Australians support the long-term continuation of live exports and that 58 per cent of them supported the minister's decision to suspend trade while these issues are being investigated. 


We all want this issue resolved. We are in furious agreement about having this resolved, but we also have to work very hard to restore public confidence in the industry before we can renew our live trade export. I have to say that the MLA have responsibility for part of the solution. We just heard about the pastoral industry and the pastoral stations that are significantly impacted by this and the uncertainty about employment, particularly for Indigenous people, is something that I am very concerned about, but of course this goes much further beyond that. It goes right along the supply chain, from the pastoral industry to everyone else involved: exporters, port and stevedoring services, shipping companies, road transporters, veterinarians and everyone in between who is part of a very important industry for the Australian agricultural sector. We do want this resolved, but the Australian people want to have public confidence in our live export industry. Until we can achieve the standards to ensure that there are international welfare guidelines adhered to in this process, we simply cannot just resume a trade that will be to the detriment of the long-term sustainability of this industry. I know that people are stressed and I know that people are worried, but I also know that the minister is working day and night to ensure that the impact on Australian producers is resolved.

"Scullion, Sen Nigel",CLP,2011-06-22,"



Senator SCULLION
 (Northern Territory—Deputy Leader of The Nationals) (15:27):  I also rise to take note of answers to questions during question time today and to speak with regard to the questions asked of Senator Ludwig on the live cattle trade. I agree with Senator Stephens that there is broad agreement on both the complexity of the problem and resolving the problem. It is very, very important, in order for the Australian people to understand and to fully support this matter, that the facts are provided. The Senate provides a great opportunity for the minister to provide the facts. Sadly, we ended up with him berating Senator Boswell for his questions, simply answering again and again, 'I've told you what the Australian government is going to do.' Senator Boswell's questions highlighted the fact that, in eight days time, the June quarter licences that are provided not by the Australian government but by the Indonesian government, are due, and what is their view about reissuing those? It is an absolutely fundamental point that I know the industry is dying to hear. But again, I would take the opportunity to commend Senator Ludwig in a very difficult circumstance. I am not sure who persuaded him to move away from his first decision, which everybody agreed was a good one, to a decision to unilaterally suspend the trade. If they were to look back, I am sure that they would have done it somewhat differently.


Australia and New Zealand signed the G20 accord, which has a number of provisions in it. One of the provisions relates to the sanctioning of another nation. Both Indonesia and Australia are signatories to the G20 and there are a series of processes about consultation and negotiation when you sanction another country. In the roar of dust and saddles in all this, we may not have seen it that way, but Indonesia absolutely surely see this as a sanction against their country, and apparently none of the usual protocols were met. There is much speculation in the media that this has now become a very tense diplomatic issue, and I suspect it is because of the way that that decision was made. I think there is somebody who can raise the bar, if you like, in Indonesia about these diplomatic issues. I would encourage Mr Rudd to put down his knife and pick up his passport. I am quite sure that his intervention in these matters would be very helpful.


Everybody acknowledges that we need a full through process that is accredited and trackable today. For some time we have had a process where 10,000 cattle have NLIS tags on them. There is no question about traceability. We have ships that have absolutely no problem. They have been approved to the highest standards of IALA. We then move to the feedlots in Indonesia, which have in fact been passed to an international standard—ISO 2001. It is not some vague international welfare standard; this is a standard that is independently audited and is well known throughout the business world. But that happens today. 


We have the minister and others standing up in this place saying, 'All we have to do is get this in place.' That is that point. The industry is saying it is in place. We need to move ahead for those places that can guarantee the Australian people that the animals will get treated according to a standard that is acceptable to a series of OIE standards, and I suspect the standards I am talking about exceed those.


We need to start the trade. We need to recommence the trade, because it is not going to threaten the trade in the long term. It is only starting the trade to those places that guarantee all the things that the Australian people and the Indonesian people have been asking for—that is, a through process guarantee that the welfare standards will be adhered to. That is there and available today. What the members of the coalition and, I suspect, many Australian people want to know is: why don't they simply act? This inaction is gutting Australian families, businesses and communities across the Top End. I get calls every day. Yes, I have this email trail that is exactly the same letter—they could have got two or three different ones. I can tell you that it is a desperate act when a family rings a politician in the middle of the night. I can tell you this is completely a reflection of the absence of the intellect that needs to be provided to this issue by the government.

The government has condemned attacks on the Coptic Christian community in Egypt, and we welcome the Egyptian government's strong condemnation of sectarian violence and stated commitment to bringing those responsible to justice.


Government officials, both in Canberra and at the Australian embassies in the Middle East, raise the right of freedom of religion and belief with host governments. We also have a proud legacy of defending human rights at the multilateral level, particularly in the United Nations through cosponsoring the UN General Assembly's resolution on the elimination of religious discrimination in 2010, sponsoring the mandate of the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Religion or Belief and our involvement in the United Nations Alliance of Civilizations.

FAMILY ASSISTANCE AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2011



This Bill delivers on five measures from the recently announced 2011-2012 Budget, and a minor non-Budget measure.




Reform of family payments



The Bill introduces three measures that make important changes to the family payments system to make it fairer and simpler, and ensure its long-term sustainability.


The first measure lowers the maximum child age of eligibility for Family Tax Benefit Part A from 24 to 21, from 1 January 2012.


Family payments are designed to support families with the costs of raising children while they are dependent. This change recognises that young people aged 22 and over are considered independent, and will bring Family Tax Benefit Part A in to line with the reduction in the Youth Allowance age of independence from 1 January 2012.


Young people aged 22 and over in full-time study may be able to access Youth Allowance independent of their parents' income, subject to means testing and academic progress rules.


Transitional arrangements will mean that families with a young person who is already enrolled in a course which started before 1 January 2012 will continue to receive Family Tax Benefit Part A until that course finishes.


The second measure builds on reforms introduced in the 2009-10 Budget that better targeted the family payments system to focus on low and middle income families.


The Government is a strong supporter of the family payments system. Family payments are a fundamental part of the Australian social fabric.


Next year, we will spend around $30 billion combined on Family Tax Benefit, the Baby Bonus, Paid Parental Leave and child care assistance.


We have added to the system since coming to government by increasing the child care rebate to 50 per cent, introducing Australia's first national Paid Parental Leave scheme and the Education Tax Refund, and also, in the recent Budget, increasing family payments for older teenagers by up to $4200 a year.


But we also believe in a targeted system that is sustainable for the long term.


That's why the Government is extending indexation pauses on higher income limits for a further two years, until 30 June 2014, for Family Tax Benefit Part A and B, the Baby Bonus and Paid Parental Leave.


This Bill will extend indexation pauses on higher income limits for a further two years, until 30 June 2014, in the following areas:


the Family Tax Benefit Part B primary earner income limit will remain at $150,000;


the Baby Bonus eligibility limit will remain at $75,000 family income in the six months following the birth or adoption of a child (equivalent to $150,000 a year);


the Paid Parental Leave income limit will stay at $150,000 for the primary carer in the previous financial year before the birth or adoption of a child; and


the higher income free area, and the per child add on, of Family Tax Benefit Part A will remain constant. This threshold is the income level at which the base rate of Family Tax Benefit Part A begins to reduce, until the benefit ends completely. The income level at which a family's benefit is completely withdrawn varies by family circumstance, depending on the number and age of the children.


The Family Tax Benefit Part A lower income free threshold and the Family Tax Benefit Part B secondary earner income threshold will continue to be indexed, providing support to low and middle income households.


Fortnightly payment rates for Family Tax Benefit and the Baby Bonus will also continue to be indexed every year to meet increases in the cost of living. The rate of Parental Leave Pay is linked to the National Minimum Wage and is also not affected by this change.


Pauses to the upper income limits mean that some families will no longer be eligible for payments, and some families will get less family payments – but only if their income rises.


No family will lose any family payments unless their income rises.


Families whose income does not increase will also have more money in their pockets as the fortnightly rates of Family Tax Benefit continue to rise, due to normal indexation.


In the first year, fewer than two per cent of families will no longer be eligible for family payments as the result of these changes.


Indexation on the upper income limits for Family Tax Benefit Part A and B, and the Baby Bonus, was paused in the 2009-2010 Budget.


The Opposition supported this very same measure in 2009. In the Parliament two years ago, on 13 May 2009, the Leader of the Opposition, the relevant Shadow Minister at the time, said these changes were too ""soft"".


The extension of these pauses will save $1.2 billion over the forward estimates. These are the decisions an economically-responsible Government must make – to bring the Budget back to surplus, and make sure our family payments system is sustainable now and into the future.


Under the third measure, indexation of Family Tax Benefit end of year supplements will also be paused for three years. End of year supplements were first introduced to address overpayments of family payments because of underestimation of income.


The number of families with overpayments has decreased since supplements were first intro­duced, and pausing indexation of these supple­ments will help make family payments more sustainable.


The end of year supplements are generally paid as a lump sum after the end of an entitlement year, when a family has completed their tax return and reconciled their actual Family Tax Benefit entitlement.


This amendment will keep the end of year supplements at their current level of $726.35 per child for Family Tax Benefit Part A, and $354.05 per family for Family Tax Benefit Part B, for the next three entitlement years.




Building Australia
'
s Future Workforce
—
implementing more efficient and accurate assessments for disability support pension



This Bill also introduces changes to the assessment arrangements for Disability Support Pension to help Australians with a disability into work wherever possible, while continuing to provide an essential safety net for Australians unable to work.


To qualify for Disability Support Pension, a person must have a physical, intellectual or psych­iatric impairment of 20 points or more under the Impairment Tables, and have a continuing inability to work for at least 15 hours per week.


Currently a person's inability to work can be assessed before the person has investigated alternative employment options or assistance from employment services, or had any retraining or rehabilitation.


This means that assessments of a person's inability to work, for the purposes of Disability Support Pension, can occur without the person having tested whether the help available could find them suitable work. 


This Bill refines the test for determining whether a person has a continuing inability to work.


Under the new rules, most people applying for Disability Support Pension will be required to have actively participated in a program of support to find employment through an open employment service or vocational rehabilitation.


People with a severe impairment, such as those who are clearly unable to work and are fast-tracked to ensure they receive financial support more quickly, will not need to have actively participated in a program of support.


These changes were first announced in the 2010-2011 Budget and, in the most recent Budget, were fast-tracked so that they will now apply from 3 September 2011, rather than from 1 January 2012.


These reforms will provide faster, more sustainable support for people with severe disabilities, while referring others with the potential to work to employment services including Job Services Australia and Disability Employment Services.


The new assessment procedure for Disability Support Pension will help people with disabilities return to the workforce wherever possible by focusing on their ability, rather than their disability.




Enabling the extension of the Cape York Welfare Reform Trial



In the 2011-2012 Budget, the Government provided $16.1 million for a proposed extension of the Cape York Welfare Reform Trial for an additional year.


The Trial is a partnership between the communities of Aurukun, Coen, Hope  Vale and Mossman Gorge, the Australian Government, the Queensland Government and the Cape York Institute for Policy and Leadership. It aims to restore positive social norms, re-establish local Indigenous authority and support community and individual engagement in the real economy.


To date, the Trial has made a real and lasting difference in the lives of Indigenous people in the Cape. Since it began in July 2008, the Cape York Welfare Reform communities have seen improved school attendance, care and protection of children and community safety.


The Queensland Government is currently leading a process of consultation with Cape York communities about extension of the Trial. Queensland Government legislation would also need to be changed in order for the Trial to be extended.


While these discussions occur, the Government is seeking to put in place the amendments required to enable the extension of the income management element of the Trial.


It is important these enabling legislative changes are put in place to ensure they do not delay any extension of the Trial and to ensure the four communities are not adversely affected.


The extension of the Trial will not go ahead until the communities of Aurukun, Coen, Hope Vale and Mossman Gorge have been consulted and the Queensland Government legislates to extend the operation of the Family Respon­sibilities Commission.


The Family Responsibilities Commission, which is established under Queensland Government legislation, is a key plank of Cape York Welfare Reform. Local Family Respon­sibility Commissioners hold conferences with community members, refer people to support services and, when necessary, arrange income management.


Currently, a person can only be subject to income management under the Trial after a decision by the Family Responsibilities Com­mission, made before 1 January 2012.


The Bill before the Parliament extends this date to 1 January 2013, to enable income management to continue in Cape York for a further 12 months.




Minor measure



The Bill also includes a minor non-Budget measure, which clarifies that the Public Works Committee Act 1969 does not apply to Aboriginal Land Trusts established in the Northern Territory under the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976.


The concept of an authority of the Commonwealth was first introduced into the Public Works Committee Act by way of amendment in 1981. Aboriginal Land Trusts are a mechanism to give effect to what is private ownership of land for the benefit of Aboriginal traditional owners. Land Trusts were never intended to be Commonwealth authorities to which that Act applies. This amendment puts that position beyond doubt.


This amendment will not affect the application of the Public Works Committee Act to any proposed arrangement that involves the carrying out of a work by or for the Commonwealth, or by or for an authority of the Commonwealth to which the Public Works Committee Act applies.


Where the Parliamentary appropriation requirements of section 5AA of the Public Works Committee Act are otherwise satisfied, the work will be a 'public work' for the purposes of that Act, even if the work is proposed to be carried out on land owned by a Land Rights Act Aboriginal Land Trust.


 




TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (2011 MEASURES NO. 5) BILL 2011



This Bill amends various taxation laws to implement a range of improvements to Australia's tax laws.


Schedule 1 amends the income tax law to allow trust beneficiaries to continue to use the primary production averaging and farm management deposits provisions in a year where the trust has a loss for trust law purposes.


After the High Court decision in Com­missioner of Taxation v Bam ford, the Com­missioner withdrew a public ruling under which he had accepted that in certain circumstances a beneficiary could be eligible for the primary production averaging and farm management deposits rules, despite the trust incurring a loss for trust law purposes. 


Schedule 1 will restore the ability of beneficiaries to access both sets of rules in an income year where the trust has incurred a loss and certain conditions are met. The amendments will secure continuity for taxpayers because they apply from the 2010-11 income year and the Commissioner's ruling applies up to and including the 2009-10 income year.


If the amendments in Schedule 1 are not enacted by 30 June 2011, the beneficiaries of up to approximately 23,000 trusts will be uncertain as to their eligibility for the primary production averaging and farm management deposits rules in the 2010 11 income year by the time they start to lodge their income tax returns.


Schedule 2 amends Subdivision 115-C and Subdivision 207-B of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to ensure that, where permitted by the trust deed, the capital gains and franked distributions (including any attached franking credits) of a trust can be effectively streamed to beneficiaries for tax purposes, by making them 'specifically entitled' to those amounts.  


This Schedule also amends Division 6 of Part III of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 to include specific anti-avoidance rules to address the inappropriate use of exempt entities to 'shelter' the taxable income of a trust.  


The Government announced on 16 December 2010, that it would update and re-write the trust income tax law to deal with the ongoing discrepancies between the treatment of trust income by trust laws, on the one hand, and the tax system on the other. These issues were highlighted by the High Court's decision in Commissioner of Taxation v Bamford.


In the interim, the Board of Taxation recommended (following consultation with industry) that changes were urgently needed to provide certainty about the streaming of capital gains and franked distributions (including any attached franking credits). 


These amendments provide this certainty and ensure that the streaming of capital gains and franked distributions (including any attached franking credits) is effective for tax purposes.


The Government is aware that due to the short timeframe involved in developing these amendments, there may be scope for unintended consequences. The operation of these amend­ments will therefore be closely monitored and if unintended consequences are identified, the Government will act to remedy these consequences retrospectively where appropriate.  


The broader review of the trust income tax provisions remains the primary focus for the Government. This will simplify the system, rewrite the rules and give more certainty to the many thousands of small businesses and farmers who use trusts.


If the amendments in Schedule 2 are not enacted by 30 June 2011, trustees of the approximately 660,000 trusts in Australia that are required to make their resolutions by 30 June 2011 will face significant uncertainty.  


Schedule 3 relates to the National Rental Affordability Scheme tax offset provisions.  


The National Rental Affordability Scheme, which commenced on 1 July 2008, is a Government initiative to stimulate the supply of new affordable rental dwellings. 


The NRAS incentive was $9,140 per dwelling in 2010-11, comprising $6,855 from the Australian Government and $2,285 from the States.  These amounts are indexed annually in line with the rents component of the consumer price index.


These amendments simplify the operation of NRAS for participants and provide some additional flexibility to NRAS participants in how the incentive is shared between members of the NRAS consortium participating in NRAS.  


Importantly, these amendments introduce the concept of an NRAS consortium, which is less restrictive than the existing non entity joint venture provisions. 


The Australian Taxation Office Interpretive Decision in 2009 highlighted that certain head lease and sub lease arrangements used in NRAS might not allow the NRAS tax offset entitlement to flow through from the 'approved participant' to the ultimate investor.  


These amendments address this situation by allowing NRAS approved participants deriving NRAS rent to make an election to relinquish their entitlement to an NRAS tax offset in favour of other members of their NRAS consortium.  


These amendments also recognise that certificates issued by the Housing Secretary under NRAS are issued to the approved participants (rather than the consortium) and ensure that certain payments provided under NRAS indirectly, such as through an NRAS consortium, are treated as 'non-assessable non-exempt income'.


Although the amendments do provide additional flexibility to those participating in NRAS, it is prudent for taxpayers to seek advice from the Australian Taxation Office about the detailed structure of their particular NRAS models and their ability to access the NRAS tax offset before investing in NRAS.


Schedule 4 implements the 2011-12 Budget measure to phase out the dependent spouse tax offset.


The dependent spouse tax offset originated around three quarters of a century ago — a time when the single income family was the norm and the welfare system was in its infancy. This was a time when a breadwinner was expected to 'maintain' a spouse even without children, and there were limited employment opportunities for women.


In today's modern economy, where unemployment is forecast to fall to 4.5 per cent, an expanding workforce is vital for the strength of our economy and the living standards of our community.


That is why the Government is phasing out the tax offset for dependent spouses currently aged less than 40 to help encourage more Australians into paid employment.


From 1 July 2011, taxpayers with a dependent spouse born on or after 1 July 1971 will no longer be eligible for the dependent spouse tax offset. 


Dependent spouses with children are not affected by this measure, nor are taxpayers whose dependent spouse is a carer, an invalid or permanently unable to work. Taxpayers eligible for the zone, overseas forces or overseas civilian tax offsets are also not affected by this measure.


If the amendments in Schedule 4 are not enacted by 30 June 2011, some taxpayers may not be able to use the PAYG withholding system to claim their benefit during the 2011-12 income year.


Schedule 5 implements the 2011-12 Budget measure to introduce a single statutory rate of 20 per cent, regardless of distance travelled, for car fringe benefits valued under the statutory formula method.  


Under the current statutory formula method, the calculated fringe benefit from a salary-sacrificed or employer-provided car decreases as the distance travelled by the vehicle increases. People can therefore increase their tax concession by driving their vehicle further. This Schedule removes the current incentive for people to drive vehicles further than they otherwise would, in order to increase their tax concession.


The log book method will still be available for cars with significant genuine work-related use. This means that users will be able to ensure that actual work-related kilometres of travel continue to be tax exempt.


This reform applies to commitments made after the Budget announcement on 10 May 2011, and will be phased in over four years. Existing contracts will not be affected.


Both Schedule 4 and Schedule 5 implement further recommendations of the Australia's Future Tax System Review, and continue the process of tax reform started in May last year with the release of the Government's Stronger, Fairer, Simpler package of reforms.


Full details of the measures in this Bill are contained in the explanatory memorandum.


 


VETERANS’ ENTITLEMENTS AMENDMENT BILL 2011


I am pleased to present legislation that delivers on the Government’s budget measures to help support our veteran community.  These measures further improve the operation of Australia’s repatriation system and provide special recogni­tion to those Australians who were prisoners of war.  The 2011-12 Budget reflects the Govern­ment’s ongoing commitment to more than 360,000 veterans and their families. 


The Bill will introduce a new payment for surviving Australian prisoners of war (POW) recognising the hardships these men and women endured.  More than 30,000 Australians became prisoners during the Second World War and the Korean War.  


We have all heard of the hardships these men and women endured during captivity.  


Subject to extremely harsh conditions and deprivation, many have lived with the physical and psychological scars for decades.  All in service to their country.  There are around 900 former POWs still alive today and this Government believes that they deserve special recognition.  This Bill introduces a new payment of $500 per fortnight which will be known as the Prisoner of War Recognition Supplement.  Pay­ments will begin automatically for former POWs known to my Department.  The Supplement will be payable from 20 September 2011 with the first payment being made on 6 October 2011.  The Supplement will be payable in addition to any existing benefits the person receives from the Commonwealth.  It will be exempt income for the purposes of income tax and for the purposes of the veterans’ entitlements and social security income tests.


Further amendments in the Bill will affirm the longstanding arrangements under the Veterans’ Entitlements Act for compensation offsetting.  Offsetting is intended to prevent double payments of compensation.  This can happen when a vet­eran or member is eligible for compensation for the same incapacity under different schemes.


This Bill will clarify the longstanding compensation offsetting arrangements that have been in place in the Repatriation system since 1973.  This follows a Full Federal Court decision which highlighted the need to clarify the legislation.  It does not vary the disability pension for any veteran.


Finally, the Bill will rationalise and better target payments for veterans and members who are undergoing treatment for war or defence-caused injuries or diseases.  There is currently an overlap in the allowances paid to veterans and members who are unable to work due to episodes of medical treatment and recuperation for war or defence-caused injuries or diseases.  This Bill will better target payments through the loss of earnings allowance.  Abolishing the temporary incapacity allowance ensures individuals are recompensed where there is actual loss of income.  It has no impact on a veteran or member’s existing disability payment.  From 20 September 2011, all eligible veterans and members in this situation will be assessed consistently against the criteria for loss of earnings allowance.


This Government is committed to streamlining and enhancing the services and support that our veterans, members and their families so rightly deserve.


Debate adjourned.

 (Western Australia) (15:52): I, and also on behalf of Senators Xenophon and Williams, move:


That—


   (a)   the National Consumer Credit Protection Amendment Regulations 2011 (No. 2), as contained in Select Legislative Instrument 2011 No. 40 and made under the National Consumer Credit Protection Act 2009; and 


   (b)   the National Consumer Credit Protection Amendment Regulations 2011 (No. 3), as contained in Select Legislative Instrument 2011 No. 67 and made under the National Consumer Credit Protection Act 2009, be disallowed. [F2011L00465 and F2011L00764]


Thirteen sitting days remain, including today, to resolve the motion or the instruments will be deemed to have been disallowed.


The Gillard government through its actions has made it harder for smaller lenders to compete with the big banks. To ensure the lowest possible banking fees and bank interest rates overall, we need robust competition between all lenders. Instead of strengthening and enhancing competition, the Gillard government has reduced and weakened competition. The market share of smaller lenders has collapsed under this government. That reduced competition is not good for consumers and not good for small business.


The coalition welcomes the fact that many lenders are now offering mortgage products with no exit fees, where consumers can choose from that mix of features that best suits their circumstances. It may well be that a consumer prefers to go for the lower interest rate with an exit fee rather than the higher interest rate without an exit fee. 


We recommend to the Senate that it pass this disallowance motion that has been put forward by the coalition and Senator Xenophon today. It will force the govern­ment back to the drawing board. It will force the government to think through the implications of what it did in imposing a blanket ban on exit fees. Yes, it may sound counterintuitive, but the government's actions have lessened competition by making it harder for the smaller lenders to compete with the big banks. The government's actions have further strengthened the already dominant position of the big four banks. This is not in our national interest and it is most certainly not in the best interests of consumers and small businesses across Australia. We commend this motion to the Senate.

Senator HURLEY,ALP,2011-06-22,"



Senator HURLEY
 (South Australia) (15:54):  The Economics Committee had an inquiry about competition in banking. They had a look at this issue of exit fees. On the advice of many people and many consumer groups, the committee decided that exit fees were not a good idea because there is no point in creating competition within banks if people cannot then decide to shift between accounts. It is critical that people be able to shift.


We have a situation where the big banks have somewhere between 75 per cent and 80 per cent of mortgage accounts. So clearly they have an advantage. But if you want to give an advantage to smaller banks you do it in other ways, and the government has already put those measures in place. You do it in other ways so that those banks get a lower cost of funds. You do not stop competition. You do not stop customers being able to switch between banks.


Time and time again we had examples of customers who were unable to switch because of exit fees. Senator Williams, for example, used that example himself. What you are doing is closing off the ability of customers to switch if they get a better deal if they are not within the banks. Okay, big banks might have 75 per cent to 80 per cent, but that means that one in four customers will not be able to switch—and that is a dumb policy!

 (Victoria—Leader and Whip of the Family First Party) (15:56):  I seek leave to make a short statement.




The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:
  Leave is granted for two minutes.




Senator FIELDING:
  The high exit fees charged by lenders essentially trap customers and restrict them from switching to more competitive loans. This is hardly in the best interests of borrowers and is not good for competition in the long term. Also, we should not be discouraging efficient practices and competitive behaviour; we should be encouraging it. Allowing exit fees to continue to be charged by lenders only provides an incentive for this uncompetitive behaviour to continue. Therefore, I will not be supporting the disallowance motion.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (15:57):  I seek leave to make a short statement.




The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:
  Leave is granted for one minute.




Senator XENOPHON:
  I co-sponsor this motion. I support it and I believe it is the right thing to do because of the unintended consequences of having an across-the-board ban on exit fees. They should only be applied on the big banks as a matter of course. The right thing to do is to have tougher legislation, which I have introduced, that relates to unreasonable fees and shows mutuality between those fees and the costs of those charges.


Let us put this in perspective: $33 million in exit fees compared to $11 billion in bank charges and fees. There is a better way of doing this. I do not want to see the unintended consequences of the impact on small lenders that we saw with the bank guarantee legislation as a result of the GFC—a good idea badly implemented. You made the banks bigger and you have marginalised the smaller lenders. That is why I am very pleased to be associated with this motion.

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia) (15:52): I, and also on behalf of Senators Xenophon and Williams, move:


That—


   (a)   the National Consumer Credit Protection Amendment Regulations 2011 (No. 2), as contained in Select Legislative Instrument 2011 No. 40 and made under the National Consumer Credit Protection Act 2009; and 


   (b)   the National Consumer Credit Protection Amendment Regulations 2011 (No. 3), as contained in Select Legislative Instrument 2011 No. 67 and made under the National Consumer Credit Protection Act 2009, be disallowed. [F2011L00465 and F2011L00764]


Thirteen sitting days remain, including today, to resolve the motion or the instruments will be deemed to have been disallowed.


The Gillard government through its actions has made it harder for smaller lenders to compete with the big banks. To ensure the lowest possible banking fees and bank interest rates overall, we need robust competition between all lenders. Instead of strengthening and enhancing competition, the Gillard government has reduced and weakened competition. The market share of smaller lenders has collapsed under this government. That reduced competition is not good for consumers and not good for small business.


The coalition welcomes the fact that many lenders are now offering mortgage products with no exit fees, where consumers can choose from that mix of features that best suits their circumstances. It may well be that a consumer prefers to go for the lower interest rate with an exit fee rather than the higher interest rate without an exit fee. 


We recommend to the Senate that it pass this disallowance motion that has been put forward by the coalition and Senator Xenophon today. It will force the govern­ment back to the drawing board. It will force the government to think through the implications of what it did in imposing a blanket ban on exit fees. Yes, it may sound counterintuitive, but the government's actions have lessened competition by making it harder for the smaller lenders to compete with the big banks. The government's actions have further strengthened the already dominant position of the big four banks. This is not in our national interest and it is most certainly not in the best interests of consumers and small businesses across Australia. We commend this motion to the Senate.

Senator HURLEY,ALP,2011-06-22,"



Senator HURLEY
 (South Australia) (15:54):  The Economics Committee had an inquiry about competition in banking. They had a look at this issue of exit fees. On the advice of many people and many consumer groups, the committee decided that exit fees were not a good idea because there is no point in creating competition within banks if people cannot then decide to shift between accounts. It is critical that people be able to shift.


We have a situation where the big banks have somewhere between 75 per cent and 80 per cent of mortgage accounts. So clearly they have an advantage. But if you want to give an advantage to smaller banks you do it in other ways, and the government has already put those measures in place. You do it in other ways so that those banks get a lower cost of funds. You do not stop competition. You do not stop customers being able to switch between banks.


Time and time again we had examples of customers who were unable to switch because of exit fees. Senator Williams, for example, used that example himself.

Senator O'BRIEN,ALP,2011-06-22,"



Senator O'BRIEN
 (Tasmania) (19:20):  Senator Wortley has kindly agreed to allow me a few minutes of her contribution because I did not have the opportunity to make some remarks in the valedictory debate that I wanted to make. So I will do that now.


I particularly want to firstly acknowledge my colleagues Steve Hutchins and Annette Hurley. As will be clear from previous contributions, I have known Steve for many years. As Senator Faulkner said, Steve and I have not agreed on much over the years; although, in our later years here I think we found more things we could agree upon in the mellowness of age, which we both show. But we have not changed much except for our hair colour. 


In terms of Steve's absolute commitment to the things he believes in, I think they are the hallmark of Steve Hutchins and anyone who knows him here knows that he is a fervent believer in things and he will do everything to pursue the cause of those beliefs. I think that is the greatest mark of a person of honour. I have never had dealings with Steve where I did not believe I could trust his word; he was always honourable in that regard and that is another important mark of a person in my view. Honour in dealings is one of the critical tests that I apply. Annette Hurley I had a little to do with, mostly through the Economics Committee, working on dairy inquiries with other senators in this place. Annette's ability to accumulate knowledge, to understand issues and to work towards a solution were a testament to the capacity that she had. She was very unlucky, from the history that she and others have recounted but also because of what took place in selection of shadow ministries in times gone by, not to have found her way onto the front bench when Labor attained government in 2007. She has made a decision to leave in her own time and do the things that she wants to do, and I can clearly tell from the look on her face that she is entirely comfortable with that decision. I think that is a wonderful thing to be able to say. I have a great deal of respect for her and hope that she and her husband, Bob, continue to be the great partnership that they have been as I have observed them in her relatively short time in this place.


I want to make some comments about Senator Steve Fielding's role here. As most have observed, Senator Fielding has supported both sides on many occasions. I suppose that when you do that some say you please no-one. But in my view he has done what he has believed was the right thing to do on every occasion. In the position that he is in, he was able to do that when some of us, because we are loyal to our parties and the decision-making process, maybe were less comfortable with some decisions than others. So that is a matter which I think Senator Fielding can take from this place. At all times he did what he believed was right. I respect that.


I was pretty regretful of some of the things that happened in this chamber earlier today when a vote took place and comments were being made in a division. I reminded some people that privilege does not apply during a division and it is probably unwise to make certain comments, even in this chamber, when the benefits of privilege do not apply. But I thought that Senator Fielding handled that particularly well.


I want to say that I think this reflects upon the honourable way in which Senator Fielding conducted himself in here. I have observed his desire that the votes in this place reflect the will of the people. There was one particular vote on a disallowance going up towards 6:50. The debate would have been concluded and, had the debate not gone to a vote, the disallowance, which related to a Queensland fishing issue, would have been deemed carried and the regulation disallowed without the Senate having voted on it. But Senator Fielding, to his credit even though he did not support the ultimate outcome, supported the concept that the will of the Senate, not the effluxion of time and the fact that the matter was not allowed to come to a vote, ought to determine the outcome.


He supported his conscience in that regard. His view on the matter was lost in the vote, but he believed—and I believed and said to him that I believed—that he had done the right thing. That reflected very well on him. I believe that to this day. I think that is one of the greatest marks of Senator Fielding's approach to this place. It was a very honourable approach. Thank you.
