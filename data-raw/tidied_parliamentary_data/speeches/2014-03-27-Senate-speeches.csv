Senator SINGH
 (Tasmania) (09:31):  I rise to speak to the Privacy Amendment (Privacy Alerts) Bill 2014. Labor believes Australians should be told when there has been a breach of their privacy. It is time that companies who are required to protect Australians' personal data should also have the complementary duty to tell a consumer when their personal data has been the subject of unauthorised public release. Businesses that already implement good privacy practices and comply with current voluntary guides from the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner, the OAIC, will have little difficulty in transitioning to the new scheme.


A consumer should have the right to know if their personal information has become compromised or if their bank or telecommunications provider has lax security standards. Consumers need to have the power to change their passwords, improve their security settings online, cancel credit cards or completely change providers such as banks and telecommunications companies.


In an increasingly digital world, more and more data and personal information is being collected from Australian families. This bill puts in place a compulsory notification regime in order to strengthen the protections around this information and build on the privacy regime Labor implemented when it was in government. The bill will require all entities currently regulated by the act to notify affected individuals and the OAIC when there has been a data breach that gives rise to a real risk of serious harm to an affected individual. A real risk is defined as a risk that is not a remote risk. Therefore, only the more serious data breaches will need to be notified—a responsible approach to implementing this important privacy regulation.


The OAIC will have the power to compel notification to affected individuals were it becomes aware of a serious data breach that has not been notified. The OAIC will also be given the power to exempt an entity from the notification requirement where it is in the public interest to do so. The bill ensures that the victims of a data breach will receive comprehensive and useful information about the circumstances of the relevant breach. Firstly, it must contain a description of the breach. Secondly, it must contain a list of the types of personal information that were accessed or disclosed. Thirdly, the notification must contain recommendations about the steps that individuals should take in response to the breach. Finally, contact information for affected individuals to obtain more information and assistance must also be included.


Noncompliance with the scheme would attract the normal Privacy Act remedies. These include public or personal apologies, compensation payments or enforceable undertakings. Under the new privacy regime enacted by the Gillard Labor government, a civil penalty can be sought where there has been serious or repeated noncompliance with mandatory notification requirements.


This bill is in substantially similar terms to the Privacy Amendment (Privacy Alerts) Bill 2013 previously introduced into the parliament in 2013 by the Gillard Labor government. It was to be the next step in the important reforms of Australia's privacy legislation being delivered by the Labor government, but the bill lapsed when parliament was prorogued ahead of the 2013 federal election.


The privacy reforms passed in the last parliament were significant Labor reforms to an area of law about which Australians are deeply concerned, and rightly so. That legislation, which has recently begun operation, delivered a number of important changes. The Privacy Act now contains a set of 13 Australian Privacy Principles which apply to Australian and Norfolk Island governments and some private sector organisations. The APPs harmonised and replaced the two sets of principles which previously applied to government and the private sector. The Office of the Australian Information Commissioner has been given new powers to assess and enforce privacy compliance and to seek civil penalties where serious breaches occur.


There are new provisions in the Privacy Act governing credit reporting. The law now provides for both more comprehensive credit reporting and an improved process for correcting reporting errors and dealing with complaints. Civil penalties now apply for certain breaches of the credit reporting provisions. The Privacy Act now provides for the recognition of external dispute resolution schemes for handling privacy complaints and for the registration of binding privacy codes.


These are all important reforms. They are important Labor reforms. It took a Labor government to enact the Privacy Act 1988 and it took a Labor government to deliver the most significant reforms to that act in the decade and a half since. Labor understands that privacy is a human right. Labor understands that technological change has made privacy a pressing everyday concern for many, many Australians. These reforms are well within the long and proud Labor tradition of consumer protection. They are an example of Labor's commitment to responsible regulation which protects rights which make a real and positive difference in the way Australians work and live.


The bill I speak to today is the next step in that package of reforms. The bill will introduce a new consumer privacy protection for Australians that will keep their personal information more secure in the digital age. It will also encourage agencies and private sector organisations to improve their data security practices. The risk of data breaches and the seriousness of their consequences have grown as new technology has allowed government and the private sector to collect more and more personal information about Australians. A data breach can severely affect an individual whose personal information has been compromised. People can lose money. The identity can be stolen. They can be embarrassed and distressed by the release of sensitive personal information.


Labor believes that individuals should know when their privacy has been interfered with. Currently, the law imposes no obligation on organisations who suffer a data breach to notify those whose privacy has been compromised. Labor thinks that is manifestly inadequate. It is out of step with what our community expects. It is out of step with the way that technology has changed the way we live our lives. Labor is committed to act to remedy this gap in our privacy laws. We were committed to doing this in government and we remain committed to doing it in opposition. 


Data breaches are of significant concern to modern Australia. There have been a number of high-profile breaches in Australia in recent times. One that comes to mind recently was the Department of Immigration in February this year, which published personal details of around 10,000 asylum seekers held in Australia. Similarly, between February 2012 and May 2013, the information of 15,775 of a telco's customers from 2009 and earlier were accessible on the internet. This included the information of 1,257 active silent customers. Previously, the personal information of approximately 734,000 customers had been made publicly available online in December 2011. Other large companies have had data breach issues as well, and the OAIC is aware of 56 data breaches in 2011-12.


But data breaches are a concern not only for individuals. The security of personal data is of commercial importance to Australian companies. Data breaches are bad for business and can be incredibly costly due to the errors that come about from them. Companies stand to lose not just time and money rectifying a data breach but also their reputation, and in a modern information economy the important trust of consumers in a company's privacy compliance is an incredibly important part of a company's goodwill. In 2012, the ABC reported that the average data breach incident in Australia cost the organisation in question some $2 million. What is more, that average cost has been steadily rising year on year.


Labor understands the importance of this issue not only to individuals but also to business and to the competitiveness of Australian companies and we have introduced this bill from opposition to ensure that appropriate action is now taken. This bill, rightly, has strong support from Australia's various information and privacy commissioners, from relevant industries, from IT security experts and from privacy and consumer advocates. But most importantly, the Australian public demand the protection this bill will provide. In a survey conducted last year, the OAIC reported that some 96 per cent of Australians believed that they should be notified of data breaches if they are affected by them. 


In government, Labor consulted extensively with relevant stakeholders. We focused on making these reforms as flexible as possible. We focused on minimising the compliance burden on companies and agencies while making sure that the privacy rights of individuals are steadfastly protected. We took both industry and consumer concerns on board, and the widespread support for the bill very much reflects this. So given that the hard work of this bill has been done by Labor and given that consumers and industry support its passage, we might wonder why the new Attorney-General has sat on his hands. This month the suite of privacy reforms that were passed by the Gillard Labor government entered into force and this bill comprises an important addition to that package of reforms. 


So why hasn't the government acted? Industry and the community are ready for this reform and, indeed, it will be easier for compliance if this bill could enter into operation more or less alongside the other major changes to the Privacy Act which have just now come into force. Delaying the passage of this bill would leave Australia behind developments in comparable jurisdictions, notably jurisdictions like the US and the EU. Australian consumers deserve protection every bit as good as that which the citizens of other nations enjoy, and Australian businesses must stay ahead of the curve to be competitive.


The Liberals did support this bill, though, when last in parliament and, when the bills lapsed at the conclusion of the 43rd Parliament, there were reports in the press that an incoming Liberal government would continue this important work and work towards the enactment of a privacy alert law when in government. Well, they have now had six months in power, and yet we have heard nothing from this government. Nor is it the case that the Abbott government or the Attorney-General, Senator Brandis, have more important things to do. Senator Brandis's only legislative work in the time he has been in office has been the bills he contributed to the Abbott government's repeal day media event. In many cases the main function of these bills was the correction of typographical errors and grammatical mistakes: a worthy enterprise, but not one that carries much legislative weight. As my colleagues in another place pointed out yesterday, the Attorney-General is yet to introduce any legislation of substance.


I hope that the Attorney-General's unedifying recent appearance on Alan Jones's show on 2GB radio does not indicate that he is now preparing to walk away from privacy law reform. On 14 March, in a display of disingenuousness, Senator Brandis appeared to disown the privacy laws that he and his party had voted for in the last parliament. Mr Jones put a number of confused complaints to the Attorney-General about the operation of the new credit reporting provisions of the privacy legislation, and this is what our bold Attorney-General said in the course of his response:


… these were measures that were introduced by the Gillard Government.


He said that the new privacy laws were:


… something we inherited from Gillard.


What a shameless act of buck-passing, when they supported the privacy reforms in the last parliament. The Liberal Party supported these privacy reforms in the last parliament. So though it was Labor that spearheaded these reforms, and Labor that did the hard yards, the Liberal Party did do the right thing in supporting our privacy reforms in the last parliament. They were right to do that at that time and so that is why it is now disappointing that they should not have the integrity to continue to hold to that responsible policy position—some six months have passed and they have had so many opportunities in the time we have been sitting in parliament for them to have done so.


When Australians want to know their Attorney-General's position on issues that matter to them, should they trust the way he votes in this parliament, or should they trust his throwaway lines on talkback radio? The only thing the public can count on is the opportunism of the Attorney-General. Why doesn't he have the courage of his convictions to stick by the Labor reforms that he so rightly supported? And why doesn't he explain the operation of legislation that he did vote for, rather than slinking away from it at the slightest hint of public debate—like the example I just gave of him on talkback radio? Does the Attorney-General support privacy law reform again, now that he is back in the cloisters of the parliament? What is his position on this issue which is of such importance to Australians in their everyday lives, and will continue to be important to them as we continue into this age of the digital economy?


Given the paucity of his own legislative record as Attorney-General, I would have thought Senator Brandis would be desperate to claim some credit for any good policy that had passed through this place. Now the Attorney-General has another chance to support good privacy policy with the introduction of this privacy alerts bill. This privacy alerts bill is a constructive policy proposal. It is ready to go. The people want it. Industry wants it. But where is our Attorney-General and where is the Abbott government on privacy law reforms? Why has it fallen to the opposition to provide this parliament with some real policy substance? The Liberal Party has been in government for some time now. There have been a number of opportunities for the new Abbott government to introduce privacy law reforms, to continue on with the good work started by the Labor government in this area of privacy reform. It is something that Australian consumers want. It is something that industry wants. In fact, it is something that ensures that industry has better data hygiene, if you like, around the way that its data complies with privacy laws.


This government and this Attorney-General might be a policy-free zone, but the Labor opposition is here to help. I sincerely hope that, as they rightly did when they were in opposition, the Liberals will support this prudent bill—this bill that is needed; this bill that will put us in step with other jurisdictions such as the EU and the US; this bill that will ensure we have certainty for consumers and for industry as we move further into this digital age. I hope the government will help us continue the good work in this area of the previous Labor government and I hope they will support this bill. I commend the bill to the Senate.

"Boyce, Sen Sue",LP,2014-03-27,"



Senator BOYCE
 (Queensland) (09:51):  Well, here we are at Groundhog Day again! I am surprised that the opposition would want to remind the Australian people of the bureaucratic and administrative mishmash and nightmare that purported to be government by the Labor Party.


The government strongly supports all efforts to improve privacy provisions for the Australian people and Australian organisations but—surprise, surprise!—we do not support doing it in the erratic, inexperienced, unthinking way that Labor would try to go about this. This piece of legislation was first brought to the House in June last year by the then government and came to the Senate with a whole 1½ days for a committee to hold an inquiry into the effects that it would have. It, of course, was something that they apparently had forgotten to include in their first tranche of legislation on privacy—and why would we be surprised by that? In the annals of history, the FoFA—Future of Financial Advice—legislation will stand in years to come for administrators to use as an example of how never to try and go about public policy: three tranches of legislation, some of it actually contradictory; some of it requiring that an IT system that had been put in place to meet the requirements of a first bill would subsequently have to be changed—within six months, was what the government first wanted—by those working in the industry. So we had once again the usual complete inability, apparently, of the Labor Party to grasp that some people out there are trying to make profits to create jobs and to create growth in our economy. This bill that we are now debating came into that category entirely.


I am somewhat bemused by Senator Singh's suggestion that Labor has consulted extensively with stakeholders in government. I will just quote from a couple of witnesses—well, not witnesses, because we did not have time to hold a full inquiry; it was done on the paper—for the inquiry held last year by the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee. The Cyberspace Law and Policy Centre of the University of New South Wales pointed out that it had 'around 10 working hours in which to collaborate on, draft and finalise a submission'. I am not sure that that constitutes extensive consultation. The Australian Privacy Foundation, who are dedicated to ensuring that the Privacy Principles apply to Australians, said that the great rush of the Labor government to get this piece of legislation through on reporting of breaches had a:


… seriously negative impact on the democratic process that is inherent in the provision by the Parliament of 1-1/2 working days, during which civil society organisations are expected to discuss, draft and finalise a Submission to your Committee.


Those comments go back to June last year, when this was an urgent, urgent piece of legislation to fix up, presumably, something that the then government had left out of the Privacy Act. 


On 21 March, Minter Ellison pointed out to its clients that the bill was introduced with 'little fanfare' by Labor Senator Lisa Singh and that it brought up the same amendments that had been proposed by the then government back in June, when it was such an urgent, urgent issue. Minter Ellison said:


The timing is likely to be concerning for those entities still coming to grips with implementing the changes required by the amendments to the Privacy Act which commenced on 12 March this year.


The then opposition, the now government, did indeed support the Privacy Act put forward and the principles that changed it, but we also warned that there was no need to introduce these particular reporting requirements in a whole new piece of legislation at the same time that we were asking Commonwealth organisations and other reporting entities to get their heads and their systems around implementing the changes that were required under the Privacy Act and were to be implemented on 12 March. We have, yet again, the situation where a Labor government apparently thought it was okay to ask organisations to change their systems every 20 minutes on the whim of a government that did not have a clue what it was doing in terms of the costs it was imposing and the problems it was creating.


We only have to go back as far as the original changes to the Privacy Act that has now come into play: if it had gone ahead as the then Labor government wanted, most banks in Australia would have had to change the way they went about data processing. We were told during a committee hearing on the Privacy Act itself that a lot of data processing for Australian banks occurs offshore, including in New Zealand, yet if the legislation, as Labor drafted it, had stood this would have become at least fraught and possibly illegal. So there is a lot of good to be gained out of an inquiry process of the Senate. 


I am not quite sure who Senator Singh has consulted so widely with, but certainly none of the stakeholders that I am aware of feel as though they have been consulted. To whip this legislation in now and then come up with some righteous platitudes, trying to suggest that only Labor cares about privacy, is the typical sort of stunt that one expects from a Labor opposition. It is not only Labor who cares about privacy. The basic legislation of the Privacy Act has been in operation now for a good two weeks. For heaven's sake, can we not let that settle down before we look at other changes that may very well need to be made and may in fact be useful changes?


Who knows is the problem. Who knows? This stunt appears to be designed to try to maximise some publicity out of the recent breach by the Department of Immigration and Border Protection, which, of course, this government abhors and has certainly dealt with in terms of repairing the damage that has been done as far as possible.


The model that Senator Singh would have us pass suggests that every government organisation, every reporting entity, should pass on to the Australian Information Commissioner data breaches which have given rise to a 'real risk of serious harm' to an affected individual. No-one, of course, has any issue whatsoever with that statement. The government would support the development of principles that would ensure that we were aware when serious breaches that caused real harm had occurred. The problem, of course, comes down to what exactly are we talking about when we talk about the 'real risk of serious harm'. Senator Singh says we define 'real risk' as 'not a remote risk'. Great! But what is 'serious harm'? What is a 'serious breach'? There is very little definition in it—and, of course, that will vary from individual to individual. The way to flesh out where the limits of this legislation should be, the costs that might be imposed by putting this legislation through, is to consult extensively, which certainly has not happened, with stakeholders.


The implications of this legislation, when we do not have a significant view of what constitutes 'real risk' or 'real harm', could be huge. We simply do not know where it would stop and start. Of course the people who are being asked to enforce it would not know where it should stop and where it should start. It is quite possible that if your PIN, for example, was inadvertently revealed, in some situations this could cause serious harm. It could be a serious breach. With a bank with very good security systems that could alert the individual immediately that somehow this had happened, then it may not cause serious harm or be a serious breach, because it has not caused damage to the individual. 


Once again, we do not really know what the Labor Party is on about. Without having a full inquiry into how this would work, where the parameters should be, it cannot happen. But, of course, Senator Singh is not really interested in getting this legislation passed; she is interested in the smoke and mirrors of pretending to care more than the government about a principle which, of course, is one that this government more than any other has embedded into the culture of Australia. Privacy is something that has been of great concern and great interest to this government and this party. It is ridiculous of the Labor Party to suggest that they could, through their bureaucratic approach, improve the system that is in place.


The restrictive time frame on this legislation when it was first put up by the then government and the lack of analysis in most of the submissions—simply because the submitters did not have time to do it properly—was most unfortunate. There was no thorough or detailed scrutiny of this bill and there still hasn't been. All we have is the pious platitudes from Senator Singh suggesting that this is the right way to go. We have no idea how companies would be asked to interpret the legislation and what it means; we have no idea what the costs of adding this reporting process to the system would be; and we have no idea how this would interact with the current new Privacy Act that has come into force on the 12 March and which companies are happily, currently, put into place. Let us bed that down before we get on with the very real job that we would agree is vital to do, to ensure that breaches of privacy are reported to the Australian Information Commissioner and to the individuals concerned. 


There is certainly an underreporting of privacy breaches in Australia. No-one is arguing about that. That needs to be fixed. But you would have thought that a piece of legislation that introduced 13 privacy principles and was supported by the now government would have come a long way towards fixing that. If it did not fix that, what was wrong with the then government, the Labor government, in the first place? Why on earth couldn't that have been a significant part of their original legislation? Let us see how the legislation that has now come into fruition—and has been operational now for just on two weeks—works before we go into the world of compulsory reporting, particularly compulsory reporting based on 'serious harm', 'real risk' and 'serious breach'. As I have pointed out, what constitutes a 'serious breach'? Certainly in the examples that Senator Singh gave no-one would have any problems saying, 'Yes, they are serious breaches of privacy principles—serious breaches,' and they have both come to public attention and they have both been dealt with. But there are many, many times when a company would need to consider whether a breach had the 'real risk', as opposed to a 'remote risk', of causing serious harm and was in fact a serious breach. These would be matters for judgement in many cases. This legislation gives companies no guidance whatsoever on what is a real risk or a serious breach or what would cause serious harm to an individual. There are, at the borders of this, many times that organisations would have to consider whether what was being proposed was in fact a problem or not a problem.


So, if Senator Singh had been serious about this legislation and wanting it to pass, she would not have snuck it into the Senate with, as Minter Ellison points out, little fanfare; she would have brought it to the attention of the Attorney-General, had it discussed and sought an inquiry from the relevant committee on this legislation so that all the stakeholders could tell us what their concerns were and how we might address any problems that were seen to be in the legislation, and she would have had the courtesy to give the many organisations that have just put new privacy principles in place a heads-up and a long time frame in which to decide how these changes might best sit with the changes that they have already had to make in the last few months to meet the new Privacy Act requirements. But none of this happened, of course, because Labor are not at all interested in getting this legislation through. They do not really care about breaches of privacy for individuals. They just care about trying to make a bit of a song and dance and carry on as though the government is in fact not looking at the issue.


It is quite bizarre that Senator Singh has chosen to approach it in this way. This legislation was allegedly urgent in June last year, according to the then government. If it was so urgent, they had plenty of opportunity to enact it. They pushed the Senate committee to make its inquiry in less than a few days. We did not have time to call witnesses; it was done on the papers. I have already used a couple of examples from the many submitters who made the point that, within that time frame, they could not put in a decent submission setting out in detail their concerns about this piece of legislation. Without any further consultation or any further work whatsoever, Senator Singh thinks that the Senate should simply roll over and put in place her piece of legislation when, as we said, no-one knows how it will pan out in practice. Without consulting the people who would have the difficulties—the onerous task—of ensuring that it goes into practice, it is ridiculous of Senator Singh to be suggesting that this legislation should go through.


I would make the point that, in the comments made by coalition senators on that extraordinarily rushed inquiry last year, we said:


Coalition senators note the concerns expressed by a number of submitters regarding the lack of definition of the terms 'serious breach' or 'serious harm' in the legislation.


Not only were the submitters concerned about the fact that there was no true definition there and in many cases it would be a matter of employing people to sit and decide what that meant; the industry also expressed great concern at the regulatory overload that the then government was putting on them or attempting to put on them. None of us would be surprised, of course, at the fact that industry—which, as I said, is driving our economy—would be complaining about regulatory overload from the then Labor government, the Rudd-Gillard government, because 'regulatory overload' was their middle name. Let us look at this legislation properly and not play political games.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Privacy Amendment (Privacy Alerts) Bill 2014</title>,BILLS,0,1,speech
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2014-03-27,"



Senator LUDWIG
 (Queensland) (10:11):  Normally it would be uncharacteristic of me to comment on a previous senator's contribution, other than to indicate that perhaps it was a little muddled and a little circuitous in its argument. But, nonetheless, it gives me an opportunity to correct some of the misconceived ideas in the contributions that have been made by those opposite on this important bill, the Privacy Amendment (Privacy Alerts) Bill 2014.


Labor is a proud champion of the rights of Australians, including the right to privacy—unlike, it appears, those opposite, but that surprised me nonetheless. Unlike the Liberal and National Party government, who have shown a blatant disregard for the rights of Australians, whether against racial discrimination or against breaches of privacy, in this instance Labor is taking action. It is deplorable that it takes an opposition to do what is, in effect, basic work of a government.


This bill provides another simple, basic plank in the protection of the right of Australian citizens to have their data held safely and, when breaches occur, to be notified. It is a very simple concept. The Australian government is the custodian of some of the most sensitive data and information of individuals. It is imperative that government departments and agencies act above and beyond best practice in the handling, management and storage of and access to the data of individuals.


It was the Liberal and National government who dispassionately oversaw the release of thousands of personal details of people in the government's care. It took a news outlet, The Guardian, to alert the department and cause it to act responsibly. That is in the face of what already exists on the record, which is the April 2012 document Data breach notification—a guide to handling personal information security breaches, a guideline produced by an Australian government agency, the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner. One would have thought the government would at least have managed to follow those guidelines, but no. If that is the standard that this government has for the privacy of people in its direct care and responsibility then it is apparent what its disregard for privacy as a whole would be.


Only Labor cares about the rights of individuals to have their privacy protected. It is, frankly, damning in the extreme that the government has not picked up the work of the former government and continued this important reform. It speaks volumes of the priorities and the choices being made by the Abbott government. Whether it is letting jobs and industries fall off the cliff, or tearing away the basic protections against racial discrimination, or instituting knights and dames—which I think is becoming comical—it is now clear that this government stands for little and is doing little. The Abbott government is not standing up for Australians and is not working in the best interests of their privacy or their rights.


I notice that the Attorney-General is in the chamber, so let us consider his track record. Let us look at what he has done during the six months he has been in office. Has he introduced measures to protect privacy? No. Has he looked at a reform agenda? If you put the Racial Discrimination Act in that bin, I think the answer is no. The only piece of legislation the Attorney-General has introduced into the parliament is to correct typos in a bill dating back to 1901! How apt it is that this anachronistic Attorney-General's first priority in this chamber has been correcting commas and removing hyphens from words such as 'email' rather than protecting the important rights of Australian citizens. This is an Attorney-General who has become absolutely catatonic when it comes to being the first law officer of the land. He has ground his department to a screaming halt—no reforms, no protections, no actions. After his 'commas and hyphens bill' his first priority—and I quote his own cabinet colleagues—has been 'to drink the right wing Kool-Aid'. That comment does not come from this side; it comes from his own side. His own cabinet and backbench have had to pull him away from the ideological cliff. Be that as it may, I think the truth is that the Attorney-General has his eyes on the bigger prize—and Senator Abetz, the leader in this place, does seem to be looking over his shoulder. I think—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Fawcett
):  Senator Ludwig, I draw your attention to standing order 193 and the imputation of improper motives against any other member.




Senator LUDWIG:
  If the Attorney-General were serious, he would be in the business of actual law reform. The privacy legislation was ready to go, but it has been sitting on the Attorney-General's windowsill, yellowing with age. Mr Acting Deputy President, you can picture the Attorney-General sitting in his office—or, as he called it yesterday, his 'chambers'—probably wearing his robe and wig, calling public servants to 'come hither'. And up they would run, with their briefs in their arms. But there would be not one brief about reform, not one that the first law officer of the land could sign off on that deals with privacy or protections for individuals. Instead, there would be one about commas and hyphens. Frankly, I think we need an Attorney-General who is a little bit more in touch. The bill will implement—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Ludwig, I draw your attention to standing order 193 about personal reflections on members.




Senator LUDWIG:
  The introduction of a mandatory data breach notification requirement will be a major consumer privacy protection reform. It will enable individuals affected by a data breach to take action to prevent identity theft and fraud by taking actions such as cancelling credit cards or changing passwords. It will encourage government agencies and private sector organisations to lift their security standards and be more transparent about how they handle personal information.


The proposals in the bill had been developed over a long period of time in consultation with a diverse range of industry groups and privacy and consumer advocates—unlike what the previous speaker spoke of. The bill will require all entities currently regulated by the act to notify affected individuals and the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner where there has been a data breach that gives rise to 'a real risk of serious harm' to an affected individual. A 'real risk' is defined as 'a risk that is not a remote risk'. That is one matter that was raised a number of times by Senator Boyce in her contribution. But if the good senator had done her homework she would have gone back to the ALRC's original report dealing with data breach notifications. In that report, the ALRC provided guidance about this particular matter—real risk of serious harm. I draw the Senate's attention to provision 51.85 of the ALRC's 2008 review No.108. It says:


In international law, the term 'a real risk of serious harm' has been refined to mean 'a reasonable degree of likelihood', 'real and substantial danger' and 'a real and substantial risk'.


And the ALRC cites a case on that point, at footnote 133, which is 'R v Secretary of State for the Home Department'.


In its draft voluntary information security breach notification guide the OPC sets out a number of questions to evaluate the risk associated with the breach: 'What personal information is involved and how sensitive is it? Could the information be used for fraudulent purposes? What is the cause and extent of the breach—for example, is there a risk of ongoing breaches? Is the information easily accessible? Was the breach deliberate, or inadvertent? Who is affected, how many people are affected, and are they particularly at risk of harm? What harm could result—for example, who is the recipient of the information; could the breach lead to fraud, financial loss or humiliation; and what impact would the breach have on the organisation or agency concerned?'


This is a matter that has been well thought through. The OAIC will have the power to compel notification to affected individuals where it becomes aware, as a result of complaints by individuals or otherwise, of serious data breaches that have not been notified. The OAIC will also be given the power to exempt an entity from the notification requirements where it is in the public interest to do so.


This is a scheme that has not only had extensive consultation; it has effectively already been embodied in a guide for the Public Service since April 2012. It is certainly not new to the Public Service or, more broadly, to those who work in the privacy area, including those companies which already take steps to protect people's privacy—for the obvious reason that it is good business practice.


Notification is ultimately about empowering the consumers, the individuals, where there have been breaches. The notification itself must contain at least four key pieces of information. It should contain a description of the breach, a list of the types of personal information that were accessed or disclosed, recommendations about the steps that individuals should take in response to the breach and, finally, contact information to allow affected individuals to obtain more information or assistance. It is quite a simple scheme that allows individuals to take appropriate action where their privacy may have been compromised. 


Noncompliance with the scheme would attract normal Privacy Act remedies. These could include public or personal apologies, compensation payments or enforceable undertakings. A civil penalty could be sought where there has been serious or repeated noncompliance with the mandatory notification scheme. 


This proposal has strong support from state and federal information privacy commissioners, from IT security companies and from privacy and consumer advocates. Some industry groups have asked for the proposals to be delayed, citing a large privacy law workload. Most, however, believe that it would easier for compliance purposes if the proposals were to commence with the other major privacy reforms in March 2014—which I agree with. Implementing this bill alongside those reforms would add to, not detract from, business certainty. It would help with compliance obligations for businesses as well as, more importantly, providing appropriate protections for individuals. 


Delaying the proposals until the impact of the 2014 privacy reforms have been assessed would effectively postpone this action until around 2015 or 2016. This would attract, I think, significant negative criticism from consumer and privacy advocates and leave Australian developments well behind those of the US and EU in this important area. Some of the concerns raised by industry groups have been addressed in this bill, particularly those relating to the cost impacts. As a result, the bill now contains concessions to industry concerns, including more flexible notification and more clarity around the process for seeking exemption from notification requirements.


It is instructive on these issues to go back to the original ALRC report of May 2008, For your information—Australian privacy laws and practice. It said:


The Privacy Act should provide for notification by agencies and organisations to individuals affected by a data breach.


It is not simply about data breaches as an esoteric concept in the broad. As the ALRC report goes on to say:


… the primary rationale for data breach notification laws is that notifying people that their personal information has been breached can help to minimise the damage caused by the breach. Notification acknowledges the fact that a data breach potentially can expose an individual to a serious risk of harm. By arming individuals with the necessary information, they have the opportunity, for example, ‘to monitor their accounts, take preventative measures such as new accounts, and be ready to correct any damage done’.


But the risks are not limited to financial matters. The ALRC report continues: 


Other types of personal information, such as health information, if disclosed, could subject a person to discriminatory treatment or damage to his or her reputation. Informing a person that such information has been disclosed makes that person aware of what may be the possible consequences of the breach.


All of that points to the importance of ensuring that personal information is maintained in the appropriate way and, if it is not—if there is either an inadvertent breach or a deliberate breach—to the importance of notification. Individuals, once notified, can take appropriate action. By notifying them, you arm them—you give the individual the power to do something rather than just be a target. 


A data breach notification also provides incentives to businesses to improve their data security. There are a range of reasons why some companies might not want to notify consumers. The reputational damage that could follow a high-profile data breach, or the commercial consequences of such a breach, provides a powerful incentive not to notify. This bill will ensure that they do notify and give them the proactive ability to arm individuals with the necessary things to help them deal with such a data breach. Overall, it also creates a market incentive. Those companies with good, strong data protection notification regimes or privacy alert regimes and those with good information on privacy practices will have a competitive advantage in the marketplace. Consumers and individuals will feel more confident in dealing with those types of businesses, amongst an array of competing businesses, who can stand out and say: 'When you give us your personal information, feel confident that we will protect it. If we inadvertently fail in that, we have a privacy alert in place that will proactively deal with it in a range of ways.' In today's modern business world, I think that is a far better way to deal with areas of privacy.


One of the disappointing things is that there is a long list of speakers for this bill. I assume many from those opposite want to contribute to such a positive bill from Senator Singh. I do not think they ultimately disagree with it, but I do worry that they might simply be talking it out so we do not get on to another bill, the environmental bill dealing with supertrawlers. I would not think that ordinarily; I would think everyone has a positive view about dealing with privacy. I would encourage those on the other side to support what is good public policy and what provides for good outcomes for privacy. Ultimately, I think that the government will pass the bill in this form or a similar form when the Attorney-General gets off his hands and that they will be back in this chamber supporting it.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2014-03-27,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (10:32):  I start my contribution by suggesting to Senator Ludwig that his attempt at humour at the expense of the Attorney-General was not only tawdry but a complete failure. I am sure Senator Brandis enjoyed it! I can see him now trembling at the vicious attack with a lettuce leaf! I suggest to Senator Ludwig that he sticks to his day job, like single-handedly destroying the northern beef cattle industry. I have been here awhile and Senator Brandis is one of the best attorneys-general I have seen in this parliament. Certainly in the last six years there is no comparison. He is a lawyer, a deep thinker and someone who understands the importance of his role. He is able to contribute not only with style but with expertise, common sense and a deep understanding of the law. Senator Ludwig's attempt at a humorous attack on the best Attorney-General I have seen was a complete failure.


Senator Ludwig did suggest that the Privacy Amendment (Privacy Alerts) Bill 2014 was sitting on the Attorney's windowsill going yellow in the sunlight, or some other such analogy. If this bill is so important, why did the former government leave it until the dying days of the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd governments to try to get it through? If it is as important as Senator Ludwig is saying, one wonders why it took the Labor Party 5½ years to get to where it is?


I do want to comment on the provisions of the bill. Before I do that, I pose this question to the other speakers in this debate, particularly to the Greens political party. I would guess that because it is a Labor bill, the Greens political party will be supporting it. I have no rationale for that, except Labor and the Greens seem to vote together on everything and have done for years. I wonder what Senator Ludlam will say in his contribution to this bill? It might be a little hard for him to contribute to the bill because I understand he is wagging it from his paid job in the Senate these last couple of weeks and is in Western Australian campaigning in a political campaign. As I understand it, he is being paid to be here working in this chamber. 


He is not here contributing to the debate, but perhaps other Greens senators who will speak might be able to answer this query. What do the Greens say about Senator Ludwig's attempt to bring into the parliament two people of questionable legality to give evidence at a parliamentary committee? I refer to Senator Ludwig's attempt to call as witnesses Mr Assange and Mr Snowdon. Mr Snowdon has been described in this chamber as a traitor to his country. Those two gentlemen, as I understand it, have no respect for anyone's privacy and certainly no respect for their nation's privacy—that is, their nation's security. Yet, here we have the Greens talking about privacy, indicating how important it is, when they are wanting to bring to a parliamentary committee two people who do not respect privacy at all and in fact disrespect privacy to the highest degree in that they have no regard for the security of their own nations. 


So it will be interesting to see how the Greens will distinguish their support for their friends in the Labor Party on this and every other bill with their attempt to destroy everyone's privacy by getting Snowdon and Assange to give evidence. If they do give evidence, it might be interesting if they tell the world just how they hacked into everyone's privacy, into the national privacy. Perhaps we can all learn something from them if we can get the details on how they hacked into the nation's privacy. So I will be listening to the debate very keenly to hear how the Greens address those issues. 


The Privacy Amendment (Privacy Alerts) Bill 2014 is similar to a bill that, as I mentioned, was introduced by the Labor government in 2013. I again repeat the point that if there is a concern about the passage of this bill, why didn't the Labor government do something about it in the previous six years rather than leaving it to a couple of days before the last parliament was prorogued? It did actually pass through the House of Representatives in June last year.


The bill was considered by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee, which reported to the Senate on 24 June. Senator Boyce in her quite distinguished and perceptive contribution—she was a member of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee at the time it considered the bill—to this debate spoke with some authority. She had actually sat through the hearings of the legislation committee's inquiry into the forerunner of this bill.


Senator Boyce and then Senator Humphries provided some additional comments to the report of the committee, which of course had a Labor majority. They expressed some concern at the lack of definition of the terms 'serious breach' or 'serious harm' in the legislation. As I read their report and listened to Senator Boyce, they also cited concerns about the regulatory overload for business.


The regulatory overload for business is costing our country money. We have made it quite clear in our pre-election commitments and by actions since then that we understand the impost of regulatory burden on business, particularly small business, and we are trying to do something about it. We have introduced several bills into the other house trying to get rid of some of the regulation that costs Australia so dearly, that makes Australia uncompetitive in its trading activities around the world and uncompetitive within our own country.


Here we are, as a government, trying to reduce the regulatory burden to encourage business activity—that is, to encourage employment, to heighten our standard of living in this country. At the same time, the Labor Party and the Greens are doing everything possible to, again, impose regulation on the Australian public, and particularly on business. That is because the Labor Party and the Greens particularly have this inflated view that people are not capable of looking after themselves; that they in the Labor Party and the Greens know better how to regulate people's lives and people's businesses than people, business men and women. A classic example of this was the embarrassment of the Senate inquiries into the Qantas issue where the Green senators tried to suggest to one of the biggest businesses in the world how they should run a business. It was laughable. If anyone had a look at the transcript of those two Senate inquiries, they would appreciate just how embarrassing it is to sit in on those committees and hear some of the inane questions that were asked by Greens and Labor senators about a multinational business—I digress slightly. I want to get back to my point: we are trying to reduce regulation; the Labor Party and the Greens are trying to increase it.


Comment on the regulatory impact of this bill was made in the dissenting report of coalition senators when this bill last came before the parliament. The last bill was intended to strengthen the existing voluntary data breach notification framework in order to counter underreporting of data breaches and to help prevent or reduce the effects of serious crimes like identity theft. The previous bill, on which this bill is based, was predicated on the general requirements of the Australian Privacy Principle 11, which requires regulated entities to hold personal information to prevent loss, unauthorised disclosure or misuse of that personal information. The 2014 bill, the one we are debating today, operates in much the same way. 


The proposed model would create a requirement to identify the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner, which I will subsequently refer to as OAIC, and affected individuals where there has been a data breach which has given rise to a real risk of serious harm to the affected individual. That was the ALRC's recommended approach. A 'real risk' is defined as a risk that is not a remote risk. This would mean that entities would not be required to report less serious privacy breaches to affected individuals or to the OAIC.


If I can pause there again and refer to the Assange and Snowden issue, where the Greens are trying to get these people to give evidence in some Senate inquiry about electronic security, electronic transmission of data and electronic storage of data. As I say, it is going to be fascinating to see what the Greens think that Mr Assange and Mr Snowden can tell us about maintaining people's privacy when, quite clearly, they are two persons who have no regard for anyone's privacy.


The bill before us has a requirement to notify that would apply to data breaches involving personal information, credit-reporting information, credit eligibility information and tax file number information. So where there were breaches relating to those things there would be a requirement to notify. I wonder whether—again, referring to Assange and Snowden—we should perhaps even put into the legislation where there are data breaches involving the nation's personal information, that is, its security.


But the content requirements of the notification are, at a minimum, a description of the breach, a list of the kinds of personal information concerned, contact information for affected individuals to obtain more information and assistance, and recommendations about the steps that individuals would take in response to the breach. There are several other provisions of this bill, which my colleague Senator Boyce has explained and which, I am sure, others will as well during their contribution.


I believe that this is a bill that the parliament should not be pressured into agreeing to without giving it full and proper consideration. I would suggest that the move by the Labor Party to introduce the bill without appropriate consultation is premature. This was the thought of coalition senators on the committee that inquired into a similar bill last year.


Can I suggest that, if the opposition were serious about privacy issues and this bill in particular, they might have introduced this bill in a proper way, which would have included informing us a bit earlier of their proposals to bring this forward. I understand there was very little notice given by the opposition to anyone or to the government generally that this bill was to be introduced. If they wanted to really address the issue, I suggest that they should have taken the opportunity to consult more widely.


It is clear that the government is not opposed to considering proposals that improve data security practices. Measures that enhance the protection of security of personal information of Australians are critical. However, I do refer the Senate to some comments made by business figures when the matter came before the Senate committee last time. The Communications Alliance argued that specific actions outlined in one of the provisions are contrary to good business practice, as reflected in the OAIC guide. Indeed, they said:


… good business practice would be to (a) contain the breach and do an assessment; (b) evaluate the risks; and then, if necessary, notify those affected by the breach. It is concerning that the Bill places more emphasis on notifying—and potentially confusing or alarming customers—than containing the breach, rectifying the issue and preventing its reoccurrence.


That indicates the sort of concerns that were raised, which I think are still current.


As I say, I am not opposed and I understand that the government is not opposed to considering proposals that improve data security services. But a lot more work has to be done, including consulting broadly on the implications of a mandatory notification scheme. I suggest to the mover of this motion that this has not been done and that we need to consult broadly with both community and industry. Until that is done and until all of the matters that were raised and, I might say, highlighted in the additional comments by coalition senators in the report of the committee that looked at the previous bill have been considered, then I do not think we should be rushed into this.


The government is not prepared to agree to a proposal without giving it full and proper consideration. I emphasise that we on this side of the chamber have always thought of the broader principles of privacy protection for individuals. We have previously expressed concerns about the detail of this bill. Given the importance of the matter, we continue to express those same concerns, including that a thorough and detailed scrutiny be afforded to this bill.

"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2014-03-27,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia) (10:51):  I too rise to speak on the Privacy Amendment (Privacy Alerts) Bill 2014, which contains proposed amendments to the Privacy Act. It is really disappointing that for the second time in a week we are standing here and discussing a bill that we support in principle. The concept of improving the provisions of security around privacy of information is something that I do not think anybody in this place would dispute as being a terribly important thing for us to do to maximise the protection of individuals. It is very frustrating that, instead of being able to stand up here today and say how fabulous this bill is and that we can support it, we cannot. Once again, there has been a lack consultation and a lack of regard by those on the other side for the reasonably simple and sensible changes that we would have expected. 


As you have probably heard in previous contributions, Mr Acting Deputy President, this bill was substantively put before the House of Representatives in 2013. That bill was passed in the House of Representatives but the coalition, which was in opposition at the time, expressed a level of concern about a number of things in it. So the bill was subsequently sent up to this place and referred off to the appropriate committee for investigation. A report came back from the coalition senators—who, at the time, were a minority on the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee looking into bill—with additional comments suggesting that they would like to see some things done to make the bill more appealing in order for them to support it. Now in 2014 we find that the bill has just been plonked down again, without those opposite taking any of the issues that were raised at that time into account. Once again, there has been no consultation and no attempt to address any of those issues raised—and many of them were quite simple. 


I was just reading through the comments made by the coalition senators about the 2013 bill, and I would have thought that those opposite might have thought those comments warranted further investigation. The Cyberspace Law and Policy Centre of the University of New South Wales Faculty of Law highlighted that it had around 10 working hours in which to collaborate on a draft on the bill and finalise its submission. The Australian Privacy Foundation also made the comment: 


... seriously negative impact on the democratic process that is inherent in the provision by the Parliament of 1-1/2 working days, during which civil society organisations are expected to discuss, draft and finalise a Submission to your Committee. 


It seems to me that it would not actually be all that difficult to go out and deal with a number of these organisations, which obviously have a major input and a major interest in this area, to find out what their concerns are in relation to this bill, because they are the ones who actually have to deal with the fall-out when this legislation is passed without consultation and fails. I would have thought that it was a pretty simple thing for us to be able to do that. I condemn those opposite for not having dealt with their concerns, albeit minor as they may well have seemed at the time, in the reintroduction of a very similar bill to that which was before this place in 2013. 


The really sad thing is that this seems to be a bit of trend. Only last week we were before this place speaking on a bill about the Woomera prohibited area. As a fellow South Australian, Mr Acting Deputy President Fawcett, I am sure you would have had concerns about it, because we would like to see the economic potential of this area unlocked for the benefit of our fellow citizens in South Australia. But, once again, we had a bill that was rushed into this place without the appropriate consultation with the wide range of people who are interested in this area, particularly when we had made it quite clear that we were very keen to see legislation passed to assist with the unlocking of this land. I believe it was only this week that the government's bill in relation to the Woomera prohibited area was introduced in the other place. We see these silly, rushed political exercises by those opposite in bringing these sorts of bills into this place when there is a proper process. A sensible consultation process needs to be undertaken and it is very, very frustrating that we are seeing silly politics being played when it would be really nice to see some good outcomes instead. 


This whole concept of policy on the run probably warrants a little more comment because it does have some very, very serious implications. Even with the best intent and the best of ideas, if you do not actually get the details sorted out, you can cause yourself amazing and significant problems. You have often heard the saying, 'the devil is in the detail'—and that is often the case with legislation and regulation. The unintended consequences of ill-conceived or not properly researched and consulted policy can have major impacts. I can assure you, Mr Acting Deputy President, having been a business person before I came into this place, I have seen the consequences of policy that has not been properly thought out and the people who were the recipients of that policy affected by it, because nobody actually bothered to go out and speak to them. They are the people who will be able to tell you, 'If you do this, this is what the consequence will be in reality.' It is not something that you will find in a textbook. It is not something that you will learn at university. It is not something that your union mates will have told you about. You need to speak to the people who are going to be impacted by the changes in legislation. 


I can think of millions of examples of this, but none more than current the debacle which was revealed last night in the NBN interim report. The problem with the NBN was not the concept of providing faster, more reliable and more affordable internet services to the majority of Australians. We all support that as a concept. There is no argument about that in any party, whether it be a minority party, a majority party or the Independents in this place. We would all like to see that as an outcome. But what we do not want to see is policy that is developed on the back of a serviette during a VIP flight from Perth, which ends up costing the Australian public way more than it can possibly afford or which makes promises that were never able to be kept because the capacity to keep them was never there—simply because nobody had thought through the details or the machinery behind the delivery of the particular promise. Last night we saw a terribly pathetic attempt to try to defend a legacy that was totally indefensible—a policy developed on the back of a serviette—whereby we have ended up spending nearly $8 billion and managed to provide less than three per cent of Australians with access to the NBN. We can go on: pink batts and the thought-bubble that was GroceryWatch. 


It stresses the importance of doing two things: making sure you are properly researched and properly prepared; and making sure you speak to the people at the grassroots level who will be affected by the policy, regulation or legislation. There is no question that we came into this place saying that we would be a government that tried to reduce the regulatory burden—and no-one disagrees that there is a need for regulation in some areas—but there has been an extraordinary increase in the number of regulations placed on the Australian community over the last six years and before that by state governments. There is a need to ensure that, whenever you put legislation before this place, you have made a sensible and thorough assessment of the regulatory impact so that you are not simply putting in a regulation for the sake of regulation. There has to be a need, a benefit; and this confirms that.


We have made it clear that we are not going to regulate for anything unless we have to and that we are intending to reduce the level of regulation out there in the marketplace. Only last week the coalition introduced a suite of bills into the lower house that outlined areas where we think there has been unnecessary and burdensome regulation placed on the Australian public and businesses for too long. The concerns that have been raised about this particular bill are not insurmountable, but we draw attention to the constant attempts by those opposite to dump things into this place. You have to start wondering whether it is simply distracting and malicious activity.


The other issue that came out of this bill—and unlike others in this place, I am no lawyer—is that of definition. In the coalition senators' dissenting report in 2013, they noted the concerns expressed by a number of submissions on the lack of definition of the terms 'serious breach' or 'serious harm' in the legislation. I have had a quick look through the legislation and the explanatory memorandum this morning, and the memorandum refers to: 


Serious harm, in this context, includes physical and psychological harm, as well as injury to feelings, humiliation, harm to reputation and financial or economic harm. The risk of harm must be real, that is, not remote, for it to give rise to a serious data breach.


That sounds interesting, but how would you assess that in your institution which holds cold private information for the people you look after. How does someone in one of these institutions make a determination about what constitutes 'psychological harm' or 'injury to feelings'? 


If we went around this chamber and surveyed all 76 senators about whether something had injured their feelings, you would probably get 76 different responses. You only need to look at some of the comments from the South Australian election. A pamphlet was put out in relation to one of our candidates. I know this is not about a breach of privacy or security, but it does emphasise the point of how you determine whether something is criminal in nature or whether it is something to be legislated for. The pamphlet basically dog whistled that one of our candidates because of her surname might have been a Middle Eastern terrorist. That may have hurt her feelings—and it probably did—and it may have been humiliating, but the question has to be: did this cause her serious harm? She might have thought it did. It goes to the point of how do you define these sorts of spurious terminologies—'as well as injury to feelings'? I find that an extraordinary thing to put in the explanatory memorandum.


Most concerning of all in this bill—the Privacy Amendment (Privacy Alerts) Bill 2014, a bill for an act to amend the Privacy Act 1998 and related purposes—are the definitions found in division 3. Clause 26ZF 'real risk' is defined as: 


For the purposes of this Part, real risk means a risk that is not aremote risk.


And 'harm' is defined as:



For the purposes of this Part, harm includes: 


(a) harm to reputation; and  


(b) economic harm; and  


(c) financial harm.


However, there is also 'serious harm', so I am not sure whether we are talking about 'harm' or 'serious harm'. What is the difference between 'harm' or 'serious harm' in that context? It talks about 'serious harm' in one context and defines 'harm' in another context: does that mean we are not talking about the same thing? In the other schedule of amendments, it says 'the access or disclosure will result in real risk of serious harm', but we do not have a definition of 'serious harm'; we only have a definition of 'harm'.


That is one difficulty I picked up this morning. I would suggest the bill has been rushed. It would be nice to think that, in the future, we might be able to have a thorough and rigorous process that would allow us to deal with all those sorts of little, petty issues which, I am sure, the average person out there who was not affected or impacted on by this particular legislation probably would think we were just being pedantic about. But it highlights the fact that sometimes just the use of a word or a phrase, a comment here or there that has not been thought through properly, can actually have quite a significant impact.


In conclusion, I and all of my colleagues on this side of the chamber support the provisions that ensure and maximise the protection of the individual from security breaches. We have absolutely no issue whatsoever with making sure that people are protected—or, at least, advised if there is something that is likely to be a problem to them.


What we do not support is something that has been just put through, I believe, because of some political motivation, as a political trick. It is something that could have been very easily fixed by just coming back to this place and speaking in an adult way, and by going back through the committee process to make sure that the concerns of everybody on the committee were addressed and speaking to the people in the community who are most likely to be impacted on by these changes. If we had just gone through that very simple process, we could be standing here today and enabling an amended version of this bill to go through.


Instead, we are standing here today, once again, saying, 'Guys, you haven't done your homework, and if you don't do your homework you're not going to pass.' We all went to school and we all knew that, the harder you worked and the better the research you did, the better your pass mark would be. And, once again, regrettably, you on the other side have got a fail.

"McKenzie, Sen Bridget",Nats,2014-03-27,"



Senator McKENZIE
 (Victoria—Nationals Whip in the Senate) (11:09):  I, too, rise this morning to make my contribution to the debate on the Privacy Amendment (Privacy Alerts) Bill 2014. This bill deals with the very real issue of data security and citizens' relationship to that. It deals with how we protect the privacy of the individual in the internet age.


Predominantly, we are looking at data mining, for instance, being a quite a profitable business. The University of Newcastle has done a bit of work in this area. The data mined can be collected, traded, analysed et cetera to ascertain a lot of detailed information about the individual: their preferences, what they like to eat, what they like to purchase, what they like to do with their leisure time and even how they think. Putting all that data together can allow the state, businesses, other individuals, security agencies—a whole raft of individuals and organisations—to understand the individual in a new way that is very different from before.


I think it raises some serious questions for us as a government as to how we ensure that the privacy of the individual is maintained within this environment, as more and more individuals use social media and the internet for a wider and wider variety of purposes, disclosing more and more about their private lives. There used to be a very clear distinction between your public life, which government is allowed to have a role in, and, from my perspective, your private life, which government is not allowed to have a role in. That line is becoming increasingly blurred through the increasingly pervasive—though often useful—role which the internet plays in our everyday lives. So this bill before us looks at that. Also, the University of Newcastle says it is not just the information itself—because obviously there are technological ways in which we can protect identity—but also the patterns that are useful to purchasers. The patterns gleaned from databases can lead to identification of an individual. That is how sophisticated we have become. So it is not just the individual markers themselves but the patterns within the databases that can cause issues.


When we look at how businesses use databases, we like to consider what the Bank of America did during Davos. They watched social media and looked at what was trending on Twitter in order to promote the bank's brand among people interested in economic issues by publishing real-time content related to the conference. So the bank itself was using social media and data to reach those individuals with highly sophisticated messages. To quote the senior vice president of the bank:


The data comes into the room from many sources, and you have to use that data like a modern-day orchestra leader, blending the inputs in real time in a combination that is as much an art as a science …


So the sophistication is growing, and we are concerned to ensure that the privacy of the individual is maintained.


I share the concerns aired in Bruce Nolop's blog under the heading, 'Why I hate what big data means for privacy'. He says:


… I fear potential abuses by law enforcement and national-security surveillance programs, and find the threat of cyberattacks, a la the Target experience, to be disconcerting. As citizens and consumers, we should demand safeguards against these risks, but recognize that breaches will be inevitable.


…   …   …


I hate the fact that if I use a search engine to research a topic, my screen space becomes inundated with advertisements for related products or services.


So it is a problem. That problem is growing and it is one that I think all of us involved in this space are concerned about.


But what concerns me about the bill before us today is that this is a huge issue. It is an international issue. Yet, in typical Labor Party fashion, when a bill very similar to this one came before the 43rd Parliament, only two days were given for public comment. It opened on the 18th and closed on the 20th. When we look at the scope of the issue itself, this is an issue that other governments internationally are dealing with and grappling with. We had two days to get our heads around the issue itself and potential solutions and to decide whether a bill very similar to the bill before us was actually going to deal with those issues and was going to result in an outcome that did protect the citizens of Australia in a way that did not impinge or overregulate an environment.


But, you know, that is the Labor way. Putting the bill before us today is, quite simply, an attempt by Labor to keep pushing through their failed legislative agenda even though they are now in opposition—a fact that they are finding very difficult to come to terms with. We had six years to deal with this issue. Even though it passed the House of Representatives on 6 June 2013, prior to the last election, they could not find a way to get it onto the Senate agenda paper so that we could actually deal with it. That was the priority that the government held this piece of legislation in. It is simply evidence again of their denial of the outcome of the last election and refusal to visit the reasons for that—the reasons for the policy vacuum that they are now operating in where we have to just dig up the legislation that did not quite make it the last time.


So here, on a Thursday in the Senate, when we have time to reflect on opposition legislation, they have a chance to put up some bills that they are really keen on and that they want to take forward to address a real concern in the community, and they bring forward legislation that is like the Thursday thought bubble: 'Whoops! We've failed to deliver any significant policy again. Let's just dig out of the bucket beside our drawer.' They rustle around. 'What have we got here? What didn't we get through in six years? Man, the pile is enormous!' The pile of unlegislated issues from the previous government is enormous—so enormous that we, in fact, are having to put forward legislation to ensure that promises made in budgets two years ago are able to be enacted, because you failed to get the bread-and-butter stuff right. You could not even get the bread-and-butter stuff right.


Senator Macdonald mentioned previously that we must ask, if this bill is so important, why it did not get treated as a priority while Labor was in government. It is a pity Senator Macdonald is not quite here, but I am sure he is watching with keen intent, and I just would like to ask: while Labor was prioritising their leadership coups, they managed to prioritise misogynistic rants about blue ties, they managed to prioritise—and I am glad Senator Cameron is here—the failed media laws, they managed to prioritise a whole tranche of legislation that the Australian people were not interested in and that the Australian people did not want to see enacted. The Australian people voted you out because you kept pursuing a legislative agenda that was not in their best interests. You managed to prioritise that, and yet you could not prioritise something which, from all accounts—globally and, indeed, locally—is an issue that we must grapple with: how do we appropriately regulate the issue of big data?


Instead, the Rudd-Gillard government's six years of chaos, waste and mismanagement delivered higher taxes, record boat arrivals and debt and deficit as far as the eye could see. Labor inherited a $20 billion surplus and left behind a projected $30 billion deficit. It turned $50 billion in the bank into a projected net debt of well over $200 billion. It was the fastest deterioration in debt in dollar terms as a share of GDP in modern Australian history.




Senator Cameron:
  There was a global financial crisis.




Senator McKENZIE:
  Labor's debt is already costing $10 billion a year in net interest payments. That is $33 million a day just in interest payments, Senator Cameron.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Bernardi
):  Order! Senator Cameron and senators on my left. The interjection is disorderly.




Senator McKENZIE:
  That is a lot of schools. That is a lot of teachers. Yet here we are. We are moving to scrap more than 10,000 unnecessary and counterproductive pieces of legislation and regulations. More than 50,000 pages of unnecessary and costly legislation that are a dead weight on business, community groups and households will go. The benefit will be significant. Removing these alone will save individuals and organisations more than $700 million a year—every single year.



Senator Cameron interjecting—




Senator McKENZIE:
  That saving, Senator Cameron, can actually be translated into things that I am sure you and the members of the AMWU will be concerned about: actual jobs. When we take the burden off business and when we ensure that the regulatory environment they are operating in gives them more cash in their hand, what they can do is employ the workers of Australia. They can actually get on with doing what they do well, which is producing fabulous product, produce and services, and get on with making our nation's economic base stronger. As I said, we will cut red tape costs by $1 billion a year. We are doing what we said we would do. What a direct contrast to those opposite. We are doing what we said we would do. This week had the first of what will be many days of repealing red tape—and hallelujah to that.


The bill before us today does raise a concern that not all regulation is bad. There are points where a government needs to ensure that appropriate regulation exists, and getting the balance right in this particular space is important to protect the privacy of the individual. Similarly, I was lucky to be on the cybersafety working group, and one of those areas that we looked at was how to get the balance right between ensuring the safety of young people and of young Australian children in the cyber environment. It is something that is responding directly to the concerns of Australian parents and, indeed, young people themselves. That does require very light regulation around how to get the balance right to ensure that we can take down quite quickly offensive material that damages and harms our young people. I have got several local examples in Victoria where the appropriate existing mechanisms were followed. I am thinking about a young girl of 12 where there was material up for a year on the website even though repeated requests had been made for it to be taken down. So there is a real need for appropriate regulation, and this may be an area where that exists. However, the way the Labor Party have proceeded to consult, to get their head around the issue and then formulate a cohesive policy response, again, beggars belief, but I should not be surprised—I feel like a broken record at times. When we talk about the process of consultation that the Labor Party underwent with the bill before us today, as I mentioned earlier, submissions opened on the 18th and closed on the 20th. When you are looking at privacy legislation, that is pretty private. In fact I do not think it gets much more private than that. That is what you do for preselection when you do not want anyone to nominate. That might be a tactic that is used more on the opposition side than on this side.


In relation to data breaches the legislation before us seeks to amend the Privacy Act 1988 to establish a framework for the mandatory notification by government agencies and certain private organisations to notify the Australian Information Commissioner and affected individuals of serious data breaches involving their personal information. Mandatory data breach notification commonly refers to a legal requirement to provide notice to affected persons and to the relevant regulator when certain types of personal information is accessed, obtained, used, disclosed, copied or modified by unauthorised persons. Such unauthorised access may occur following a malicious breach of the secure storage and handling of that information, for instance through a hacker attack, an accidental loss, most commonly of IT equipment or hard copy documents, a negligent or improper disclosure of information or otherwise. A data breach arises when there has been unauthorised access for this sort of information.


As I said earlier, a bill very similar to this was considered by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee and was reported on 24 June 2013.



Senator Cameron interjecting—



Senator Bilyk interjecting—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Bernardi
):  Order! Senator McKenzie, ignore the interjections, they are entirely disorderly. Senators on my left, please, Senator Bilyk, Senator Cameron.




Senator McKENZIE:
  Mr Acting Deputy President Bernardi, I do thank you for your protection. The government will not be pressured into agreeing to a proposal without giving it full and proper consideration. There will be no back-of-the-envelope policy decisions on this side, Senator Cameron. The move by Labor Senator the hon. Lisa Singh to introduce such a bill without appropriate consultation is premature. The opposition could have done this in a proper way, including informing the government earlier of their proposal. If the opposition really wanted to address this issue they should have taken the opportunity to consult widely, because that is what you do: you bring people along with you for your good ideas. You could not bring the Australian people along with you for the mining tax; you could not bring the Australian people along with you for the carbon tax. That was last September—you have got to get over it; it is not working for you. So, start consulting, bring us along with you, and we can start dealing with these sorts of issues in a constructive way to make sure that we get the right policy outcomes, particularly for these types of privacy issues.


The government are not opposed to considering proposals that improve data security practices. Measures that enhance the protection and security of personal information of Australians are critical, particularly in the digital environment, as I have previously outlined. There is more work to be done, including—I know you do not want to hear it; it is against your DNA—consulting broadly on implications of a mandatory notification scheme and consulting broadly with the community and industry. The government are not to prepared to agree to a proposal without giving it full and proper consideration. That is nothing less than what the Australian people ask us to do, to ensure that the policy responses we develop in this place actually address the issue and include them in part of the solution. We have always supported broad principles of privacy protection for individuals.


The lack of consultation with the previous bill was raised by various submitters to the inquiry. I would like to quote one from my home state from Liberty Victoria:


… we note with extreme disappointment that public comment opened on 18 June 2013 and closed two days later on 20 June 2013. This is a not conducive to open and transparent Government and it is extremely unlikely that many members of the public or any other interested party will have had time to review the Bill let alone prepare submissions to this Committee. Privacy is an important issue and with increasing amounts of personal data being collected by both the private and public sectors, the issue as to how that information is used and protected is of high public interest.


It is Thursday Trash Day for the opposition: 'We'll dig around and pull out the privacy bill. We won't actually go out and consult any further and have a look to see if we need any amendment. We won't actually talk to the government. We'll just pull out what we've got because we've got no other policy to bring forward.' The Australian Privacy Foundation similarly said during the prior inquiry:


The APF draws attention to the seriously negative impact on the democratic process that is inherent in the provision by the Parliament of only 1-1/2 working days, during which civil society organisations are expected to discuss, draft and finalise a Submission to your Committee.


Hello, what a failure! In its submission the Cyberspace Law and Policy Centre of the University of New South Wales Faculty of Law highlighted that it had:


… around 10 working hours in which to collaborate on, draft and finalise a submission …


This is an international issue; it is of high public interest. You think you could have given people a little longer than two days to get their high-quality submissions together so that the Senate, through its Legal and Constitutional Committee, last year, could have drafted an appropriate piece of legislation, let alone put any of the thoughts that had come through that inquiry process into the current bill before us—but not from Labor.


Coalition senators believe the concerns raised by those stakeholders should be scrutinised, understood and acted upon by the relevant government agencies as this new privacy regime is rolled out. These concerns still hold for the bill before us today. Privacy is too important not to be considered fully and properly. The coalition remain committed to a considered and consultative approach to policy development and to an open and transparent approach to government. It is what we said we would do, it is what we promised we would do and it is exactly what we are doing.

"Seselja, Sen Zed",LP,2014-03-27,"



Senator SESELJA
 (Australian Capital Territory) (11:29):  I rise to add my voice to the voices of coalition senators in this debate. I commend the words of Senator McKenzie, who outlined the case against this bill very well. She did that, despite being heckled completely unreasonably by those opposite, particularly Senator Cameron. I think that was quite unfair and unreasonable. I think Senator McKenzie was being heckled by the honourable Senator Doug Cameron. 



Senator Cameron interjecting—




Senator Bilyk:
  And Senator Bilyk!




Senator SESELJA:
  I am sorry. I was not aware, Senator Bilyk, that you were 'an honourable'. If you do have that title—




Senator Bilyk:
  No, I was just—




Senator SESELJA:
  So, it is just 'Senator Bilyk'. Thank you.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order! Senator Seselja, direct your comments to the chair.




Senator SESELJA:
  Thank you, Mr Deputy President. You are quite right. I am sure that those opposite will not be taking those honorary titles in future, anyway. They have made it very clear what they think of such titles.




Senator Bilyk:
  Do you want one, Zed?




Senator SESELJA:
  I could not quite hear the interjection, but I should not respond to interjections.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  That is correct, Senator Seselja.




Senator SESELJA:
  It does not matter if I do not hear them. It is hard to respond to them—it is hard to know whether you want to respond—if you cannot hear. Please heckle louder next time so that we can be clear on what it is you are heckling me on!


I would like to lend my support to what has been said. Senator McKenzie put it really well, and I want to pick up where she left off and where much of her contribution was aimed—that is, in relation to the fact that this government does not want to make the same mistakes that the previous government made. Those mistakes were often about very poor policy—about dumb ideas and not getting a mandate—but they were also very often about very, very poor process. That very poor process, when coupled with some very dumb ideas, led to some very poor outcomes. I want to touch on some of those poor processes because we do not want to make the same mistakes. 


There are many things on which we want to differentiate ourselves from the opposition. One of those is that we do not want to follow the poor processes of the previous Labor-Greens government. Senator McKenzie touched on some of those poor processes, and I will expand on some of them. We are hearing right now about one of the poorest processes ever put in place—the pink batts scheme. There were two days for public servants to go away and design a scheme to spend billions of dollars of tax payers' money.


We know about the disastrous results of that very poorly conceived and executed policy. Whether it was a good idea in the first place is one thing; we can all agree that the implementation was a disaster. That is what happens when you do not get it right and when you rush things.


The National Broadband Network was designed on the back of a beer coaster on a VIP flight. That has led to taxpayers forking out billions of dollars for very little delivery. That scheme would have led, had the Labor Party been returned to office, to at least $30 billion extra being spent on the National Broadband Network because of the poor design and because of the poor rollout.


We know that, in the time the Labor Party had in office, they had time to do damage because of that process. The NBN is another example of where we do not want to be. We do not want to end up doing things like the former, Labor-Greens government did. 


The mining tax mark 1 was brought in without proper consultation with industry. It was dumped on industry as a fait accompli. It was not properly consulted on. That led to the chaos that we saw with the removal of a first-term Prime Minister. Then we saw a hastily cobbled together replacement mining tax which ended up getting very little revenue while still doing damage to investment because of the concerns about that type of process and the concerns about that kind of attack on an industry that was so important to Australia.


That is another example of how we do not how to do things. That is the Labor way. The Labor way was to rush things. They would often tell us about how much legislation they had passed—the great success of the previous parliament was just how many pages of legislation they had passed. I put it to senators that the mark of a good government is not how many pages of legislation they pass; it is whether they manage the country effectively. The test is: when they pass legislation does it make things better? Does it make things better for families? Does it make things better for business? Does it make it easier to do business? Does it make us freer as a people? It is not about how many pieces of legislation and regulation you put in place.


So, not content, it seems, with passing ill-conceived and ill-thought-through legislation and policy from government, we now have the Labor Party seeking to impose that model on us from opposition. That is at the heart of our concerns.


I will go to some of the substance of the bill. As has already been stated by government senators, the government has always supported the principles of privacy protection for individuals. In this digital age, protection of personal information is important. We have seen in recent years many serious data breaches which have led to the compromising of personal information. The government understands how serious the issues of financial and identity theft are, but the government will not be pressured into agreeing to a proposal without giving it full and proper consideration. That is where we believe that the introduction of a bill by Senator Singh without appropriate consultation is premature.


If we look back at the criticisms made by coalition senators when a similar bill was introduced last year—criticisms about the lack of due process, time and scrutiny—we believe they still stand. There was a short timeframe for submissions in the original inquiry. The Cyberspace Law and Policy Centre at the University of New South Wales expressed concerned about the lack of time to submit. They said that they had had only around 10 working hours to draft and finalise a submission. The Australian Privacy Foundation also expressed concern about having only 1½ days to draft and finalise their submission. 


There is also a lack of clarity around the terms 'serious breach' or 'serious harm'. The Australian Privacy Foundation did not support the real risk of serious harm threshold. They argue that the threshold should not be set at too high a risk of harm and risk of harm should not be the only trigger for notification. The AFP said:


Aggregation of terms limiting the nature of the harm that triggers notification increases the risk that organizations will argue that one or other aggregated term do not apply to them. For example, a phrase such as ""real risk of serious harm"" is a very high threshold, because of the combination of 'real' (i.e. 'not remote') risk, 'serious' harm (with no clear notion of seriousness) and ‘harm’ which may be given a limited definition …


In addition, a second trigger is necessary. Any significant breach should be subject to notification in any case. If that were not the case, then a significant insecurity would not become apparent, and would not be addressed, and it would be very likely that it would later give rise to a serious breach that was eminently avoidable. A single threshold test would result in a scheme which was a failure.


There is also industry concern about the mandatory notification provisions. The proposed bill requires three specific actions. As soon as practicable, after forming a reasonable belief that a serious data breach has occurred, they must prepare a detailed statement concerning the breach, provide a copy of the statement to the commissioner and take reasonable steps to notify the contents of the statement to each significantly affected individual, and publish a copy of the statement on the entity's website and in at least one newspaper circulating generally in each state and territory if the prescribed general publication conditions are satisfied.


The Communications Alliance argued that these specific actions were contrary to good business practice. They said:


… good business practice would be to (a) contain the breach and do an assessment; (b) evaluate the risks; and then, if necessary, notify those affected by the breach. It is concerning that the Bill places more emphasis on notifying—and potentially confusing or alarming customers—than containing the breach, rectifying the issue and preventing its reoccurrence.


At the heart of the Communications Alliance's argument is that the bill will not do what is claimed it will do. What it could do in practice is cause more harm than good—not focusing on the outcome, which is about containing the breach; rather, potentially confusing customers. Sometimes these bills and Labor Party policies are about being seen to do something rather than actually dealing with the problem at hand. The Communications Alliance makes a good point.


The Australian Bankers Association raised concerns about the final condition of notification and the uncertain scope of the general publication conditions and notification model. Their submission said:


There is a critical element of the notification model in the Bill that is missing because it is unclear what “general publication conditions” will mean if these conditions are satisfied. Without this definition, the real impact of the Bill cannot be assessed because the meaning of this expression will be covered by a regulation-making power in the Bill. Regulations dealing with this aspect have not been provided with the Bill.


It is also important to note the additional regulatory burden this will place on the industry. Without proper consultation it is difficult to assess just how significant this burden is.


The concerns of key stakeholders should not be set aside, and further time to scrutinise the bill and consult with stakeholders is crucial before the bill is passed. The government is not opposed to considering proposals that improve data security practices. Measures that enhance the protection and security of the personal information of Australians are critical, particularly in this digital environment.


In conclusion, the coalition certainly agrees that we need to find ways to ensure data security, but we do not believe that the Labor-Greens way of doing things—which is to rush legislation through, which is to not properly consult with affected stakeholders and which is to not properly take account of serious industry concerns—is the right way to go. That path leads to poor policy, poor legislation and, ultimately, very poor outcomes for consumers in Australia. Those are the concerns that the coalition and I share.

"Back, Sen Chris",LP,2014-03-27,"



Senator BACK
 (Western Australia—Second Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (11:42):  I am delighted to rise to speak to the Privacy Amendment (Privacy Alerts) Bill 2014 as proposed by Senator Singh and to endorse the comments of my colleague Senator Seselja. It is a shame that Senator Singh is not here in the chamber to see the carriage of the discussion. Whether or not that is an indication of her interest in it I do not know, but, nevertheless, it can be taken along those lines. What was interesting to me—




Senator Moore:
  Mr Deputy President, I rise on a point of order: reflection on another member. I do not believe that was appropriate and it is becoming way too common.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Back, if you did reflect on another member, it would be simple if you just withdrew that.




Senator BACK:
  I certainly would withdraw any suggestion that I was reflecting on another senator in my comment. Senator Moore, I withdraw, through you, Mr Deputy President. It was not my intention; it was simply to point out the importance of this particular bill and to make some comments on the coalition's points. Part of my reason for making that point was to allow Senator Singh an opportunity in having me respond to a comment that she made in introducing the bill. It was the comment she made to my colleagues about the adequacy of time that has been allowed for public consultation. Quite clearly, we see this as further evidence of the failure of the now Labor opposition in this very area. We are again going to see discussion in this place this afternoon about activity that has resulted from inadequate public consultation and opportunity for the wider community to have its say in these areas.


Senator Singh made the point that there had been adequate time for public consultation. I go to last year's submission of the Cyberspace Law and Policy Centre of the Faculty of Law at the University of New South Wales. This very august body highlighted that, despite the apparent adequacy of the time that had been given for consideration by members of the public, it had had just 10 working hours—not 10 days, not 10 weeks, but 10 hours—in which to collaborate, to draft and to finalise its submission. I would see that as a deep insult to any body whose views were genuinely being sought and who might be able to make a useful contribution.


The Australian Privacy Foundation is another body that one might think would make a useful contribution and that the wider community would have a view on and be particularly keen on hearing from. I know that there would be many people wanting to know what the Australian Privacy Foundation's interests are. They said a 'seriously negative impact on the democratic process' was inherent in the provision by the parliament of just 1½ working days—very close to that 10 hours of the Cyberspace Law and Policy Centre—for civil society organisations to discuss, draft and finalise a submission to the committee. I would say to anyone who thinks that 10 hours, or 1½ days, is adequate time for a reputable body to consider, discuss, draft and finalise a submission to the committee, that it as a deep insult. Indeed, regrettably, we on this side continue to regard it as a deep insult.


As we know, the proposed model would create a requirement to notify the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner and affected individuals where there has been a data breach that gives rise to a real risk of serious harm. I would go to your background, Mr Deputy President, in the law enforcement area in Australia. How would you regard the words 'real risk of serious harm'? What is real to you might not be real to me. What is serious to Senator Scullion might not be serious to me. If a crocodile were chasing me, I would be very worried. Senator Scullion, on the other hand, would possibly see it as an opportunity that he would relish. I do not use this term flippantly. I would make the point that it would mean entities would not be required to report less serious privacy breaches to affected individuals or to the commissioner.


Senator Seselja spoke eloquently when he referred to the Australian Federal Police in this same area. He made the point that an unintended consequence might be that it makes the issue more serious, rather than less serious, simply because of the point of definition: what constitutes a serious breach of privacy? The requirement to notify would apply to data breaches involving personal information, credit-reporting information, credit eligibility information and tax file information. All of us in the community would share that concern. We do not want to see our private information—tax file, credit eligibility, banking details and personal information—being made public. All of us in this chamber would support that. The wider community would definitely support that proposition.


The important point to make is that the coalition will not allow the Senate to descend into the failure of the Labor opposition, and that is to rush through the decision-making and consultation process. We will not be pressured into agreeing to a proposal without giving it full and proper consideration. I have considered the points that Senator Seselja has made and the comments by Senator Boyce and my colleague Senator McKenzie in the same context. Senator Singh has introduced this bill without proper consultation, and I say that that is premature. The opposition could have done this in a more timely fashion. They could have informed the government of their proposal earlier. There is no good reason why they did not. I heard Senator Singh adversely commenting on the Attorney-General and his apparent lack of speed in introducing legislation in this area. She could have approached him some time earlier. If the opposition had wanted to address this issue seriously and in a timely fashion, they could have taken the opportunity to consult more widely and more quickly.


We are not opposed to considering the proposals to improve data security practices. They are of universal concern. We see around the world now the ease and speed with which cyberhackers and others can interfere with private data and information. And there are no geographic or national borders when it comes to this situation. But we know that there is more work to be done. We know that we must collaborate with officials in other countries—in Europe, the United States, Canada, New Zealand, the Eastern bloc and Asian countries. But the government is not prepared to agree to a proposal without giving it full and proper consideration. I thank you for the opportunity to comment.


Debate adjourned.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Privacy Amendment (Privacy Alerts) Bill 2014</title>,BILLS,0,1,speech
"Singh, Sen Lisa",ALP,2014-03-27,"



Senator SINGH
 (Tasmania) (09:31):  I rise to speak to the Privacy Amendment (Privacy Alerts) Bill 2014. Labor believes Australians should be told when there has been a breach of their privacy. It is time that companies who are required to protect Australians' personal data should also have the complementary duty to tell a consumer when their personal data has been the subject of unauthorised public release. Businesses that already implement good privacy practices and comply with current voluntary guides from the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner, the OAIC, will have little difficulty in transitioning to the new scheme.


A consumer should have the right to know if their personal information has become compromised or if their bank or telecommunications provider has lax security standards. Consumers need to have the power to change their passwords, improve their security settings online, cancel credit cards or completely change providers such as banks and telecommunications companies.


In an increasingly digital world, more and more data and personal information is being collected from Australian families. This bill puts in place a compulsory notification regime in order to strengthen the protections around this information and build on the privacy regime Labor implemented when it was in government. The bill will require all entities currently regulated by the act to notify affected individuals and the OAIC when there has been a data breach that gives rise to a real risk of serious harm to an affected individual. A real risk is defined as a risk that is not a remote risk. Therefore, only the more serious data breaches will need to be notified—a responsible approach to implementing this important privacy regulation.


The OAIC will have the power to compel notification to affected individuals were it becomes aware of a serious data breach that has not been notified. The OAIC will also be given the power to exempt an entity from the notification requirement where it is in the public interest to do so. The bill ensures that the victims of a data breach will receive comprehensive and useful information about the circumstances of the relevant breach. Firstly, it must contain a description of the breach. Secondly, it must contain a list of the types of personal information that were accessed or disclosed. Thirdly, the notification must contain recommendations about the steps that individuals should take in response to the breach. Finally, contact information for affected individuals to obtain more information and assistance must also be included.


Noncompliance with the scheme would attract the normal Privacy Act remedies. These include public or personal apologies, compensation payments or enforceable undertakings. Under the new privacy regime enacted by the Gillard Labor government, a civil penalty can be sought where there has been serious or repeated noncompliance with mandatory notification requirements.


This bill is in substantially similar terms to the Privacy Amendment (Privacy Alerts) Bill 2013 previously introduced into the parliament in 2013 by the Gillard Labor government. It was to be the next step in the important reforms of Australia's privacy legislation being delivered by the Labor government, but the bill lapsed when parliament was prorogued ahead of the 2013 federal election.


The privacy reforms passed in the last parliament were significant Labor reforms to an area of law about which Australians are deeply concerned, and rightly so. That legislation, which has recently begun operation, delivered a number of important changes. The Privacy Act now contains a set of 13 Australian Privacy Principles which apply to Australian and Norfolk Island governments and some private sector organisations. The APPs harmonised and replaced the two sets of principles which previously applied to government and the private sector. The Office of the Australian Information Commissioner has been given new powers to assess and enforce privacy compliance and to seek civil penalties where serious breaches occur.


There are new provisions in the Privacy Act governing credit reporting. The law now provides for both more comprehensive credit reporting and an improved process for correcting reporting errors and dealing with complaints. Civil penalties now apply for certain breaches of the credit reporting provisions. The Privacy Act now provides for the recognition of external dispute resolution schemes for handling privacy complaints and for the registration of binding privacy codes.


These are all important reforms. They are important Labor reforms. It took a Labor government to enact the Privacy Act 1988 and it took a Labor government to deliver the most significant reforms to that act in the decade and a half since. Labor understands that privacy is a human right. Labor understands that technological change has made privacy a pressing everyday concern for many, many Australians. These reforms are well within the long and proud Labor tradition of consumer protection. They are an example of Labor's commitment to responsible regulation which protects rights which make a real and positive difference in the way Australians work and live.


The bill I speak to today is the next step in that package of reforms. The bill will introduce a new consumer privacy protection for Australians that will keep their personal information more secure in the digital age. It will also encourage agencies and private sector organisations to improve their data security practices. The risk of data breaches and the seriousness of their consequences have grown as new technology has allowed government and the private sector to collect more and more personal information about Australians. A data breach can severely affect an individual whose personal information has been compromised. People can lose money. The identity can be stolen. They can be embarrassed and distressed by the release of sensitive personal information.


Labor believes that individuals should know when their privacy has been interfered with. Currently, the law imposes no obligation on organisations who suffer a data breach to notify those whose privacy has been compromised. Labor thinks that is manifestly inadequate. It is out of step with what our community expects. It is out of step with the way that technology has changed the way we live our lives. Labor is committed to act to remedy this gap in our privacy laws. We were committed to doing this in government and we remain committed to doing it in opposition. 


Data breaches are of significant concern to modern Australia. There have been a number of high-profile breaches in Australia in recent times. One that comes to mind recently was the Department of Immigration in February this year, which published personal details of around 10,000 asylum seekers held in Australia. Similarly, between February 2012 and May 2013, the information of 15,775 of a telco's customers from 2009 and earlier were accessible on the internet. This included the information of 1,257 active silent customers. Previously, the personal information of approximately 734,000 customers had been made publicly available online in December 2011. Other large companies have had data breach issues as well, and the OAIC is aware of 56 data breaches in 2011-12.


But data breaches are a concern not only for individuals. The security of personal data is of commercial importance to Australian companies. Data breaches are bad for business and can be incredibly costly due to the errors that come about from them. Companies stand to lose not just time and money rectifying a data breach but also their reputation, and in a modern information economy the important trust of consumers in a company's privacy compliance is an incredibly important part of a company's goodwill. In 2012, the ABC reported that the average data breach incident in Australia cost the organisation in question some $2 million. What is more, that average cost has been steadily rising year on year.


Labor understands the importance of this issue not only to individuals but also to business and to the competitiveness of Australian companies and we have introduced this bill from opposition to ensure that appropriate action is now taken. This bill, rightly, has strong support from Australia's various information and privacy commissioners, from relevant industries, from IT security experts and from privacy and consumer advocates. But most importantly, the Australian public demand the protection this bill will provide. In a survey conducted last year, the OAIC reported that some 96 per cent of Australians believed that they should be notified of data breaches if they are affected by them. 


In government, Labor consulted extensively with relevant stakeholders. We focused on making these reforms as flexible as possible. We focused on minimising the compliance burden on companies and agencies while making sure that the privacy rights of individuals are steadfastly protected. We took both industry and consumer concerns on board, and the widespread support for the bill very much reflects this. So given that the hard work of this bill has been done by Labor and given that consumers and industry support its passage, we might wonder why the new Attorney-General has sat on his hands. This month the suite of privacy reforms that were passed by the Gillard Labor government entered into force and this bill comprises an important addition to that package of reforms. 


So why hasn't the government acted? Industry and the community are ready for this reform and, indeed, it will be easier for compliance if this bill could enter into operation more or less alongside the other major changes to the Privacy Act which have just now come into force. Delaying the passage of this bill would leave Australia behind developments in comparable jurisdictions, notably jurisdictions like the US and the EU. Australian consumers deserve protection every bit as good as that which the citizens of other nations enjoy, and Australian businesses must stay ahead of the curve to be competitive.


The Liberals did support this bill, though, when last in parliament and, when the bills lapsed at the conclusion of the 43rd Parliament, there were reports in the press that an incoming Liberal government would continue this important work and work towards the enactment of a privacy alert law when in government. Well, they have now had six months in power, and yet we have heard nothing from this government. Nor is it the case that the Abbott government or the Attorney-General, Senator Brandis, have more important things to do. Senator Brandis's only legislative work in the time he has been in office has been the bills he contributed to the Abbott government's repeal day media event. In many cases the main function of these bills was the correction of typographical errors and grammatical mistakes: a worthy enterprise, but not one that carries much legislative weight. As my colleagues in another place pointed out yesterday, the Attorney-General is yet to introduce any legislation of substance.


I hope that the Attorney-General's unedifying recent appearance on Alan Jones's show on 2GB radio does not indicate that he is now preparing to walk away from privacy law reform. On 14 March, in a display of disingenuousness, Senator Brandis appeared to disown the privacy laws that he and his party had voted for in the last parliament. Mr Jones put a number of confused complaints to the Attorney-General about the operation of the new credit reporting provisions of the privacy legislation, and this is what our bold Attorney-General said in the course of his response:


… these were measures that were introduced by the Gillard Government.


He said that the new privacy laws were:


… something we inherited from Gillard.


What a shameless act of buck-passing, when they supported the privacy reforms in the last parliament. The Liberal Party supported these privacy reforms in the last parliament. So though it was Labor that spearheaded these reforms, and Labor that did the hard yards, the Liberal Party did do the right thing in supporting our privacy reforms in the last parliament. They were right to do that at that time and so that is why it is now disappointing that they should not have the integrity to continue to hold to that responsible policy position—some six months have passed and they have had so many opportunities in the time we have been sitting in parliament for them to have done so.


When Australians want to know their Attorney-General's position on issues that matter to them, should they trust the way he votes in this parliament, or should they trust his throwaway lines on talkback radio? The only thing the public can count on is the opportunism of the Attorney-General. Why doesn't he have the courage of his convictions to stick by the Labor reforms that he so rightly supported? And why doesn't he explain the operation of legislation that he did vote for, rather than slinking away from it at the slightest hint of public debate—like the example I just gave of him on talkback radio? Does the Attorney-General support privacy law reform again, now that he is back in the cloisters of the parliament? What is his position on this issue which is of such importance to Australians in their everyday lives, and will continue to be important to them as we continue into this age of the digital economy?


Given the paucity of his own legislative record as Attorney-General, I would have thought Senator Brandis would be desperate to claim some credit for any good policy that had passed through this place. Now the Attorney-General has another chance to support good privacy policy with the introduction of this privacy alerts bill. This privacy alerts bill is a constructive policy proposal. It is ready to go. The people want it. Industry wants it. But where is our Attorney-General and where is the Abbott government on privacy law reforms? Why has it fallen to the opposition to provide this parliament with some real policy substance? The Liberal Party has been in government for some time now. There have been a number of opportunities for the new Abbott government to introduce privacy law reforms, to continue on with the good work started by the Labor government in this area of privacy reform. It is something that Australian consumers want. It is something that industry wants. In fact, it is something that ensures that industry has better data hygiene, if you like, around the way that its data complies with privacy laws.


This government and this Attorney-General might be a policy-free zone, but the Labor opposition is here to help. I sincerely hope that, as they rightly did when they were in opposition, the Liberals will support this prudent bill—this bill that is needed; this bill that will put us in step with other jurisdictions such as the EU and the US; this bill that will ensure we have certainty for consumers and for industry as we move further into this digital age. I hope the government will help us continue the good work in this area of the previous Labor government and I hope they will support this bill. I commend the bill to the Senate.

"Boyce, Sen Sue",LP,2014-03-27,"



Senator BOYCE
 (Queensland) (09:51):  Well, here we are at Groundhog Day again! I am surprised that the opposition would want to remind the Australian people of the bureaucratic and administrative mishmash and nightmare that purported to be government by the Labor Party.


The government strongly supports all efforts to improve privacy provisions for the Australian people and Australian organisations but—surprise, surprise!—we do not support doing it in the erratic, inexperienced, unthinking way that Labor would try to go about this. This piece of legislation was first brought to the House in June last year by the then government and came to the Senate with a whole 1½ days for a committee to hold an inquiry into the effects that it would have. It, of course, was something that they apparently had forgotten to include in their first tranche of legislation on privacy—and why would we be surprised by that? In the annals of history, the FoFA—Future of Financial Advice—legislation will stand in years to come for administrators to use as an example of how never to try and go about public policy: three tranches of legislation, some of it actually contradictory; some of it requiring that an IT system that had been put in place to meet the requirements of a first bill would subsequently have to be changed—within six months, was what the government first wanted—by those working in the industry. So we had once again the usual complete inability, apparently, of the Labor Party to grasp that some people out there are trying to make profits to create jobs and to create growth in our economy. This bill that we are now debating came into that category entirely.


I am somewhat bemused by Senator Singh's suggestion that Labor has consulted extensively with stakeholders in government. I will just quote from a couple of witnesses—well, not witnesses, because we did not have time to hold a full inquiry; it was done on the paper—for the inquiry held last year by the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee. The Cyberspace Law and Policy Centre of the University of New South Wales pointed out that it had 'around 10 working hours in which to collaborate on, draft and finalise a submission'. I am not sure that that constitutes extensive consultation. The Australian Privacy Foundation, who are dedicated to ensuring that the Privacy Principles apply to Australians, said that the great rush of the Labor government to get this piece of legislation through on reporting of breaches had a:


… seriously negative impact on the democratic process that is inherent in the provision by the Parliament of 1-1/2 working days, during which civil society organisations are expected to discuss, draft and finalise a Submission to your Committee.


Those comments go back to June last year, when this was an urgent, urgent piece of legislation to fix up, presumably, something that the then government had left out of the Privacy Act. 


On 21 March, Minter Ellison pointed out to its clients that the bill was introduced with 'little fanfare' by Labor Senator Lisa Singh and that it brought up the same amendments that had been proposed by the then government back in June, when it was such an urgent, urgent issue. Minter Ellison said:


The timing is likely to be concerning for those entities still coming to grips with implementing the changes required by the amendments to the Privacy Act which commenced on 12 March this year.


The then opposition, the now government, did indeed support the Privacy Act put forward and the principles that changed it, but we also warned that there was no need to introduce these particular reporting requirements in a whole new piece of legislation at the same time that we were asking Commonwealth organisations and other reporting entities to get their heads and their systems around implementing the changes that were required under the Privacy Act and were to be implemented on 12 March. We have, yet again, the situation where a Labor government apparently thought it was okay to ask organisations to change their systems every 20 minutes on the whim of a government that did not have a clue what it was doing in terms of the costs it was imposing and the problems it was creating.


We only have to go back as far as the original changes to the Privacy Act that has now come into play: if it had gone ahead as the then Labor government wanted, most banks in Australia would have had to change the way they went about data processing. We were told during a committee hearing on the Privacy Act itself that a lot of data processing for Australian banks occurs offshore, including in New Zealand, yet if the legislation, as Labor drafted it, had stood this would have become at least fraught and possibly illegal. So there is a lot of good to be gained out of an inquiry process of the Senate. 


I am not quite sure who Senator Singh has consulted so widely with, but certainly none of the stakeholders that I am aware of feel as though they have been consulted. To whip this legislation in now and then come up with some righteous platitudes, trying to suggest that only Labor cares about privacy, is the typical sort of stunt that one expects from a Labor opposition. It is not only Labor who cares about privacy. The basic legislation of the Privacy Act has been in operation now for a good two weeks. For heaven's sake, can we not let that settle down before we look at other changes that may very well need to be made and may in fact be useful changes?


Who knows is the problem. Who knows? This stunt appears to be designed to try to maximise some publicity out of the recent breach by the Department of Immigration and Border Protection, which, of course, this government abhors and has certainly dealt with in terms of repairing the damage that has been done as far as possible.


The model that Senator Singh would have us pass suggests that every government organisation, every reporting entity, should pass on to the Australian Information Commissioner data breaches which have given rise to a 'real risk of serious harm' to an affected individual. No-one, of course, has any issue whatsoever with that statement. The government would support the development of principles that would ensure that we were aware when serious breaches that caused real harm had occurred. The problem, of course, comes down to what exactly are we talking about when we talk about the 'real risk of serious harm'. Senator Singh says we define 'real risk' as 'not a remote risk'. Great! But what is 'serious harm'? What is a 'serious breach'? There is very little definition in it—and, of course, that will vary from individual to individual. The way to flesh out where the limits of this legislation should be, the costs that might be imposed by putting this legislation through, is to consult extensively, which certainly has not happened, with stakeholders.


The implications of this legislation, when we do not have a significant view of what constitutes 'real risk' or 'real harm', could be huge. We simply do not know where it would stop and start. Of course the people who are being asked to enforce it would not know where it should stop and where it should start. It is quite possible that if your PIN, for example, was inadvertently revealed, in some situations this could cause serious harm. It could be a serious breach. With a bank with very good security systems that could alert the individual immediately that somehow this had happened, then it may not cause serious harm or be a serious breach, because it has not caused damage to the individual. 


Once again, we do not really know what the Labor Party is on about. Without having a full inquiry into how this would work, where the parameters should be, it cannot happen. But, of course, Senator Singh is not really interested in getting this legislation passed; she is interested in the smoke and mirrors of pretending to care more than the government about a principle which, of course, is one that this government more than any other has embedded into the culture of Australia. Privacy is something that has been of great concern and great interest to this government and this party. It is ridiculous of the Labor Party to suggest that they could, through their bureaucratic approach, improve the system that is in place.


The restrictive time frame on this legislation when it was first put up by the then government and the lack of analysis in most of the submissions—simply because the submitters did not have time to do it properly—was most unfortunate. There was no thorough or detailed scrutiny of this bill and there still hasn't been. All we have is the pious platitudes from Senator Singh suggesting that this is the right way to go. We have no idea how companies would be asked to interpret the legislation and what it means; we have no idea what the costs of adding this reporting process to the system would be; and we have no idea how this would interact with the current new Privacy Act that has come into force on the 12 March and which companies are happily, currently, put into place. Let us bed that down before we get on with the very real job that we would agree is vital to do, to ensure that breaches of privacy are reported to the Australian Information Commissioner and to the individuals concerned. 


There is certainly an underreporting of privacy breaches in Australia. No-one is arguing about that. That needs to be fixed. But you would have thought that a piece of legislation that introduced 13 privacy principles and was supported by the now government would have come a long way towards fixing that. If it did not fix that, what was wrong with the then government, the Labor government, in the first place? Why on earth couldn't that have been a significant part of their original legislation? Let us see how the legislation that has now come into fruition—and has been operational now for just on two weeks—works before we go into the world of compulsory reporting, particularly compulsory reporting based on 'serious harm', 'real risk' and 'serious breach'. As I have pointed out, what constitutes a 'serious breach'? Certainly in the examples that Senator Singh gave no-one would have any problems saying, 'Yes, they are serious breaches of privacy principles—serious breaches,' and they have both come to public attention and they have both been dealt with. But there are many, many times when a company would need to consider whether a breach had the 'real risk', as opposed to a 'remote risk', of causing serious harm and was in fact a serious breach. These would be matters for judgement in many cases. This legislation gives companies no guidance whatsoever on what is a real risk or a serious breach or what would cause serious harm to an individual. There are, at the borders of this, many times that organisations would have to consider whether what was being proposed was in fact a problem or not a problem.


So, if Senator Singh had been serious about this legislation and wanting it to pass, she would not have snuck it into the Senate with, as Minter Ellison points out, little fanfare; she would have brought it to the attention of the Attorney-General, had it discussed and sought an inquiry from the relevant committee on this legislation so that all the stakeholders could tell us what their concerns were and how we might address any problems that were seen to be in the legislation, and she would have had the courtesy to give the many organisations that have just put new privacy principles in place a heads-up and a long time frame in which to decide how these changes might best sit with the changes that they have already had to make in the last few months to meet the new Privacy Act requirements. But none of this happened, of course, because Labor are not at all interested in getting this legislation through. They do not really care about breaches of privacy for individuals. They just care about trying to make a bit of a song and dance and carry on as though the government is in fact not looking at the issue.


It is quite bizarre that Senator Singh has chosen to approach it in this way. This legislation was allegedly urgent in June last year, according to the then government. If it was so urgent, they had plenty of opportunity to enact it. They pushed the Senate committee to make its inquiry in less than a few days. We did not have time to call witnesses; it was done on the papers. I have already used a couple of examples from the many submitters who made the point that, within that time frame, they could not put in a decent submission setting out in detail their concerns about this piece of legislation. Without any further consultation or any further work whatsoever, Senator Singh thinks that the Senate should simply roll over and put in place her piece of legislation when, as we said, no-one knows how it will pan out in practice. Without consulting the people who would have the difficulties—the onerous task—of ensuring that it goes into practice, it is ridiculous of Senator Singh to be suggesting that this legislation should go through.


I would make the point that, in the comments made by coalition senators on that extraordinarily rushed inquiry last year, we said:


Coalition senators note the concerns expressed by a number of submitters regarding the lack of definition of the terms 'serious breach' or 'serious harm' in the legislation.


Not only were the submitters concerned about the fact that there was no true definition there and in many cases it would be a matter of employing people to sit and decide what that meant; the industry also expressed great concern at the regulatory overload that the then government was putting on them or attempting to put on them. None of us would be surprised, of course, at the fact that industry—which, as I said, is driving our economy—would be complaining about regulatory overload from the then Labor government, the Rudd-Gillard government, because 'regulatory overload' was their middle name. Let us look at this legislation properly and not play political games.

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2014-03-27,"



Senator LUDWIG
 (Queensland) (10:11):  Normally it would be uncharacteristic of me to comment on a previous senator's contribution, other than to indicate that perhaps it was a little muddled and a little circuitous in its argument. But, nonetheless, it gives me an opportunity to correct some of the misconceived ideas in the contributions that have been made by those opposite on this important bill, the Privacy Amendment (Privacy Alerts) Bill 2014.


Labor is a proud champion of the rights of Australians, including the right to privacy—unlike, it appears, those opposite, but that surprised me nonetheless. Unlike the Liberal and National Party government, who have shown a blatant disregard for the rights of Australians, whether against racial discrimination or against breaches of privacy, in this instance Labor is taking action. It is deplorable that it takes an opposition to do what is, in effect, basic work of a government.


This bill provides another simple, basic plank in the protection of the right of Australian citizens to have their data held safely and, when breaches occur, to be notified. It is a very simple concept. The Australian government is the custodian of some of the most sensitive data and information of individuals. It is imperative that government departments and agencies act above and beyond best practice in the handling, management and storage of and access to the data of individuals.


It was the Liberal and National government who dispassionately oversaw the release of thousands of personal details of people in the government's care. It took a news outlet, The Guardian, to alert the department and cause it to act responsibly. That is in the face of what already exists on the record, which is the April 2012 document Data breach notification—a guide to handling personal information security breaches, a guideline produced by an Australian government agency, the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner. One would have thought the government would at least have managed to follow those guidelines, but no. If that is the standard that this government has for the privacy of people in its direct care and responsibility then it is apparent what its disregard for privacy as a whole would be.


Only Labor cares about the rights of individuals to have their privacy protected. It is, frankly, damning in the extreme that the government has not picked up the work of the former government and continued this important reform. It speaks volumes of the priorities and the choices being made by the Abbott government. Whether it is letting jobs and industries fall off the cliff, or tearing away the basic protections against racial discrimination, or instituting knights and dames—which I think is becoming comical—it is now clear that this government stands for little and is doing little. The Abbott government is not standing up for Australians and is not working in the best interests of their privacy or their rights.


I notice that the Attorney-General is in the chamber, so let us consider his track record. Let us look at what he has done during the six months he has been in office. Has he introduced measures to protect privacy? No. Has he looked at a reform agenda? If you put the Racial Discrimination Act in that bin, I think the answer is no. The only piece of legislation the Attorney-General has introduced into the parliament is to correct typos in a bill dating back to 1901! How apt it is that this anachronistic Attorney-General's first priority in this chamber has been correcting commas and removing hyphens from words such as 'email' rather than protecting the important rights of Australian citizens. This is an Attorney-General who has become absolutely catatonic when it comes to being the first law officer of the land. He has ground his department to a screaming halt—no reforms, no protections, no actions. After his 'commas and hyphens bill' his first priority—and I quote his own cabinet colleagues—has been 'to drink the right wing Kool-Aid'. That comment does not come from this side; it comes from his own side. His own cabinet and backbench have had to pull him away from the ideological cliff. Be that as it may, I think the truth is that the Attorney-General has his eyes on the bigger prize—and Senator Abetz, the leader in this place, does seem to be looking over his shoulder. I think—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Fawcett
):  Senator Ludwig, I draw your attention to standing order 193 and the imputation of improper motives against any other member.




Senator LUDWIG:
  If the Attorney-General were serious, he would be in the business of actual law reform. The privacy legislation was ready to go, but it has been sitting on the Attorney-General's windowsill, yellowing with age. Mr Acting Deputy President, you can picture the Attorney-General sitting in his office—or, as he called it yesterday, his 'chambers'—probably wearing his robe and wig, calling public servants to 'come hither'. And up they would run, with their briefs in their arms. But there would be not one brief about reform, not one that the first law officer of the land could sign off on that deals with privacy or protections for individuals. Instead, there would be one about commas and hyphens. Frankly, I think we need an Attorney-General who is a little bit more in touch. The bill will implement—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Ludwig, I draw your attention to standing order 193 about personal reflections on members.




Senator LUDWIG:
  The introduction of a mandatory data breach notification requirement will be a major consumer privacy protection reform. It will enable individuals affected by a data breach to take action to prevent identity theft and fraud by taking actions such as cancelling credit cards or changing passwords. It will encourage government agencies and private sector organisations to lift their security standards and be more transparent about how they handle personal information.


The proposals in the bill had been developed over a long period of time in consultation with a diverse range of industry groups and privacy and consumer advocates—unlike what the previous speaker spoke of. The bill will require all entities currently regulated by the act to notify affected individuals and the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner where there has been a data breach that gives rise to 'a real risk of serious harm' to an affected individual. A 'real risk' is defined as 'a risk that is not a remote risk'. That is one matter that was raised a number of times by Senator Boyce in her contribution. But if the good senator had done her homework she would have gone back to the ALRC's original report dealing with data breach notifications. In that report, the ALRC provided guidance about this particular matter—real risk of serious harm. I draw the Senate's attention to provision 51.85 of the ALRC's 2008 review No.108. It says:


In international law, the term 'a real risk of serious harm' has been refined to mean 'a reasonable degree of likelihood', 'real and substantial danger' and 'a real and substantial risk'.


And the ALRC cites a case on that point, at footnote 133, which is 'R v Secretary of State for the Home Department'.


In its draft voluntary information security breach notification guide the OPC sets out a number of questions to evaluate the risk associated with the breach: 'What personal information is involved and how sensitive is it? Could the information be used for fraudulent purposes? What is the cause and extent of the breach—for example, is there a risk of ongoing breaches? Is the information easily accessible? Was the breach deliberate, or inadvertent? Who is affected, how many people are affected, and are they particularly at risk of harm? What harm could result—for example, who is the recipient of the information; could the breach lead to fraud, financial loss or humiliation; and what impact would the breach have on the organisation or agency concerned?'


This is a matter that has been well thought through. The OAIC will have the power to compel notification to affected individuals where it becomes aware, as a result of complaints by individuals or otherwise, of serious data breaches that have not been notified. The OAIC will also be given the power to exempt an entity from the notification requirements where it is in the public interest to do so.


This is a scheme that has not only had extensive consultation; it has effectively already been embodied in a guide for the Public Service since April 2012. It is certainly not new to the Public Service or, more broadly, to those who work in the privacy area, including those companies which already take steps to protect people's privacy—for the obvious reason that it is good business practice.


Notification is ultimately about empowering the consumers, the individuals, where there have been breaches. The notification itself must contain at least four key pieces of information. It should contain a description of the breach, a list of the types of personal information that were accessed or disclosed, recommendations about the steps that individuals should take in response to the breach and, finally, contact information to allow affected individuals to obtain more information or assistance. It is quite a simple scheme that allows individuals to take appropriate action where their privacy may have been compromised. 


Noncompliance with the scheme would attract normal Privacy Act remedies. These could include public or personal apologies, compensation payments or enforceable undertakings. A civil penalty could be sought where there has been serious or repeated noncompliance with the mandatory notification scheme. 


This proposal has strong support from state and federal information privacy commissioners, from IT security companies and from privacy and consumer advocates. Some industry groups have asked for the proposals to be delayed, citing a large privacy law workload. Most, however, believe that it would easier for compliance purposes if the proposals were to commence with the other major privacy reforms in March 2014—which I agree with. Implementing this bill alongside those reforms would add to, not detract from, business certainty. It would help with compliance obligations for businesses as well as, more importantly, providing appropriate protections for individuals. 


Delaying the proposals until the impact of the 2014 privacy reforms have been assessed would effectively postpone this action until around 2015 or 2016. This would attract, I think, significant negative criticism from consumer and privacy advocates and leave Australian developments well behind those of the US and EU in this important area. Some of the concerns raised by industry groups have been addressed in this bill, particularly those relating to the cost impacts. As a result, the bill now contains concessions to industry concerns, including more flexible notification and more clarity around the process for seeking exemption from notification requirements.


It is instructive on these issues to go back to the original ALRC report of May 2008, For your information—Australian privacy laws and practice. It said:


The Privacy Act should provide for notification by agencies and organisations to individuals affected by a data breach.


It is not simply about data breaches as an esoteric concept in the broad. As the ALRC report goes on to say:


… the primary rationale for data breach notification laws is that notifying people that their personal information has been breached can help to minimise the damage caused by the breach. Notification acknowledges the fact that a data breach potentially can expose an individual to a serious risk of harm. By arming individuals with the necessary information, they have the opportunity, for example, ‘to monitor their accounts, take preventative measures such as new accounts, and be ready to correct any damage done’.


But the risks are not limited to financial matters. The ALRC report continues: 


Other types of personal information, such as health information, if disclosed, could subject a person to discriminatory treatment or damage to his or her reputation. Informing a person that such information has been disclosed makes that person aware of what may be the possible consequences of the breach.


All of that points to the importance of ensuring that personal information is maintained in the appropriate way and, if it is not—if there is either an inadvertent breach or a deliberate breach—to the importance of notification. Individuals, once notified, can take appropriate action. By notifying them, you arm them—you give the individual the power to do something rather than just be a target. 


A data breach notification also provides incentives to businesses to improve their data security. There are a range of reasons why some companies might not want to notify consumers. The reputational damage that could follow a high-profile data breach, or the commercial consequences of such a breach, provides a powerful incentive not to notify. This bill will ensure that they do notify and give them the proactive ability to arm individuals with the necessary things to help them deal with such a data breach. Overall, it also creates a market incentive. Those companies with good, strong data protection notification regimes or privacy alert regimes and those with good information on privacy practices will have a competitive advantage in the marketplace. Consumers and individuals will feel more confident in dealing with those types of businesses, amongst an array of competing businesses, who can stand out and say: 'When you give us your personal information, feel confident that we will protect it. If we inadvertently fail in that, we have a privacy alert in place that will proactively deal with it in a range of ways.' In today's modern business world, I think that is a far better way to deal with areas of privacy.


One of the disappointing things is that there is a long list of speakers for this bill. I assume many from those opposite want to contribute to such a positive bill from Senator Singh. I do not think they ultimately disagree with it, but I do worry that they might simply be talking it out so we do not get on to another bill, the environmental bill dealing with supertrawlers. I would not think that ordinarily; I would think everyone has a positive view about dealing with privacy. I would encourage those on the other side to support what is good public policy and what provides for good outcomes for privacy. Ultimately, I think that the government will pass the bill in this form or a similar form when the Attorney-General gets off his hands and that they will be back in this chamber supporting it.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2014-03-27,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (10:32):  I start my contribution by suggesting to Senator Ludwig that his attempt at humour at the expense of the Attorney-General was not only tawdry but a complete failure. I am sure Senator Brandis enjoyed it! I can see him now trembling at the vicious attack with a lettuce leaf! I suggest to Senator Ludwig that he sticks to his day job, like single-handedly destroying the northern beef cattle industry. I have been here awhile and Senator Brandis is one of the best attorneys-general I have seen in this parliament. Certainly in the last six years there is no comparison. He is a lawyer, a deep thinker and someone who understands the importance of his role. He is able to contribute not only with style but with expertise, common sense and a deep understanding of the law. Senator Ludwig's attempt at a humorous attack on the best Attorney-General I have seen was a complete failure.


Senator Ludwig did suggest that the Privacy Amendment (Privacy Alerts) Bill 2014 was sitting on the Attorney's windowsill going yellow in the sunlight, or some other such analogy. If this bill is so important, why did the former government leave it until the dying days of the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd governments to try to get it through? If it is as important as Senator Ludwig is saying, one wonders why it took the Labor Party 5½ years to get to where it is?


I do want to comment on the provisions of the bill. Before I do that, I pose this question to the other speakers in this debate, particularly to the Greens political party. I would guess that because it is a Labor bill, the Greens political party will be supporting it. I have no rationale for that, except Labor and the Greens seem to vote together on everything and have done for years. I wonder what Senator Ludlam will say in his contribution to this bill? It might be a little hard for him to contribute to the bill because I understand he is wagging it from his paid job in the Senate these last couple of weeks and is in Western Australian campaigning in a political campaign. As I understand it, he is being paid to be here working in this chamber. 


He is not here contributing to the debate, but perhaps other Greens senators who will speak might be able to answer this query. What do the Greens say about Senator Ludwig's attempt to bring into the parliament two people of questionable legality to give evidence at a parliamentary committee? I refer to Senator Ludwig's attempt to call as witnesses Mr Assange and Mr Snowdon. Mr Snowdon has been described in this chamber as a traitor to his country. Those two gentlemen, as I understand it, have no respect for anyone's privacy and certainly no respect for their nation's privacy—that is, their nation's security. Yet, here we have the Greens talking about privacy, indicating how important it is, when they are wanting to bring to a parliamentary committee two people who do not respect privacy at all and in fact disrespect privacy to the highest degree in that they have no regard for the security of their own nations. 


So it will be interesting to see how the Greens will distinguish their support for their friends in the Labor Party on this and every other bill with their attempt to destroy everyone's privacy by getting Snowdon and Assange to give evidence. If they do give evidence, it might be interesting if they tell the world just how they hacked into everyone's privacy, into the national privacy. Perhaps we can all learn something from them if we can get the details on how they hacked into the nation's privacy. So I will be listening to the debate very keenly to hear how the Greens address those issues. 


The Privacy Amendment (Privacy Alerts) Bill 2014 is similar to a bill that, as I mentioned, was introduced by the Labor government in 2013. I again repeat the point that if there is a concern about the passage of this bill, why didn't the Labor government do something about it in the previous six years rather than leaving it to a couple of days before the last parliament was prorogued? It did actually pass through the House of Representatives in June last year.


The bill was considered by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee, which reported to the Senate on 24 June. Senator Boyce in her quite distinguished and perceptive contribution—she was a member of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee at the time it considered the bill—to this debate spoke with some authority. She had actually sat through the hearings of the legislation committee's inquiry into the forerunner of this bill.


Senator Boyce and then Senator Humphries provided some additional comments to the report of the committee, which of course had a Labor majority. They expressed some concern at the lack of definition of the terms 'serious breach' or 'serious harm' in the legislation. As I read their report and listened to Senator Boyce, they also cited concerns about the regulatory overload for business.


The regulatory overload for business is costing our country money. We have made it quite clear in our pre-election commitments and by actions since then that we understand the impost of regulatory burden on business, particularly small business, and we are trying to do something about it. We have introduced several bills into the other house trying to get rid of some of the regulation that costs Australia so dearly, that makes Australia uncompetitive in its trading activities around the world and uncompetitive within our own country.


Here we are, as a government, trying to reduce the regulatory burden to encourage business activity—that is, to encourage employment, to heighten our standard of living in this country. At the same time, the Labor Party and the Greens are doing everything possible to, again, impose regulation on the Australian public, and particularly on business. That is because the Labor Party and the Greens particularly have this inflated view that people are not capable of looking after themselves; that they in the Labor Party and the Greens know better how to regulate people's lives and people's businesses than people, business men and women. A classic example of this was the embarrassment of the Senate inquiries into the Qantas issue where the Green senators tried to suggest to one of the biggest businesses in the world how they should run a business. It was laughable. If anyone had a look at the transcript of those two Senate inquiries, they would appreciate just how embarrassing it is to sit in on those committees and hear some of the inane questions that were asked by Greens and Labor senators about a multinational business—I digress slightly. I want to get back to my point: we are trying to reduce regulation; the Labor Party and the Greens are trying to increase it.


Comment on the regulatory impact of this bill was made in the dissenting report of coalition senators when this bill last came before the parliament. The last bill was intended to strengthen the existing voluntary data breach notification framework in order to counter underreporting of data breaches and to help prevent or reduce the effects of serious crimes like identity theft. The previous bill, on which this bill is based, was predicated on the general requirements of the Australian Privacy Principle 11, which requires regulated entities to hold personal information to prevent loss, unauthorised disclosure or misuse of that personal information. The 2014 bill, the one we are debating today, operates in much the same way. 


The proposed model would create a requirement to identify the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner, which I will subsequently refer to as OAIC, and affected individuals where there has been a data breach which has given rise to a real risk of serious harm to the affected individual. That was the ALRC's recommended approach. A 'real risk' is defined as a risk that is not a remote risk. This would mean that entities would not be required to report less serious privacy breaches to affected individuals or to the OAIC.


If I can pause there again and refer to the Assange and Snowden issue, where the Greens are trying to get these people to give evidence in some Senate inquiry about electronic security, electronic transmission of data and electronic storage of data. As I say, it is going to be fascinating to see what the Greens think that Mr Assange and Mr Snowden can tell us about maintaining people's privacy when, quite clearly, they are two persons who have no regard for anyone's privacy.


The bill before us has a requirement to notify that would apply to data breaches involving personal information, credit-reporting information, credit eligibility information and tax file number information. So where there were breaches relating to those things there would be a requirement to notify. I wonder whether—again, referring to Assange and Snowden—we should perhaps even put into the legislation where there are data breaches involving the nation's personal information, that is, its security.


But the content requirements of the notification are, at a minimum, a description of the breach, a list of the kinds of personal information concerned, contact information for affected individuals to obtain more information and assistance, and recommendations about the steps that individuals would take in response to the breach. There are several other provisions of this bill, which my colleague Senator Boyce has explained and which, I am sure, others will as well during their contribution.


I believe that this is a bill that the parliament should not be pressured into agreeing to without giving it full and proper consideration. I would suggest that the move by the Labor Party to introduce the bill without appropriate consultation is premature. This was the thought of coalition senators on the committee that inquired into a similar bill last year.


Can I suggest that, if the opposition were serious about privacy issues and this bill in particular, they might have introduced this bill in a proper way, which would have included informing us a bit earlier of their proposals to bring this forward. I understand there was very little notice given by the opposition to anyone or to the government generally that this bill was to be introduced. If they wanted to really address the issue, I suggest that they should have taken the opportunity to consult more widely.


It is clear that the government is not opposed to considering proposals that improve data security practices. Measures that enhance the protection of security of personal information of Australians are critical. However, I do refer the Senate to some comments made by business figures when the matter came before the Senate committee last time. The Communications Alliance argued that specific actions outlined in one of the provisions are contrary to good business practice, as reflected in the OAIC guide. Indeed, they said:


… good business practice would be to (a) contain the breach and do an assessment; (b) evaluate the risks; and then, if necessary, notify those affected by the breach. It is concerning that the Bill places more emphasis on notifying—and potentially confusing or alarming customers—than containing the breach, rectifying the issue and preventing its reoccurrence.


That indicates the sort of concerns that were raised, which I think are still current.


As I say, I am not opposed and I understand that the government is not opposed to considering proposals that improve data security services. But a lot more work has to be done, including consulting broadly on the implications of a mandatory notification scheme. I suggest to the mover of this motion that this has not been done and that we need to consult broadly with both community and industry. Until that is done and until all of the matters that were raised and, I might say, highlighted in the additional comments by coalition senators in the report of the committee that looked at the previous bill have been considered, then I do not think we should be rushed into this.


The government is not prepared to agree to a proposal without giving it full and proper consideration. I emphasise that we on this side of the chamber have always thought of the broader principles of privacy protection for individuals. We have previously expressed concerns about the detail of this bill. Given the importance of the matter, we continue to express those same concerns, including that a thorough and detailed scrutiny be afforded to this bill.

"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2014-03-27,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia) (10:51):  I too rise to speak on the Privacy Amendment (Privacy Alerts) Bill 2014, which contains proposed amendments to the Privacy Act. It is really disappointing that for the second time in a week we are standing here and discussing a bill that we support in principle. The concept of improving the provisions of security around privacy of information is something that I do not think anybody in this place would dispute as being a terribly important thing for us to do to maximise the protection of individuals. It is very frustrating that, instead of being able to stand up here today and say how fabulous this bill is and that we can support it, we cannot. Once again, there has been a lack consultation and a lack of regard by those on the other side for the reasonably simple and sensible changes that we would have expected. 


As you have probably heard in previous contributions, Mr Acting Deputy President, this bill was substantively put before the House of Representatives in 2013. That bill was passed in the House of Representatives but the coalition, which was in opposition at the time, expressed a level of concern about a number of things in it. So the bill was subsequently sent up to this place and referred off to the appropriate committee for investigation. A report came back from the coalition senators—who, at the time, were a minority on the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee looking into bill—with additional comments suggesting that they would like to see some things done to make the bill more appealing in order for them to support it. Now in 2014 we find that the bill has just been plonked down again, without those opposite taking any of the issues that were raised at that time into account. Once again, there has been no consultation and no attempt to address any of those issues raised—and many of them were quite simple. 


I was just reading through the comments made by the coalition senators about the 2013 bill, and I would have thought that those opposite might have thought those comments warranted further investigation. The Cyberspace Law and Policy Centre of the University of New South Wales Faculty of Law highlighted that it had around 10 working hours in which to collaborate on a draft on the bill and finalise its submission. The Australian Privacy Foundation also made the comment: 


... seriously negative impact on the democratic process that is inherent in the provision by the Parliament of 1-1/2 working days, during which civil society organisations are expected to discuss, draft and finalise a Submission to your Committee. 


It seems to me that it would not actually be all that difficult to go out and deal with a number of these organisations, which obviously have a major input and a major interest in this area, to find out what their concerns are in relation to this bill, because they are the ones who actually have to deal with the fall-out when this legislation is passed without consultation and fails. I would have thought that it was a pretty simple thing for us to be able to do that. I condemn those opposite for not having dealt with their concerns, albeit minor as they may well have seemed at the time, in the reintroduction of a very similar bill to that which was before this place in 2013. 


The really sad thing is that this seems to be a bit of trend. Only last week we were before this place speaking on a bill about the Woomera prohibited area. As a fellow South Australian, Mr Acting Deputy President Fawcett, I am sure you would have had concerns about it, because we would like to see the economic potential of this area unlocked for the benefit of our fellow citizens in South Australia. But, once again, we had a bill that was rushed into this place without the appropriate consultation with the wide range of people who are interested in this area, particularly when we had made it quite clear that we were very keen to see legislation passed to assist with the unlocking of this land. I believe it was only this week that the government's bill in relation to the Woomera prohibited area was introduced in the other place. We see these silly, rushed political exercises by those opposite in bringing these sorts of bills into this place when there is a proper process. A sensible consultation process needs to be undertaken and it is very, very frustrating that we are seeing silly politics being played when it would be really nice to see some good outcomes instead. 


This whole concept of policy on the run probably warrants a little more comment because it does have some very, very serious implications. Even with the best intent and the best of ideas, if you do not actually get the details sorted out, you can cause yourself amazing and significant problems. You have often heard the saying, 'the devil is in the detail'—and that is often the case with legislation and regulation. The unintended consequences of ill-conceived or not properly researched and consulted policy can have major impacts. I can assure you, Mr Acting Deputy President, having been a business person before I came into this place, I have seen the consequences of policy that has not been properly thought out and the people who were the recipients of that policy affected by it, because nobody actually bothered to go out and speak to them. They are the people who will be able to tell you, 'If you do this, this is what the consequence will be in reality.' It is not something that you will find in a textbook. It is not something that you will learn at university. It is not something that your union mates will have told you about. You need to speak to the people who are going to be impacted by the changes in legislation. 


I can think of millions of examples of this, but none more than current the debacle which was revealed last night in the NBN interim report. The problem with the NBN was not the concept of providing faster, more reliable and more affordable internet services to the majority of Australians. We all support that as a concept. There is no argument about that in any party, whether it be a minority party, a majority party or the Independents in this place. We would all like to see that as an outcome. But what we do not want to see is policy that is developed on the back of a serviette during a VIP flight from Perth, which ends up costing the Australian public way more than it can possibly afford or which makes promises that were never able to be kept because the capacity to keep them was never there—simply because nobody had thought through the details or the machinery behind the delivery of the particular promise. Last night we saw a terribly pathetic attempt to try to defend a legacy that was totally indefensible—a policy developed on the back of a serviette—whereby we have ended up spending nearly $8 billion and managed to provide less than three per cent of Australians with access to the NBN. We can go on: pink batts and the thought-bubble that was GroceryWatch. 


It stresses the importance of doing two things: making sure you are properly researched and properly prepared; and making sure you speak to the people at the grassroots level who will be affected by the policy, regulation or legislation. There is no question that we came into this place saying that we would be a government that tried to reduce the regulatory burden—and no-one disagrees that there is a need for regulation in some areas—but there has been an extraordinary increase in the number of regulations placed on the Australian community over the last six years and before that by state governments. There is a need to ensure that, whenever you put legislation before this place, you have made a sensible and thorough assessment of the regulatory impact so that you are not simply putting in a regulation for the sake of regulation. There has to be a need, a benefit; and this confirms that.


We have made it clear that we are not going to regulate for anything unless we have to and that we are intending to reduce the level of regulation out there in the marketplace. Only last week the coalition introduced a suite of bills into the lower house that outlined areas where we think there has been unnecessary and burdensome regulation placed on the Australian public and businesses for too long. The concerns that have been raised about this particular bill are not insurmountable, but we draw attention to the constant attempts by those opposite to dump things into this place. You have to start wondering whether it is simply distracting and malicious activity.


The other issue that came out of this bill—and unlike others in this place, I am no lawyer—is that of definition. In the coalition senators' dissenting report in 2013, they noted the concerns expressed by a number of submissions on the lack of definition of the terms 'serious breach' or 'serious harm' in the legislation. I have had a quick look through the legislation and the explanatory memorandum this morning, and the memorandum refers to: 


Serious harm, in this context, includes physical and psychological harm, as well as injury to feelings, humiliation, harm to reputation and financial or economic harm. The risk of harm must be real, that is, not remote, for it to give rise to a serious data breach.


That sounds interesting, but how would you assess that in your institution which holds cold private information for the people you look after. How does someone in one of these institutions make a determination about what constitutes 'psychological harm' or 'injury to feelings'? 


If we went around this chamber and surveyed all 76 senators about whether something had injured their feelings, you would probably get 76 different responses. You only need to look at some of the comments from the South Australian election. A pamphlet was put out in relation to one of our candidates. I know this is not about a breach of privacy or security, but it does emphasise the point of how you determine whether something is criminal in nature or whether it is something to be legislated for. The pamphlet basically dog whistled that one of our candidates because of her surname might have been a Middle Eastern terrorist. That may have hurt her feelings—and it probably did—and it may have been humiliating, but the question has to be: did this cause her serious harm? She might have thought it did. It goes to the point of how do you define these sorts of spurious terminologies—'as well as injury to feelings'? I find that an extraordinary thing to put in the explanatory memorandum.


Most concerning of all in this bill—the Privacy Amendment (Privacy Alerts) Bill 2014, a bill for an act to amend the Privacy Act 1998 and related purposes—are the definitions found in division 3. Clause 26ZF 'real risk' is defined as: 


For the purposes of this Part, real risk means a risk that is not aremote risk.


And 'harm' is defined as:



For the purposes of this Part, harm includes: 


(a) harm to reputation; and  


(b) economic harm; and  


(c) financial harm.


However, there is also 'serious harm', so I am not sure whether we are talking about 'harm' or 'serious harm'. What is the difference between 'harm' or 'serious harm' in that context? It talks about 'serious harm' in one context and defines 'harm' in another context: does that mean we are not talking about the same thing? In the other schedule of amendments, it says 'the access or disclosure will result in real risk of serious harm', but we do not have a definition of 'serious harm'; we only have a definition of 'harm'.


That is one difficulty I picked up this morning. I would suggest the bill has been rushed. It would be nice to think that, in the future, we might be able to have a thorough and rigorous process that would allow us to deal with all those sorts of little, petty issues which, I am sure, the average person out there who was not affected or impacted on by this particular legislation probably would think we were just being pedantic about. But it highlights the fact that sometimes just the use of a word or a phrase, a comment here or there that has not been thought through properly, can actually have quite a significant impact.


In conclusion, I and all of my colleagues on this side of the chamber support the provisions that ensure and maximise the protection of the individual from security breaches. We have absolutely no issue whatsoever with making sure that people are protected—or, at least, advised if there is something that is likely to be a problem to them.


What we do not support is something that has been just put through, I believe, because of some political motivation, as a political trick. It is something that could have been very easily fixed by just coming back to this place and speaking in an adult way, and by going back through the committee process to make sure that the concerns of everybody on the committee were addressed and speaking to the people in the community who are most likely to be impacted on by these changes. If we had just gone through that very simple process, we could be standing here today and enabling an amended version of this bill to go through.


Instead, we are standing here today, once again, saying, 'Guys, you haven't done your homework, and if you don't do your homework you're not going to pass.' We all went to school and we all knew that, the harder you worked and the better the research you did, the better your pass mark would be. And, once again, regrettably, you on the other side have got a fail.

"McKenzie, Sen Bridget",Nats,2014-03-27,"



Senator McKENZIE
 (Victoria—Nationals Whip in the Senate) (11:09):  I, too, rise this morning to make my contribution to the debate on the Privacy Amendment (Privacy Alerts) Bill 2014. This bill deals with the very real issue of data security and citizens' relationship to that. It deals with how we protect the privacy of the individual in the internet age.


Predominantly, we are looking at data mining, for instance, being a quite a profitable business. The University of Newcastle has done a bit of work in this area. The data mined can be collected, traded, analysed et cetera to ascertain a lot of detailed information about the individual: their preferences, what they like to eat, what they like to purchase, what they like to do with their leisure time and even how they think. Putting all that data together can allow the state, businesses, other individuals, security agencies—a whole raft of individuals and organisations—to understand the individual in a new way that is very different from before.


I think it raises some serious questions for us as a government as to how we ensure that the privacy of the individual is maintained within this environment, as more and more individuals use social media and the internet for a wider and wider variety of purposes, disclosing more and more about their private lives. There used to be a very clear distinction between your public life, which government is allowed to have a role in, and, from my perspective, your private life, which government is not allowed to have a role in. That line is becoming increasingly blurred through the increasingly pervasive—though often useful—role which the internet plays in our everyday lives. So this bill before us looks at that. Also, the University of Newcastle says it is not just the information itself—because obviously there are technological ways in which we can protect identity—but also the patterns that are useful to purchasers. The patterns gleaned from databases can lead to identification of an individual. That is how sophisticated we have become. So it is not just the individual markers themselves but the patterns within the databases that can cause issues.


When we look at how businesses use databases, we like to consider what the Bank of America did during Davos. They watched social media and looked at what was trending on Twitter in order to promote the bank's brand among people interested in economic issues by publishing real-time content related to the conference. So the bank itself was using social media and data to reach those individuals with highly sophisticated messages. To quote the senior vice president of the bank:


The data comes into the room from many sources, and you have to use that data like a modern-day orchestra leader, blending the inputs in real time in a combination that is as much an art as a science …


So the sophistication is growing, and we are concerned to ensure that the privacy of the individual is maintained.


I share the concerns aired in Bruce Nolop's blog under the heading, 'Why I hate what big data means for privacy'. He says:


… I fear potential abuses by law enforcement and national-security surveillance programs, and find the threat of cyberattacks, a la the Target experience, to be disconcerting. As citizens and consumers, we should demand safeguards against these risks, but recognize that breaches will be inevitable.


…   …   …


I hate the fact that if I use a search engine to research a topic, my screen space becomes inundated with advertisements for related products or services.


So it is a problem. That problem is growing and it is one that I think all of us involved in this space are concerned about.


But what concerns me about the bill before us today is that this is a huge issue. It is an international issue. Yet, in typical Labor Party fashion, when a bill very similar to this one came before the 43rd Parliament, only two days were given for public comment. It opened on the 18th and closed on the 20th. When we look at the scope of the issue itself, this is an issue that other governments internationally are dealing with and grappling with. We had two days to get our heads around the issue itself and potential solutions and to decide whether a bill very similar to the bill before us was actually going to deal with those issues and was going to result in an outcome that did protect the citizens of Australia in a way that did not impinge or overregulate an environment.


But, you know, that is the Labor way. Putting the bill before us today is, quite simply, an attempt by Labor to keep pushing through their failed legislative agenda even though they are now in opposition—a fact that they are finding very difficult to come to terms with. We had six years to deal with this issue. Even though it passed the House of Representatives on 6 June 2013, prior to the last election, they could not find a way to get it onto the Senate agenda paper so that we could actually deal with it. That was the priority that the government held this piece of legislation in. It is simply evidence again of their denial of the outcome of the last election and refusal to visit the reasons for that—the reasons for the policy vacuum that they are now operating in where we have to just dig up the legislation that did not quite make it the last time.


So here, on a Thursday in the Senate, when we have time to reflect on opposition legislation, they have a chance to put up some bills that they are really keen on and that they want to take forward to address a real concern in the community, and they bring forward legislation that is like the Thursday thought bubble: 'Whoops! We've failed to deliver any significant policy again. Let's just dig out of the bucket beside our drawer.' They rustle around. 'What have we got here? What didn't we get through in six years? Man, the pile is enormous!' The pile of unlegislated issues from the previous government is enormous—so enormous that we, in fact, are having to put forward legislation to ensure that promises made in budgets two years ago are able to be enacted, because you failed to get the bread-and-butter stuff right. You could not even get the bread-and-butter stuff right.


Senator Macdonald mentioned previously that we must ask, if this bill is so important, why it did not get treated as a priority while Labor was in government. It is a pity Senator Macdonald is not quite here, but I am sure he is watching with keen intent, and I just would like to ask: while Labor was prioritising their leadership coups, they managed to prioritise misogynistic rants about blue ties, they managed to prioritise—and I am glad Senator Cameron is here—the failed media laws, they managed to prioritise a whole tranche of legislation that the Australian people were not interested in and that the Australian people did not want to see enacted. The Australian people voted you out because you kept pursuing a legislative agenda that was not in their best interests. You managed to prioritise that, and yet you could not prioritise something which, from all accounts—globally and, indeed, locally—is an issue that we must grapple with: how do we appropriately regulate the issue of big data?


Instead, the Rudd-Gillard government's six years of chaos, waste and mismanagement delivered higher taxes, record boat arrivals and debt and deficit as far as the eye could see. Labor inherited a $20 billion surplus and left behind a projected $30 billion deficit. It turned $50 billion in the bank into a projected net debt of well over $200 billion. It was the fastest deterioration in debt in dollar terms as a share of GDP in modern Australian history.




Senator Cameron:
  There was a global financial crisis.




Senator McKENZIE:
  Labor's debt is already costing $10 billion a year in net interest payments. That is $33 million a day just in interest payments, Senator Cameron.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Bernardi
):  Order! Senator Cameron and senators on my left. The interjection is disorderly.




Senator McKENZIE:
  That is a lot of schools. That is a lot of teachers. Yet here we are. We are moving to scrap more than 10,000 unnecessary and counterproductive pieces of legislation and regulations. More than 50,000 pages of unnecessary and costly legislation that are a dead weight on business, community groups and households will go. The benefit will be significant. Removing these alone will save individuals and organisations more than $700 million a year—every single year.



Senator Cameron interjecting—




Senator McKENZIE:
  That saving, Senator Cameron, can actually be translated into things that I am sure you and the members of the AMWU will be concerned about: actual jobs. When we take the burden off business and when we ensure that the regulatory environment they are operating in gives them more cash in their hand, what they can do is employ the workers of Australia. They can actually get on with doing what they do well, which is producing fabulous product, produce and services, and get on with making our nation's economic base stronger. As I said, we will cut red tape costs by $1 billion a year. We are doing what we said we would do. What a direct contrast to those opposite. We are doing what we said we would do. This week had the first of what will be many days of repealing red tape—and hallelujah to that.


The bill before us today does raise a concern that not all regulation is bad. There are points where a government needs to ensure that appropriate regulation exists, and getting the balance right in this particular space is important to protect the privacy of the individual. Similarly, I was lucky to be on the cybersafety working group, and one of those areas that we looked at was how to get the balance right between ensuring the safety of young people and of young Australian children in the cyber environment. It is something that is responding directly to the concerns of Australian parents and, indeed, young people themselves. That does require very light regulation around how to get the balance right to ensure that we can take down quite quickly offensive material that damages and harms our young people. I have got several local examples in Victoria where the appropriate existing mechanisms were followed. I am thinking about a young girl of 12 where there was material up for a year on the website even though repeated requests had been made for it to be taken down. So there is a real need for appropriate regulation, and this may be an area where that exists. However, the way the Labor Party have proceeded to consult, to get their head around the issue and then formulate a cohesive policy response, again, beggars belief, but I should not be surprised—I feel like a broken record at times. When we talk about the process of consultation that the Labor Party underwent with the bill before us today, as I mentioned earlier, submissions opened on the 18th and closed on the 20th. When you are looking at privacy legislation, that is pretty private. In fact I do not think it gets much more private than that. That is what you do for preselection when you do not want anyone to nominate. That might be a tactic that is used more on the opposition side than on this side.


In relation to data breaches the legislation before us seeks to amend the Privacy Act 1988 to establish a framework for the mandatory notification by government agencies and certain private organisations to notify the Australian Information Commissioner and affected individuals of serious data breaches involving their personal information. Mandatory data breach notification commonly refers to a legal requirement to provide notice to affected persons and to the relevant regulator when certain types of personal information is accessed, obtained, used, disclosed, copied or modified by unauthorised persons. Such unauthorised access may occur following a malicious breach of the secure storage and handling of that information, for instance through a hacker attack, an accidental loss, most commonly of IT equipment or hard copy documents, a negligent or improper disclosure of information or otherwise. A data breach arises when there has been unauthorised access for this sort of information.


As I said earlier, a bill very similar to this was considered by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee and was reported on 24 June 2013.



Senator Cameron interjecting—



Senator Bilyk interjecting—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Bernardi
):  Order! Senator McKenzie, ignore the interjections, they are entirely disorderly. Senators on my left, please, Senator Bilyk, Senator Cameron.




Senator McKENZIE:
  Mr Acting Deputy President Bernardi, I do thank you for your protection. The government will not be pressured into agreeing to a proposal without giving it full and proper consideration. There will be no back-of-the-envelope policy decisions on this side, Senator Cameron. The move by Labor Senator the hon. Lisa Singh to introduce such a bill without appropriate consultation is premature. The opposition could have done this in a proper way, including informing the government earlier of their proposal. If the opposition really wanted to address this issue they should have taken the opportunity to consult widely, because that is what you do: you bring people along with you for your good ideas. You could not bring the Australian people along with you for the mining tax; you could not bring the Australian people along with you for the carbon tax. That was last September—you have got to get over it; it is not working for you. So, start consulting, bring us along with you, and we can start dealing with these sorts of issues in a constructive way to make sure that we get the right policy outcomes, particularly for these types of privacy issues.


The government are not opposed to considering proposals that improve data security practices. Measures that enhance the protection and security of personal information of Australians are critical, particularly in the digital environment, as I have previously outlined. There is more work to be done, including—I know you do not want to hear it; it is against your DNA—consulting broadly on implications of a mandatory notification scheme and consulting broadly with the community and industry. The government are not to prepared to agree to a proposal without giving it full and proper consideration. That is nothing less than what the Australian people ask us to do, to ensure that the policy responses we develop in this place actually address the issue and include them in part of the solution. We have always supported broad principles of privacy protection for individuals.


The lack of consultation with the previous bill was raised by various submitters to the inquiry. I would like to quote one from my home state from Liberty Victoria:


… we note with extreme disappointment that public comment opened on 18 June 2013 and closed two days later on 20 June 2013. This is a not conducive to open and transparent Government and it is extremely unlikely that many members of the public or any other interested party will have had time to review the Bill let alone prepare submissions to this Committee. Privacy is an important issue and with increasing amounts of personal data being collected by both the private and public sectors, the issue as to how that information is used and protected is of high public interest.


It is Thursday Trash Day for the opposition: 'We'll dig around and pull out the privacy bill. We won't actually go out and consult any further and have a look to see if we need any amendment. We won't actually talk to the government. We'll just pull out what we've got because we've got no other policy to bring forward.' The Australian Privacy Foundation similarly said during the prior inquiry:


The APF draws attention to the seriously negative impact on the democratic process that is inherent in the provision by the Parliament of only 1-1/2 working days, during which civil society organisations are expected to discuss, draft and finalise a Submission to your Committee.


Hello, what a failure! In its submission the Cyberspace Law and Policy Centre of the University of New South Wales Faculty of Law highlighted that it had:


… around 10 working hours in which to collaborate on, draft and finalise a submission …


This is an international issue; it is of high public interest. You think you could have given people a little longer than two days to get their high-quality submissions together so that the Senate, through its Legal and Constitutional Committee, last year, could have drafted an appropriate piece of legislation, let alone put any of the thoughts that had come through that inquiry process into the current bill before us—but not from Labor.


Coalition senators believe the concerns raised by those stakeholders should be scrutinised, understood and acted upon by the relevant government agencies as this new privacy regime is rolled out. These concerns still hold for the bill before us today. Privacy is too important not to be considered fully and properly. The coalition remain committed to a considered and consultative approach to policy development and to an open and transparent approach to government. It is what we said we would do, it is what we promised we would do and it is exactly what we are doing.

"Seselja, Sen Zed",LP,2014-03-27,"



Senator SESELJA
 (Australian Capital Territory) (11:29):  I rise to add my voice to the voices of coalition senators in this debate. I commend the words of Senator McKenzie, who outlined the case against this bill very well. She did that, despite being heckled completely unreasonably by those opposite, particularly Senator Cameron. I think that was quite unfair and unreasonable. I think Senator McKenzie was being heckled by the honourable Senator Doug Cameron. 



Senator Cameron interjecting—




Senator Bilyk:
  And Senator Bilyk!




Senator SESELJA:
  I am sorry. I was not aware, Senator Bilyk, that you were 'an honourable'. If you do have that title—




Senator Bilyk:
  No, I was just—




Senator SESELJA:
  So, it is just 'Senator Bilyk'. Thank you.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order! Senator Seselja, direct your comments to the chair.




Senator SESELJA:
  Thank you, Mr Deputy President. You are quite right. I am sure that those opposite will not be taking those honorary titles in future, anyway. They have made it very clear what they think of such titles.




Senator Bilyk:
  Do you want one, Zed?




Senator SESELJA:
  I could not quite hear the interjection, but I should not respond to interjections.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  That is correct, Senator Seselja.




Senator SESELJA:
  It does not matter if I do not hear them. It is hard to respond to them—it is hard to know whether you want to respond—if you cannot hear. Please heckle louder next time so that we can be clear on what it is you are heckling me on!


I would like to lend my support to what has been said. Senator McKenzie put it really well, and I want to pick up where she left off and where much of her contribution was aimed—that is, in relation to the fact that this government does not want to make the same mistakes that the previous government made. Those mistakes were often about very poor policy—about dumb ideas and not getting a mandate—but they were also very often about very, very poor process. That very poor process, when coupled with some very dumb ideas, led to some very poor outcomes. I want to touch on some of those poor processes because we do not want to make the same mistakes. 


There are many things on which we want to differentiate ourselves from the opposition. One of those is that we do not want to follow the poor processes of the previous Labor-Greens government. Senator McKenzie touched on some of those poor processes, and I will expand on some of them. We are hearing right now about one of the poorest processes ever put in place—the pink batts scheme. There were two days for public servants to go away and design a scheme to spend billions of dollars of tax payers' money.


We know about the disastrous results of that very poorly conceived and executed policy. Whether it was a good idea in the first place is one thing; we can all agree that the implementation was a disaster. That is what happens when you do not get it right and when you rush things.


The National Broadband Network was designed on the back of a beer coaster on a VIP flight. That has led to taxpayers forking out billions of dollars for very little delivery. That scheme would have led, had the Labor Party been returned to office, to at least $30 billion extra being spent on the National Broadband Network because of the poor design and because of the poor rollout.


We know that, in the time the Labor Party had in office, they had time to do damage because of that process. The NBN is another example of where we do not want to be. We do not want to end up doing things like the former, Labor-Greens government did. 


The mining tax mark 1 was brought in without proper consultation with industry. It was dumped on industry as a fait accompli. It was not properly consulted on. That led to the chaos that we saw with the removal of a first-term Prime Minister. Then we saw a hastily cobbled together replacement mining tax which ended up getting very little revenue while still doing damage to investment because of the concerns about that type of process and the concerns about that kind of attack on an industry that was so important to Australia.


That is another example of how we do not how to do things. That is the Labor way. The Labor way was to rush things. They would often tell us about how much legislation they had passed—the great success of the previous parliament was just how many pages of legislation they had passed. I put it to senators that the mark of a good government is not how many pages of legislation they pass; it is whether they manage the country effectively. The test is: when they pass legislation does it make things better? Does it make things better for families? Does it make things better for business? Does it make it easier to do business? Does it make us freer as a people? It is not about how many pieces of legislation and regulation you put in place.


So, not content, it seems, with passing ill-conceived and ill-thought-through legislation and policy from government, we now have the Labor Party seeking to impose that model on us from opposition. That is at the heart of our concerns.


I will go to some of the substance of the bill. As has already been stated by government senators, the government has always supported the principles of privacy protection for individuals. In this digital age, protection of personal information is important. We have seen in recent years many serious data breaches which have led to the compromising of personal information. The government understands how serious the issues of financial and identity theft are, but the government will not be pressured into agreeing to a proposal without giving it full and proper consideration. That is where we believe that the introduction of a bill by Senator Singh without appropriate consultation is premature.


If we look back at the criticisms made by coalition senators when a similar bill was introduced last year—criticisms about the lack of due process, time and scrutiny—we believe they still stand. There was a short timeframe for submissions in the original inquiry. The Cyberspace Law and Policy Centre at the University of New South Wales expressed concerned about the lack of time to submit. They said that they had had only around 10 working hours to draft and finalise a submission. The Australian Privacy Foundation also expressed concern about having only 1½ days to draft and finalise their submission. 


There is also a lack of clarity around the terms 'serious breach' or 'serious harm'. The Australian Privacy Foundation did not support the real risk of serious harm threshold. They argue that the threshold should not be set at too high a risk of harm and risk of harm should not be the only trigger for notification. The AFP said:


Aggregation of terms limiting the nature of the harm that triggers notification increases the risk that organizations will argue that one or other aggregated term do not apply to them. For example, a phrase such as ""real risk of serious harm"" is a very high threshold, because of the combination of 'real' (i.e. 'not remote') risk, 'serious' harm (with no clear notion of seriousness) and ‘harm’ which may be given a limited definition …


In addition, a second trigger is necessary. Any significant breach should be subject to notification in any case. If that were not the case, then a significant insecurity would not become apparent, and would not be addressed, and it would be very likely that it would later give rise to a serious breach that was eminently avoidable. A single threshold test would result in a scheme which was a failure.


There is also industry concern about the mandatory notification provisions. The proposed bill requires three specific actions. As soon as practicable, after forming a reasonable belief that a serious data breach has occurred, they must prepare a detailed statement concerning the breach, provide a copy of the statement to the commissioner and take reasonable steps to notify the contents of the statement to each significantly affected individual, and publish a copy of the statement on the entity's website and in at least one newspaper circulating generally in each state and territory if the prescribed general publication conditions are satisfied.


The Communications Alliance argued that these specific actions were contrary to good business practice. They said:


… good business practice would be to (a) contain the breach and do an assessment; (b) evaluate the risks; and then, if necessary, notify those affected by the breach. It is concerning that the Bill places more emphasis on notifying—and potentially confusing or alarming customers—than containing the breach, rectifying the issue and preventing its reoccurrence.


At the heart of the Communications Alliance's argument is that the bill will not do what is claimed it will do. What it could do in practice is cause more harm than good—not focusing on the outcome, which is about containing the breach; rather, potentially confusing customers. Sometimes these bills and Labor Party policies are about being seen to do something rather than actually dealing with the problem at hand. The Communications Alliance makes a good point.


The Australian Bankers Association raised concerns about the final condition of notification and the uncertain scope of the general publication conditions and notification model. Their submission said:


There is a critical element of the notification model in the Bill that is missing because it is unclear what “general publication conditions” will mean if these conditions are satisfied. Without this definition, the real impact of the Bill cannot be assessed because the meaning of this expression will be covered by a regulation-making power in the Bill. Regulations dealing with this aspect have not been provided with the Bill.


It is also important to note the additional regulatory burden this will place on the industry. Without proper consultation it is difficult to assess just how significant this burden is.


The concerns of key stakeholders should not be set aside, and further time to scrutinise the bill and consult with stakeholders is crucial before the bill is passed. The government is not opposed to considering proposals that improve data security practices. Measures that enhance the protection and security of the personal information of Australians are critical, particularly in this digital environment.


In conclusion, the coalition certainly agrees that we need to find ways to ensure data security, but we do not believe that the Labor-Greens way of doing things—which is to rush legislation through, which is to not properly consult with affected stakeholders and which is to not properly take account of serious industry concerns—is the right way to go. That path leads to poor policy, poor legislation and, ultimately, very poor outcomes for consumers in Australia. Those are the concerns that the coalition and I share.

"Back, Sen Chris",LP,2014-03-27,"



Senator BACK
 (Western Australia—Second Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (11:42):  I am delighted to rise to speak to the Privacy Amendment (Privacy Alerts) Bill 2014 as proposed by Senator Singh and to endorse the comments of my colleague Senator Seselja. It is a shame that Senator Singh is not here in the chamber to see the carriage of the discussion. Whether or not that is an indication of her interest in it I do not know, but, nevertheless, it can be taken along those lines. What was interesting to me—




Senator Moore:
  Mr Deputy President, I rise on a point of order: reflection on another member. I do not believe that was appropriate and it is becoming way too common.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Back, if you did reflect on another member, it would be simple if you just withdrew that.




Senator BACK:
  I certainly would withdraw any suggestion that I was reflecting on another senator in my comment. Senator Moore, I withdraw, through you, Mr Deputy President. It was not my intention; it was simply to point out the importance of this particular bill and to make some comments on the coalition's points. Part of my reason for making that point was to allow Senator Singh an opportunity in having me respond to a comment that she made in introducing the bill. It was the comment she made to my colleagues about the adequacy of time that has been allowed for public consultation. Quite clearly, we see this as further evidence of the failure of the now Labor opposition in this very area. We are again going to see discussion in this place this afternoon about activity that has resulted from inadequate public consultation and opportunity for the wider community to have its say in these areas.


Senator Singh made the point that there had been adequate time for public consultation. I go to last year's submission of the Cyberspace Law and Policy Centre of the Faculty of Law at the University of New South Wales. This very august body highlighted that, despite the apparent adequacy of the time that had been given for consideration by members of the public, it had had just 10 working hours—not 10 days, not 10 weeks, but 10 hours—in which to collaborate, to draft and to finalise its submission. I would see that as a deep insult to any body whose views were genuinely being sought and who might be able to make a useful contribution.


The Australian Privacy Foundation is another body that one might think would make a useful contribution and that the wider community would have a view on and be particularly keen on hearing from. I know that there would be many people wanting to know what the Australian Privacy Foundation's interests are. They said a 'seriously negative impact on the democratic process' was inherent in the provision by the parliament of just 1½ working days—very close to that 10 hours of the Cyberspace Law and Policy Centre—for civil society organisations to discuss, draft and finalise a submission to the committee. I would say to anyone who thinks that 10 hours, or 1½ days, is adequate time for a reputable body to consider, discuss, draft and finalise a submission to the committee, that it as a deep insult. Indeed, regrettably, we on this side continue to regard it as a deep insult.


As we know, the proposed model would create a requirement to notify the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner and affected individuals where there has been a data breach that gives rise to a real risk of serious harm. I would go to your background, Mr Deputy President, in the law enforcement area in Australia. How would you regard the words 'real risk of serious harm'? What is real to you might not be real to me. What is serious to Senator Scullion might not be serious to me. If a crocodile were chasing me, I would be very worried. Senator Scullion, on the other hand, would possibly see it as an opportunity that he would relish. I do not use this term flippantly. I would make the point that it would mean entities would not be required to report less serious privacy breaches to affected individuals or to the commissioner.


Senator Seselja spoke eloquently when he referred to the Australian Federal Police in this same area. He made the point that an unintended consequence might be that it makes the issue more serious, rather than less serious, simply because of the point of definition: what constitutes a serious breach of privacy? The requirement to notify would apply to data breaches involving personal information, credit-reporting information, credit eligibility information and tax file information. All of us in the community would share that concern. We do not want to see our private information—tax file, credit eligibility, banking details and personal information—being made public. All of us in this chamber would support that. The wider community would definitely support that proposition.


The important point to make is that the coalition will not allow the Senate to descend into the failure of the Labor opposition, and that is to rush through the decision-making and consultation process. We will not be pressured into agreeing to a proposal without giving it full and proper consideration. I have considered the points that Senator Seselja has made and the comments by Senator Boyce and my colleague Senator McKenzie in the same context. Senator Singh has introduced this bill without proper consultation, and I say that that is premature. The opposition could have done this in a more timely fashion. They could have informed the government of their proposal earlier. There is no good reason why they did not. I heard Senator Singh adversely commenting on the Attorney-General and his apparent lack of speed in introducing legislation in this area. She could have approached him some time earlier. If the opposition had wanted to address this issue seriously and in a timely fashion, they could have taken the opportunity to consult more widely and more quickly.


We are not opposed to considering the proposals to improve data security practices. They are of universal concern. We see around the world now the ease and speed with which cyberhackers and others can interfere with private data and information. And there are no geographic or national borders when it comes to this situation. But we know that there is more work to be done. We know that we must collaborate with officials in other countries—in Europe, the United States, Canada, New Zealand, the Eastern bloc and Asian countries. But the government is not prepared to agree to a proposal without giving it full and proper consideration. I thank you for the opportunity to comment.


Debate adjourned.

  This disallowance motion, which I am pleased to say has passed the Senate today, is really important. This was obviously a regulation to reintroduce temporary protection visas into the Senate through this parliament, effectively through the back door. The reason I say that is that this place debated this issue at length and resolved the issue back in December. But despite the government taking on board the will of the parliament and the will of the Senate—and they waited till everybody went on Christmas holidays—they reintroduced the regulation, despite the fact that there is a convention in this place that regulations that have been disallowed will not be reintroduced in this place within a six-month period. I think it was quite an arrogant move by this government to reintroduce regulations that had been dealt with. Temporary protection visas are cruel. They are ineffective— (Time expired)

  I think it is appropriate to acknowledge in this matter the coalition government's success in breaking the people-smuggling trade that Labor and the Greens fostered for more than five years. In 2007 when the Howard government left office there were just four people in detention who had arrived illegally by boat and none were children. The following year, Labor unwound the coalition's proven measures, abolishing the Pacific Solution, including temporary protection visas. The consequences were disastrous. As we well know, more than 50,000 people arrived illegally by boat, including more than 8,000 children, costing the taxpayer more than $11 billion in budget blow-outs. More than 1,100 people tragically perished at sea and thousands of people were denied a resettlement opportunity because these places had already been taken by those who had arrived illegally. The coalition's policies have proven to be successful. Those on the other side of the chamber should finally recognise that. (Time expired)

That this bill be now read a second time.


I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard.


Leave granted.




The speech read as follows—



The Defence Legislation Amendment (Woomera Prohibited Area) Bill 2014 gives effect to the recommendations of the Hawke Review of the Woomera Prohibited Area. The review was established in response to increasing demand for access to the Woomera Prohibited Area by the resources sector and the challenge this posed to Defence activity.


The Hawke Review consulted extensively to obtain the views of individuals and groups that had an interest in the future use of the Woomera Prohibited Area. The final review report was provided to the then Government on 4 February 2011 and made a number of recommendations aimed at improving the co-existence of the various parties that had an interest in the Woomera Prohibited Area. The focus of the recommendations was to improve the management of the Woomera Prohibited Area in a way that would meet Defence's testing requirements while creating conditions to make it commercially viable for other sectors, particularly resources, to invest in operations in the Woomera Prohibited Area.


The Woomera Prohibited Area is Australia's most important military testing range. It is used for the testing of war materiel under the control of the Royal Australian Air Force. It covers almost 124,000 square kilometres in South Australia, approximately 450 kilometres north north-west of Adelaide. It is the largest land range in the world, with a centre line of over 600 kilometres, and is comparable in size to England.


At the same time, the Woomera Prohibited Area overlaps a major part of South Australia's potential for significant minerals and energy resources, including 30 percent of the Gawler Craton, one of the world's major mineral domains, and the Arckaringa, Officer and Eromanga Basins for hydrocarbons and coal. Olympic Dam is adjacent to the Woomera Prohibited Area and is part of the same geological formations. In fact, the minerals that are known to be found in the area include copper, gold and iron ore. There is high potential for oil, gas and uranium to also be found in the area.


The South Australian Government has assessed that over the next decade about $35 billion worth of iron ore, gold and other minerals resources are potentially exploitable from within the Woomera Prohibited Area.


The Hawke Review considered how to use the Woomera Prohibited Area in a way that ensured that both its full national security and economic potential was realised. The Review proposed a system to maximise the co-existence between defence and non-defence users of the area.


The Review recommended that Defence remain the primary user of the area, but acknowledged that exploitation of the Woomera Prohibited Area's considerable minerals resources would bring significant economic benefit to South Australia in particular and Australia in general.


And this Bill will assist doing just that. There are four mines currently operating within the Woomera Prohibited Area and the Government looks forward to additional mining operations commencing in the near future. Furthermore, the Government believes the certainty and clarity of the exclusion periods will assist new operators to appropriately plan around Defence activities.


The Review proposed that the Woomera Prohibited Area be opened up for resources exploration to the maximum extent possible, but within the confines of its primary use for defence purposes. This will allow companies to take advantage of the resources potential in the Woomera Prohibited Area while ensuring its future viability as the most important test and evaluation range that supports the Australian Defence Force.


The Bill implements existing administrative procedures for non-Defence users to access the Woomera Prohibited Area in legislation. This regulatory change provides non-Defence users with long-term certainty around their ability to access the Woomera Prohibited Area and the conditions attached to that access. It also represents an estimated saving of around $690,000 in administrative costs for individual applicants in the resources sector to access the Woomera Prohibited Area over the next 10 years.


So, as well as providing certainty, this Bill is cutting red tape—consistent with this Government's drive to rid business of unnecessary impediments to expand, to invest and to employ Australians.


The Bill establishes a framework that provides all non-Defence users within the Woomera Prohibited Area a greater level of certainty over Defence activity in the Area and greater certainty over access arrangements.


It allows users to make commercial decisions with some assurance as to when they will be required to leave the Area because of Defence activity.


The framework maintains the primacy of the Woomera Prohibited Area as a national security and defence asset and sets up a co-existence scheme that allows access by non-defence users subject to conditions that protect the safety of all users in the Woomera Prohibited Area and ensure the appropriate national security protections for an area used to test defence capability.


Existing users of the Woomera Prohibited Area, including Indigenous groups, pastoralists, the Tarcoola-Darwin railway owners and operator and existing mining operations, will continue to access and operate under their current arrangements. The co-existence scheme established by the Bill will apply to new users of the Woomera Prohibited Area only.


This means that for non-Defence users, the permit system will allow access to the Woomera Prohibited Area on a conditional basis (existing users will continue to gain access under their current permissions). The permit conditions put limits on permit holders' access to allow Defence to conduct its testing activities in a manner that is safe and secure.


In order to obtain a permit, individuals must complete a permit application form in order to undertake the activity for which they require access to the Woomera Prohibited Area. The Woomera Prohibited Area Coordination Office will process the form and issue a permit within the timeframes set out in the draft Woomera Prohibited Area Rules. Local staff of the Woomera Test Range may also be able to approve some permits for purposes including Emergency access. There are different types of permits—resources exploration and production, opal mining, research, environmental, and other (including tourism activities). Once the Rules are finalised, the forms will be accessible on the Coordination Office website. The forms are likely to be very similar to the forms currently used for access during the transition period.


While the Bill provides the overarching framework for the legislative scheme, the detail of the proposed regime is to be included in the Woomera Prohibited Area Rules, to be agreed by the Minister for Defence and the Minister for Industry.


The Woomera Prohibited Area Advisory Board has been established to oversee the Woomera Prohibited Area access system and foster relationships among the Woomera Prohibited Area stakeholder groups.


The current Advisory Board has an independent Chair, Stephen Loosley, and Deputy Chair, the Hon Paul Holloway. Its ex-officio members are senior representatives from the Australian Government Departments of Defence, Industry and Finance, and the South Australian Department for Manufacturing, Innovation, Trade, Resources and Energy, and Defence SA.


The Board was established to ensure:


that the balance between economic interests and national security is maintained;


the effectiveness of the access system in safeguarding Defence activities; and


Indigenous and environmental interests are properly accounted for.


The Woomera Prohibited Area Advisory Board meets on a regular basis to undertake these functions. The roles and functions of the Board are to monitor and recommend amendments to coexistence policies and procedures; develop high-level relationships between Defence and the resources sector; resolve disputes between Defence and non-Defence users; report annually on the balance of interests in the WPA and conduct a review every seven years of the balance of interests in the WPA.


The Board will work with Defence in an endeavour to resolve all reasonable impediments to Defence authorising a permit and the Chair of the Advisory Board has the power to refer Defence access conditions to the Secretaries of Defence and Industry to seek their review by Defence where necessary.


In broad terms, the Bill:


Authorises the Minister for Defence, with the agreement of the Minister for Industry, to make the Woomera Prohibited Area Rules prescribe certain matters, including defining the Woomera Prohibited Area, and the zones to be demarcated within that Area.


Creates a permit system for access and use by future non-defence users of the Woomera Prohibited Area.


Introduces offences and penalties for entering the Woomera Prohibited Area without permission and for failing to comply with a condition of a permit. An infringement notice scheme and demerit point system will apply to the offence for failing to comply with a permit condition. The details of these schemes will be included in the Rules.


Provides for compensation for acquisition of property from a person otherwise than on just terms, although the Rules may limit the amounts of compensation payable by the Commonwealth.


Provides that any declaration or action taken under regulation 35 of the Defence Force Regulations 1952 in relation to the Woomera Prohibited Area is taken to have always been valid.


Provides that the Rules may limit the amounts of compensation payable by the Commonwealth for loss or damage in the Woomera Prohibited Area arising from a breach of common law or statutory duty of care in relation to the use of the area for the testing of war materiel.


This Bill takes previous attempts to deal with the various interests and stakeholders even further—and does so in a manner that is fair, transparent and predictable.


This Bill is an improvement on recent Woomera Bills for a number of reasons. For example, in October 2013, the South Australian Government raised concerns about potential unintended consequences of the legislation for their land management and economic objectives regarding pastoral leases in the Woomera Prohibited Area. In particular, it noted that the way the Bill was drafted would have the consequential effect that any new holder of an existing pastoral lease would be subject to the new legislation and Rules. This was especially relevant in the area designated as the 'Red Zone', in which the previous Bill stated no new permits will be granted.


Such an approach would have effectively precluded the sale or transfer of pastoral leases in the Red Zone, to the detriment of both economic activity and the important land management services provided by pastoralists (including maintenance of access roads, water infrastructure and fences, weed control, culling of feral animals, monitoring and fighting fires).


The Government determined that existing pastoral leases could be maintained under current arrangements as 'existing users', including in cases where a pastoral lease is acquired or extended.


The Northern Territory Government has raised concerns about the potential for long disruptions to the railway, and the impact of that for tourism and freight delivery to the Northern Territory. Current arrangements (under the Defence Force Regulations 1952) allow the Minister to suspend permission to access the railway and Stuart Highway for safety or security for the testing of war materiel—at any time and with no time limit specified. These arrangements have existed in their current form since 1989.


That said, today rail and road closures occur only for as long as is required to conduct the test and ensure safety or security. This will continue to be the case under the proposed new arrangements. For example, a recent long range missile test required the suspension of rail traffic through the WPA for a period of three hours on three occasions over a 21 day period. This was done in close consultation with the rail operator and did not impact their schedule.


The Tarcoola-Darwin railway owners and operator had raised concerns about their status as 'existing users' of the Woomera Prohibited Area under the Defence Force Regulations 1952 and that the scope of their existing use includes the railway and all associated infrastructure.


The status of the owner and operators of the Tarcoola-Darwin railway as existing users of the Woomera Prohibited Area has been clarified in this Bill in section 72TB.


Continuing positive engagement with the rail owners and operators, including the development of a working level agreement, will minimise the effect that any testing activity may have on rail operations and schedules.


This version of the Bill includes a technical provision that provides that any declaration or action taken under regulation 35 of the Defence Force Regulations 1952 in relation to the Woomera Prohibited Area is taken to have always been valid.


This provision ensures that any declaration or past act taken under regulation 35 of the Defence Force Regulations 1952 in relation to the Woomera Prohibited Area is taken to have always been valid. This section is inserted to avoid any doubt on the past applicability of the Defence Force Regulations to Woomera Prohibited Area which may arise as a result of the establishment of the new access regime by the Bill.


In order to meet the constitutional requirements to provide just terms compensation, the provision provides that where the declaration or past act would be invalid because of an acquisition of property otherwise than on just terms; the Commonwealth is liable to pay reasonable compensation.


Certainly it has taken some time for this Bill to be forthcoming. Developing a policy approach across the Commonwealth and South Australian Governments to facilitate non-Defence access to the WPA is a complex task.


The Hawke Review of the Woomera Prohibited Area recognised that the passage of legislation can be a lengthy process and consequently identified transition arrangements to support the introduction of the coexistence model.


Adopting a phased approach to admitting new non-Defence users enabled Defence, in conjunction with the South Australian Government, to acquire the capabilities and build the expertise required to manage the complex access control arrangements of the Woomera Prohibited Area.


A moratorium on new users accessing the WPA was put in place from 3 May 2011 through to 5 October 2012, when the transitional phase commenced.


During the Moratorium phase, Defence established the joint WPA Coordination Office, and developed the protocols necessary to enable greater access by the resource and energy sectors. Defence consultation and negotiation with industry on the transitional deeds of access allowed for access during the transition phase, and provided the foundation for the future legislative model.


Following the end of the Moratorium in October 2012, implementation of the review's recommendations moved into the transition phase. During this time the Coordination Office progressed the development of draft legislation in support of the co-existence framework.


This important legislation:


establishes a framework that provides non-Defence users within the Woomera Prohibited Area, in particular industry, with a level of certainty over Defence activity in the area;


allows users to make commercial decisions with some assurance as to when they will be requested to leave the area because of Defence activity; and


protects the safety of all users in the Woomera Prohibited Area and to ensure the appropriate national security protections for an area used to test defence capability. I commend the Bill.


Ordered that further consideration of the second reading of this bill be adjourned to the first sitting day of the next period of sittings, in accordance with standing order 111.

The speech read as follows—



Australia is blessed with a world-class health system. Between our public and private hospitals and Medicare, we boast a system that is by world standards of high quality. It is also very efficient. Australia spends about 9.4% of GDP on health. This compares very well with OECD countries and is vastly more efficient than the United States, which spends over 17%.


More importantly our health system is highly equitable. Every Australian knows that if they get sick, they can go to a doctor. Thanks to high rates of bulk billing—82% at last count—most people who need to are able to see their GP free of charge. And if something more serious comes along, we have excellent public hospitals that are guaranteed to worry more about your general health than your financial health.


In some countries, where user pays is the norm, healthcare is much more expensive. Those with insurance can get treatment, though it may mean a fight with their insurance company. Those who lack insurance live in fear of falling ill and when they do must either suffer without treatment or skirt bankruptcy.


The combination of equity, efficiency and quality that we enjoy is a feature of our health system. But these three aspects are related. Because we have a single universal insurer in Medicare, it puts a brake on prices and keeps costs down. All Australians pay into the system with their taxes and use it for their healthcare needs, so its universality means ownership by all Australians. This creates pressure on government to ensure that the quality is of an acceptable standard. Although we read horror stories about emergency departments in the newspapers, by and large Australians can trust in their hospitals to look after them well.


In contrast, a two-tier health system run by a multitude of private health insurance companies has none of these advantages. Competition by insurance companies adds the overhead of multiple layers of administration into every medical service or procedure. A complex and opaque network of contracts can mean escalating prices. It can be more complex for consumers who have to check which doctor or hospital they can visit, what is covered, and how much of it is covered.


And what becomes of the uninsured, those on the bottom tier?


The Greens are committed to keeping this question in the realm of the hypothetical here in Australia. However, we have seen some worrying signs that indicate that Medicare as we know it is under threat. Firstly, there has been a lot of debate about adding a co-payment for all Medicare services as a way of reducing demand for primary health care services and thus to save money. Deliberately placing a cost barrier between patients and their GPs undermines all that Medicare is built upon.


Secondly, and not unrelated to the first point, is the potential for private insurers to enter the primary care space in force. Already, Medibank Private are trialling a system where they pay GP clinics to offer enhanced services to their members such as guaranteed appointments and after hours care. While this runs clearly against the spirit of the Private Health Insurance Act it appears to be within the letter of the law.


There is an important role for private hospitals as part of our healthcare system. Private health insurance is a choice that those who can afford it are free to make. But there is nothing to be gained by throwing open the doors to competing private health funds in primary care. Competition does not always mean lower prices. GP visits will become more expensive for everyone and if doctor visits become more expensive so will private health insurance.  We do not want to start health care costs on this upward spiral. This undermines the single, universal system we prize so dearly.


In order to prevent this, this Bill, the Private Health Insurance Amendment (GP Services) Bill 2014, amends the Act to clarify that commercial arrangements between private insurers and GPs that create a two-tiered system are not acceptable. The Bill specifies in clear language that insurers cannot pay GPs for treatment of their members, nor can they pay to get their members preferential access to treatment.


Despite rhetoric we are hearing from the Government, health spending in Australia is not out of control and visits to the doctor are not to be discouraged. Medicare is fair and it is affordable. The Greens want to preserve both of these aspects of our health system.

The speeches read as follows—



AMENDING ACTS 1901 TO 1969 REPEAL BILL 2014


The Amending Acts 1901 to 1969 Repeal Bill 2014 is the second bill in the Government's 2014 Autumn Repeal Day package.


The main purpose of the Bill is to clean-up the statute books by removing over one thousand amending and repeal Acts.


The Bill repeals each Act mentioned in its Schedule.


These Acts are no longer required as the amendments and repeals that they provide for have already happened.


If any application, saving or transitional provision is included in one of those Acts, any ongoing operation of the provision will be preserved. The Acts do not contain any other substantive provisions that are not already spent.


Repealing these Acts is important because it will make the statute book simpler and quicker to use by reducing the time it takes to locate current regulations.


At present, the Acts proposed to be repealed in the Amending Acts Bill form part of the current law and it is not clear to everyone whether the Acts have force in and of themselves.


Repealing these Acts will remove any confusion about the status of these laws.


It will be easier for individuals, businesses and community organisations to find laws that impact them without needing to sift through redundant material, while people with a specific interest in the legislation can continue to access these Acts as they will remain publically available on ComLaw as historical records. 


The earliest Act being repealed in this Bill is the Defence Act 1904. It made amendments that were themselves amended and overtaken multiple times since 1904. This is recorded in the legislative amendment history of the current Defence Act 1903. Indeed, so historic is the Defence Act 1904 that it references a State Division of the Naval Forces and not the Royal Australian Navy, which was formed in 1911.


There are numerous other items contained in schedule 1 of the Bill which were made in the decades shortly after the start of Federation but which are no longer necessary.


The Dried Fruits Export Charges Act 1927 is an example of an Act that is clearly out-dated but has remained on the statute book for a significant period of time. It set the charge on export of dried fruits in the now repealed principal Act of 1924 to one-eighth of a penny for each pound of dried fruits exported. It is now fully spent and redundant. 


Other Acts being repealed amend principal Acts which have already been repealed. For instance, the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Power Acts from 1951, 1952, 1956 and 1958 amend parts of the principal Act from 1949. The 1949 Act was repealed over a decade ago by the Snowy Hydro Corporatisation Act 1997 when the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Authority was corporatised.


Amending Acts made after 1969 will be repealed on future repeal days. I commend this bill to the Senate.


THE OMNIBUS REPEAL DAY (AUTUMN 2014) BILL 2014


In April 1946, Sir Robert Menzies' Liberal Party took out an advertisement in The Bulletin magazine - ""we want fewer forms and more reforms"" the headline screamed.


Alongside a picture of a husband and wife drowning in paperwork, the advertisement went on to say ""I'm fenced in with permits, licences, returns, regulations from every Board, Division and Department under the sun. What I want is to control my own industry…""


It was a message that strongly resonated then, as it still does today.


In every facet of life, from aged care to agriculture, schools to small business and visas to veterans, we are facing an avalanche of regulation that is impeding investment and innovation and the creation of new jobs.


In under 6 years, the previous Labor Government introduced an additional 21,000 regulations, including the Carbon Tax with its 18 separate acts and 1,100 pages of legislation, and the Mining Tax with 11 separate acts and 525 pages of legislation.


This is despite Kevin Rudd's 2007 claim that ""the truth is business regulation is now right out of control. The quantity and complexity of business regulation today is eating away at the entrepreneurial spirit of Australian business"".


And Kevin Rudd's Small Business Minister, Craig Emerson, who said ""we are promising to take a giant pair of scissors to the red tape that is strangling small businesses."" Unfortunately, Labor did anything but.


It is little wonder then, that given this poor performance by the Rudd and Gillard Governments, the World Economic Forum ranked Australia a pitiful 128 out of 148 countries surveyed for ""burden of government regulation"".


Or that the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry surveyed its members in 2013 and found that 73 per cent of businesses felt the compliance burden had increased in the past two years.


The Business Council of Australia too has documented the overwhelming compliance burden, highlighting one environmental approval process that took more than two years, cost millions of dollars, involved 4,000 meetings, required a 12,000-page report and when the approval came back, it had 1,500 conditions attached, 300 at the federal level, 1,200 at the state level, and 8,000 sub-conditions. How can we expect any company to go through that process?


Unfortunately today, too many of our business leaders share the sentiments of Jos de Bruin, CEO of the Master Grocers Association, who said ""many of our members feel that they are in the business of compliance, and do a little bit of retailing on the side.""


Comments such as these from an industry group representing firms employing more than 115,000 staff and contributing more than $14 billion each year to the economy are a call to action. And we need to respond.


It is against this backdrop that the Abbott Government is determined to turn back the tide of red and green tape and adopt a new approach.


Questions must be asked first before any new regulations are passed. What is their purpose? Their cost? Their impact on new entrants? And their effectiveness in managing risk? Only then, when it is absolutely necessary, with no sensible alternatives available, should we proceed to regulate.


We need a new concept of acceptable risk and we need to better understand the cumulative impact of regulation on business decision-making. After all, business is not sentimental and capital is mobile.


Politicians who support new regulation are, in the words of former Productivity Commission chairman Gary Banks, ""often rewarded with public acclaim as tangible evidence that the government is 'doing something' "". Just look at the previous Government's boast that it passed hundreds of pieces of legislation, as if that was an achievement in itself.


As Banks describes, these ""uneven political pressures"" are ""the antithesis of good regulatory process"". The incentives are simply all wrong. Their cumulative impact is to deter investment and innovation and stifle productivity.


As part of the Abbott Government's new approach, we are implementing a series of reforms which will hold both Ministers and the bureaucracy to greater account.


Cabinet submissions proposing legislative changes with a significant regulatory impact will no longer be exempted from the regulatory impact assessment processes.


Ministers have been tasked to establish designated units within their own departments to advise on deregulation priorities, while each minister is appointing an advisory committee with outside representation to provide advice on where regulation can be cut. 


Senior members of the public service are having their remuneration directly linked to their performance in reducing red and green tape.


Two parliamentary sitting days have been set aside for repealing legislation each year, with the first Repeal Day occurring next Wednesday.


And we have committed to an annual target of reducing red tape by $1 billion.


All this is being overseen by the Prime Minister and his department, which has subsumed the Office of Deregulation and the Office of Best Practice Regulation into the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet from its previous location in the Department of Finance.


Regulators too are the subject of a new approach. The Government is releasing today a Productivity Commission report which provides a framework for auditing the performance of regulatory agencies.


The Commonwealth has 75 external and 68 internal regulators, each of which vary in size. When they do their job well, they effectively manage risk and advance the interests of stakeholders and the community at large. However, when their performance is sub-par, it can lead to substantial delays, increased costs and complexity, and what can politely be described as ""mission creep"".


The perception today is that too many of our regulators are dominated by a culture of compliance and enforcement that stifles productivity. There is also a view that where regulators have the ability to cost-recover their fees from industry, it is industry that bears the impost of regulators' ­risk-aversion.


The Abbott Government is implementing a series of measures to audit and ultimately strengthen the performance of regulators. In addition to the Productivity Commission's report, which covers four key indicators - advice and guidance, licensing and approvals, monitoring and compliance, and enforcement – senior ministers in the Abbott Government with portfolio responsibility for one or more of the Commonwealth regulators are now sending letters of expectation to the relevant regulatory head.


These letters make clear that the strategic direction of the Government is to deregulate and lift the compliance burden on stakeholders. Where appropriate, Ministers call upon regulators to reduce any overlap between their functions and those of other regulators, and to undertake an audit of the cost to their stakeholders of regulatory compliance. Where it can be done, the Ministers are also requesting that regulators substitute mandatory reporting requirements with independent audits. The goal of these changes is to create a more practical, risk-based approach to enforcement.


Ahead of Repeal Day next Wednesday, today too is a historic moment for the Australian Parliament. Today the Government introduces legislation and tables documents to repeal more than 10,000 Acts and regulations - the largest ever single bulk repeal in the history of the Commonwealth.


Red and green tape is being cut across nearly every portfolio, slashing the compliance bill for the business and the not-for-profit sectors by more than $700 million.


Significantly, the broader economic impact will be exponentially larger than this as jobs will be created and investments that may have otherwise been delayed or cancelled will now go ahead.


In just over 6 months in government, it is a good start, but there is a long way to go. We are determined to see a cultural shift in Australia's approach to regulation.


Regulation must never be the default option for government, but only a means of last resort following genuine consultation with stakeholders.


The Abbott Government's deregulation initiatives, many of which are being introduced today, align with three key themes.


First, removing duplication between different levels of government and between different agencies of government.


The Government has already announced one-stop-shops for environmental approvals to avoid overlap between state and federal regimes. Now one-stop-shops will be extended to offshore petroleum activities in Commonwealth waters, with NOPSEMA (the National Offshore Petroleum Safety and Environmental Management Authority) now empowered to make determinations required under the Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Act without the need to get approval from a second, separate Commonwealth regulator.


David Byers, CEO of the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association, said this move is essential should Australia be able to ""win extra market share"" beyond the $200 billion already invested in local projects.


We are also removing the requirement for aged care building certification at the federal level, as this merely duplicates requirements at the state level. With an additional 74,000 aged care places needed over the next 10 years, we need less regulation not more if we are going to provide the incentive for the required investment.


In another significant change we are opening up the Comcare scheme to companies who operate in multiple states and want to self-insure. Instead of having to enter into separate workers' compensation schemes in every state in which they operate, they can enter into a single scheme which is estimated to save industry over $30 million a year in compliance costs.


Second, is the need to streamline onerous and costly reporting requirements.


Labor's Future of Financial Advice laws imposed a $700 million implementation cost on the financial services sector and needs to be paired back.


The Personal Property Securities Act which mandates that small and large hire firms register serial numbered goods with a Commonwealth authority is more onerous than regimes in place in comparable jurisdictions such as New Zealand and Canada.


Commonwealth grant and procurement guidelines also need to be amended to ensure greater use of template contracts and to increase the threshold for the Commonwealth to make payments with credit cards to assist the cash flow of small business.


The education sector also needs relief, with universities no longer having to submit capital asset management surveys, which provide unnecessary levels of detailed information on the use of their lecture theatres, laboratories, and academic offices.


And the not-for profit sector will also see savings, with the Brotherhood of St Laurence no longer having to report monthly, but instead quarterly, as it oversees the implementation of the Commonwealth's Home Interaction Program for Parents and Youngsters (HIPPY) program, an important educational service assisting disadvantaged young families.


Third, the Abbott Government will take a common sense approach to regulation.


There is no need for companies to seek separate classifications, for 2D, 3D, DVD or Blu-ray versions of a film like Kung Fu Panda when one classification should suffice.


Job service providers should not be required to keep 336 file cabinets to hold paper copies of job applications when they could be otherwise stored electronically.


It does not make sense for more than 30,000 retailers selling prepaid sim cards to take a photocopy of the purchaser's ID when similar details are again taken when the phone is activated.


So too for a potato farmer exporting to Korea, they should have the option to self-certify the origin of their produce and not go through the costly and time consuming process of paying for a certificate of origin.


These are just some of the many examples of over-regulation which we are seeking to correct with our initiatives announced in conjunction with Repeal Day. 


The Omnibus Repeal Day (Autumn 2014) Bill 2014, which is before the House, is part of a package of repeal measures, together with a series of other important Bills including the Statute Law Revision Bill No 1 2014 and the Amending Acts 1901-1969 Repeal Bill 2014.


The Omnibus Bill makes a number of changes to:


streamline reporting and information provision requirements for telecommunications providers under the Competition and Consumer Act 2010.


remove Telstra's standard marketing plan and policy statement requirements, now redundant under the Telecommunications (Consumer Protection and Service Standards) Act 1999.


streamline the Australian Communication and Media Authority's (AMCA) discretion to investigate complaints under the Media Authority Act 2005, Broadcasting Services Act 1992 (Broadcasting Act) and Interactive Gambling Act 2001.


remove superseded standard form agreement provisions outlined in the Telecommunications Consumer Protection Code requiring carriers to maintain duplicate summaries for each product and service.


grant the Australian Communication and Media Authority the power to exempt classes of licenses that do not have significant revenue from the requirement to provide audited accounts under the Broadcasting Act.


remove redundant permit provisions regarding the operation of sea installations under the Sea Installations Act 1987.


remove requirements to undertake water studies in the Murray-Darling Basin for mining activities which have been superseded by provisions in the Murray-Darling Basin Plan and the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conversation Act 1999.


repeal the Coordinator-General for Remote Indigenous Services Act 2009 following the decision announced in MYEFO and its function ceasing on 31 January 2014.


remove the certification requirement under the Aged Care Act 1997 that replicates state, territory and local government building regulations for residential aged care facilities..


exempt low volume importers from the licensing requirements of the Ozone Protection and Synthetic Greenhouse Gas Management Act 1989


This Omnibus Repeal Day Bill also proposes the repeal of 43 spent and redundant Acts, some of which have remained on the Commonwealth statute books despite fulfilling their purpose or being superseded, decades ago.


For example, the Approved Defence Projects Protection Act 1947 was enacted to provide for the protection of Approved Defence Projects by making it an offence to prevent, hinder or obstruct an approved defence project. This Act applies to the Woomera Prohibited Area and the Nurrungar Joint Defence Facility. Woomera has been protected under the Defence Force Regulation 1952 since 1976 and the Nurrungar facility was decommissioned in 1999.


Further, the Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement (Service Personnel) Act 1990 was established to transfer property between the Commonwealth and individual States following the creation of the Defence Housing Authority in 1988. The Act was fully spent after five years but remains on the Commonwealth statute book.


Four Acts from the Treasury portfolio remain on the statute book to implement increases to Australia's quota at the International Monetary Fund in 1965, 1970, 1983 and 1991. These payments have long been made and the arrangements are no longer required. Furthermore, the International Monetary Agreements Act 1947 was amended in 1991 to include standing arrangements to support any payment we are required to make to the IMF when quotas are changed.


By allowing these spent and redundant Acts to continue in force on the Commonwealth statute book, we are making it harder for businesses, individuals and community organisations to find out about the regulations that matter to them. Instead of being able to quickly and easily find and access the regulations they need to comply with, they have to sift through outdated, unnecessary regulations, to determine whether they still apply.


Through our commitment to dedicated parliamentary repeal days and bills like the Omnibus Repeal Day Bill, and the Amending Acts 1901 to 1969 Repeal Bill 2014 and Statute Law Review Bill (No. 1) 2014, this Government is taking decisive action to reduce this burden.


In conclusion, if Australia does not act now to tackle this avalanche of red and green tape, we will be unnecessarily raising the risk on Australia's $400+ billion investment pipeline, and, in the process, endangering tens of thousands of potential new jobs.


We must never forget in a competitive world, capital is mobile, and in the Asian Century, where the opportunities are so large, we not only need to seize every advantage but we need to eliminate every disadvantage.


This is why the deregulation agenda is so urgent and so important. We must act now, as the choice is ours.


Sir Robert Menzies, Australia's longest serving Prime Minister, was right when he said, more than 60 years ago, that what was needed was ""less forms and more reforms"". The Abbott Government has heeded these words and is now taking the lead.


Australian families, businesses and community organisations all stand to be the great beneficiaries. I commend this Bill to the Senate.


STATUTE LAW REVISION BILL (NO. 1) 2014


The Statute Law Revision Bill (No. 1) 2014 is the third bill in the Government's 2014 Autumn Repeal Day package.


The Bill cleans up the statute books by repairing minor errors in Commonwealth consolidated Acts, and repeals spent or redundant provisions and Acts.


While the Bill does not make substantive changes to the law, it serves two important functions. First, it clarifies the status of laws by repealing obsolete legislation and, secondly, it removes confusion by amending incorrect or out of date provisions. 


The Bill reduces the regulatory burden by improving the accuracy and useability of Commonwealth legislation. As a result, the Bill will help to save individuals, businesses and community organisations time and money.


Schedules 1 and 2 of the Bill achieve two main ends:


correcting minor technical errors in principal Acts, such as grammatical errors and errors in numbering, and


correcting amending Acts which contain errors.


For example, sometimes legislation refers to other Acts incorrectly, or contains references to other parts of the same Act which are not accurate. By correcting these unclear legislative provisions, this Bill helps make the law easier to use.


Schedules 3, 4 and 5 of the Bill update language used in a range of legislation. These schedules make three sorts of changes:


Firstly, they amend Acts to ensure that Commonwealth Ministers are consistently mentioned by reference to the administration of particular legislation, rather than by title. This ensures that the provisions can still be understood and operate properly when the titles of Ministers change.


Secondly, they amend terminology to consistently reflect terms now used in the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 and in current drafting practice. The Acts Interpretation Act is a dictionary and manual that provides rules for reading and interpreting Commonwealth legislation.


Thirdly, they correct various Commonwealth Acts to reflect the correct title of the Legislative Assembly of the Northern Territory under the Northern Territory (Self-Government) Act 1978.


By removing out-dated or unnecessary provisions and Acts, this Bill also makes Commonwealth legislation more efficient to use.


Schedules 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 of the Bill repeal spent or redundant provisions and Acts.


For example, the Melbourne 2006 Commonwealth Games (Indicia and Images) Protection Act 2005 regulated the use of indicia and images associated with the Melbourne 2006 Commonwealth Games. The Act provided that it ceased to have effect on 30 June 2006, so it can now be repealed.


Other minor errors in Commonwealth consolidated Acts will be corrected on future repeal days. I commend this bill to the Senate. 


Ordered that further consideration of the second reading of these bills be adjourned to the first sitting day of the next period of sittings, in accordance with standing order 111.


Ordered that the bills be listed on the Notice Paper as separate orders of the day.

Senator LINES
 (Western Australia) (12:23):  Pursuant to order, I present the Education and Employment References Committee report titled Effectiveness of the National Assessment Program—Literacy and numeracy together with the Hansard record of proceedings and documents presented to the committee. 


Ordered that the report be printed.




Senator LINES:
  by leave—I move:


That the Senate take note of the report.


The NAPLAN report has been a long time coming to the Senate, and it is with some pleasure that I table the report today and have it available for the public to see the committee's assessment of the submissions presented to it. The committee received a number of submissions from academics, teachers and schools. As you would appreciate, Mr Deputy President, the lead-up to the introduction of this annual test was a little contentious in Australia. Before the test commenced in May 2008, states and territories in Australia were conducting tests in literacy and numeracy. Initially, the committee looked at how we might make comparisons with those tests conducted across the states and territories but, as I am sure the Senate can appreciate, it was an impossible task. The tests were too different to really be able to provide any objective analysis of the state of student outcomes across the country. 


In 2008, the NAPLAN test was introduced. NAPLAN is administered across the country in both primary and secondary schools to students in years 3, 5, 7 and 9 and tests across four core areas of reading, writing, language and numeracy. The test results are made available some four months later. The submissions received by the committee went into great detail about the test. It is obvious that the test is of great interest to parents, schools and universities, particularly those that have education as part of their fraternity. Many issues were raised with the committee, including the view that students were nervous before the test and that that could somehow impact on the results. We also had a number of submissions saying that teachers were really moving away from a broad commitment to school learning and were teaching towards the test. There were also those who thought that NAPLAN was a very good diagnostic tool. It is fair to say that the committee saw a great depth and breadth of interest from everyone concerned with education—and we should be concerned about education.


It is critically important for us in the parliament and for everyone concerned with schooling to make sure that the investment we make in schools is the best that it can possibly be and that we ensure student outcomes are as good as we can get them. It is important to remind ourselves of the educational goals of NAPLAN, which are to ensure that Australian schooling promotes equity and excellence and that all the young Australians become successful learners, confident and creative individuals and active and informed citizens. They are two very good and very important goals. Certainly the committee was of the view that, generally speaking, NAPLAN was working and that it was a good tool. 


Further, it was felt by some that there was too much of a gap between the time the test was administered and when the test results were made available. If we are measuring the performance of our students then those results should be available quickly so that appropriate diagnostic tools and measurements can be put in place. Then we do not merely note the NAPLAN test but use the outcomes of the test more constructively to enable good teaching to occur. Across geographic areas where there are a number of schools, whether in local communities or large regional towns, we could do a lot more in terms of school performance by asking those schools that are performing well in tests what are they doing that enables their students to perform better in tests as opposed to a school three or four streets away. That is the second stage of NAPLAN: how do we use the results of NAPLAN to hone in on school performance? NAPLAN has now been around since 2008. I am pleased to say that today's report is supported by all senators involved in that report. That we are able to say, despite our differences, that we all believe it is an important diagnostic tool, augurs well for the ongoing success of NAPLAN. Certainly, the results need to be available much more quickly, and now that NAPLAN has moved to an online test there is no reason we cannot get those results back to schools as soon as possible.


The next stage for us is to ask: how do we take those tests and use them to improve student performance? How do we look at what is happening in a particular area or across the state or across states—which NAPLAN already does—compare like for like? Where we have really good pedagogy and good test results, then how do we share them? Education should not be occurring in a competitive environment. We want all students to succeed at school regardless of their background or where they live. The results of NAPLAN should be used to dig into why some students in some schools perform better at NAPLAN than others. How do we then bring everyone along with us—how we use those results to improve all students' performance.


Parents can measure where their child is performing against a national average and we can look at how a local school is performing against schools in similar areas and in similar circumstances. For me the next step needs to be: how do we take excellence and make sure it is shared right across the community? The other thing the committee has been at pains to stress was that NAPLAN in and of itself cannot improve student performance. It measures student performance, but actual improvement in student performance rests with quality teaching, quality teacher training and good pedagogical leadership in the school—where good principals are willing to look beyond their own school gate at the school that perhaps did better than them down the road in, say, in the area of literacy and investigate why that happened and what they can to make sure in the next round of NAPLAN they are doing as well as the other school.


The committee believes that at the micro level, the school level, but those results can be most effective and that is certainly where parents want NAPLAN to be effective and where the community wants to see those NAPLAN results analysed at school level and developed much more fully. There is no point in doing national testings if the results come back to schools and sit on the shelf collecting dust. That is not what we want to see. It is about improving school performance. I commend the report. (Time expired)

"Back, Sen Chris",LP,2014-03-27,"



Senator BACK
 (Western Australia—Second Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (12:35):  I rise on behalf of the coalition to support the report and recommendations of the effectiveness of the national assessment program literacy and numeracy. Knowing that my Senate colleagues, Senator Wright and Senator McKenzie, do want to contribute, I will confine my remarks. The first thing to say is that the coalition supports the report and its recommendations. All of us on the committee particularly support shortening the interval between when the NAPLAN test is taken and when the results come back. Of course, with new technologies we believe these capacities exist with online testing. One of the things I do want to emphasise, however, is that, whilst in government, we will work closely with the states and the territories, the Catholic sector and the independent schools, to make sure that the technologies and the equipment are in place so that if and when we move to an online testing platform then we do not add to students' anxiety because the computers are breaking down or because they do not have access to them in the first place or because they do not have the capacity to use them. That is one of the recommendations I endorse.


The second point feeds on from that: there are special problems for students with disabilities or students from a non-English-speaking background. We would be urging ACARA that the nature of the testing, the questions being asked, are those that students from a non-English-speaking background or those who may be new to this country have some understanding of the actual question being asked and that they are not left at the starting gates simply because they do not understand the background or the nature of the question. If we do want, as Senator Lines says, this to become a diagnostic tool that is of some use to a teacher then there is not much point of doing the test in March or April and getting the results in October. But in the meantime, of course, it prompts the question, 'Should the results be available to that student's teacher in the next year?' because the information may still be relevant to that teacher in grasping some understanding.


What the government does not support is the notion of league tables—inevitably the media, the newspapers in particular, love to get hold of the information that comes from the My School website and start producing league tables. We cannot stop that happening and we do not intend to stop it happening. I think the message that needs to go out there is that this is not the basis upon which decisions are going to be made relating to either funding or resourcing. What is necessary is to use the results themselves, and the feedback from principals, to allow principals of schools to have far more autonomy in their decision making, while particularly including the parents, the teachers and the school community.


We do not want a circumstance in which pupils are pressured in going into this NAPLAN testing for fear that, if they do it badly in some way, their school is going to be disadvantaged—and we have seen evidence of that. Neither do we want a circumstance in which teachers teach to the test, out of fear placed upon them by the bureaucracy or administration that, if somehow or other there is a poor performance by pupils, the school is going to be disadvantaged. That has encouraged some, indeed, to leave the students at home.


I propose to conclude my remarks there to allow time for my colleagues to make a contribution. I will simply say that we certainly endorse the report and its recommendations.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Whish-Wilson
):  Senator Wright, you have the call, but I would just remind you: the debate will be interrupted at 12.45 and there will not be a continuation.

"Wright, Sen Penny",AG,2014-03-27,"



Senator WRIGHT
 (South Australia) (12:38):  Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. I am very pleased to take note of the report of the Senate Education and Employment References Committee's inquiry into the effectiveness of the NAPLAN program. I moved to establish this inquiry because of the growing parental concern I was hearing about the impact of NAPLAN testing and the My School website on students. After six years of the NAPLAN scheme, I thought it was time to re-evaluate what was happening in schools and check that the tests were still putting student needs first.


What we uncovered was that it was not only having adverse consequences for some students—including things like anxiety and stress—but actually affecting teaching and learning practices as a whole. We heard evidence that teachers were spending more and more time teaching to the test, and that the publication of the results on the My School site had created a very competitive environment.


Teachers, parents, schools, academics and education groups generally all came forward to have their say during this inquiry, and they said with a near unanimous voice: 'NAPLAN testing has drifted away from its original purposes, and it is time for change.' It is time to make sure that NAPLAN works for students, not the other way around. It has become a high-stakes test, but it should not be that way, and it does not have to be that way.


Although there was a lot of confusion in the evidence before the inquiry about the purposes of NAPLAN in the first place, one thing is very clear: NAPLAN was not designed to evaluate school success, so it should not be used to rank and compare schools. This competitive environment has also seen a commercial spin-off, so we have had everything from NAPLAN training books and teddy bears to specialised after-school tutoring sessions.


The evidence presented to the committee was clear: the data that comes out of the NAPLAN test should be used to help parents and teachers track how a student is going and to help them. But we have actually created a competitive spirit where schools are increasingly holding dedicated time teaching to the test, drawing time and resources away from other important curriculum areas. One survey found that 66 per cent of teachers believed the test damaged student wellbeing. And teachers are asking not to teach the NAPLAN year levels because of the extra burden and parental expectations. Schools should not feel like NAPLAN is a be all and end all test. It is simply a snapshot of how a student is tracking on a few areas of literacy and numeracy.


So, to combat this, the committee is recommending that the government do more to monitor the use of NAPLAN data to make sure it is helping kids, not creating a competitive environment with league tables. We are recommending that more is done to help students with a disability and from language backgrounds other than English to demonstrate their understanding. We are also recommending that the NAPLAN results get back to parents and schools much faster; at the moment there is a three-month turnaround, which drastically impairs NAPLAN's effectiveness as a diagnostic tool.


However, on the strength of the evidence presented to the committee, the Australian Greens do not believe that the committee's recommendations go far enough. If you read the report you will see that the committee's views are framed much more strongly than the recommendations that were able to be agreed to unanimously.


So, first, I note that it was the position of the coalition before the election that individual school-level data should not be published on the My School site, and the education minister has made similar statements since coming to government. On the evidence presented to the committee about the profound changes to teaching and learning as a result of the My School site, the Australian Greens would be very willing to work with the federal government to work out the best way to do this.


There is so much more I could say, but I am going to run out of time. I do want to thank the many, many parents, teachers and principals, academics and education groups who made submissions and to thank the committee for their excellent work. The Australian Greens have tabled additional comments, which we think strengthen for the better the recommendations of the general committee report.

Senator McKENZIE
 (Victoria—Nationals Whip in the Senate) (12:42):  I, too, rise in the remaining two minutes to make some very brief comments on the report of the Senate Education and Employment References Committee inquiry into the effectiveness of the NAPLAN program. I support wholeheartedly the chair's comments around what actually makes a difference in the classroom, to teachers and to educational outcomes for students, and that is: quality teaching and a degree of autonomy and flexibility at the local level to have a look around and adopt practices that will actually support the learning and development of our young people.


Obviously, Senator Back, we support the use of NAPLAN. It has provided an incredible amount of data for both state and federal governments to put on the table when designing their education policy. What we will be looking at—and this was one of the recommendations that came out of our inquiry—is the need to get the data into the classroom a lot quicker, so that teachers can adapt their pedagogy appropriately to the students in their classroom. That is what the test was designed to do, and ensuring that that time frame is shortened is a positive measure—and we support that state education ministers have set 2016 as the date for them to start looking at that, and we look forward to that. So we are not going to rush in to 'NAPLAN online', if you like, as a potential mechanism for doing that. That could be quite an adaptive process for young people and teachers to assess their numeracy and literacy, but it is going to take time. We are going to work comprehensively with state government and Catholic and independent systems to ensure that we get it right, so that we can make good decisions.


I just want to briefly comment on the need for increased support for student teachers and teachers in analysing and interpreting the quantitative data that comes out of NAPLAN.


I just wanted to make a brief comment on the Greens' additional comments around the creation of league tables and to reiterate the fact that the coalition does not support league tables. That is not what the tool was designed to do, nor should it be used for that. But we cannot stop media outlets, for instance, and other organisations using their numeracy skills with the data available to construct comparison data, nor would we want to.


Finally, I wanted to briefly touch on the fact that the department of the former Minister for Education in Tasmania, Greens Minister McKim, supported NAPLAN. (Time expired)

One of the things I do want to emphasise, however, is that, whilst in government, we will work closely with the states and the territories, the Catholic sector and the independent schools, to make sure that the technologies and the equipment are in place so that if and when we move to an online testing platform then we do not add to students' anxiety because the computers are breaking down or because they do not have access to them in the first place or because they do not have the capacity to use them. That is one of the recommendations I endorse.


The second point feeds on from that: there are special problems for students with disabilities or students from a non-English-speaking background. We would be urging ACARA that the nature of the testing, the questions being asked, are those that students from a non-English-speaking background or those who may be new to this country have some understanding of the actual question being asked and that they are not left at the starting gates simply because they do not understand the background or the nature of the question. If we do want, as Senator Lines says, this to become a diagnostic tool that is of some use to a teacher then there is not much point of doing the test in March or April and getting the results in October. But in the meantime, of course, it prompts the question, 'Should the results be available to that student's teacher in the next year?' because the information may still be relevant to that teacher in grasping some understanding.


What the government does not support is the notion of league tables—inevitably the media, the newspapers in particular, love to get hold of the information that comes from the My School website and start producing league tables. We cannot stop that happening and we do not intend to stop it happening. I think the message that needs to go out there is that this is not the basis upon which decisions are going to be made relating to either funding or resourcing. What is necessary is to use the results themselves, and the feedback from principals, to allow principals of schools to have far more autonomy in their decision making, while particularly including the parents, the teachers and the school community.


We do not want a circumstance in which pupils are pressured in going into this NAPLAN testing for fear that, if they do it badly in some way, their school is going to be disadvantaged—and we have seen evidence of that. Neither do we want a circumstance in which teachers teach to the test, out of fear placed upon them by the bureaucracy or administration that, if somehow or other there is a poor performance by pupils, the school is going to be disadvantaged. That has encouraged some, indeed, to leave the students at home.


I propose to conclude my remarks there to allow time for my colleagues to make a contribution. I will simply say that we certainly endorse the report and its recommendations.

Senator WRIGHT
 (South Australia) (12:38):  Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. I am very pleased to take note of the report of the Senate Education and Employment References Committee's inquiry into the effectiveness of the NAPLAN program. I moved to establish this inquiry because of the growing parental concern I was hearing about the impact of NAPLAN testing and the My School website on students. After six years of the NAPLAN scheme, I thought it was time to re-evaluate what was happening in schools and check that the tests were still putting student needs first.


What we uncovered was that it was not only having adverse consequences for some students—including things like anxiety and stress—but actually affecting teaching and learning practices as a whole. We heard evidence that teachers were spending more and more time teaching to the test, and that the publication of the results on the My School site had created a very competitive environment.


Teachers, parents, schools, academics and education groups generally all came forward to have their say during this inquiry, and they said with a near unanimous voice: 'NAPLAN testing has drifted away from its original purposes, and it is time for change.' It is time to make sure that NAPLAN works for students, not the other way around. It has become a high-stakes test, but it should not be that way, and it does not have to be that way.


Although there was a lot of confusion in the evidence before the inquiry about the purposes of NAPLAN in the first place, one thing is very clear: NAPLAN was not designed to evaluate school success, so it should not be used to rank and compare schools. This competitive environment has also seen a commercial spin-off, so we have had everything from NAPLAN training books and teddy bears to specialised after-school tutoring sessions.


The evidence presented to the committee was clear: the data that comes out of the NAPLAN test should be used to help parents and teachers track how a student is going and to help them. But we have actually created a competitive spirit where schools are increasingly holding dedicated time teaching to the test, drawing time and resources away from other important curriculum areas. One survey found that 66 per cent of teachers believed the test damaged student wellbeing. And teachers are asking not to teach the NAPLAN year levels because of the extra burden and parental expectations. Schools should not feel like NAPLAN is a be all and end all test. It is simply a snapshot of how a student is tracking on a few areas of literacy and numeracy.


So, to combat this, the committee is recommending that the government do more to monitor the use of NAPLAN data to make sure it is helping kids, not creating a competitive environment with league tables. We are recommending that more is done to help students with a disability and from language backgrounds other than English to demonstrate their understanding. We are also recommending that the NAPLAN results get back to parents and schools much faster; at the moment there is a three-month turnaround, which drastically impairs NAPLAN's effectiveness as a diagnostic tool.


However, on the strength of the evidence presented to the committee, the Australian Greens do not believe that the committee's recommendations go far enough. If you read the report you will see that the committee's views are framed much more strongly than the recommendations that were able to be agreed to unanimously.


So, first, I note that it was the position of the coalition before the election that individual school-level data should not be published on the My School site, and the education minister has made similar statements since coming to government. On the evidence presented to the committee about the profound changes to teaching and learning as a result of the My School site, the Australian Greens would be very willing to work with the federal government to work out the best way to do this.


There is so much more I could say, but I am going to run out of time. I do want to thank the many, many parents, teachers and principals, academics and education groups who made submissions and to thank the committee for their excellent work. The Australian Greens have tabled additional comments, which we think strengthen for the better the recommendations of the general committee report.

"McKenzie, Sen Bridget",Nats,2014-03-27,"



Senator McKENZIE
 (Victoria—Nationals Whip in the Senate) (12:42):  I, too, rise in the remaining two minutes to make some very brief comments on the report of the Senate Education and Employment References Committee inquiry into the effectiveness of the NAPLAN program. I support wholeheartedly the chair's comments around what actually makes a difference in the classroom, to teachers and to educational outcomes for students, and that is: quality teaching and a degree of autonomy and flexibility at the local level to have a look around and adopt practices that will actually support the learning and development of our young people.


Obviously, Senator Back, we support the use of NAPLAN. It has provided an incredible amount of data for both state and federal governments to put on the table when designing their education policy. What we will be looking at—and this was one of the recommendations that came out of our inquiry—is the need to get the data into the classroom a lot quicker, so that teachers can adapt their pedagogy appropriately to the students in their classroom. That is what the test was designed to do, and ensuring that that time frame is shortened is a positive measure—and we support that state education ministers have set 2016 as the date for them to start looking at that, and we look forward to that. So we are not going to rush in to 'NAPLAN online', if you like, as a potential mechanism for doing that. That could be quite an adaptive process for young people and teachers to assess their numeracy and literacy, but it is going to take time. We are going to work comprehensively with state government and Catholic and independent systems to ensure that we get it right, so that we can make good decisions.


I just want to briefly comment on the need for increased support for student teachers and teachers in analysing and interpreting the quantitative data that comes out of NAPLAN.


I just wanted to make a brief comment on the Greens' additional comments around the creation of league tables and to reiterate the fact that the coalition does not support league tables. That is not what the tool was designed to do, nor should it be used for that. But we cannot stop media outlets, for instance, and other organisations using their numeracy skills with the data available to construct comparison data, nor would we want to.


Finally, I wanted to briefly touch on the fact that the department of the former Minister for Education in Tasmania, Greens Minister McKim, supported NAPLAN. (Time expired)

"Singh, Sen Lisa",ALP,2014-03-27,"



Senator SINGH
 (Tasmania) (12:45):  I rise in support of the Marriage (Celebrant Registration Charge) Bill 2014 and the Marriage Amendment (Celebrant Administration and Fees) Bill 2014, because these are bills which reflect very much the implementation of the 2011-12 budget decision of the Gillard Labor government to introduce cost recovery for Commonwealth-registered marriage celebrants in Australia. A couple's wedding, we could all acknowledge, is one of the most important moments in their lives, and it is important that Australians can expect that those tasked with solemnising marriages will discharge their responsibilities to a very high standard. This bill concerns civil celebrants, and it should be added that celebrants in particular are an essential feature of many modern weddings. Celebrants provide marrying couples with a meaningful alternative to a registry wedding.


The Marriage Celebrants Program was established under the Marriage Act in 1973 by the Whitlam Labor government. My parliamentary colleague in the other place, the shadow Attorney-General, remarked in the second reading debate on this issue that the program that the Whitlam government introduced was one of the many achievements of a reforming Labor Attorney-General, Lionel Murphy. Despite vociferous opposition to the idea of civil celebrants from conservative quarters, including from within his own party, Lionel Murphy exercised his powers as Attorney-General to appoint the first civil celebrant in July 1973. There you are, we have come a long way since then and since that remarkable reform that he commenced with. A recent account holds that, frustrated with opposition to the idea, Lionel Murphy returned to his office late one night, typed the first letter of appointment himself and posted it from a nearby postbox to Lois Darcy, a 25-year-old Queenslander. Darcy was a great success; and, in the following months, Lionel Murphy appointed many others to this role.


That just shows you the importance of this program. The number of celebrants has significantly increased as many people move away from the more traditional religious marriage ceremonies. Some recent statistics from the Australian Bureau of Statistics show that in 2011 some 71 per cent of marriages were formalised by a celebrant. That really shows you not only how much things have changed since that great reform of Lionel Murphy in 1973 but also how much Australia has changed and how modernised we have become when it comes to the institution of marriage and how so many Australians do opt for a civil celebrant in choosing how their marriage ceremony will be carried out. I am sure senators in this place have attended many such ceremonies with celebrants at hand to carry out their duties.


Following on from the long tradition of Labor's support for celebrants, the Gillard Labor government developed these bills to ensure the ongoing integrity of the celebrant program and to make the administration of the program by the Attorney-General's Department financially sustainable—a very important step that obviously needs to occur for the program to run efficiently and effectively. The government undertook an extensive consultation process and prepared stakeholders for the introduction of these changes. It is pleasing to see the Abbott government continuing to implement these great Labor reforms with this prudent addition to the regulatory framework. I think that is an important component of these bills, and that is what we are debating and discussing here today.


The primary focus of these bills is very much on cost recovery of the administration of the Commonwealth Marriage Celebrants Program, and I understand that that includes new fees and charges consistent with the government's cost recovery guidelines. I think what is important—and it is something that is worth mentioning—is what those actual charges may end up being. I think celebrants certainly would like to know, in carrying out their work, what charges will be imposed on celebrants, to ensure that the charges are geared to cost recovery, because that really is the primary focus of this bill. It is about cost recovery, not about gouging. We would not want to see gouging occur. We want it to be focused, obviously, on the cost recovery of the administration of the Commonwealth. I think it is also critical that the program is adequately resourced to ensure that those high standards that Australians rightly do expect of a Commonwealth-registered marriage celebrant are properly monitored and properly enforced. That is a very important component, I think, that needs to be recognised. We do expect a high standard when it comes to our marriage celebrants, and that needs to be monitored and enforced. Some few years have passed now, and there have been extensive celebrant community meetings conducted around the country by, I understand, the Attorney-General's Department. I know they happened whilst Labor was in office and I hope they have continued, as need be, in the last six months under the Abbott government. It is an important component of the model that celebrants are informed, that they are aware and that they are not taken by surprise so that, when this bill passes in this chamber, they will know what to expect coming forward.


We need to recognise that this cost-recovery model will enable the program to improve services delivered by a Commonwealth registered marriage celebrant. I think that is really what we all want. We want to ensure that services are improved in their delivery. Also, of course, we want to effectively regulate celebrants in Australia. This model does improve on the program and does improve on the history, which I outlined earlier,—which the shadow Attorney-General also outlined in his contribution—from its beginnings under Lionel Murphy in 1973. The cost recovery implementation will very much provide the program with resources to better scrutinise aspiring celebrants prior to registration. Of course we are thinking, currently, about our existing celebrants and our Commonwealth registered marriage celebrants, but we should also recognise that there could be Australians who may choose to become a celebrant as their future job career and they, too, need to know about this new process and the new resources to ensure that they are the right person for the job. We want to ensure that that kind of scrutiny goes on, because we want to continue to make sure that this program has very high standards of celebrants within it. These measures will, in turn ,ensure that professional and legally correct services are delivered to marrying couples in Australia on that receiving end, which is what this is really all about: when marrying couples have professional and legally correct services delivered for their special day.


Of course there will be exemptions available from the fees and charges on grounds set by the regulations. I understand it is intended that exemptions will allow remote communities to access celebrancy services, which is a good thing, as well as cover those celebrants with serious illness, incapacity or absence from Australia that will affect their ability to solemnise marriages for a significant part of an exempted year. This bill establishes the infrastructure for the fees, including the eligibility for exemption provisions that I just touched on, and also on consequences for non-payment, and that infrastructure is important. The bill also provides legislative authority for the government to charge Commonwealth registered marriage celebrants an annual cost-recovery levy—the celebrant registration charge as it is known. The bill will allow the amount of the charge to be set by the minister up to a statutory limit of $600. The bill also allows for the indexation of the limit for financial years to reflect CPI.


As the implementation of a continuing history of Labor reform for the civil celebration of marriage, this bill is an important step to ensure that that reform history continues and ensures that the celebrant program continues in a robust, effective and highly professional manner. As I said at the outset, the institution of marriage celebrants in Australia is very much a proud Labor achievement established, as I mentioned, under the Whitlam Labor government. Today, civil celebrants officiate at almost 70 per cent of marriages in Australia. That is an incredible number of marriages. I understand that that equates to around 120,000 marriages a year. That figure shows the popularity of weddings where people choose to have a marriage celebrant to conduct the service. People are very much exercising their freedom to choose a wedding ceremony that accords with their own personal values and with their own personal beliefs. That is a really important thing in a modern, free society like Australia where couples do have that choice and where they are exercising their freedom to choose. That statistic of 70 per cent of marriages in Australia being officiated by civil celebrants shows that people are continuing to exercise that choice.


I do support this program and I do think it is critical that the program is adequately resourced, so I hope that that is a consideration by this government. Those higher standards that Australians rightfully expect from Commonwealth registered marriage celebrants cannot be delivered unless there is proper resourcing of the Attorney-General's Department for the monitoring and enforcing of these regulations. I will stress this issue. We are coming up to the budget season. It is one thing to pass good legislation; it is another thing to adequately resource it to ensure that it can be implemented as best it can. That includes, of course, the monitoring and enforcing provisions that are contained within this bill.


The work done into this bill and all of its components—and the work that has gone on since the Gillard Labor government were looking at introducing it during the budget of 2011—has brought us to the point today where there is bipartisan support. I am most pleased that the Abbott government is continuing on with this bill. I support the work of marriage celebrants in Australia. I support the freedom of choice that Australian couples continue to have—to have a marriage celebrant to conduct their weddings. 


Marriage is one of the most important moments in couples' lives. They expect that the celebrant that they choose is of the highest standard. That is what this bill helps to ensure will occur. With that I very much commend the bill to the Senate and look forward to it becoming law.

That the Senate take note of the report.


These ABCC bills have quite a history. As the Senate is aware, it is the second introduction by the government of such draconian laws to an industry and it has absolutely failed on both occasions to show due cause why we need such draconian legislation. Last year in December the legislative committee recommended that the bills re-establishing the ABCC be passed. However, the legislative committee did not have the benefit of a significant body of material that this committee, the references committee, has received in evidence through its three hearings, evidence that clearly undermines the case for the re-establishment of the ABCC.


In December last year the government and the supporters of these bills wanted the Senate to simply abandon its role to scrutinise, and simply pass the bills. The legislation committee was given a very short time in which to consider the bills, just 18 days to hear from submitters and produce a report. Indeed, submitters were rushed too, having a mere eight days to prepare submissions and gather evidence, and they were expected in that time to cover a wide range of complex matters. Then, there was only one public hearing, with just 3½ hours available to the committee to hear evidence from a very wide range of submitters who had very different points of view.


Since the tabling of the legislative committee report on 2 December 2013, the second report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights has been tabled and, shortly after the tabling of the legislative committee report, the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills report was also tabled. Both of these reports have raised very, very serious concerns which go to the limitation, curtailment and, indeed, extinguishment of a wide range of the civil, human and political rights of people working in the building and construction industry, and both of those committees have written to the Minister for Education and Employment seeking detailed evidence to support the government's assertions that the interference with human rights contained in the bills is necessary, reasonable and proportional. However, the government has yet to provide responses to the concerns of either of these committees and the minister's submissions to this inquiry of the references committee did not provide sufficient details or quality to satisfy the high standard—and there should be a high standard—of proof required to establish that human rights should be interfered with in the manner in which it is intended in the ABCC bills.


Throughout the references committee inquiry we heard evidence from the department and the minister, the Master Builders Association and the Australian Industry Group. We had an academic paper from Professor Peetz. We heard from a range of unions, but in particular the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union gave evidence, as did the Maritime Union of Australia, and then we heard the evidence of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, the ACTU. That evidence, as the Senate can imagine, was quite different, quite polarising. But what I want to say here today is that the evidence of the minister and the department, the MBA and the AiG was really quite inflated and did not go to facts or evidence to support the reintroduction of such draconian legislation, legislation which goes to the very heart of people's human rights. Certainly the CFMEU, the MUA and the ACTU said time after time that their approach as trade unions and, indeed, the peak body of trade unions, had a zero tolerance towards any form of corruption and, whilst that was put on the record, the MBA, the AiG and the minister completely disregarded the views of the unions and the ACTU about their attitudes towards corruption or alleged corruption in the building and construction industry.


It seemed that the MBA, the AiG and the department relied on one single report, a report by a company known formerly as Econtech, and now known as Independent Economics, which is flawed factually. That has been acknowledged by a range of bodies but in particular it has been completely discredited by Professor Peetz in both the submission to the references committee but also in an academic peer-reviewed paper that Professor Peetz reviewed. It goes to the heart of two key areas. One of the issues that the government and the MBA on behalf of the government kept putting was the notion of productivity gain, claiming just a little over nine per cent productivity gain during the life of the ABCC. Despite the fact that Professor Peetz in a methodical academic way completely discredited the nine per cent claim, the facts did not alter the views of the minister. 


The productivity gain starts off by comparing the domestic building industry with the multistorey CBD industry and it looks at a variety of building work that is done. One of the areas it looks at is the putting up of a wall. We know in our domestic building sector, particularly with housing, the architectural design of those houses does not change very much, that every second or third or fourth house is simply rearranged on the block or changed slightly—almost building by numbers. Yet, Econtech, or Independent Economics, took the building of a wall in the domestic situation and compared that to the building of a wall in a multistoreyed, uniquely architecturally designed building and came up with a cost. The cost was designed by simply phoning building companies, calling building companies who operate in a competitive environment, and asking them how much that cost. On the basis of that, they came up with this absolutely flawed and discredited number on productivity, and nobody who regards themselves as a rigorous academic agrees with that number for productivity.


The other area that we heard a lot about from the MBA and the government was this issue of lawlessness. In fact, they tried at one point to hold up a graph that supported and reported the number of lost days in the sector. In evidence, the CFMEU told us that in most of their enterprise bargaining a large majority of it is conducted without any authorised industrial stoppages, which are absolutely authorised under the current Fair Work Act. And what the government tried to do was take that lost days statistic, although it was not able to say which were authorised days and which were not, and say somehow there was lawlessness in the building industry.


So the government has completely failed on every single test to give any credible factual evidence to support the reintroduction of harsh laws that go to the very heart of people's human rights. Indeed, the minister is on the record as saying it is going to combat this alleged lawlessness in the building industry, and yet it only ever goes to civil penalties despite it using coercive powers—coercive powers which community and human rights organisations have said are completely over the top in terms of what they seek to do. I am pleased to say that the majority report of the committee has rejected these bills out of hand, and the government should now simply remove them from the Senate.

Senator BACK
 (Western Australia—Second Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (13:46):  I rise to totally reject the majority report of the Senate Education and Employment References Committee's inquiry into the Australian Building and Construction Commission bills. Once again, regrettably, the quality of the activities and the reports and the recommendations and the work of this chamber has been cheapened.


I regret, on behalf of coalition senators, that the Labor Party's decision, with support from the Greens, to refer this legislation for further review is an abuse of the process. It was only in December that the legislation committee reported on this very question. For those who wished to, they had the opportunity to present, to submit, to appear as witnesses and to put information before that committee—and they did so. Literally, only within weeks of the legislation committee reporting to the Senate on the outcome, which of course was that the ABCC legislation should proceed, we had the circumstance in which we had yet another series of hearings by the references committee going over exactly the same information.


I do want to record, in the few minutes available to me, the courtesy that the minister, Minister Abetz, showed to this references committee by appearing. I do not recall too many instances when Labor were in government that the minister of the day appeared before a committee and made themselves available. Minister Abetz, obviously along with his officers, did that.


Of course it is not necessary for me to read out the long litany of current reasons why we need the re-establishment of the ABCC. Just simply, if I may, Business SA submitted to the legislation committee that there was evidence that lawlessness identified by the Cole royal commission had returned in full force. The Master Builders, describing the 2011 Melbourne markets case, demonstrated that the courts had recognised—the courts had recognised!—deliberate flouting of the law by the CFMEU to obtain industrial advantage. Do I need to go on? In that case, the court imposed a $250,000 penalty.


On the day that this references committee met in Melbourne, only as we rose—there is a three-hour time difference between Perth and Melbourne—did we hear of the judgement in the federal court in Perth in which $684,000 in fines and compensation was awarded against the CFMEU, while the union's assistant state secretary, Mr Joseph McDonald, was himself fined $30,500 and banned from Brookfield Multiplex worksites until December 2016. I cannot for one moment imagine how my colleagues on the other side could come forward with the recommendation that there is no need for the re-establishment of the ABCC. I asked the CFMEU representative what was he willing to do, what evidence could he show of action by the union in condemning the use of force and abuse of process. Of course I got no answer at all. The MBA—the Master Builders Association—listed a number of examples.


Time does not permit me to spell out all the reasons why I believe this references inquiry really, with deep respect, ended up being worse than a farce. Coalition senators believe the Labor and the Greens senators must carefully consider their actions in the spirit of what this place is for—that is, for the opportunity for inquiries to be raised, for terms of reference to be struck, for submissions to be prepared and presented, for witnesses to appear, and of course for due process to take place. It has not taken place in this case. The coalition senators stand by the legislation committee and its recommendations. I thank you for the opportunity to comment.

Senator WRIGHT
 (South Australia) (13:50):  The Senate Standing Education and Employment References Committee has not minced words in delivering its report into the government's approach to re-establishing the Australian Building and Construction Commission, or the ABCC as I will call it from now on.


There is a long history to this issue, and the committee's findings can be summarised around five key problems. Firstly, the government's proposal embodied in the Building and Construction Industry (Improving Productivity) Bill 2013 disproportionately compromises human rights when you consider its objectives. Secondly, the bill does not contain adequate protections to balance the extensive coercive powers that the ABCC would have. Thirdly, there is no evidence that the ABCC would enhance productivity. In fact, the few sources that the government uses to support this claim have been discredited to the extent that they cannot be relied upon. Fourthly, the ABCC would have no jurisdiction to investigate criminality in the building and construction industry, so the claim that criminality in these industries is a rationale is spurious. In fact, evidence from law enforcement agencies was that the fact there may be criminals involved in the industry does not make it unique. Finally, the committee also concluded that the findings of Cole's Royal Commission into the Building and Construction Industry—still cited by supporters of the ABCC proposal after more than a decade—do not warrant re-establishing the ABCC.


The Australian Greens are particularly concerned about the proposal's impact on human rights and its disregard for appropriate legal protections. Even from a general legal point of view the bill is troubling. The Law Council of Australia states it has numerous features which are contrary to the rule of law principles, traditional common-law rights and privileges. These relate to the burden of proof, the privilege against self-incrimination, the right to silence, freedom from retrospective laws and the delegation of law-making power to the executive. The New South Wales Council for Civil Liberties also highlighted the human rights implications and the extreme powers that the ABCC would have to compel workers to produce documents, attend hearings and answer questions under the penalty of imprisonment. The Law Council, in its submission to the inquiry, submitted that the Commonwealth government has committed to upholding traditional rights and freedoms and yet here we have proposed legislation that would transgress many of those. It would be inappropriate to pass this legislation without considering this bill's significant impact on those.


We do not need to speculate to understand how the ABCC would impact on the industry. In the scheme of things the ABCC has only recently been abolished, and one of the worst examples of the ABCC's excesses in its last incarnation is the story of Ark Tribe, a unionist who hails from South Australia, my home state. In 2008 Ark Tribe, who is a rigger, discussed safety issues with his union colleagues on a construction site at Flinders University in Adelaide. As a consequence, the ABCC demanded he meet with them to discuss the legality of his actions. When he refused to give details of the meeting, the ABCC took him to court. In this landmark case, Ark Tribe was ultimately found not guilty after an 18-month legal fight, but it was a fight that took its toll on Ark, his family and supporters and had the potential to deter others who are committed to taking action in relation to workplace safety. That finding was a nail in the ABCC's coffin, yet this government proposes to resurrect it.


I commend this report to the Senate. The Australian Greens believe that free, independent and democratic unions are an essential pillar of a civil society. Unions have a proud history of enhancing wages and conditions for their members. Their role in ensuring the best possible safety for workers, especially in high-risk industries, is crucial. The benefits unions have fought for and won over a long period of time flow on to all workers. As long-term advocates against the ABCC, the Australian Greens will continue to fight for workers' rights to organise and work within a fair and equitable industrial relations system. The Greens will block this ABCC legislation and future attempts to legislate it.

Senator Lines interjecting—




Senator McKENZIE:
  Senator Lines, you were not in the 43rd Parliament. Issues around the building and construction industry and this side of the chamber's desire to fix and address the lawlessness that is inherent in the industry, particularly in my home state of Victoria, are falling on deaf ears with the unity ticket opposite. The Greens and the ALP are fighting for the hearts and minds of the trade union movement, slugging it out in inquiry after inquiry, contribution after contribution. Who is going to end up with the support at the end of the day? It is quite a tussle.


Over on this side of the chamber I think it is quite clear whose side we are on. We are on the side of the honest workers, the honest trade unions, the honest employers, those that are interested in ridding the building and construction industry of corruption and intimidation. I can briefly go through a list of examples in my home state where the current system is not working. It is not working for honest workers and it is not working for employers either. Both the Greens and the Labor Party failed to recognise or admit in their contributions to this debate here today that the legislation seeks to deal with corrupt behaviour and that it does not matter who is doing it, it applies equally, whereas they are only focused on how it is going to affect their union mates. I think we really have to ask what protection racket is actually being run.


I think of Boral Cement being black-banned and the effect on their industry and their business. I look at the Grocon building site in central Melbourne, where police horses were punched and witnesses said police used capsicum spray on protesters. There had been no work at the Myer site since last week, a delay that has cost Grocon $371,000 a day. Similarly with the Werribee picket line and the city west water project: a $40 million project and no work. At the desalination plant in Victoria, with the stoppages there and the impact on the Victorian budget and household costs for water, we have an issue. And an article headed 'Behind the Coles picket line, food may go off', in The Age on 20 June 2012, said about 250 of the Somerton National Distribution Centre's 467 permanent employees decided to go off the job while at least $32 million worth of food and alcohol stuck in the Somerton warehouse could go off, with the impact that has on that business's viability.


Senator Wright talks about free and democratic unions. I could not agree more with the role of unions in ensuring safe workplaces throughout our nation's history. But when the CFMEU and the AMWU were ordered by the Supreme Court not to picket, not to prevent free access to the site in a WA family business, they defied it and proceeded onto the site. So the courts can do what they like, but the sense of lawlessness inherent in the Australian union movement at present requires a tough cop on the beat, the Building and Construction Commissioner and draconian legislation, as Senator Lines likes to call it. That is exactly the type of legislation that is required to address the lawlessness inherent in the construction industry. We are interested in ensuring that honest workers and honest employers get to work in an industry where corruption does not abound.


The Labor Party and the Greens have joined together and abused Senate processes for the first time in 17 years by sending legislation to a committee which had been examined in the previous parliament. It had also been through a comprehensive consultation process through our own coalition policy development process, where the shadow minister at the time did consult with unions and employer organisations to come up with a comprehensive policy to address corruption within the building and construction industry and produce the bill. I know it is odd that we actually go through a consultation process to produce well-designed policy! You do not like to hear it, but maybe it is a methodology you should consider involving yourself in. Here we are, having had roughly 19 submitters in December and roughly 19 submitters today. It is just a delaying tactic, looking after your union mates.

 (Western Australia) (13:35):  by leave—I move:


That the Senate take note of the report.


These ABCC bills have quite a history. As the Senate is aware, it is the second introduction by the government of such draconian laws to an industry and it has absolutely failed on both occasions to show due cause why we need such draconian legislation. Last year in December the legislative committee recommended that the bills re-establishing the ABCC be passed. However, the legislative committee did not have the benefit of a significant body of material that this committee, the references committee, has received in evidence through its three hearings, evidence that clearly undermines the case for the re-establishment of the ABCC.


In December last year the government and the supporters of these bills wanted the Senate to simply abandon its role to scrutinise, and simply pass the bills. The legislation committee was given a very short time in which to consider the bills, just 18 days to hear from submitters and produce a report. Indeed, submitters were rushed too, having a mere eight days to prepare submissions and gather evidence, and they were expected in that time to cover a wide range of complex matters. Then, there was only one public hearing, with just 3½ hours available to the committee to hear evidence from a very wide range of submitters who had very different points of view.


Since the tabling of the legislative committee report on 2 December 2013, the second report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights has been tabled and, shortly after the tabling of the legislative committee report, the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills report was also tabled. Both of these reports have raised very, very serious concerns which go to the limitation, curtailment and, indeed, extinguishment of a wide range of the civil, human and political rights of people working in the building and construction industry, and both of those committees have written to the Minister for Education and Employment seeking detailed evidence to support the government's assertions that the interference with human rights contained in the bills is necessary, reasonable and proportional. However, the government has yet to provide responses to the concerns of either of these committees and the minister's submissions to this inquiry of the references committee did not provide sufficient details or quality to satisfy the high standard—and there should be a high standard—of proof required to establish that human rights should be interfered with in the manner in which it is intended in the ABCC bills.


Throughout the references committee inquiry we heard evidence from the department and the minister, the Master Builders Association and the Australian Industry Group. We had an academic paper from Professor Peetz. We heard from a range of unions, but in particular the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union gave evidence, as did the Maritime Union of Australia, and then we heard the evidence of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, the ACTU. That evidence, as the Senate can imagine, was quite different, quite polarising. But what I want to say here today is that the evidence of the minister and the department, the MBA and the AiG was really quite inflated and did not go to facts or evidence to support the reintroduction of such draconian legislation, legislation which goes to the very heart of people's human rights. Certainly the CFMEU, the MUA and the ACTU said time after time that their approach as trade unions and, indeed, the peak body of trade unions, had a zero tolerance towards any form of corruption and, whilst that was put on the record, the MBA, the AiG and the minister completely disregarded the views of the unions and the ACTU about their attitudes towards corruption or alleged corruption in the building and construction industry.


It seemed that the MBA, the AiG and the department relied on one single report, a report by a company known formerly as Econtech, and now known as Independent Economics, which is flawed factually. That has been acknowledged by a range of bodies but in particular it has been completely discredited by Professor Peetz in both the submission to the references committee but also in an academic peer-reviewed paper that Professor Peetz reviewed. It goes to the heart of two key areas. One of the issues that the government and the MBA on behalf of the government kept putting was the notion of productivity gain, claiming just a little over nine per cent productivity gain during the life of the ABCC. Despite the fact that Professor Peetz in a methodical academic way completely discredited the nine per cent claim, the facts did not alter the views of the minister. 


The productivity gain starts off by comparing the domestic building industry with the multistorey CBD industry and it looks at a variety of building work that is done. One of the areas it looks at is the putting up of a wall. We know in our domestic building sector, particularly with housing, the architectural design of those houses does not change very much, that every second or third or fourth house is simply rearranged on the block or changed slightly—almost building by numbers. Yet, Econtech, or Independent Economics, took the building of a wall in the domestic situation and compared that to the building of a wall in a multistoreyed, uniquely architecturally designed building and came up with a cost. The cost was designed by simply phoning building companies, calling building companies who operate in a competitive environment, and asking them how much that cost. On the basis of that, they came up with this absolutely flawed and discredited number on productivity, and nobody who regards themselves as a rigorous academic agrees with that number for productivity.


The other area that we heard a lot about from the MBA and the government was this issue of lawlessness. In fact, they tried at one point to hold up a graph that supported and reported the number of lost days in the sector. In evidence, the CFMEU told us that in most of their enterprise bargaining a large majority of it is conducted without any authorised industrial stoppages, which are absolutely authorised under the current Fair Work Act. And what the government tried to do was take that lost days statistic, although it was not able to say which were authorised days and which were not, and say somehow there was lawlessness in the building industry.

 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, Vice-President of the Executive Council, Minister for Arts and Attorney-General) (14:01):  Thank you very much indeed, Senator Singh. I once again acknowledge and thank you for your deep and close interest in this important topic. Senator Singh does not render the full text of the remarks I made to the Senate, because what I in fact said to the Senate was that the Human Rights Commission, speaking through the Human Rights Commissioner, had made certain observations. I did not say, as a matter of fact, that the president of the Human Rights Commission had said something; I said that the Human Rights Commissioner, Mr Wilson, had said something. I think the fact that there is a variety of views on this matter within the Human Rights Commission is itself relevant to the fact that we are having a debate in the community about where the line should be drawn between the two goals that I suspect everybody in this chamber subscribes to of on the one hand protecting freedom of speech and freedom of public discussion and on the other hand protecting racial minorities from vilification.


I accepted entirely, Senator Singh, that different people in good will may draw that line in different places. Professor Triggs, with whom I have discussed this matter on several occasions, has a particular view. The Human Rights Commissioner, Mr Wilson, has a different view. It is the government's view that the fact that there is a variety of opinions about how best to arrive at twin objectives which we all share is a good thing, not a bad thing. That is why the government has put out an exposure draft for consultation and feedback.

Senator SINGH
 (Tasmania) (15:08):  I move:


That the Senate take note of answers given by ministers to questions without notice asked by Opposition senators today.


Earlier this week the Attorney-General shocked the Australian public by stepping in to defend the rights of bigots. He backed the defence not only with statements made to the media but with a proposal to bring the full force of the law to bear on minorities and vulnerable groups in the community who might infringe on the rights of bigots. What we have heard since are rumblings not only from his own backbenchers—the member for Hasluck, the member for Reid, and even Senator Seselja—but, today, from Premier Barry O'Farrell who also criticised the federal Attorney-General's comment that people have the right to be bigoted and declared that vilification on the grounds of race or religion is 'always wrong'. One of the most senior members in the Liberal Party in this country, Premier Barry O'Farrell, has declared that there should be limits when it comes to free speech. Premier O'Farrell recognises that free speech should not be at any cost. He said today:


In commendably seeking to protect freedom of speech, we must not lower our defences against the evil of racial and religious intolerance.


He said further:


Bigotry should never be sanctioned, whether intentionally or unintentionally. Vilification on the grounds of race or religion is always wrong. There's no place for inciting hatred within our Australia society.


That shows you how much Senator Brandis is out of touch not only within the Australian community but within his own Liberal Party on this issue of changing race hate laws in this country. I call on Premier Barry O'Farrell to go further and to lobby the Prime Minister. Tell the Prime Minister how out of touch Senator Brandis is, how out of touch these proposed new racial vilification laws are. I call on Premier O'Farrell to lobby the Prime Minister to have these laws scrapped. Words are good, and his words have been good today, but what we need now are actions. Actions are what we want from Premier O'Farrell. At least Premier O'Farrell has had the good sense to see that this is actually killing the Liberal Party. This is destroying the Liberal Party. The extremism that Senator Brandis has embarked upon and that Tony Abbott has encouraged is breaking the Liberal Party apart as well as posing a greater threat, of course, to the broader Australian community.


We have now been made aware that Senator Brandis's own cabinet colleagues have leaked information against him because they are so shocked by the lengths to which he will go to appease Andrew Bolt. The one thing we do know about these racial vilification changes put forward by Senator Brandis is that they are not being put in place for the greater good. They are being put in place to appease one man, to appease one journalist. That is no way to govern for all people in this nation.


To declare that the rights of bigots are more important than the rights of minorities, minorities who suffer extreme race hate speech on a daily basis in this country, is wrong. It is unfortunate, but we do have racism in this country. That is why we have free speech, but it is not at any cost. We have good laws in this country that have worked for 20 years and have provided protections to minorities and to ethnic groups. That is why Senator Brandis has not had one ethnic group, not one community group, come out in support of these laws. He has had not one of the 150, who signed their names to a letter last year, come out in support of his proposed changes.


Now, we have one of the highest Liberal Party members in this country saying that Senator Brandis has got it wrong. I thank Premier Barry O'Farrell for coming out, for putting it right and for saying that these laws are wrong. I call on Premier O'Farrell to lobby the Prime Minister and to tell him that Senator Brandis should scrap these proposed changes.

Senator MASON
 (Queensland—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs) (15:13):  I welcome the release of the exposure draft of the repeal of section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act by the Attorney-General. All week we have had this howling chorus of political correctness from this morally vain party sitting opposite me—all week without stop.


I am not a good lawyer, and do not claim to be, but I do know this: there is no right at all not to be offended. I am offended by many things in this place—in fact I am offended all the time—but I do not want to ban or criminalise those things. I am offended by the fact that the party opposite, the opposition, spent the money of our children and of our grandchildren. It was morally culpable. They did it and I am offended by it, but I do not want to ban it. I loathe the fact that they have actually brought in a debt that has become systemic, that recurrent expenditure now is well and truly over government receipts. They did that and it is morally reprehensible. They are stealing money from the next generation, and that is morally reprehensible, but I do not want to ban it.


There is also no right not to have one's feelings hurt. You know, Deputy President, that I am very sensitive! I do not like to have my feelings hurt. But there is no right not to have them hurt. The Left's first instinct is always to ban things. They do not believe in a free market economy. That also do not believe in the free market of ideas. 


We do, even if we do not like some of those ideas. Do you know why?—because we believe it is better to ventilate, argue and debate than to attempt to subdue and hide. That has always been the Liberal way. If you do not believe me let me quote the Indigenous leader Dr Sue Gordon on the front page of The Australian, today. I am sure you read it, Deputy President. The article said:


Dr Gordon said the repression of free speech was damaging to race relations and she agreed with Attorney-General George Brandis that people had the right to be bigots. ""I think sometimes there is too much emotion in this topic and people need to just look at it calmly,"" she said.


""I agree with what Brandis said. People do have a right in this country, you can't suppress everything.""


That is the point that Dr Gordon was making. That is the point that the Attorney-General has been making all week. It is better to ventilate, argue and debate than to repress. It might be tough and uncomfortable. Democracy and pluralism is tough and uncomfortable, by nature.


There is a lot of political correctness going around at the moment. You may notice that it is fine to question the motives of Senator Brandis, the Attorney-General—a middle aged white man. You are always allowed to question his motives, but you are definitely not able to question the motives of anyone who identifies as an Australian Aboriginal or Indigenous person. That you cannot do. That is the mark of political correctness from those opposite.


Mr Dillon, who also identifies as being Aboriginal, was also quoted in that article on the front page of The Australian. The article went on:


""Political correctness, with regard to people who identify as Aboriginal Australians, has reached the ridiculous stage where one can be accused of being racist simply by questioning the motives of some people who identify as being Aboriginal,"" Mr Dillon says.


To question the motives of someone who is Indigenous or of a certain ethnicity is somehow outrageous and bigoted! It cannot be done, but it is okay to question or suborn the motives of someone who is white, middle-aged, male and happens to be the Attorney-General. 


We have heard all week that somehow there is a lack of propriety or good faith on behalf of the Attorney-General. That is what is outrageous about this debate—it has become personal rather than a matter of principle. So let us hope that between now and when the parliament resumes in a few weeks time calmness and rational debate takes over. There is one certainty, and it is this: the coalition will never reject, or even compromise, the idea of freedom of speech, except in very few cases. We will not change. Questioning motives is not the way to go about this debate. (Time expired)

Senator POLLEY
 (Tasmania) (15:18):  It is quite interesting that my colleague from the other side talks about being offended by contributions from this side of the chamber. Today, I was offended, as would be every older Australian in this country. What a shocking, shameful performance by the minister responsible here for aged care. He could not even fulfil his time allocation to answer a question and talk about what his government plans for older Australians. 


We on this side of the chamber know what they have planned. They will not deliver the $1.1 billion to support those working in aged-care facilities. The question is: will that money go into general revenue or will they put that straight to providers of aged care? We know that this government—the Abbott government—puts no value at all on older Australians or on having an aged-care minister. 


I can understand why the government do not have a minister for aged care. When Abbott was part of the Howard government, when they were last in government, they did nothing for aged care. They would not take the necessary steps to ensure, after 11½ years, that we had this country on a solid footing with respect to aged care. They did not show the respect that older Australians—those who have committed and contributed to this country over a long period of time—deserve.


Do not be mistaken—when it comes to who is the best friend of older Australians and those on the aged-care pension, people in the community know that it is the Labor government. We were the ones who delivered for the aged-care community in this country. Let's look at what not having an aged-care minister is going to mean. It will probably ensure that we do not go back to kerosene baths, but it will also mean that we have no-one in the ministry or cabinet fighting for older Australians. That is what it means. We, on this side of the chamber, know the issues that are confronting the aged-care sector in this country. We know that the average aged-care worker is about five years away from retirement. 


I took the opportunity to walk in the shoes of an aged-care worker. I can tell you that the people who work in that sector deserve to be remunerated to a standard— 




Senator Abetz:
  But only if they are members of United Voice.




Senator POLLEY:
  You can say that, but what have you done? You are a minister. You know very well the issues that we are facing in Tasmania in the aged-care sector. What I am saying is that—



Senator Abetz interjecting—




The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order on my right!




Senator POLLEY:
  Have you taken the opportunity to go and talk to those who work in the aged-care sector? I very much doubt anyone on that side of the chamber has. We want to see what the policy is. Are we just waiting for the Commission of Audit so that they can announce the cuts and advise us that that $1.1 billion that was set aside for the workers in the sector will go into general revenue—or will it go to the providers? 


The opposition want to see those workers supported, but we also want to see that older Australians are looked after. The minister representing the minister responsible for aged care had plenty of time to outline what he has planned. Where is the future? We know that on 1 July changes will come into effect. When Mark Butler was the minister for aged care under our government, he developed a policy in consultation with the sector to ensure that older Australians had better services and were looked after. We put a plan in place to look after those in the aged-care sector. But what do we hear today? Nothing.


We had a senator on the other side just talking about being offended. Every Australian should be ashamed of having a government that refuses to outline what it has planned and what its policies are going forward. When Tony Abbott was going to the election, he said: 'There will be no cuts to health, no cuts to education and no cuts to pensions,' but that was never put in writing, so we know we cannot take Tony Abbott's word— (Time expired)

"Bernardi, Sen Cory",LP,2014-03-27,"



Senator BERNARDI
 (South Australia) (15:23):  Mr Deputy President, thank you for putting a stop to that ceaseless babble from Senator Polley. It was an extraordinary reinvention of six years of the worst government that we have seen in the history of this country. For some reason, Senator Polley is masquerading as the saviour of people in aged-care facilities when her government disgracefully racked up hundreds of billions of dollars worth of debt and destroyed virtually any opportunity to build this country and build upon the good management that was the legacy of the Howard administration.


It is an extraordinary burden of hypocrisy that they bear when they have to stand up and ask whether money is going back into general revenue. May I remind you and the Australian people that there is some $300 billion worth of debt that needs to be repaid and priorities have to be made. Unlike those on the opposition benches, our priorities are not going to be specifically targeted. Ten per cent of childcare workers decided to sign up to one of the unions that have been terribly, horribly and grotesquely mismanaged. May I remind honourable senators opposite that those the Health Services Union represents—some of the lowest paid workers in the country—were ripped off and had their money stolen from them to use on prostitutes, porno movies and other filth and depravity.




Senator Polley:
  Mr Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. I ask you to call the senator to order so that he makes his comments relevant to the taking note issue, which aged care, and does not try to get back down into the gutter.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Polley, there is no point of order. The question before the chair is that we take note of all opposition questions.




Senator BERNARDI:
  I am very surprised that Senator Polley—a person, I believe, of great integrity normally—is now defending Craig Thomson and his misuse of credit cards on hookers, pornos, flights for his wife and things like that. I think that is quite grubby and it is beneath you, Senator Polley. What we are talking about here is appropriate use of taxpayers' money, whether that takes place in the union movement, where you have low-paid workers who should expect more from their leaders, or in this place. The taxpayers of Australia believe they should be getting a fair go and their money should be put to good use.


The fact is that $300 billion, or thereabouts, of debt was racked up on obscure programs, like pink batts, which of course cost a billion dollars to redo and, tragically, four people died as a result of incompetent and poor administration from those on the other side. Do we remember the cheques for $900 that were sent out at random? There were $10 billion worth of cheques to people, including dead people and people overseas. I remember Senator Polley justifying that it was okay to give it to people to put into the poker machines, because what they do with their money is their business. In principle, I agree with you, Senator Polley, but this is $10 billion worth of taxpayers' money that was randomly distributed to dead people and people overseas, as well as to people in this country. So do not give me and those on this side of the chamber a lecture about how we are applying taxpayers' money, because we are trying to redress the damage done by six years of the poorest administration in the history of this country.


I know that a whole bunch of eager frontbenchers on the other side have moved down. They spent six years on the backbench defending these abhorrent programs and saying, 'It's okay. This is the Labor way,' and now they are on the front bench and they need to defend their legacy, but their legacy is horrible and will have implications for this country for perhaps decades to come, because for every bad year of government it takes four years of good government to redress it. To pay off $300 billion of debt will take decades. We are doing it for our children. Sacrifices will have to be made, but those sacrifices will not be made at the expense of those who have served our nation, which is why we have already enhanced the pension benefits for serving military personnel. It will not be at the expense of the aged and the infirm. It will not be at the expense of those suffering from disability. It will have to be a sacrifice made by those who are working today—people like us in this place; people who are committed to building a better future for their country and to ensuring that we can look after those who are unable to look after themselves.


I contrast that with the actions of those on the other side. When in government, they do not look after anyone except themselves and their union mates. We have seen union slush funds, we have seen grubby deals done, we have seen people employed without any interviews—Mr Mike Kaiser—and we have seen billions of dollars squandered without so much as a business plan. It is rank hypocrisy to hear a lecture about the management of taxpayer resources from those on the other side. They should be ashamed of their performance.

Senator FARRELL
 (South Australia) (15:28):  I rise to take note of answers given by Senator Ronaldson—or, more precisely, non-answers given by Senator Ronaldson. I asked Senator Ronaldson a very simple question that related to his portfolio of Veterans' Affairs. That question was: given that he had set up a consultation period with respect to Veterans' Access Network, which offices is he proposing to close? It was a very simple question. You could not make it much more simple than that.




Senator Abetz:
  We would expect nothing more from you.




Senator FARRELL:
  Senator Abetz, I do like to reduce things to simple propositions, and it was a very simple proposition that I put to Senator Ronaldson. I asked him which of the Veterans Access Network offices he was planning to close. He said he had set up a so-called consultation process and had identified a number of places which potentially would be subject to closure: Bairnsdale, Morwell, Ballarat, Franklin, all in Victoria, and Wollongong and Gosford in New South Wales. This was a very simple question and it could easily have been answered. But the person occupying the chair at question time had to twice refer Senator Ronaldson to the question; and, despite that, we did not get an answer. Senator Ronaldson talked about lots of other things but not about the question I asked. The question I asked was a very simple one: what are you intending to do with these offices?


I think we are entitled to draw certain conclusions from Senator Ronaldson's refusal to answer the question, including that he does intend to close one or more of these offices. Why would you do that? These are services that we provide to our veterans. It is often the older veterans and sometimes the war widows who access these services. Senator Ronaldson's idea is that you force these people onto the internet. These people may not want to use the internet to access information. They might like to have a face-to-face conversation with somebody so that they can put their questions to them and get a straight answer. It is a little bit like Senator Ronaldson: he could not give us a straight answer to his question. But there are lots of veterans and war widows out there who would like a straight answer.


I think there is a pattern of behaviour here. The opposition has totally supported the government's move today to introduce fair indexation for particular superannuants. But we have asked the question: how is the government going to pay for it? I think we are starting to see the answer. I can see on my side that Senator McEwen and Senator Brown are nodding. I think we are starting to get the answer as to how this government is going to pay for those benefits. Senator Ronaldson was very critical of the Labor Party for not initially supporting his bill in 2011. But who was the most vocal advocate against it? It was former Senator Minchin, from South Australia. He totally opposed the payment of the money.


Labor has supported this, and the Greens have supported it, but how are the government going to pay for it? I think we are starting to see the answer to that question. They are going to pay for it by closing offices of the Veterans Access Network. They are going to pay for it by taking money out of the pockets of war veterans. And from where else are they going to find the money to pay for it? This will be a $6.2 billion debt going into the future. I think we are starting to find out exactly how the government are going to claw back that money. They are going to claw it back from orphans, they are going to claw it back from— (Time expired)

 (Tasmania—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture) (15:39):  I present the government's response to the 128th report of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties on its inquiry into the Treaties Ratification Bill 2012. In accordance with the usual practice, I seek leave to incorporate the document in Hansard.


Leave granted.




The document read as follows—





Australian Government response to the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties' report:


Report 128





Inquiry into the Treaties Ratification Bill 2012



March 2014




Recommendation 1: That prior to commencing negotiations for a new agreement, the Government table in Parliament a document setting out its priorities and objectives including the anticipated costs and benefits of the agreement.



The Government does not accept this recommendation.


The powers to negotiate and enter into treaties are executive powers within section 61 of the Australian Constitution. Accordingly, formal responsibility for treaty making and negotiation lies with the Executive. The Government nevertheless considers that the Parliament has a significant role in scrutinising treaties prior to binding treaty action being taken and in passing legislation to give effect to them where necessary. The Joint Standing Committee on Treaties (JSCOT) plays an important part in fulfilling Parliament's role in this respect. The Government remains of the view that its capacity to effectively pursue the national interest while allowing for appropriate public consultation is best met by current parliamentary and consultation processes.


The Government currently provides information about treaties under consideration or negotiation in a variety of ways. The nature and extent of public consultation is determined by the scope and importance of the proposed treaty and can include statements to the Parliament, press releases, information published on agency websites, calls for public submissions and face-to-face consultations with industry and civil society representatives. The purpose of such consultations is to inform the public about the Government's priorities and objectives and to afford an opportunity for comment. In addition, regular consultations are conducted with the States and Territories through the Standing Committee on Treaties.


Notwithstanding its commitment to stakeholder consultation, the Government is constrained in what it can disclose about prospective and ongoing treaty negotiations. Making detailed information about Australia's negotiating position publicly available prior to the commencement of negotiations would limit Australia's room for manoeuvre in the negotiations. Adopting the Committee's recommendation could circumscribe the capacity of Australia's negotiators to secure the best possible outcomes for Australia in the treaty negotiations.


Any statement of negotiating priorities and objectives made at the outset of treaty negotiations would be of limited value in assessing the eventual treaty outcomes. Negotiating priorities commonly develop over the course of negotiations, and eventual treaty outcomes reflect compromises acceptable to all Parties. While negotiators operate within defined parameters, it is generally not possible to predict accurately the full range of commitments which will be incorporated into the final agreement until negotiations are concluded. Similarly, any advance assessment of costs and benefits would necessarily be based on a range of assumptions which may or may not prove correct. The Government considers the current practice of tabling treaties after they are concluded enables the Parliament to make a more meaningful assessment of their impact on the national interest, based on the actual rights and obligations they contain.


Treaties do not become legally binding on Australia until the Government formally undertakes to perform the obligations set out in the treaty by taking binding treaty action (ratification, acceptance, approval or other formal mechanism provided for in the treaty). Until binding treaty action is taken, Australia is only obliged to refrain from acts which would defeat the object and purpose of the treaty1. Other than in exceptional circumstances, the Government does not take binding treaty action, or introduce legislation to give legal effect to treaty provisions in Australia, until after JSCOT has reviewed and reported on the treaty and its advice has been advice taken into account. Existing treaty tabling arrangements therefore afford ample opportunity for the Parliament to express its views on treaties well before a final decision is made on whether they become binding on Australia.


The Government notes Recommendation 1 does not state how the Parliament would conduct an assessment of proposed treaty negotiations. If it is intended that JSCOT enquire into and report on proposed treaty negotiations prior to their commencement, this could delay the start of negotiations and further impinge on the Government's negotiating flexibility. The Government further notes the recommendation does not make any allowance for urgent or sensitive treaties. Finally, adding another step to the treaty process would have resource implications for the responsible agencies, which the Government does not consider to be justified.




Recommendation 2: That the 
Treaties Ratification Bill 2012
 not be passed by the House of Representatives or the Senate.



The Government notes that this is a decision for the Parliament.

The Government considers the current practice of tabling treaties after they are concluded enables the Parliament to make a more meaningful assessment of their impact on the national interest, based on the actual rights and obligations they contain.


Treaties do not become legally binding on Australia until the Government formally undertakes to perform the obligations set out in the treaty by taking binding treaty action (ratification, acceptance, approval or other formal mechanism provided for in the treaty). Until binding treaty action is taken, Australia is only obliged to refrain from acts which would defeat the object and purpose of the treaty1. Other than in exceptional circumstances, the Government does not take binding treaty action, or introduce legislation to give legal effect to treaty provisions in Australia, until after JSCOT has reviewed and reported on the treaty and its advice has been advice taken into account. Existing treaty tabling arrangements therefore afford ample opportunity for the Parliament to express its views on treaties well before a final decision is made on whether they become binding on Australia.


The Government notes Recommendation 1 does not state how the Parliament would conduct an assessment of proposed treaty negotiations. If it is intended that JSCOT enquire into and report on proposed treaty negotiations prior to their commencement, this could delay the start of negotiations and further impinge on the Government's negotiating flexibility. The Government further notes the recommendation does not make any allowance for urgent or sensitive treaties. Finally, adding another step to the treaty process would have resource implications for the responsible agencies, which the Government does not consider to be justified.




Recommendation 2: That the 
Treaties Ratification Bill 2012
 not be passed by the House of Representatives or the Senate.



The Government notes that this is a decision for the Parliament.

Senator MADIGAN
 (Victoria) (16:55):  I, and also on behalf of Senator Xenophon, move:


That the Senate calls on the Government to alter Commonwealth procurement policy in order to require all government departments to only use Australian made products where possible, and, in particular, paper products.


I am pleased to speak on this important topic today. It has been more than two years since I took my seat in this place. As a tradesman, a boilermaker and a blacksmith, it is fair to say that I look at things differently to most others here. I believe my background gives me empathy and common ground with our manufacturing sector—a sector which I believe has been ignored by this place for far too long.


It should be with a sense of pride that all parliamentarians and all Australians view this building. This is one place that should be showcasing the very best Australia has to offer. It would not even cross the minds of Australians that the national symbol on top of the Australian parliament in the nation's capital was made anywhere but in this country. However, the Department of Parliamentary Services, acting under Commonwealth procurement guidelines, cannot even guarantee our flag on top of this building would be made in Australia. It is not just unfortunate that our coat of arms is emblazoned on coffee cups, plates and glasses that are made in China, the UAE or elsewhere; it is a real slap in the face of our manufacturers in this country who have the skills and knowhow to make these items here.


As many of you may know, Senator Xenophon and I took steps to ensure that at least some Australian-made products were represented in the parliament. We took it upon ourselves to purchase a 120-place setting—750 pieces of Australian-made crockery to stock the Members' Guests Dining Room. Two Victorian manufacturers made the plates and delivered them to my office here at Parliament House, and there the boxes sat. It was only after intense media pressure that the Department of Parliamentary Services accepted our gift. Since the boxes of plates were moved from my office to the office of DPS, they have disappeared, I fear into a bureaucratic black hole—the rabbit warren of unaccountability. They have not been seen in the dining room to date, so where are they?


Australian government procurement goes far beyond cups, plates and bowls in the dining room. The Commonwealth is a huge consumer of products. Everything from tissues to office chairs and copy paper in offices through to uniforms, food and fighter jets for our defence personnel is an opportunity for Australian manufacturers to supply a need. Since taking my seat, I have had the opportunity to meet with a multitude of manufacturers across my home state of Victoria and across the country. I know Australian manufacturers are amongst the best in the world. They have to be to have survived in a country that has not supported them. I have met workers from everywhere: from Gold Acres in Ballarat to Flip Screen in Wagga Wagga, Rossi Boots in Adelaide, Baum Cycles in Geelong, Brobo Waldown in Dandenong, Parken Drills in Clayton in Victoria and Molnar Hoists in Adelaide. All these firms and their workers have one message for the government: they just want a fair go.


On 14 November 2013, Senator Xenophon and I referred a motion relating to Commonwealth procurement to the Finance and Public Administration References Committee for report. In my speech today, I would like to concentrate on a line from that motion: 'the economic, social and environmental benefits of utilising Australian goods and services.' Over the Christmas break almost 50 submissions were received. Many of the submissions highlighted the need for our government to consider not just the bottom-line dollar value but the real benefits of buying Australian made.


The submissions confirm what I have said all along. No imported manufactured goods can compare when you consider the economic, social and environmental benefits of buying Australian made. It is not rocket science. Australian manufacturers are the custodians of all that makes this country great. Australian manufacturers are an integral part of Australia. They contribute to their families and their friends who make up the Australian community, they care for the environment in which they live and they care about the economy which they support and which supports them.


I can talk in broad brush strokes about the benefits of supporting our country, but let me give you an example of one product, the people who make it and how buying from our manufacturers supports our country. That product is paper. In the Australian Forest Products Association submission to the inquiry, they gave us the statistics on paper. Annually, the Australian government purchases approximately 6½ thousand tonnes of copy paper, uses an estimated 50,000 to 60,000 tonnes of paper for external printing of publications, pamphlets, forms, brochures and envelopes and purchases around $100 million worth of tissue paper. Buying paper made in Australia means we are supporting not only companies that pay tax and employ Australians but also a product that complies with Australian standards. Supporting our own companies means that social, environmental and economic benefits stay in our country.


The Australian Forest Products Association made the case better than I could ever do in their submission to the Commonwealth procurement inquiry. They said:


… Australian Paper is the largest private employer in Victoria's Latrobe Valley, and contributes more than $750 million annually to Australia's GDP and supports over 5,900 flow-on full time jobs. The construction of Australia's only de-inked recycled paper plant at the Australian Paper Maryvale mill is also supporting 950 direct and indirect jobs during construction and around 250 new jobs ongoing, as well as contributing $160 million in value to the economy. This project will produce 50000 tonnes of recycled pulp each year, diverting up to 85000 tonnes of wastepaper that would otherwise end up in landfill.


That is socially, economically and environmentally responsible. With good news like that, you would think it would be hard to find anyone who does not value the industry for all the good work it does. However, you only have to look as far as our own government departments to see how short-sighted our government is being.


When AFPA consulted the Australian government procurement coordinator, they discovered that, of the 84 copy paper products sourced under the whole-of-government stationery and office supply arrangements, only 45 per cent of the products were sourced from Australia. Let me put that in different words: less than half of government paper products come from Australia. Forty-five per cent comes from Australia, 36 per cent comes from Europe and 19 per cent of our paper products come from Asia. If the company Australia Paper can so vitally support workers in the Latrobe Valley when they are competing with other Australian paper mills for less than half of the total federal government pie, imagine the social, economic and environmental benefits the country could be experiencing if 60, 80 or 100 per cent of government paper products were purchased in Australia.


During the public hearing held on 21 March Mr Ross Hampton, chief executive officer of AFPA, said:


Firstly, it is important to acknowledge the economic, social and environmental benefits of utilising Australian paper products. The Australian paper industry directly employs 15,000 people in both outer metropolitan and, importantly, regional areas and supports a further 22,000 indirect jobs. A sales turnover for the sector averages around $9.6 billion per year and the wood and paper products industry collectively represents about five per cent of the total manufacturing value added in this country.


The Australian government annually purchases up to 6½ thousand tonnes of copy paper, and by some estimates—this is important—a further 50,000 to 60,000 tonnes of paper is used for external printing and that sort of thing. Purchasing decisions therefore by the Australian government consequently have a direct impact on national, economic and social benefits.


Let me repeat that last line:


Purchasing decisions therefore by the Australian government consequently have a direct impact on national, economic and social benefits.


Our manufacturers and our industries recognise the positive flow-on effects of buying Australian made. These effects include greater employment, more tax paid to the government and better environmental outcomes. Australian manufacturers deserve a government that puts the interests of our country first. It is dangerous to view procurement through the narrow lens of value for money alone.


Our procurement policy needs to take into account the social, economic and environmental effects of buying in Australia from Australian companies that manufacture in Australia. If we save a few dollars bringing in paper from Asia and use that paper to print welfare cheques for people in the Latrobe Valley, how is that value for money? If we save a few dollars by importing the Australian flag for the top of this building while watching our own flag makers go out of business, how is this value for money? If we save a few dollars by importing crockery from China for Parliament House, putting our own crockery makers into the dole queue, how is that value for money? And if we save a few dollars by sourcing 250 drills from China—as was done recently for our defence forces—instead of buying them from one of our own drill manufacturers, how is this value for money? This last purchase, if Australian-made, would have ticked all the boxes socially and economically—to say nothing of the skills that would have been boosted and kept in Australia.


I will finish my speech today by reminding everyone in the chamber exactly why we are here. We politicians are elected to represent the people of this country. Politicians are elected to represent the interests of the people who elect them. We are not elected by the people of other countries, nor are we elected by foreign corporations. Thank you.

"Colbeck, Sen Richard",LP,2014-03-27,"



Senator COLBECK
 (Tasmania—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture) (17:08):  I rise to make my contribution to the motion of Senator Madigan and Senator Xenophon in respect of procurement in Australia. Noting that time is short for this debate, I will keep my remarks to a time limit so that others do have the opportunity to contribute to the debate. It is an important debate and, at the outset, I acknowledge the passion that Senator Madigan and Senator Xenophon have for Australian manufacturing and Australian businesses. It is important.


We in this government also have a responsibility in respect of procurement to get value for money. Value for money does not necessarily mean the lowest price and there are a range of inputs in our procurement policy, which is available to the community on the Department of Finance website. It does consider a range of things. But every dollar we spend more on products that we do not need to spend on particular items or products is more money we have to raise from Australian taxpayers. We are not spending government money; this is taxpayers' money we are spending and taxpayers' money we are dealing with.


The best way a government can assist Australian industry and business is to ensure that the economic fundamentals are strong, that we do not overburden industry with unnecessary tax and unnecessary red tape, that we do make sure that they are competitive in what is a global market. Australia is a trading nation and, I must say, Australian industry and Australian business does not just rely on the Australian market. That is a really important point to consider. To trade out, we need to be prepared to trade back in. If we want to send product overseas and into those broader markets—and that should be our aim—then we need to be prepared to accept product coming back the other way. To be competitive in that global market and on that global stage, we need to ensure that the economic fundamentals in this country are right. 


Doing things like reducing red and green tape, which this government is doing, is important. Doing things like removing the carbon tax is absolutely vital. If you look at the paper industry, where 30 per cent of the cost of a piece of paper is energy, the impact of the carbon tax on the paper manufacturing sector is quite significant. It is one of the sectors of the economy that was most significantly impacted. When you look at the performance of the previous government, which basically saw a complete decay of the paper industry in this country, you can see the impact of their policy. You can see the fact that, despite the rhetoric that was delivered, the impact of Labor Party policy over the last six years has been very, very detrimental to the paper industry in particular. 


I know the concerns of the paper industry, because I have seen the demise of two paper manufacturing plants in my home state, one in Burnie and one in Devonport. And while that process was going on, the previous administration completely and utterly did it. When Australian Paper made the announcement in 2009 that they were going to review the operations of the two plants in Tasmania, the then minister and the local member decided that they would get the local mayors and industry in to talk to them. 


The minister at the time would not come to Tasmania; industry had to go to him in Melbourne. So on 6 March the five local mayors met in Melbourne. On that day and following that meeting, the minister—Minister Carr in fact at the time—announced that there would be an Industry Strategy Group established with the minister stating that the final report would be completed in June of that year, and that the strategy group would run in parallel with the company review, which was intended to be completed by the end of June.


The unfortunate thing is that the review was not even completed by December of that year and the company had already made the decision to close. So the information that was supposed to come out of the government's process was not available to the company. It is a clear demonstration that the policies of the Labor Party during the last election, including procurement policy, have not assisted industry despite taxpayers' funds being invested in the plant that Senator Madigan talked about in Tasmania for the development of the recycling plant—which is due to open very soon. I am sure that the people at the Maryvale mill are looking forward to that advancement and the company are as well. 


The ICT regulations put in place by the previous government almost specify that business out of procurement. It really is very, very difficult and unfortunate that the economy has been left in such a mess by the previous government. The paper industry in particular has suffered very badly. And what did make it worse was the combination of the Labor Party and the Greens—the Greens who have done everything they can to destroy the forest industry in Australia with continued protest, continued campaigns. The work of the Labor Party in conjunction with the Greens, particularly during the last three years, has been quite devastating for the forest industry. And given that the forest industry is the base that provides the resource for the paper industry in Australia, that is very, very difficult.


But it is important that we receive value for money for Australian taxpayers out of Australian government procurement. As I said earlier, we are a trading nation and we need to ensure that trade is facilitated. If business is going to survive in the global market, it needs to be able to compete and work in the global market. So getting the fundamentals right, removing unnecessary tax and regulation, is a very, very important part. As Bill Clinton said when he was seeking the presidency, 'It's the economy, stupid.' We need to ensure that our business and our industry are capable of competing in the global market. We are operating in a global economy now. We cannot step off—




Senator Farrell:
  Why did you let Holden collapse? Why did you let Toyota leave?




Senator COLBECK:
  Senator, if you were listening to what I was just talking about, we need to be exporting, we need to be operating in a global economy and we need to be able to compete. I am happy to take your interjection, Senator Farrell, because what your government did not do was encourage industry to compete in the global market. They did not set a strategy where they looked out rather than looking in. And that is what we need to encourage our industry to do, because that is what is going to allow them to grow. If they want to just rely on the Australian market, that is going to limit their capacity. We need to be putting the economic fundamentals in place so that our businesses can compete in both the Australian and the international markets. And there are huge opportunities for us to do that.


If you look at the food industry and what has happened to it in recent years—and I know Senator Xenophon and Senator Madigan are vitally interested in that sector—there is the opportunity for it to look out of Australia. There is the opportunity for it to look out at the emerging markets in our region, where the quality of our product is recognised, the safety of our product is recognised and there is a market at a premium price for us as well. So we need to be working with our industries on a strategy that provides them with a competitive base in the Australian market, but which also provides them with a competitive base in the international market. That is the opportunity for these industries to grow. It is not by trying to confine themselves to the Australian market; it is not by the Australian government buying from just one place, because we also have trade obligations that we must meet.


We have done deals to say that we will be an open trading economy, but what that means is that we need to get the fundamentals right for our industries so that they can play and complete. And that goes right across the economy. Senator Madigan sat with me on the Senate select committee into the food processing sector. We looked right across that industry. The issues are all the same: we need the industrial relations settings right, we need the taxation settings right, we need the education settings right to provide skills for employed people and we need the innovation sector to be working as part of that process too.


Yes, government should, where it can, in accordance with its procurement guidelines and getting value for money for taxpayers, buy Australian product, but we need to ensure that it is done on fair and reasonable terms because that is what our industries and our businesses expect when they export overseas. So it is a two-way street. I understand the passion that both senators have in bringing this motion to the chamber, and I respect that passion for their local manufacturing industries and businesses. I know that senators across the chamber support their local businesses where they can. I always buy Australian paper for my office; it is a value decision I have made. It is important that we all continue to do that too. I will cut my comments short so that other senators can make a contribution to the debate.

"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2014-03-27,"



Senator LUNDY
 (Australian Capital Territory) (17:19):  The Labor Party has a strong and proud record of supporting Australian businesses, and this has extended to the supporting of Australian businesses, in particular small- to medium-enterprises, through procurement policy. This support has been reflected through the genuine initiatives that Labor governments have established to support Australian business. For example, in 2013 the Labor government acknowledged certain barriers faced by Australian suppliers and established the requirement for Australian industry participation plans. The AIP plans require bidders for major tenders exceeding $20 million to develop plans that set out how they will offer opportunities for capable Australian suppliers of goods and services. This approach sought to assist Australian industry to gain a foothold in major projects and tenders by encouraging industry to innovate, develop competitive capability and take advantage of investment opportunities.


The Australian industry participation plans also acknowledge that in many cases the supply chains involving very large corporations often were preset, and therefore served as a systemic barrier for Australian businesses seeking work in that particular sector. It was a very tangible response to an entrenched problem, and on the larger scale reflected a lot of the barriers that small businesses face in other areas of procurement.


The Australian industry participation plans in that regard are supported by the supplier advocates program. This was also established by the Labor government and was a direct response to the issue of systemic barriers facing small Australian companies seeking to compete in a very competitive procurement environment. Supplier advocates play a strategic role and provide leadership to improve the capability of Australian industry and suppliers to win project work—not just in government procurement contracts but also in large private sector contracts. Work of the supplier advocates could include coordinating opportunities for companies to showcase their capabilities and products to government, and promoting supply chain activity.


I am most familiar with the information and communications technology supplier advocate. For many years, particularly during the previous coalition government under Prime Minister Howard, there were a series of moves early in the period of that government—and, yes, we are talking some 16 to 18 years ago now—that undid the systems that were in place to promote SME involvement in ICT government contracts. Looking at the role of the IT Supplier Advocate now, the very fine work of Mr Don Easter, who has performed the role admirably, there have been a number of challenges to take on—in particular, mitigating the risk that is perceived to be associated with engaging an SME in the ICT space. Indeed, risk management and helping small businesses understand risk management in the context of tendering for government contracts has been a key part of his work. 


Another area that presented a systemic blockage for companies was the level of professional indemnity insurance and public liability insurance. Some time ago it was evident that often these insurances not only were required far beyond the value of the contract but were not commensurate with the work being performed. Thanks to Don's work and the advocacy of the Australian Information Industries Association and others, these have been brought more into line so that the requirements for the appropriate levels of insurance, both professional indemnity and public liability, reflect the risk associated with the given contract.


Another area of systemic challenge, I suppose you would call it, for small businesses was in the scope and scale of the tender documentation. In many cases, particularly for new entrants to the government procurement market, the scope and scale of the tender documents again went well beyond the work required. The effect was that companies tendering for work had to have a far broader capability than was required to respond to a particular tender that may in some cases be quite narrow. This had the effect of ensuring that all the work was funnelled towards the companies that were already in that marketplace. Many Australian companies, particularly in the ICT sector, who were new and innovative, doing things in a very different way and challenging the standard practices perhaps with some very economic solutions, often found it very difficult to compete as their tenders were not able to be compared on the basis of apples with apples. Because they did not fulfil the scope and scale preconditions, they found themselves excluded from the process.


Many of these challenges require constant attention and many require the education of both the small businesses themselves but, equally, the departments and agencies seeking to procure innovative ICT solutions. I should add here that these issues are not peculiar to ICT. The characteristics and the nature of these challenges extend in one way or the other, or in one characteristic or another, to many of our small business sectors seeking to get that elusive government work.


Before I go on to other issues relating specifically to procurement I think it is worthwhile underscoring why procurement is so important to many Australian companies. Australian companies see a government contract as an export credential. Indeed, because the Australian government is seen as a high-standard procurer, that means that an Australian company having a contract with the Australian government is seen as an enormously important credential when that company is seeking work internationally. So for many years now I have talked about government contracts as being an export credential for many of our small businesses. Often the first question an ICT company is asked overseas is: do you have any of your own government's contracts? If the answer is yes then that establishes that company in a good position. But if the answer is no then the question that is always asked is: why isn't your own government trusting the goods and services that you are supplying? In this way the importance of fair and equitable access to the Australian government procurement market is elevated if we are serious about supporting our small businesses in being able to operate and participate in the international marketplace—but I digress.


The Labor government also acted in the interests of emerging business by making exemptions to mandatory requirements of the Commonwealth Procurement Guidelines to allow direct sourcing from small to medium enterprises that are either Indigenous owned or that primarily exist to provide the services to people with a disability. The Labor government announced during the election campaign that we would move to ensure all Commonwealth government fleets were 100 per cent Australian owned. This strong and proud record of supporting Australian businesses while in government plays out in the latest statistics provided by the Department of Finance for 2012-13, which show that over 82 per cent or $32 billion out of over $39 billion in Australian government contracts for goods and services were Australian sourced or delivered.


I would now like to speak about the Commonwealth procurement policy itself. The Australian government Procurement Framework operates on a non-discriminatory basis and, as we have already heard, has achieving value for money as the core rule. Indeed, all potential suppliers are supposed to be treated equitably and not discriminated against due to size, ownership or location. The procurement policy aims to strike a sensible balance between non-discriminatory procurement principles and strong support for Australian businesses to supply goods and services to government.


The issue of Australian made goods and services and government procurement is, as we have also heard from Senator Madigan, the subject of a reference currently being heard by the Senate Finance and Public Administration References Committee, which is due to report on 30 June 2014. I am very proud to chair that committee and I would like to reflect a little on a couple of the submissions that have been presented to that committee, as it is of relevance to the motion we have before us.


The paper industry is a significant industry and my colleagues have rightly included reference directly to it in the motion we are discussing today, given the significance to government procurement and that industry. As a brief aside, I note that, according to evidence presented to the Senate references inquiry, the Australian government annually purchases up to 6½ thousand tonnes, or $13 million worth of copy paper. Additionally, by some estimates, there is a further 50,000 to 60,000 tonnes, or $117 million worth, of paper used by government agencies in external printing and publications. The evidence also suggests that, by the best estimates, the Australian government uses approximately $100 million worth of tissue paper per annum. 


It is from this lens of the paper industry where we perhaps see the clear interaction of government procurement policy per se with other elements of government policy. I would like to evoke two in particular: the ICT Sustainability Plan and the National Waste Policy. The procurement rules refer to issues of environmental sustainability and other non-financial considerations in relation to the concept of 'value for money'. The National Waste Policy, for example, aims to avoid the generation of waste; reduce the amount of waste for disposal; manage waste as a resource; and ensure that waste disposal, recovery and reuse is undertaken in an environmentally sound manner. The ICT Sustainability Plan, for example, mandates a minimum of 50 per cent recycled copy paper for Financial Management Act agencies on the basis of improved waste management outcomes. Australian Paper noted in their submission to the current inquiry: 


Imported recycled paper which only delivers waste reduction outcomes for the country from which it originates cannot deliver the same benefits as locally made recycled paper.


And:


The local landfill benefits of Australian made recycled paper will deliver enhanced environmental benefits for Australia over imported recycled papers which also have a much larger transport footprint based on shipping from their country of origin. 


On the basis of these complementary policies requiring procurement decisions to be framed around inherent environmental and other non-financial considerations, the committee heard from Australian Paper that, in their view, the policies and frameworks in place that could automatically promote the use of Australian made goods and services, particularly paper, in government agencies specifically could be achieved if the:


Commonwealth Government more broadly assess and enforce recognition of the economic, social and environmental values of all aspects of the Government's paper and printing services procurement decisions ...


The issue in their view was one of implementation. The Australian Forests Products Association further noted:


… there is a lack of robust risk assessment tools and due diligence for the adequate consideration of sustainability issues. 


This point of lack of transparency in procurement was also acknowledged in evidence provided to the committee by the Australian National Audit Office. It is clear that guidelines are required to help guide all officials who are making procurement decisions and an enforcement role is needed to make sure the policies in place are applied appropriately. We heard evidence presented that there are limits to procurement in relation to international obligations from free-trade agreements, including in particular the Australia-United States Free Trade Agreement. These agreements include obligations for the government to open our procurement market to international suppliers and that international procurement markets are open to Australian suppliers. These obligations also limit the ability to preference local suppliers in procurement. 


So we operate in a framework informed by international constraints. However, we do have a framework that still has resulted in significant support for Australian businesses in Commonwealth procurement. So we have a framework that we know functions well. The significance of the complaint being put forward by Australian Paper, in my mind at least, is in part that these associated policies—that is, the National Waste Policy and the ICT Sustainability Plan, are not complied with equal or appropriate weight in informing the decisions guided by the procurement rules. It is these issues which inform our ongoing consideration in our very important inquiry into Commonwealth procurement procedures.

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",Ind.,2014-03-27,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (17:35):  I welcome the opportunity to speak on the seemingly complex and vexed issue of the Australian government's procurement process and how it serves—or rather, does not serve—the Australian people. I say 'seemingly complex and vexed' because it shouldn't be that hard to do the right thing by Australian manufacturers and Australian jobs. This is why I have been so pleased to work with Senator Madigan on this inquiry. We have co-sponsored this motion and I pay tribute to Senator Madigan for the work that he has done in initiating this. 


Senator Madigan and I helped to set up an inquiry into the process because we are concerned that the procurement processes do not serve the interests of the Australian people—surely the first and foremost task of any government. In my home state of South Australia the Hon. John Darley MLC, a member of the legislative council, re-elected with my full backing and endorsement at the recent South Australian election, has also worked on issues of procurement. Recently we worked on issues with respect to office supplies procurement, where the South Australian government, I think, made some fundamental mistakes that discriminated against local suppliers.


Some might recall our repeated attempts to have the Parliament House dining room supplied with fine Australian-made crockery. Senator Madigan and I even sourced an extensive set made here in Australia at our own expense. The crockery succeeded in making the news but unfortunately has yet to see the inside of the Members' Guests Dining Room. In fact, as Senator Madigan said, the status and whereabouts of the crockery set are unknown. The parliament took it but is not using it. What a waste.


The Senate Finance and Public Administration References Committee inquiry has heard a range of views so far, and I have been impressed by the level of engagement with the issue, especially from Australian industry and union representatives. Submissions have also been received from several Commonwealth departments, as well as academic lawyers concerned that Australia should not break its free trade agreements by 'discriminating' against foreign suppliers. I will say more on that later.


Commonwealth procurement policy intersects with our relations with free trade partners, our region and our status in the World Trade Organization, but it also has a massive impact on the Australian economy and almost all local industries. It is hard to find a sector of the local economy that is not impacted by Commonwealth procurement. Australian government procurement is estimated at $41 billion a year. It is 10 per cent of the Commonwealth budget and accounts for 2.5 per cent of the national economy. As one witness at the inquiry said, 'Australian government procurement is equivalent in turnover to Australia's entire hotel and restaurant sector.' So we are not talking about a sideshow here; for many sectors and industries in Australia it is the main show in town.


Yet Australia has a reputation internationally of taking a narrow view of its options in relation to procurement. A narrow and short-term view of so-called best value for money and a black-letter interpretation of our free trade obligations have come to dominate the thinking of this government and the previous government. Unfortunately, the word is spreading. A few years ago I had a conversation with Michael O'Connor, the national secretary of the CFMEU, in relation to issues of dumping, and he recounted to me a comment passed by a Scandinavian at a timber industry forum in Scandinavia a few years back. No sooner had Mr O'Connor introduced himself and said he was from Australia than the Scandinavian official laughed and said, 'You're from Australia? You are the free trade Taliban,' because Australia takes a fundamentalist, literalist and purist approach to free trade that no other country in the world does. We are being mugs. It marks us out as extremists, naive at best and at worst ideologues without the spark to know our best interests.


I believe it is the role of senators and political leaders in general to determine what our policy should be in the future. We cannot bury our heads in the sand and mutter the tired old slogans of the past. As has been written, the past is another country. We must be concerned about Australia's future and how Australia's manufacturers and producers can prosper while fitting into the world economy. There can be no place for ideology or fixed dogma on an issue that directly affects the livelihoods of so many. There is serious work to do both within the inquiry and outside it, informing a debate about how the Commonwealth can lead the way.


Senator Madigan has strong and, in my view, well-considered opinions on this, and I share them. His links to the people of Victoria's manufacturing base are strong. He was onto something last week in the inquiry which resonated with me very much when he picked up on the issue of Commonwealth procurement and the so-called ban on 'discrimination' against foreign suppliers. Senator Madigan said:


The government procurement policy says they are not allowed to discriminate against a foreign product in procurement. Other countries might use the term 'discernment' as to what they purchase. So in our case here in Australia the word 'discriminate' replaces 'being discerning' in how we practise procurement.


This surely is a call for a return to a wider application of national interest in procurement and a wider definition of value for money—one that takes into consideration the longer term and wider benefits as well as the true cost of engaging foreign suppliers.


In terms of value for money, let us put this in perspective. If we buy some drill bits from another country which might be 40 or 50 per cent cheaper but only last a tenth as long as Australian-made drill bits—and Senator Madigan, as a practising blacksmith, has a lot of experience in these sorts of issues, and I believe him—then where is the value for money? It is a superficial approach in terms of durability. We need to look very closely at what so-called value for money means in the context of Commonwealth procurement policies. We need to make sure that, if we are buying something that is seemingly cheaper, it does not mean that it will last for a fraction of the time of an Australian-made product.


A straight price comparison between an Australian product and one from overseas does not tell the full story—not by a long shot. The value to Australia of sourcing native goods starts with the initial purchase and then keeps on going. It includes security of employment, higher standards of manufacturing, confidence that minimum environmental, social and employment conditions have been met, and the multiplier effect of government money fanning out throughout the Australian economy. By comparison, $1 spent on a foreign-source product appears to leave the country immediately.


This is critical stuff. Why? Because in my home state of South Australia we have seen the demise of General Motors Holden, a great tragedy for our state. That will mean thousands of jobs are potentially on the line in the whole supply base—the automotive component manufacturers, who are really state of the art and cutting edge. If they are to have any chance of surviving in the longer term, we need to lead by example in Commonwealth procurement policy so that they can have a fighting chance of expanding their markets or developing new markets.


The inquiry heard that the standards by which overseas products were made—be they employment conditions, product standards or environmental safeguards—were generally not checked or even checkable by our government. The inquiry heard detailed evidence from paper manufacturers and their industry representatives, as well as paper consumers from government departments. We are not talking about a few reams of copy paper here. The Australian government uses about 600,000 tonnes of paper a year across more than 20 Commonwealth departments and agencies. Only two departments, Defence and Human Services, sourced Australian paper, we heard. Admittedly, due to the size of these departments, Australian paper makes up 57 per cent of the total, but the question has to be asked: why doesn't it make up 100 per cent of the total?


It appears from evidence to the inquiry that when purchasing paper made in Indonesia, Germany or Austria—which we do—there is no way of checking the supplier's pledge that it is made from 50 per cent recycled sources and does not use, for instance, rainforest timber. The Australian Tax Office purchases paper from Indonesia stamped '50 per cent recycled'. One would hope the label is true, because Indonesia is fast running out of its old growth rainforests. And that has something to do with orangutan habitats, palm oil and other related issues. I could go on about that, but I am already banned from Malaysia and I do not necessarily want to be banned from Indonesia anytime soon.


Australia's Forest Products Association is rightly frustrated. Its CEO, Ross Hampton, told the inquiry:


As far as our departments are asked to look, that is the point. They have a list and they click on a box that says that it is 50 per cent recycled, they tick it and they move on and then they are into lowest price.


He went on to say: 


It goes to the heart of what we are talking about, because no-one does look further than the label at the moment. That is what happening. You get the label and it says '50 per cent recycled—tick'.


But who can blame the government for taking overseas labels at face value? It clearly could not afford to send investigators to all corners of the world to verify the claims made by foreign manufacturers in order to win supply contracts. Nor could it; that would be insane. So we are left with the so-called relative sanity of taking environmental and other labels at face value.


We heard at the inquiry just last Friday that you can just buy a rubber stamp for $10 and stamp the product as certified, or environmentally friendly or whatever standards it is supposed to meet. We, in another country, have no way of checking that. We need to insist on having almost an onus of proof on overseas suppliers that they are complying. There must be a more rigorous standard rather than us having to go and check whether they comply. We are told, though, that to do this could be discriminatory—and discrimination would breach Commonwealth procurement policy as well as our various free trade deals. To use Senator Madigan's words, we are not being discerning—and we need to be discerning. Applied across the width and breadth of our $4 billion procurement program, this view hobbles our national interest. We do not hear the rest of the world complaining much, do we? In short, we are being taken for mugs.


A similar point can be made about furniture manufacturing standards and the various environmental and employment standards met by local companies. In my home state of South Australia, Molnar Hoists, in Adelaide, ticks off on all the categories—safety; reliability; spare parts; social, economic and environmental factors; and a better resale value. So why do they have to compete on such an unlevel playing field? This issue has much in common with Australia's poor record on dumped imports. The much-vaunted 'level playing field' does not exist for many Australian manufacturers and producers, given the difficulty of lodging an action against dumping and the stance taken by the Commonwealth on matters of international trade. There have been improvements, and I acknowledge the work that was done by the former government in relation to that. They needed to go much further, but I am grateful for some of those changes. I urge the government to take the changes even further and give that support to small and medium sized manufacturers.


The case involving South Australian tissue paper producer Kimberly-Clark and dumped goods from China and Indonesia is telling. The case led me to introduce a private senator's bill—the Customs Amendment (Anti-dumping) Bill in 2010. In the case of Kimberly-Clark the government imposed dumping duties on Chinese and Indonesian tissue products in 2008 after investigations found that Chinese products were being sold at two to 25 per cent below the cost in its domestic market, while Indonesian toilet paper was found to have been dumped at 33 to 45 per cent below value. But this decision was overruled in 2009 following a review by the Trade Measures Branch of Australian Customs, which determined that there was 'no material injury' to Australian manufacturing as a result of these dumped imports. Many saw that as a bizarre decision that was not in the national interest, that was not fair, and that did not even stick to the letter or spirit of the WTO.


I believe that we need to reform our antidumping laws, which in turn will impact on our Commonwealth procurement policies. The Kimberly-Clark case highlights my ongoing concerns about an absence of fair treatment from the Commonwealth towards Australian manufacturers. Of course, I balance my call for a reframing of Commonwealth procurement with some caution. I support the Australian Industry Group's sensible submission to the inquiry that the Commonwealth must continue to adhere to established principles of best practice in procurement. But that must include a reasonable and robust consideration of what best value for money is.


I agree with Ai Group's view that best practice, far from being a buzz word for management boffins, can be a guide for a government seeking savings for its budget. It says:


No areas or agencies of government should be off limits to the application of best practice principles such as efficiency, effectiveness, transparency and equity in government expenditure.


But the key point on procurement is how wide to frame the value proposition for the nation. The Ai Group makes the point as good as anyone:


Government should take a long-term and holistic approach when applying these principles to individual costs and expenditure items. The emphasis should be on value for money over the whole life of a product or service and should take into account factors such as risk, reliability and future maintenance costs.


The Ai Group said the major barriers and distortions for local suppliers to the Commonwealth were:


An undue emphasis on upfront costs rather than whole-of-life costs in government procurement. This emphasis resulted in the purchase of lower quality goods and services and neglected the costs involved in maintenance and through-life support, which were key advantages that local suppliers were able to offer.


If this process gets us anywhere, I would like to see the Commonwealth assess and quantify the wider, long-term and indirect benefits to Australia of engaging local suppliers. The Ai Group puts it in these terms:


Government spending measures should be assessed holistically so that any spill-over benefits that are not easy to quantify are taken into account.


We should be quantifying these benefits so that we can target and achieve them through Commonwealth procurement. The Ai Group's concerns must be listened to. It represents 60,000 businesses in manufacturing, engineering, construction, automotive, food, transport and many other sectors. The businesses which it represents employ more than one million Australians. This is about the national interest of Australia and Australians.


The ALP's Australian Jobs Bill last year addressed procurement concerns, but I believe the thresholds were set too high. An August 2012 report from the Prime Minister's Taskforce on Manufacturing estimated that 950,000 people were employed in the manufacturing sector and that it contributes eight per cent of our gross domestic product directly. That does not include the significant amount that it contributes indirectly through flow-on effects to other businesses. The report also stated that over 100,000 jobs had disappeared from the manufacturing sector over the previous four years. That means that 100,000 families around the nation were affected by this plunge in employment in our manufacturing sector. We have to stop being mugs. Other countries are laughing at us for being such purists about free trade. We can go further by reframing Commonwealth procurement.


I will finish by highlighting a very important example of Commonwealth procurement that would be transformed by a better application of the national interest test—shipbuilding for the Department of Defence. Right now, the Commonwealth is weighing up what additional warships it will ask local industry to construct in coming years—if any. Defence has indicated it will need to acquire 80 ships for the Navy in coming years. The estimated cost of these is about $100 billion. The so-called 'valley of death' awaits many thousands of shipbuilding workers in Victoria, New South Wales and my home state of South Australia, as well as in other parts of the country. A witness to the inquiry, Dr Tom Skladzien, National Economic Adviser to the Australian Manufacturing Workers' Union, said:


It's better to have a defence industry and not need one, than need one and not have one.


Dr Skladzien articulated well a range of concerns about defence procurement and I would urge honourable senators to look at his remarks and his evidence.


It is a stark picture, but it is not a stretch to see the same peaks and troughs, the same boom-and-bust pattern, stretching across the economic and social fabric of the nation—driven by short-sighted procurement policy. The Commonwealth's procurement regime could reasonably be called a latter day, free-trade-inspired cargo cult. It is not serving Australians and more and more of us are waking up to it. 


The United States and Europe woke up long ago. The United States is the greatest free trade country in history, yet can find a way to act in the best economic interests of its people. Just look at the tough and controversial negotiations it is having with Australia on the Trans-Pacific Partnership free trade agreement. It is fair to say that the US and Europe operate on a completely different level than Australia does in relation to local suppliers and industries. We must be less credulous of the rest of the world, who are clear eyed about their own national interests, yet remain aware of the benefits of free trade over time. 


Commonwealth procurement should not be couched in terms of discrimination nor driven by a desire to be whiter than the driven snow on free trade. We cannot afford to be so naive. Rather, we should be framing decisions about Commonwealth procurement more realistically and more fully, recognising the true benefits of a sustained, competitive and responsive local supplier base. In the end, it is about us no longer being taken for mugs.

"McKenzie, Sen Bridget",Nats,2014-03-27,"



Senator McKENZIE
 (Victoria—Nationals Whip in the Senate) (17:55):  I only have a limited amount of time available to me, but I do recognise that government procurement is an attractive option as a solution to shoring up local manufacturers. I understand that. Australian manufacturers would love to have something like the Buy American Act, just as Australian farmers would like our own version of the American farm bill. But we know that the role of government is both to protect the taxpayer dollar and to support local business by decreasing regulation, encouraging competition and allowing capital to flow. 


I do not want to pre-empt the Senate Finance and Public Administration References Committee inquiry that is currently underway, but one of the issues that was raised with the committee was the proposition of value for money and how we define it. Like trying to come to terms with the vague concept of national interest, it is difficult to define. But it does need to include a whole-of-life examination of the product being bought. 


Senator Lundy, in her contribution, commented on the issue of how best to support SMEs and the role of direct sourcing policies in doing so. The inquiry heard evidence that the ANAO has issues with how some of our departments and agencies are using the direct sourcing policy and applying the notion of value for money. The ANAO's concern is that departments and agencies are not looking at their purchases in a holistic manner but going straight for the lowest cost supplier. I think the inquiry is going to flesh out that issue further.


It is an important inquiry in the context of a manufacturing sector which is facing serious challenges to its viability and sustainability, especially in a world that is becoming more and more protectionist. A recent British announcement about procurement is a case in point. They are going to be encouraging British schools to buy local products. I support local products and produce being sold in our schools and indeed our hospitals, but if that British announcement is any example, this is not just an issue that Australia is looking at but one being looked at by countries right around the world.


We are being forced to look at the processes and standards that we apply to goods produced on Australian soil—and those that we apply to goods that are imported. From the submissions to the inquiry, one of the strongest themes has been about making the tender process fairer for Australian companies. The submission from Australian Paper, located in beautiful Gippsland in my home state of Victoria, made a good point that the environmental laws under which Australian companies operate are onerous. I know that the member for Gippsland, Darren Chester, has tabled a petition with over 4,000 signatures to that effect in the other place. Exposing Australian businesses to international competition should be encouraged. It keeps us nimble and flexible. For the immediately foreseeable future, those are exactly the characteristics required to be successful. Australian companies can and do compete on price alone, but we should be doing everything we can to make that easier. 


The submission from the Council of Textile and Fashion Industries made quite an impact on me. Local companies have to sign up with Ethical Clothing Australia before they can tender for a government contract. Their overseas competitors, however, do not. So our local companies are effectively being unfairly discriminated against as a result of our procurement processes and policy. Thanks to the coalition's repeal day yesterday, that unnecessary and unfair regulation has been removed. I will be writing to the parliamentary secretary, Josh Frydenberg, to congratulate him on that effort.


The Australian government is committed to supporting our local defence industry. In this regard, Defence expect to spend $5.4 billion on equipment acquisition and support in Australia this financial year. This equates to around 60 per cent of DMO's military equipment acquisition and support expenditure this year. I have a lot more to say about the international arena and what other countries are doing to support their local manufacturing industries and service industries, but I will save that for another time.

That this bill be now read a second time.


I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard.


Leave granted.




The speech read as follows—



This Bill, repealing the Clean Energy Finance Corporation Act 2012, delivers on our election commitment to abolish the $10 billion Clean Energy Finance Corporation.


The CEFC was established on 3 August 2012 and was given a wide remit to lend taxpayers' borrowed money. The CEFC extended the reach of the carbon tax by creating a $10 billion fund to invest in renewable energy technologies and energy efficiency projects. 


From the outset, the concept of the CEFC overlapped with the 20 per cent renewable energy target. By itself, this target encourages investment in renewable energy. The target does not need to be accompanied by $10 billion of borrowed taxpayers' money going into the CEFC to encourage investment.


This Bill also transfers the CEFC's existing assets and liabilities to the Treasury. The Commonwealth will ensure both an orderly transition of the CEFC's investments to the Commonwealth and minimal disruption to the clean energy market so business can continue as usual. 


We will of course honour all payments that are necessary as part of meeting our contractual obligations to committed investments. These obligations will be met from the CEFC's existing funding, which will be transferred to a new CEFC transitional special account. 


This account will also cover the Treasury's management costs in administering the CEFC's investments. Any other liabilities relating to the CEFC will also be covered by funds from the special account. 


Future monies that were due to be appropriated to the CEFC annually until 2017 will be returned to consolidated revenue. This Bill also provides for excess funding to be returned to consolidated revenue at any stage if it is no longer needed for managing the CEFC's assets and liabilities. 


With this Bill the Government is delivering on its commitment to abolish the CEFC.

"Boyce, Sen Sue",LP,2014-03-27,"



Senator BOYCE
 (Queensland) (18:06):  I did not have the chance to say as much as I would have liked when this report was tabled yesterday. It is an extremely important report. I made the point yesterday that in many ways the situation for aged people, especially those with dementia and those displaying behavioural and psychiatric symptoms of dementia, reminds me of the institutionalised and insensitive way that people with disabilities were treated a number of years ago.


We heard evidence during the inquiry that the way that institutions, aged-care facilities, were established was in fact often part of the reason that people developed challenging behaviours and that large areas where people were congregated together in noisy places was not the way to deal with people with dementia. Someone referred to the noise being like oil on water for people suffering from dementia. 


One of the very good visits that the committee made during this inquiry was to the Perc Walkley Dementia Learning Centre in Melbourne. We have in fact amongst our recommendations suggested that every state and territory should have a similar learning centre so that professionals, other stakeholders and families can experience what it might be like for people who have dementia. A number of the senators on the committee went through the experience. 


It is possible within the set-up at the Perc Walkley centre to begin to get some idea of what it is like for people with dementia—how when your perception goes, big swirly patterns on floors can look like obstacles that you actually need to step over or walk around; how the stripe in the middle of a bath mat may look like a great cavernous hole in the floor; how when you are confused and your perception is not as good as it could be, every door can look the same, so quite simple things like putting signs on doors can assist people; how a bright, white bathroom may make it impossible for someone with dementia to know where the toilet is exactly, so something as simple as a black seat on a white toilet might assist someone who could currently be seen as suffering from incontinence. 


There are a lot of simple things that can be done in design areas and it would be very useful, I think, for anyone contemplating building, refurbishing or renovating an aged-care facility to visit the Perc Walkley centre. It also would be very useful for families to have that opportunity to experience what it must be like for their loved ones. Clearly, for someone who cares for someone with dementia, particularly someone beginning to develop the behavioural or psychiatric symptoms, it can be terribly frustrating and terribly difficult. If you can perhaps have some sense of where that challenging behaviour is coming from, then the problems can be partly dealt with. 


It reminds me, as I said, very much of areas in the disability sector where people will often misbehave—or appear to be misbehaving—simply because their needs are not being met. No-one is paying attention to them. No-one is understanding what they want. This might be because they are not able to tell people what their needs are. They may be in physical pain and not able to pass that on. However, if the same thing is being done to you over and over, when you have in your view expressed for it not to happen, then of course any one of us is going to get very angry and use whatever tools we have to demonstrate to others that we do not want that to happen. If it continues to happen, we will get angry. Understanding that can be very valuable for families and carers. 


I briefly mentioned yesterday the problems that currently exist with the respite care that is available for people being cared for in the community who have dementia or are beginning to display symptoms of psychiatric and behavioural problems. Currently, the main respite that is available is a two-week holiday. Again, I am reminded of the disability sector where two weeks away with unfamiliar people in unfamiliar surroundings doing unfamiliar things is the least restful thing that can happen for the person who has dementia. It often means that when that person comes back home to the carer, who is supposed to have had a break, a rest and be refreshed, the behaviours of the person with dementia are far worse than they were before they went. 


We took evidence that said that people with dementia are often better during the day than at night. It would be useful to many carers to have respite care during the day but for the person to come home at night. They would be in familiar surroundings at night so that they would not be challenged by the problems of an unfamiliar environment with unfamiliar people. 


Another area I want to talk about briefly is the use of restraints. It was good to see that yesterday Alzheimer's Australia also brought out a report on the use of restraints and psychotropic medications in people with dementia. Clearly, if you have people whose behaviour is such that it is likely to cause them harm or others harm, you have to deal with that. The way we are dealing with that right now is certainly not best practice in any way. In the majority of cases, people are treated with psychotropic medications when often this should not need to happen, if the behaviours are understood, if the environment is changed—and we saw examples during our hearings of best practice where there was virtually no-one using medication. 


Senator McKenzie got quite excited yesterday when we mentioned a facility in Warracknabeal in Victoria, because it is one of the towns that she knows very well in her area. The Yarriambiack Lodge is a fantastic centre where they have got rid of the staffroom. They got rid of the large-screen TV and bought a small 1960s box and had a TV fitted into it. Everyone in the place, except the staff, thought that was a fantastic idea. It is very rarely watched, because most of the people who live at the lodge have tasks—occupations—assigned to them. One woman assists with making beds during the day. Another, who is a nurse, spends her days rolling bandages. Whether these bandages are used or not is not the question, as this woman believes herself to be gainfully employed. She is not on any medication and she is enjoying her time. That is clearly a far better outcome than an outcome where she is sitting, full of medication, staring at a wall or a television that she is not comprehending.


There is a long way for us to go in terms of treating people with dementia better. Another area that reminds me in many ways of the disability sector is the current trend that we have to collect people with dementia and people with behavioural and psychiatric symptoms into one place. That is, to segregate them and to exclude them from the general aged-care community, whether it be within the community itself or within an aged-care facility.


Again, all we do is exaggerate and worsen the conditions for the people involved and make life more difficult for the staff involved. There is a lot of work to do in this area. I think all the senators involved could talk for a lot longer on the changes that we perceive need to be made.

"Thorp, Sen Lin",ALP,2014-03-27,"



Senator THORP
 (Tasmania) (18:16):  Could I just concur with the remarks made by my colleague Senator Boyce. She is very correct in the sense that it was a very good inquiry. We worked collaboratively together very well and there was no difficulty at all coming to a set of recommendations that we all felt extremely comfortable with. Could I also take this opportunity to thank the secretariat for the excellent work they did in the preparation of the report and in organising the hearings et cetera.


The report recognises that, when it comes to the treatment and management of people living with dementia, we do need to do better. With our ageing population and the increasing numbers of people living with dementia, we must be sure that the care provided is the best it can be. Those living with dementia, the young and particularly the old, are amongst the most vulnerable people in our communities. We must therefore do all we can in this place to be a voice for their needs and an advocate for their rights.


The inquiry into the care and management of Australians living with dementia recognised that dementia is not a natural part of ageing. It recognised that dementia is a significant and growing element in Australia. We have more than 320,000 Australians currently living with dementia. However, every single day the illness touches many, many more. The report identified that 60 per cent of people living with dementia are women. The Department of Health and Ageing report of 2013 estimated that:


… nearly 1.5 million Australians are affected by dementia including the families and carers of people living with dementia.


The numbers therefore speak for themselves. The treatment and management of people with dementia is an issue that is too big for our nation to ignore. The estimations are particularly troubling when projections suggest that the number of Australians living with dementia will increase to 400,000 by 2020 and to almost 900,000 by 2050. Whilst age is often the biggest risk factor for dementia, there are currently an estimated 24,000 people living with dementia who are under the age of 60.


I am pleased that the inquiry placed a core focus upon assessing the needs of younger people living with the behavioural and psychiatric symptoms of dementia, who are often overlooked in political debate. It is vital that we remember and think of dementia as not just a condition which affects older people. The care needs of younger people are different and the service and care provided needs to reflect this.


In response, the report recommended an expansion to the Younger Onset Dementia Key Worker Program to provide support for all who live with dementia. The report also recommended that the funding for the Younger Onset Dementia Key Worker Program be increased and that the revised level of funding be sufficient enough to ensure that the planned review of the expanded trial has sufficient data to accurately assess the program.


Of particular importance to many people living with dementia in my home state of Tasmania is the recommendation in the report to explore options for the provision of respite in rural and remote areas. The unique symptoms of dementia and the current circumstances surrounding the limited options for appropriate care available in Australia means that family members and carers are burdened by additional strains. Dementia, after all, is more accurately thought of as an umbrella term for 'a syndrome which is associated with more than 100 different conditions which are characterised by the impairment of brain functions'.


I am pleased to speak on the tabling of this report, as it signals a first step towards identifying some of the greater issues that we in this place must recognise if we are to provide effective, appropriate and comprehensive reform for people living with dementia.


There are many significant and challenging issues for younger and older Australians living with dementia. That is why I not only welcomed but also considered it absolutely vital that the terms of reference for this inquiry examined: the scope and adequacy of the different models of community, residential and acute care for Australians living with dementia and BPSD;    the scope for improving the provision of care and management of Australians living with dementia and BPSD, such as access to appropriate respite care; and, significantly, as Senator Boyce referred to, the reduction in the use of both physical and chemical restraints on people living with dementia.


In particular, how we respond to the unwarranted and inhumane use of chemical restraints on people living with dementia is an aspect of dementia care which does require our urgent attention. Too often people with dementia are prescribed antipsychotic drugs as a first response, too often these drugs are used to chemically restrain those who experience the behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia and too often the results are deadly or irreversible.


Whether restraints are physical such as chairs with barriers over the lap or chemical restraints such as lethal combined doses of mirtazapine and morphine, restraints rarely work to assist with the behaviour of people living with dementia. In fact, restraints can actually increase the likelihood of an incident of physical harm occurring, and if people are restrained in an immobile position for too long they can suffer from constipation, as well as pressure sores. Putting the physical impact aside, restraints also have the capacity to induce and become the cause of psychological harm as people with dementia may suffer increased levels of depression, fear and frustration. The symptoms of dementia can often be prevented and managed without the need to medically induce restraint in people. I must also note that the majority of these antipsychotic drugs are in no way intended to be used for the treatment of dementia, and people with dementia are at much higher risk of experiencing dangerous side effects.


Dementia reform makes social sense and economic sense. We have listened carefully to the stakeholders involved in the discussion, and I would like to thank the many people, particularly those in my home state of Tasmania, who contacted my office and made submissions to the inquiry. The recommendations reflect a key focus of the report, which was to assess both the Commonwealth and the state government services currently provided to those who suffer from dementia. They address the adequacy of care for people with dementia in a variety of settings, including the home, the community and acute care. 


Mr Deputy President, I am aware of the time so I will prune my remarks a little, but I did want to put on the record the committee's appreciation of the evidence given to us by people from Tasmania, including Dr John Tooth. I commend to the Senate the excellent pioneering work done by Dr Tooth over 20 years ago. His work has become world renowned. In fact, he is considered an expert in this area in the United States and Japan. He was a state finalist for the Australian of the Year in 2007. He has been a pioneer for dementia care reform, advocating for a kind and humane response to treating people with dementia. He emphasises the importance of 'dementia specific' architectural design in order to create simple structures with a home-like interior. He has lectured in Japan, Canada, the United States and the United Kingdom. One way in which we can work on the model championed by Dr John Tooth is to make sure that we are educating staff to be skilled and caring. We must ensure that there are higher numbers of staff per person, and we must make a greater commitment to training and investment.


It is great to see, as you would know, Mr Deputy President, that the University of Tasmania is offering a free nine-week online course titled Understanding Dementia. It draws on the expertise of neuroscientists, clinicians and dementia care professionals. Not only is this course free; it is also offered to anyone who wishes to register for it. I understand that it is one of those rare courses where not only is there a great deal of interest when it comes to registering and starting the course but there is also an extremely high rate of completion. 


At this point, I will curtail my remarks to say that, as nearly 1.5 million Australians are affected by dementia, including the families and carers of people living with dementia, please let this report be a call to action because we can and need to do better.

"Boyce, Sen Sue",LP,2014-03-27,"



Senator BOYCE
 (Queensland) (18:06):  I did not have the chance to say as much as I would have liked when this report was tabled yesterday. It is an extremely important report. I made the point yesterday that in many ways the situation for aged people, especially those with dementia and those displaying behavioural and psychiatric symptoms of dementia, reminds me of the institutionalised and insensitive way that people with disabilities were treated a number of years ago.


We heard evidence during the inquiry that the way that institutions, aged-care facilities, were established was in fact often part of the reason that people developed challenging behaviours and that large areas where people were congregated together in noisy places was not the way to deal with people with dementia. Someone referred to the noise being like oil on water for people suffering from dementia. 


One of the very good visits that the committee made during this inquiry was to the Perc Walkley Dementia Learning Centre in Melbourne. We have in fact amongst our recommendations suggested that every state and territory should have a similar learning centre so that professionals, other stakeholders and families can experience what it might be like for people who have dementia. A number of the senators on the committee went through the experience. 


It is possible within the set-up at the Perc Walkley centre to begin to get some idea of what it is like for people with dementia—how when your perception goes, big swirly patterns on floors can look like obstacles that you actually need to step over or walk around; how the stripe in the middle of a bath mat may look like a great cavernous hole in the floor; how when you are confused and your perception is not as good as it could be, every door can look the same, so quite simple things like putting signs on doors can assist people; how a bright, white bathroom may make it impossible for someone with dementia to know where the toilet is exactly, so something as simple as a black seat on a white toilet might assist someone who could currently be seen as suffering from incontinence. 


There are a lot of simple things that can be done in design areas and it would be very useful, I think, for anyone contemplating building, refurbishing or renovating an aged-care facility to visit the Perc Walkley centre. It also would be very useful for families to have that opportunity to experience what it must be like for their loved ones. Clearly, for someone who cares for someone with dementia, particularly someone beginning to develop the behavioural or psychiatric symptoms, it can be terribly frustrating and terribly difficult. If you can perhaps have some sense of where that challenging behaviour is coming from, then the problems can be partly dealt with. 


It reminds me, as I said, very much of areas in the disability sector where people will often misbehave—or appear to be misbehaving—simply because their needs are not being met. No-one is paying attention to them. No-one is understanding what they want. This might be because they are not able to tell people what their needs are. They may be in physical pain and not able to pass that on. However, if the same thing is being done to you over and over, when you have in your view expressed for it not to happen, then of course any one of us is going to get very angry and use whatever tools we have to demonstrate to others that we do not want that to happen. If it continues to happen, we will get angry. Understanding that can be very valuable for families and carers. 


I briefly mentioned yesterday the problems that currently exist with the respite care that is available for people being cared for in the community who have dementia or are beginning to display symptoms of psychiatric and behavioural problems. Currently, the main respite that is available is a two-week holiday. Again, I am reminded of the disability sector where two weeks away with unfamiliar people in unfamiliar surroundings doing unfamiliar things is the least restful thing that can happen for the person who has dementia. It often means that when that person comes back home to the carer, who is supposed to have had a break, a rest and be refreshed, the behaviours of the person with dementia are far worse than they were before they went. 


We took evidence that said that people with dementia are often better during the day than at night. It would be useful to many carers to have respite care during the day but for the person to come home at night. They would be in familiar surroundings at night so that they would not be challenged by the problems of an unfamiliar environment with unfamiliar people. 


Another area I want to talk about briefly is the use of restraints. It was good to see that yesterday Alzheimer's Australia also brought out a report on the use of restraints and psychotropic medications in people with dementia. Clearly, if you have people whose behaviour is such that it is likely to cause them harm or others harm, you have to deal with that. The way we are dealing with that right now is certainly not best practice in any way. In the majority of cases, people are treated with psychotropic medications when often this should not need to happen, if the behaviours are understood, if the environment is changed—and we saw examples during our hearings of best practice where there was virtually no-one using medication. 


Senator McKenzie got quite excited yesterday when we mentioned a facility in Warracknabeal in Victoria, because it is one of the towns that she knows very well in her area. The Yarriambiack Lodge is a fantastic centre where they have got rid of the staffroom. They got rid of the large-screen TV and bought a small 1960s box and had a TV fitted into it. Everyone in the place, except the staff, thought that was a fantastic idea. It is very rarely watched, because most of the people who live at the lodge have tasks—occupations—assigned to them. One woman assists with making beds during the day. Another, who is a nurse, spends her days rolling bandages. Whether these bandages are used or not is not the question, as this woman believes herself to be gainfully employed. She is not on any medication and she is enjoying her time. That is clearly a far better outcome than an outcome where she is sitting, full of medication, staring at a wall or a television that she is not comprehending.


There is a long way for us to go in terms of treating people with dementia better. Another area that reminds me in many ways of the disability sector is the current trend that we have to collect people with dementia and people with behavioural and psychiatric symptoms into one place. That is, to segregate them and to exclude them from the general aged-care community, whether it be within the community itself or within an aged-care facility.


Again, all we do is exaggerate and worsen the conditions for the people involved and make life more difficult for the staff involved. There is a lot of work to do in this area. I think all the senators involved could talk for a lot longer on the changes that we perceive need to be made.

"Thorp, Sen Lin",ALP,2014-03-27,"



Senator THORP
 (Tasmania) (18:16):  Could I just concur with the remarks made by my colleague Senator Boyce. She is very correct in the sense that it was a very good inquiry. We worked collaboratively together very well and there was no difficulty at all coming to a set of recommendations that we all felt extremely comfortable with. Could I also take this opportunity to thank the secretariat for the excellent work they did in the preparation of the report and in organising the hearings et cetera.


The report recognises that, when it comes to the treatment and management of people living with dementia, we do need to do better. With our ageing population and the increasing numbers of people living with dementia, we must be sure that the care provided is the best it can be. Those living with dementia, the young and particularly the old, are amongst the most vulnerable people in our communities. We must therefore do all we can in this place to be a voice for their needs and an advocate for their rights.


The inquiry into the care and management of Australians living with dementia recognised that dementia is not a natural part of ageing. It recognised that dementia is a significant and growing element in Australia. We have more than 320,000 Australians currently living with dementia. However, every single day the illness touches many, many more. The report identified that 60 per cent of people living with dementia are women. The Department of Health and Ageing report of 2013 estimated that:


… nearly 1.5 million Australians are affected by dementia including the families and carers of people living with dementia.


The numbers therefore speak for themselves. The treatment and management of people with dementia is an issue that is too big for our nation to ignore. The estimations are particularly troubling when projections suggest that the number of Australians living with dementia will increase to 400,000 by 2020 and to almost 900,000 by 2050. Whilst age is often the biggest risk factor for dementia, there are currently an estimated 24,000 people living with dementia who are under the age of 60.


I am pleased that the inquiry placed a core focus upon assessing the needs of younger people living with the behavioural and psychiatric symptoms of dementia, who are often overlooked in political debate. It is vital that we remember and think of dementia as not just a condition which affects older people. The care needs of younger people are different and the service and care provided needs to reflect this.


In response, the report recommended an expansion to the Younger Onset Dementia Key Worker Program to provide support for all who live with dementia. The report also recommended that the funding for the Younger Onset Dementia Key Worker Program be increased and that the revised level of funding be sufficient enough to ensure that the planned review of the expanded trial has sufficient data to accurately assess the program.


Of particular importance to many people living with dementia in my home state of Tasmania is the recommendation in the report to explore options for the provision of respite in rural and remote areas. The unique symptoms of dementia and the current circumstances surrounding the limited options for appropriate care available in Australia means that family members and carers are burdened by additional strains. Dementia, after all, is more accurately thought of as an umbrella term for 'a syndrome which is associated with more than 100 different conditions which are characterised by the impairment of brain functions'.


I am pleased to speak on the tabling of this report, as it signals a first step towards identifying some of the greater issues that we in this place must recognise if we are to provide effective, appropriate and comprehensive reform for people living with dementia.


There are many significant and challenging issues for younger and older Australians living with dementia. That is why I not only welcomed but also considered it absolutely vital that the terms of reference for this inquiry examined: the scope and adequacy of the different models of community, residential and acute care for Australians living with dementia and BPSD;    the scope for improving the provision of care and management of Australians living with dementia and BPSD, such as access to appropriate respite care; and, significantly, as Senator Boyce referred to, the reduction in the use of both physical and chemical restraints on people living with dementia.


In particular, how we respond to the unwarranted and inhumane use of chemical restraints on people living with dementia is an aspect of dementia care which does require our urgent attention. Too often people with dementia are prescribed antipsychotic drugs as a first response, too often these drugs are used to chemically restrain those who experience the behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia and too often the results are deadly or irreversible.


Whether restraints are physical such as chairs with barriers over the lap or chemical restraints such as lethal combined doses of mirtazapine and morphine, restraints rarely work to assist with the behaviour of people living with dementia. In fact, restraints can actually increase the likelihood of an incident of physical harm occurring, and if people are restrained in an immobile position for too long they can suffer from constipation, as well as pressure sores. Putting the physical impact aside, restraints also have the capacity to induce and become the cause of psychological harm as people with dementia may suffer increased levels of depression, fear and frustration. The symptoms of dementia can often be prevented and managed without the need to medically induce restraint in people. I must also note that the majority of these antipsychotic drugs are in no way intended to be used for the treatment of dementia, and people with dementia are at much higher risk of experiencing dangerous side effects.

Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS
 (New South Wales—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Services) (18:37):  It is my honour to rise to provide a summary to the Senate on Harmony Day 2014, which we celebrated around the nation last week on 21 March. The theme for Harmony Day is: 'Everyone belongs'. Harmony Day was an initiative of the coalition government in 1999, so I am pleased that it has become a significant day of the year when Australians are encouraged to celebrate the cultural diversity of our country and that 14 years later more than 55,000 Harmony Day events have now been held.


21 March is also the United Nations International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination. Harmony Day encourages people to participate in their community, to respect different cultures and religions and to foster a sense of belonging for everyone. And so we should. We are one of the most culturally diverse countries in the world. Our diversity is unique and, in the government's view, it is one of Australia's greatest strengths.


Without doubt, migrants have helped shape the Australia we enjoy today. Through hard work and a commitment to Australia, our migrants have helped make Australia one of the most prosperous and socially cohesive nations on earth.


As the daughter of migrants myself and now Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Services with special responsibility for multicultural affairs and settlement services, I was especially honoured to have the principal carriage of the Harmony Day celebrations. Can I record my thanks and acknowledgement for the support that I received from the Hon. Kevin Andrews, Minister for Social Services, and his office and department.


My message in the lead-up to Harmony Day was to get involved by joining in or registering your Harmony Day event by going to www.harmony.gov.au or to Harmony Day on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram to join the conversation—'Everyone belongs'. I am pleased to say that a record number of people responded. First there was the record number of events staged around the country. No less than 6,632 events were registered, a 35 per cent increase on the 4,905 events registered in 2013. The events staged were in childcare centres, schools, community groups, churches, businesses, and federal, state and local government agencies across Australia. Morning teas, fairs, concerts, school assemblies, sporting events and national costume days were among the different events staged to showcase cultures, traditions and backgrounds. On behalf of the government, I hosted a harmonious and multicultural morning tea for my parliamentary colleagues—the samosas and cannoli were a hit. I thank our Prime Minister, who made time to attend.


As I said, there were record events held this year—evidence of a growing awareness and involvement by the Australian community, with orange, the colour for Harmony Day, in abundance. A highlight was that, for the first time, all states and territories had a landmark bathed in orange, including Old Parliament House in Canberra, Melbourne's Federation Square, Government House in Darwin, and, close to my electorate office, Wollongong's Breakwater Lighthouse. The display of orange also translated to the Harmony Day ribbons and show of orange clothing.


We also engaged on social media and encouraged those on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram to engage in the conversation about Harmony Day. Again, there were more participants this year. Not only was the Harmony Day Stories app downloaded over 6,780 times—a 400 per cent increase on last year—but there were more than 750,000 impressions on Facebook. Our Harmony Day video was downloaded almost 9½ thousand times.


Food is very important in breaking down barriers where there are differences, and this year proved no exception. So I want to congratulate the Scanlon Foundation's initiative, A Taste of Harmony. It was great to join Guy Grossi for afternoon tea at Grossi Fiorentino in Melbourne as we talked about the culture of the table—la cultura della tavola. A Taste of Harmony was promoted as a free and delicious way to celebrate workplaces' cultural diversity in the week of 17 to 23 March, where Australians were invited to organise their workmates to bring a plate of food to share.


Involvement in sport as a player or spectator also has the ability to unite people of all ages, cultures and religions. To celebrate this year's Harmony Day, the Australian government announced a $180,000 sponsorship of the 2014 Harmony Game Schools Pack, in partnership with SBS and Football Federation Australia. This will be a resource for primary school teachers to teach young people about the value of cultural diversity to Australian society, and it will go to every primary school in Australia. This initiative uses young people's passion for sport and teaches respect in the classroom and on the football field. Children are offered the opportunity to learn and understand how all Australians from diverse backgrounds equally belong to this nation and make it a better place.


I also extend my appreciation to the Australian Parliament Sports Club for their support with the series of events under the banner 'Sport in support of Harmony Day' between 16 and 27 March when the pollies took on the press and others in a range of sports. I particularly want to thank those who came from around Australia to play in support of our Harmony Games, including Lisa Alexander, Diamonds coach; Anne Sargeant, former Australian netball captain; Australia Post AFL Multicultural Ambassadors Patrick Karnezis and David Rodan; former Socceroo captain Craig Foster; as well as Young Australian of the Year and Paralympian eight-time gold-medal champion Jacqueline Freney. I am pleased to report the overall result was respectable for the pollies. A special thanks goes to our Parliament House sports guru, Andy Turnbull.


I would also like to acknowledge and thank the various sporting codes in Australia for their Harmony Day efforts. I was delighted to enjoy Harmony Day with over 45,000 others at the AFL Harmony Day match between North Melbourne Kangaroos and the Essendon Bombers in Melbourne last Friday night. Last Saturday morning I addressed the NRL's Harmony Day Festival in Penrith before attending the Sunday match between the NSW Swifts and the Queensland Firebirds, as part of Netball Australia's celebrations.


Young people in particular have an important role to play in promoting diversity and eliminating racism and discrimination. During Harmony Week we also welcomed to Parliament House six young players who have been selected to represent Australia at the Football for Hope Festival to be held in Rio during the final two weeks of the FIFA World Cup 2014. These young Australians were selected from the cohort of participants at Football United programs across western and south-western Sydney. They mirror the diversity of our great country, and a number have come to Australia under our humanitarian program. Dr Bunde-Birouste, founder and CEO of Football United, and their blue, indestructible football were welcome guests at our Parliament House Harmony Day morning tea.


The morning tea was also enhanced by the selection of posters from the annual competition organised by the B'nai B'rith Alfred Dreyfus Anti-Defamation Unit. Through their artwork, secondary students from New South Wales and ACT expressed their understanding of religious and cultural differences and their importance in a harmonious society. On display were the two national winners of the 2013 competition. I recall speaking at Harmony Day 2006 at the Sydney Town Hall and celebrating the works of young people then. I would like to particularly acknowledge the work of Ernie Friedlander OAM, Chairman of Moving Forward Together, part of B'nai B'rith. His contribution to the ongoing fight against racism and discrimination makes him a truly outstanding Australian.


In reviewing the Harmony Day activities of so many Australians, we can take quiet pride in our ability to unite in different ways and celebrate the rich tapestry of our nation, whether in food, sport or simply gathering together. However, it is important that we harness the spirit and enthusiasm of Harmony Day every day of the year. Where we see racial vilification, we must take a stand. Harmony Day reinforces the importance of inclusiveness for all Australians and respect for cultural and religious diversity. The many initiatives around the country in support of Harmony Day are further important steps to counter racial vilification. It is about community participation and inclusiveness. But, above all, it is about respect for each other.


Our country is a great country, but it is only as great as our people. We have come so far, and together we can go so much further. For now I simply want to applaud all those Australians who played a role in making this year's Harmony Day a day where we truly came together in so many ways to celebrate Australia's cultural diversity in the spirit of everyone belonging.
