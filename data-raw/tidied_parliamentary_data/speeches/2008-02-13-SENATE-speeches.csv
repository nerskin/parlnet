"Wortley, Sen Dana",ALP,2008-02-13,"—I move:
That the following address-in-reply be agreed to:

To His Excellency the Governor-General


may it please your excellency—

We, the Senate of the Commonwealth of Australia in Parliament assembled, desire to express our loyalty to our Most Gracious Sovereign and to thank Your Excellency for the speech which you have been pleased to address to Parliament.
I welcome the opportunity to move the address-in-reply to His Excellency the Governor-General’s speech given at the opening of the 42nd Parliament. On 24 November 2007 the people of Australia voted in a new government. They voted for a government with a plan—a plan that as a nation we will move forward to write a new page in our nation’s history, a plan to make this country of ours even greater. As His Excellency said yesterday:
As one of the world’s oldest democracies, it is easy for us to take elections for granted ...
But, as he went on to say:
... all Australians can celebrate the success of our democracy when such changes can occur so seamlessly and with such goodwill.
This week and those ahead of this parliament are history in the making, a precursor to change, renewal and moving forward. There will be new directions, advancements and progress important to our nation, and today I will focus on just some of these. They include workplace relations, the environment, climate change and water, education and health, skills training, and reconciliation and Indigenous affairs.
It is significant that yesterday, the day we opened the 42nd Parliament, we were for the first time officially welcomed by the traditional owners of this land, by Indigenous Australians—welcomed to country. The Rudd government has made a commitment to our future as a nation, and this was a small but significant step.
The tasks ahead are challenging. We are faced with the bleak reality of climate change, the fact that owning a house is beyond the reach of many Australian families and many young people, the frustration of a skills crisis, the lack of adequate childcare places, the confrontation that many hardworking Australian families are being denied fairness in the workplace, and a wide gap in health and educational outcomes between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians. On that Saturday in November less than three months ago, the Australian people made a stand on these and other issues at the ballot box. It is now fair to say that the recovery of the Australian soul, the restoration of our national spirit, is underway with a fair go for all.
Admittedly, there are mountains to climb; but each step takes us closer to delivering to the Australian people the commitments made by this government. The seeds of compassion are once again being sown. Today we take a step forward by honouring the Indigenous people of this land and by apologising for the wrongs they have worn; by apologising for the laws and policies of successive parliaments and governments that inflicted profound grief, suffering and loss on them; by apologising for the removal of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children from their families, their communities and their country; and by saying sorry for the pain, suffering and hurt of the stolen generations, their descendants and their families left behind and for the indignity and degradation inflicted upon a proud people and a proud culture.
In the words of the Prime Minister:
We today take this first step by acknowledging the past and laying claim to a future that embraces all Australians.
When I entered the parliament in July 2005, I included the following words in my first speech:
Today I acknowledge the traditional owners of this land where we stand ... and I pay tribute to all Indigenous people of Australia. For the tragedy suffered by them and their ancestors I am truly sorry, as are the 55,000 people with whom I marched in Adelaide on that long weekend in June 2000. More than 240,000 people around Australia walked for reconciliation with our Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. It is a shame that reconciliation has not progressed as it could have, and we now know that as a nation it will not reflect kindly on us in the history books.
Almost three years on, and with a new government in office, today as a nation we arrive at a place from which to progress reconciliation with our Indigenous peoples. Optimism and hope are returning to these halls. Today we find ourselves at a place from which to start building better relationships between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians—a better future. It is the cornerstone upon which we can all begin to establish mutual respect and from which we can work towards achieving other meaningful goals. Now we must take the opportunity to move forward, Indigenous and non-Indigenous people, learning from the mistakes of the past and ensuring that they are never repeated.
As Prime Minister Kevin Rudd said at yesterday’s historic welcome to country opening of parliament:
Our challenge this week, then is to write a new page in the country’s history, and this is one small step. But for that page to be truly written, it must be written between ourselves and indigenous Australia, and within this parliament between those who are Government and those who are Opposition.
There remains much to be done across the Australian community to bring about reconciliation between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians. Through consultation and collaboration with Indigenous peoples and communities, the government will seek to build a relationship based on respect. We must translate our words of apology into actions via meaningful and effective policy, legislation and law. The government will continue developing and implementing a range of initiatives to help close the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australia in the areas of health outcomes and educational achievement. These include, but are not limited to, within a generation closing the 17-year life expectancy gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians; halving the gap in infant mortality rates between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians in the next decade; and halving the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous children in their reading, writing and numeracy achievements, also within a decade. It is important that individually and as a nation we recognise the true and full value of Indigenous culture, and we must move towards this end. As a government, we will address these and other examples of oversight and neglect of our Indigenous peoples.
The Rudd government believe every Australian child deserves a world-class education. We have promised an education revolution, and that is what we are working towards delivering. Submissions have already been made to cabinet regarding the $1 billion National Secondary School Computer Fund and the $2.5 billion trades training centres initiative. Real commitments have been made through the Council of Australian Governments to drive the productivity agenda through substantial reform in education, skills and early childhood development.
The government will raise standards in education by increasing standards in our schools and improving the quality of teaching through a grand reform agenda—the education revolution. Added to our education measures is Labor’s 50 per cent education tax refund, which is designed to boost Australia’s productivity and ease cost of living pressures for working families. Indeed, Australia needs an education revolution with new measures and innovations from early childhood years through primary and high school and on to tertiary study.
As His Excellency noted in his address yesterday, the government wants parents to have access to affordable, high-quality child care that helps them balance their work and family responsibilities. Another innovation will be universal access to early childhood education for all four-year-olds for 15 hours per week for 40 weeks of the year. A national curriculum will be introduced to streamline education in key learning areas for older children and the government will establish trades training centres in thousands of high schools around the country as a central plank in addressing the skills shortage.
There is no doubt that the skills shortage is impacting on our economy. Therefore, the government will commit $1.17 billion to a skills package over four years. The government’s establishment of the Skills Australia body is being fast-tracked to assist in fighting the inflationary pressures in the economy and improving productivity. This independent statutory body, to be known as Skills Australia—made up of members from a range of backgrounds, including economics, industry and academia—will oversee the government’s pledge to provide an extra 450,000 training places in the next four years. Over the coming decade, this number will grow to 820,000. To emphasise the government’s seriousness in this matter, the plan is to have the first 20,000 of these training places available by April this year. The goal of this program is to better match the demand for skills with skills training in Australia.
When it comes to our nation’s health systems, we need to end the state and territory versus Commonwealth government blame game referred to by His Excellency in his speech yesterday. The Rudd government, in cooperation with the states and territories, will direct resources towards medical and health research, boost nursing numbers, establish GP superclinics and put in place strategies to slash elective surgery waiting lists at our hospitals. There will be more attention paid, too, to the seriously under-resourced sectors of rural, women’s and Indigenous health. Aged care will take its turn in the spotlight during this parliamentary term, as will dental health, preventative health policies and meeting the challenge presented by the obesity epidemic confronting Australians of all ages.
As a government, we will address this and other areas that urgently require attention, including the environment, climate change and our most fragile and vital resource, water. Australians know we cannot afford to be sluggish when it comes to issues of our environment. What we do or do not do now and in the coming years will help shape the health of our planet for generations to come. To what extent the globe continues to be hospitable may well depend on us. We cannot afford to leave things to those who come after us.
While, through the media, we have seen worldwide the spectacular and even terrifying evidence of the toll of climate change, there are also clear signs in our own backyard. Environmental wonders, including rainforests, reefs and unique natural wildlife sanctuaries such as Kakadu National Park, are under threat. Bushfires pose more of a threat to life and livelihood than before, and our river systems are being choked by drought. For these reasons and more, on 3 December—the day the government was sworn in—as one of the first acts of this government, the Prime Minister signed the instrument of ratification of the Kyoto protocol. It was the first official act of the newly elected Rudd Labor government. In doing so, we have now gained a place at the world’s negotiating table.
So Australia will become a full member of the Kyoto protocol next month, and this government intends to be actively involved in developing a comprehensive new agreement to address the very serious issue of climate change. As a government, we want to be helping to drive the international dialogue on climate change rather than remaining in the back seat criticising those at the wheel. The government has also committed to slashing Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions by 60 per cent on 2000 levels by 2050. There will also be a $500 million renewable energy fund to develop, commercialise and deploy renewable energy technologies in Australia. This will aim to generate a further $1 billion private sector investment in such technologies. The government is committed to a national emissions trading scheme, which will provide incentives to cut greenhouse gas emissions across the country.
Caring for the environment is everyone’s responsibility, but we believe that the government must lead the way. Only the government can legislate change, and so this administration has embarked on a range of initiatives designed to preserve our precious environment. We want to conserve whales in our waters and around the world, and to that end we have upped diplomatic efforts, looked seriously at our international legal options and overseen an unprecedented level of monitoring of the Japanese whaling fleet in the Southern Ocean. We are also working to help Australians make their homes greener and more sustainable. The range of measures includes green loans, energy efficient insulation and cost-saving new standards for household appliances. The Solar Cities concept will be expanded and every school will become a solar school.
When it comes to action on the urgent issue of water, and particularly our drought-ravaged lifeblood, the Murray-Darling Basin, the government will implement its election commitments to secure a sustainable future for the basin. While some of the nation has suffered through floods in recent weeks, much of it remains terribly parched. Because of this fact, special water-sharing arrangements in the Murray-Darling Basin will continue in 2009.
Nowhere is the need for a new spirit of cooperation between the federal and state governments in the area of water more evident than in my home state of South Australia. Through cooperation, we need to find a long-term and sustainable solution for the River Murray and the communities who depend on it. For the first time in many years, real progress is being made in the area of consolidating a national approach to this crisis. How we deal with this challenge now will affect our people and environment for many years to come.
As with climate change, the voting public’s verdict from last November on workplace relations is clear. Australians want a fair go for themselves, their families and others in the workplace. They want to be treated with respect and even-handedness, and that is an entirely reasonable expectation. When Australians voted last November for Labor’s fair and balanced workplace relations system, we promised them there would be no new Australian workplace agreements. This government’s commitment in this area is to give working families a better, simpler industrial relations system than the one it will replace.
Essential to establishing a better system is to have a modern safety net. Our 10 national employment standards will form the integral part of that safety net. We will modernise and simplify our award system, and we will begin this process with a transition bill promised before the election. People who want to make individual agreements can make common-law agreements which must give them equal or more than the safety net rather than overriding and undermining that safety net.
The purpose of these measures is clear: we want to restore job security and satisfaction to our workforce. The Forward with Fairness reforms that the government will introduce are designed to establish just and fair relationships between employers and employees and revive worker confidence and family certainty. Better morale and more reasonable conditions within the workforce will also foster improved productivity. Happier workers are also healthier workers, with less stress and the associated social problems that it brings. Our legislation will implement a genuine no-disadvantage test for workplace agreements, protect workers against being unfairly dismissed and halt the stripping away of pay and conditions, including public holidays and overtime, without any appropriate remuneration. The government will promote family-friendly policy developments, such as giving women the right to ask their employer for an extended period of maternity leave or to return to work under part-time or more flexible conditions. There also will be a Productivity Commission inquiry looking into possibilities for paid maternity leave as a priority of this administration.
However, it is not only in the areas of the environment, working families, education, health and Indigenous issues that we will see benefits from a new way of thinking and a different course of action from our government; the government’s policies and their implementation are working towards delivering a more just society, a more united society, a more productive society and a more sustainable society in which all Australians can share.",SENATE,<title>GOVERNOR-GENERAL’S SPEECH</title>,<title>Address-in-Reply</title>,Governor-General's Speech,1,1
"McEwen, Sen Anne",ALP,2008-02-13,"—It is with great pleasure that I second the motion moved by Senator Wortley thanking his Excellency the Governor-General for his address to parliament yesterday. I also take this opportunity to congratulate the new ministers and parliamentary secretaries who took their seats for the first time in the parliament yesterday. After 2½ years for me, and up to 11 years for some of my colleagues here, it is a great feeling today to be sitting on the right side of you, Mr Acting Deputy President.
The opening of the 42nd Parliament was a very special day. For the first time in our parliament’s history, we had a welcome to country ceremony. It is hard to believe that it had not been done before. I think that for many years most senators would have attended conferences, events and government functions where a welcome to country ceremony was expected and always occurred. It is good that we have finally done it here. It is unfortunate that it took so long. The welcome to country ceremony was a strong sign that this parliament and this government will be different to those of the past. I am heartened to know that future openings of parliament will also incorporate the welcome to country ceremony.
In his speech, His Excellency the Governor-General pointed out how fortunate we are to live in a nation where governments change peacefully as a result of the free expression of the will of the people. We live in a democracy that is truly democratic, where people can safely and secretly vote with the confidence that their vote will be counted and that they have a say in who runs their country. Not everyone in the world is as fortunate as us. It is indeed a feature of our democracy that we change governments peacefully, and it is also a significant feature of our democracy that it began from the roots up rather than being created by special interest groups. This fact was noted by South Australian representative Josiah Symon at the time of Federation. While members on this side of the chamber do not share all of Symon’s philosophies, he was right in making a distinction between us and the founding structure of the British parliament, for example, which was frustrated by power struggles between royalty and landed gentry.
Although in our early history there was a failure to include Aboriginal Australians, there were at least sentiments expressed about a people’s parliament. This historic week in our parliament is a step towards achieving a more inclusive system. The political liberty Australians have in being able to change governments democratically and peacefully is one that other nations do not have. Some nations do not have that opportunity, nor the opportunity to establish their democracies from scratch. Before a democracy can come about in some countries a lot of pain has to be endured while regimes which are not representative are replaced. One example of such a country is Myanmar. In its recent history Myanmar has suffered a military dictatorship which has severely curtailed the democratic rights of its citizens. Who could forget those terrible images we have all undoubtedly seen of Buddhist monks and democracy protesters being fired at with tear gas and rounded up to be imprisoned? Pakistan is another example where the fight for democracy is characterised by violence. Less than two months ago, former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto was murdered by extremists. She had shown great courage and defiance in her resistance to extremism as she campaigned resolutely for democracy in Pakistan.
Recently, Kenya has also struggled for democracy as it faces civil strife and allegations of vote rigging following the recent elections there. Subsequent to those elections, we have seen violence which has claimed the lives of more than 1,000 Kenyans and is reported to have displaced more than 600,000 people. Even in the ex-Commonwealth country of Zimbabwe, where the history of the British system and conventions on parliamentary democracy would be presumed to be stronger than in some other countries, abuses of executive power leading to an undemocratic regime occur to this day. One emerging democracy which must in time experience the democracy that Australia enjoys is East Timor. However, currently this young nation is beset with political instability which saw the country split following the last election. The instability was further expressed in the recent attempted assassination of the country’s President and Prime Minister.
I would like to take this chance to remind the Senate that our government is strongly committed to seeing democracy prosper in that nation, our nearest neighbour, and we have deployed extra troops and police officers there in an effort to maintain order at this particularly volatile time. I would like to acknowledge the efforts of our troops and the Australian Federal Police officers serving in East Timor and in other countries, including Iraq.
In contrast to those examples of nations struggling for democracy, on 24 November last year Australians went to polling booths and voted according to their own free will. Australians used their democratic right and they voted for change. The trust and confidence of the nation has been handed to those of us in the Labor Party. It is a significant step for a nation to change government, and with change comes much responsibility for those who are assuming government.
A key difference between the new Australian government and the previous one is that under a Labor government the focus will not be on the individual. We have the ability to look at the bigger picture and we are committed to improving the lives of all Australians. We believe in a fair distribution of the benefits of economic growth, continuous improvement in the welfare and living standards of the Australians people and the reallocation of resources to those most in need. Labor is proud to bring these principles with it into the new government.
I was very encouraged to hear the Governor-General outline the government’s plans for the future. We do not just have plans; we implement them. When elected, Labor hit the ground running, and we will not be slowing down anytime soon. As His Excellency mentioned, one of our first actions as a new government was to ratify Kyoto. From the beginning of the election campaign, Mr Rudd outlined Labor’s commitment to the environment and our commitment to addressing climate change. This commitment has been evident since our election, not only in the ratification of the Kyoto protocol but also by the creation of the climate change portfolio. That change to portfolios means that the Minister for Climate Change and Water, Senator Penny Wong, is able to dedicate herself to the issue.
The government has also committed to reducing Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions by 60 per cent on 2000 levels by the year 2050. We see that climate change is one of the biggest challenges of our generation and, if the Australian government does not take action, it will undoubtedly continue to be one of the biggest challenges for generations to come. The previous government unfortunately was full of climate change sceptics and made little effort to protect our environment and develop ways to counteract global warming, but we will take action.
Labor has developed a strong plan of action to address the environmental issues that are currently facing Australia and the rest of the world. As the Governor-General outlined, our plans for the environment include managing the water crisis. As Senator Wortley said, this is an issue of particular importance to my state of South Australia. For urban areas, the new government will be establishing a $1 billion fund to invest in both old and new water supplies. A number of rebates will also be made available for families across the nation to assist them in making their homes more water efficient.
Those in rural areas, particularly farmers, have been impacted the most by the water crisis. For this reason the government has a drought policy that will ensure that those farmers receiving government assistance are better equipped to deal with drought. That includes climate change adaptation programs, which support farmers to change their practices to better deal with changes in the environment.
One area that really suffered during the reign of the Howard-Costello government was the education sector. So, shortly after the election, senators and members were directed by the new Prime Minister to visit schools. These visits were invigorating. It gave us all a chance to get out into the community and find out what is needed in our education sector. I took the opportunity to visit public and private schools in metropolitan and rural areas of South Australia and it provided me with a very good understanding of the issues faced by our schools. It was exciting to visit the schools and to present our education revolution, particularly our digital education revolution. Everywhere we went principals, teachers, students and parents showed great interest in this initiative and looked forward to improving and expanding the information technology systems in their schools.
University students continued to suffer because the previous government introduced voluntary student unionism and broke its promise of no more full-fee-paying university places. As we know, there are now 104 domestic full-fee university degrees costing over $100,000—three of which cost more that $200,000 per student. Labor believes that everyone has the right to a good education regardless of their socioeconomic background. Therefore we will be keeping our promise of phasing out full-fee-paying courses so that by the year 2010 students will be entering universities based on merit, not on their household income.
Working families have also suffered over the last decade through Howard’s draconian and extreme industrial relations laws, the decline in housing affordability and the rising cost of living. Those three elements combined have led to a lot of people doing it really tough at the moment. The Rudd Labor government acknowledges those problems and is committed to addressing them.
I am proud to say that the government will bury WorkChoices. Changes will include abolishing AWAs but respecting existing contractual arrangements; providing 10 national employment standards; creating a fast and simple unfair dismissals system; simplifying and modernising some 4,300 awards; and creating a new independent umpire—Fair Work Australia.
Throughout the campaign we outlined a comprehensive plan on how to address housing affordability and homelessness. This plan incorporates first home saver accounts, the release of Commonwealth land and talking with the states and territories to develop a national housing affordability agreement. That agreement is just one example of the new cooperation between state and federal governments that will bring an end to the so-called blame game that we saw the previous federal government use extensively as an excuse for doing nothing.
An area that is of great importance to the government is Indigenous affairs. The experience of the last day and a half in Canberra and in Parliament House has been unique and I feel very honoured to have been a part of it. The events that have transpired are truly momentous and are without doubt a highlight of this nation’s history. Today’s apology in both houses of the parliament is but the first step in developing respect and equality amongst all Australians. Our next focus must be on closing the life expectancy gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous people. Australians can already be proud of the government, as we have already shown strength and energy—disproving claims that we would become a ‘me too’ government.
The Governor-General referred to a ‘modern Australia’ in his speech yesterday. A modern Australia can be interpreted as a country which is prepared to be active and is not shackled by conservatism. A modern society also sets targets and takes action. While conservatism is by definition a tendency to resist change, this change of government will see a refreshing approach to how we view the world and how we treat our citizens. We do have a lot of catching up to do.
One area where we need to catch up very quickly is the skills shortage. By not acting on the Reserve Bank predictions of a skills shortage, the former coalition government made this country much less able to take advantage of opportunities in this first decade of the 21st century. Rather than rhetoric, the Labor government has set targets for change. In the Governor-General’s address, for instance, we see specific targets and time lines. I would like to outline a few of those time lines. The government aims to deliver a budget surplus of 1.5 per cent of GDP in 2008-09. It aims to provide an additional 450,000 training places, which will be established over four years, including 65,000 extra apprenticeships, with the first 20,000 places available from April this year. The government has committed to reducing Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions by 60 per cent on 2000 levels by 2050. A major study to help Australia set robust shorter term emission reductions will report in June this year. A national emissions trading scheme will be established by the end of 2010. The time line for an apology to the stolen generations is immediate. Targets have been set for improved education and health among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. The government will withdraw all Australian combat troops from Iraq at the end of the next rotation, due in the middle of the year. Australia’s overseas development assistance will increase to 0.5 per cent of gross national income by 2015-16. There were many other initiatives outlined in the Governor-General’s speech, including plans to reform the health system and to build a world-class education system, as I mentioned before.
Apart from setting targets for a modern, fairer and more efficient and productive society, Labor has demonstrated already its commitment to being modern, as the Governor-General put it, by addressing contemporary and future issues. Under that banner, there are many other things those of us in this chamber would like to see the government implement so that the nation is truly inclusive and fair for all. Personally, I hope that one day soon we can agree on a sensible scheme of universal paid parental leave and stronger legislation to ensure women do not continue to be disadvantaged in the workplace. I would also like to see government legislation amended to remove any provisions that discriminate against Australians because of their race, gender, disability, religion or sexuality. I look forward to the term of this government and look forward to working with all my fellow senators to make a better future for all Australians.
Debate (on motion by Senator Ludwig) adjourned.",SENATE,<title>GOVERNOR-GENERAL’S SPEECH</title>,<title>Address-in-Reply</title>,Governor-General's Speech,1,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2008-02-13,"—This motion is to set the days of sitting for the Senate for this year. As some senators would know, but others may not, it is the Senate itself that chooses the days that it meets to conduct business. The Democrats have expressed concern for a number of years about the inadequate number of days of meeting for the Senate. Under the previous coalition government we saw a consistent decline in the number of days that the Senate met to conduct business—at the same time, I might say, as a consistent increase in the number of pieces of legislation that were put before the chamber. It is very disappointing that this decline in the number of sitting days will continue under the new Labor government. There has been some media coverage of the fact that the House of Representatives is now sitting on Fridays for the first time and that the number of days the House of Representatives is sitting has increased. That has been used to create the perception of the new, hardworking Rudd government. As usual, the media has completely ignored the very different reality in the Senate. I am not going to get into the debate about what the House of Representatives is doing on Fridays and whether or not that constitutes hard work. That is a matter for them.
For the Senate, which is after all the primary chamber where legislation is actually considered in genuine detail—and particularly after July, when no one party or grouping will have control of this chamber—it will be absolutely critical to ensure there is enough time to properly consider different amendments to legislation that are put forward. The parliament and the Senate in particular is a legislature. The Senate is not—or should not be—a debating chamber in which to score political points. It is a chamber that is the primary mechanism for determining the adequacy of the laws that are passed by the national parliament, the laws that affect every person in this country and, indeed, many people outside this country. We should be ensuring that there is adequate time to properly consider those proposed laws and, I might say, any other matters that deserve proper consideration.
We have literally thousands of regulations and ordinances—subsidiary legislation. We also have hundreds of reports that are tabled in this chamber that rarely get consideration. But my primarily concern is the inadequate time to properly consider the legislation itself. Of course, we have Senate committees that meet outside of this chamber and we have estimates committees that meet in addition to the sitting days spent here. We have had estimates committees for a long period of time and have managed to have them meet alongside a much greater number of sitting days than are being put forward here. In total there are just 52 days, spread across 14 sitting weeks, scheduled for this year in the motion before the chamber. As far as I can see, that is the lowest number in a non-election year going back at least 30 years.
When the Howard government first came to office in 1996—and that was in a year when the election was held in March, if I recall correctly, so we did not even sit for the first three months of that year—there were 71 sitting days spread across 16 weeks. In contrast to that, in its first full year the Rudd government—and we will have an entire year—are suggesting just 52 sitting days across 14 sitting weeks. During the previous Labor government, it was basically the norm to have 70-odd sitting days. Back in 1983, the first year of a Labor government—again, an election year—there were 63 sitting days. In the following years there were 62, 74, 86 and 85 sitting days, and then 89 sitting days in 1988 and 92 sitting days in 1989. I think it is unacceptable for the number of sitting days to have declined so dramatically—to just 52 in a full year when there is no election—particularly with a new government coming in.
As we heard yesterday from the Governor-General, the government has a comprehensive program of reform—I appreciate not all of it will require legislation but it certainly will require examination and there will be a lot of legislation. So I think the proposal is inadequate. Perhaps it is understandable, although not necessarily excusable—it is understandable given Realpolitik—that the government wants only 21 sitting days in the first part of the year when the coalition still has a majority. But to have only 31 days in the second half of the year, when the balance of power situation will be back in operation, I think is grossly inadequate.
As usually happens when a new government comes in, there is talk of taking the parliament more seriously and treating it with more respect. I do not think this is a good sign of that. It is more important than just the formality of showing respect; it is important for doing the job properly. I am quite conscious of the fact that I will not be here to take part in the job being done after July—and neither will anyone from the Democrats—so to some extent people could say it does not have anything to do with me in particular, but I think there is a broader message. It is not about any particular party or individual; it is about the job that the Senate has done, certainly from the time the Democrats first appeared—and hopefully after the Democrats disappear—of holding the government to account and properly examining what the government is doing. This is the only chamber that can do that. We all know the House of Representatives is not capable of doing that properly and we do need to ensure that the Senate does meet on a sufficient number of days to properly provide that opportunity and to ensure that the senators themselves have sufficient time to make fully informed decisions. That particularly applies to views and amendments that are put forward by people outside of government. It might seem a long time since the election, but I am sure all on the government side can remember what it was like to be in opposition for that long period of time—it was not that long ago. I am sure you can recall how frustrating it is not to have sufficient time to properly consider amendments and to feel that things are being railroaded through. I think this is quite a bad start in that respect.
There are other aspects of the Rudd government’s start which I think are quite positive. As you know, Madam Acting Deputy President Moore, I always try to take a balanced view of these things, but I think this is not a particularly good sign. To have the lowest number of sitting days for decades, for at least 30 years and probably for many years before that—and quite clearly in a non-election year—is unsatisfactory. It certainly gives the lie to any suggestion that the new government will be a hardworking one, at least in regard to work done in the Senate chamber. I think it is unfortunate. In previous years, when the coalition was in government and motions like this were moved, I moved amendments proposing extra sitting weeks. I have not bothered to do that this time around because of the assumption that it would not be likely to receive support. I think it is quite clear when you look at this schedule that there are number of spaces where at least a couple of extra sitting weeks could easily have been fitted in.

"Ludwig, Sen Joe (Manager of Government Business in the Senate)",ALP,2008-02-13,"—I am sure I have heard before in this chamber the points that Senator Bartlett makes. In respect of the program, it is a planned program. What the Senate does—and has done in the last couple of years—is to ensure there is sufficient time for legislation to be debated by expanding the hours where necessary to ensure that everyone has an opportunity to speak. Given the numbers in this place, I am sure we will continue to debate legislation properly and appropriately and utilise the committee system as we have done in the past to foreshorten debates in the Senate. Of course, Fridays are reserved for Senate committees to meet, and I would encourage the committee chairs to plan their days to ensure that Fridays are utilised for committees to meet to consider legislation and other matters that committees look at.
When a new government comes into parliament, the reality is that in the first half of the year the new government will be working on delivering its election commitments, taking the necessary steps to bring forward its legislative agenda, and ensuring that stakeholders are properly consulted and that the Senate committees can do their work. This means that it is more likely that the second half of the year will be even busier than the first half.
However, the Senate has in the past adjusted its program accordingly to ensure that there is sufficient time to deal with the legislative program. In the past that statement has proved correct. The Senate has adjusted its hours and its times to ensure that debate has been had and that all of those who wanted to speak could speak on these matters. I will not prolong this matter. I do understand the point that Senator Bartlett made; however, I do not agree with it in this respect. The Senate will determine the appropriate times for sittings, as they will do now, and of course the program will generally adjust itself to ensure that we can deal with the legislation that comes forward.

"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2008-02-13,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by ministers to questions without notice asked today.
It is very hard to believe that Prime Minister Rudd promised the Australian people that his ministry would be appointed solely on the basis of merit. The performance we witnessed today shows that, clearly, many other factors were at play other than just merit. In particular, I want to focus on Senator Carr’s performance today which was both pitiful and arrogant but, more importantly, obfuscating. His Prime Minister’s own Standards of Ministerial Ethics say in part, at paragraph 4.4:
Ministers are required to provide an honest and comprehensive account of their exercise of public office ... in response to any ... enquiry by a member of the Parliament ...
The first question asked of Minister Carr saw him breach this much-vaunted new standard. It was a simple question: would he rule out the appointment of former Labor Premier Bracks—and he was unwilling to do so. He will make the announcement tomorrow. He knows who is going to comprise the commission of inquiry—whether it is going to be the Productivity Commission or his mate Steve Bracks. He was unwilling to rule it out. All that he was willing to rule out was that Steve Bracks would be paid $2,000 a day. But then, when asked how much he would be paid, Minister Carr arrogantly refused to answer the question. He is unable to deny that his department suggested a Productivity Commission inquiry instead of the Bracks gravy train. So, confronted with that difficulty, he resorted to the old Labor tactic of raising the decibels to avoid the answer. He resorted to the blame game as well, which Prime Minister Rudd said would not be part of this government’s approach. He resorted to the blame game and he foolishly resorted to his old opposition tactic of trying to blame the difficulties in the automotive industry on the previous government.
Can I remind him that, when he was confronted with the Mitsubishi closure, he very sensibly said: ‘I am not going to pretend that you can wave a magic wand and have this problem go away.’ I agree with him and that is why I make no criticism of him. But yet, when confronted with some hard issues, he reverted to his silly opposition tactic. Of course, what he did that for was to try to obfuscate the fact that undoubtedly Mr Bracks has been lined up for this inquiry.
I hope that as a result of today’s exposure Mr Bracks will no longer be appointed and that the Productivity Commission will deal with the issue, because those that are involved in the automotive industry deserve nothing less. They need a highly professional Productivity Commission inquiry, not something led by a defunct Labor premier, union hacks and a few other mates from the automotive industry.
By Mr Rudd’s own standards we have seen the appointment, in a jobs-for-the-boys situation, of Mr Bracks; we have seen indecent fees; and we have seen the rejection of departmental advice—all in the first decision of this minister, and all enunciated in answer to the very first question that this minister was asked. The Prime Minister would have us believe that Senator Carr was appointed on the basis of merit. If you look through the ministerial list you will see that there is a doctor of economics, Dr Craig Emerson, as Senator Carr’s junior minister. Are we really saying that the hapless Senator Carr is more skilled and competent than Dr Craig Emerson? I think we know the explanation for what occurred: Senator Carr is the spear carrier for the Left in Western Australia. By that virtue alone he had to be appointed to cabinet and people like Dr Craig Emerson had to be avoided.
Coming back to the issue here, we have had on this very first day a refusal to deny a jobs-for-the-boys appointment with an indecent fee and a refusal to acknowledge that departmental advice was rejected. All those factors suggest that something is at play. I hope the government changes its mind.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Answers to Questions</title>,Questions Without Notice: Take Note of Answers,10,1
"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,2008-02-13,"—The Australian people made their judgement about merit on 24 November. The reduced number of representatives that sit on the opposition side of the House of Representatives and the reduced representation that will sit on the other side of the Senate after July demonstrates that, on the issues of merit and performance, the coalition failed. They failed dismally. The Australian people looked to Kevin Rudd and the Labor team to fix up the mistakes and take this country forward. They voted for us overwhelmingly.
Today we had Senator Abetz get up and ask a question about jobs for the boys. Why would any coalition senator ever want to go to that issue? It would take me a lot longer than the five minutes or so that I have to go through the list of all the appointments made by the then coalition government while they were in office—all the mates that they put on inquiries. I will just mention one—Mr Estens and the communications inquiry—but I could go on and on.
But what about the really important issues that you would think they would want to raise in the first taking note of answers debate? One is the issue of climate change. As Minister Penny Wong said, the Labor government’s first action was to ratify the Kyoto protocol. Our standing in the international community went up enormously in Bali at the climate change conference because finally Australia joined the rest of the world to tackle the issue of climate change by signing Kyoto and then going on to establish the Garnaut inquiry.
On the issue of the economy, we were lectured so often by the former Treasurer, the former Prime Minister, and other representatives in this chamber and in the other one about them being the great economic managers. It was the coalition government that delivered us 16 interest rate rises during their entire time in office—seven of them in the last term. We now have to deal with runaway inflation as a result of the unrestrained spending by that government during the last couple of elections when they were endeavouring to buy their way back into office.
Finally the Australian people said: ‘Enough is enough. We aren’t going to cop any more of these bribes in election campaigns or these ad hoc decisions made on funding commitments.’ Despite that temptation—that carrot—they said: ‘Enough is enough. We’ve had enough of this coalition government. We are going to give a Labor government—so brilliantly led by Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard—with a meritorious team of ministers, the opportunity to right the wrongs.’
—And backbenchers!
—Yes, and backbenchers, as Senator Marshall has said. With the amount of talent and merit that is on the backbench and keen to get onto the front bench, we should enlarge the ministry; but unfortunately we cannot. I digress. The real issues are interest rates, inflation and doing something about the skills crisis in this country. The skills crisis affects so much of our manufacturing industry, including the vehicle industry.
There has been a pathetic attack today by Senator Abetz on Senator Carr, who has undertaken to look properly at the motor vehicle industry in this country. We have just had an announcement by Mitsubishi about closure. That is a problem that has been lumped on our desk at the very outset of our getting into government, after those opposite had been in office for 11 years. Minister Carr has taken the issue on board, and we are going to deal with it. So senators opposite should not come in here and lecture us. They have been sitting around for two months since the last election trying to figure out what issues they can attack us on. Well, they have none.
The cost of living is another important issue, and then there is the housing crisis and education. We have made announcements on what we are going to do to give the young kids in this country greater education opportunities. I could go on and on. My time has expired today but I look forward to further opportunities to get up here and remind those opposite of what a pathetic bunch they really are.

"Bernardi, Sen Cory",LP,2008-02-13,"—I would like to raise some points in relation to an answer given by Senator Evans in his capacity as Minister representing the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs—specifically about the rollback of the permit system in Indigenous communities, which the Labor Party has already announced as policy. This is a very important day for Indigenous Australians. The debate and the discussion that have taken place and the motions that were presented to this chamber and to the other place have demonstrated that. The attendance of hundreds if not thousands of people outside and in Parliament House relayed the significance of this day for many Indigenous Australians. Yet Senator Evans has suggested that the rollback of the permit system will somehow preserve and protect Indigenous Australians from those that seek to prey upon their vulnerabilities. I take issue with this because it is simply absurd logic. To suggest that the instigation of a permit system will prevent from entering people—who are already prepared to break the law in so many other ways is just absurd. These people are paedophiles; these people are sly groggers; they are porn peddlers; they are the undesirable filth of Australian communities. They do not care two hoots for the law. They will go in there and they will pursue their nefarious aims irrespective of whether a permit system is in place. This is a very serious issue.
What we do not need in this country is a return to a separation, where one part of our land is only for Indigenous people and lawbreakers and the rest of Australia is prevented from being there. What we need is an open system, where people within these communities can be held to account, where the people that seek to prey on their vulnerabilities will be held to account. We need a system where police can go in and where health workers can go in and check on the welfare of people. We need a system where journalists can go in and continue to hold those within these communities to account. The importance of this is not simply in my mind. This is shared, as Senator Scullion pointed out, by the first Indigenous president of the Australian Labor Party. Whilst I normally do not quote Labor organisational figures, I think that Mr Warren Mundine, a former national president, sums it up pretty well. He told the Weekend Australian that the move to reinstate the permit system could ‘kill any chance the communities had of economic development’. He said it could kill any chance that Aboriginal communities had of economic development. He went on:
The permit system didn’t stop crime. In fact ... crime has flourished under the permit system so it’s a fallacy to say that it helps law-and-order problems.
I will acknowledge that Senator Evans has a deep and meaningful interest in the plight of Indigenous people in this country, but who is better qualified to talk about it and to make an objective assessment of it? Is it an Indigenous leader who led Senator Evans’s party or Senator Evans himself? I would suggest it is the former. This is a very serious issue because the very future of Indigenous people in our country is at stake.
Minister Macklin has simply decided to roll back the clock on Indigenous affairs, pursuing some determination that has existed within the Labor Party for the last 20 years and not acknowledging for a moment that we need a new approach. Today is a very symbolic day. It is a day about moving on. It is a day about moving forward. It is not a day on which we should be forced to talk about rolling back a system that is starting to provide meaningful benefits for Indigenous people in this country. It is appalling that on such a day Minister Evans, representing Minister Macklin, is prepared to undo a lot of the symbolic gestures that have gone forward. I would encourage the Labor Party to revisit this policy because it is an appalling one that is playing politics with people’s lives. It is simply an ideological quest being pursued by the Labor Party.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Answers to Questions</title>,Questions Without Notice: Take Note of Answers,10,1
"O’Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2008-02-13,"—Isn’t it marvellous? I thank Senator Abetz for moving the motion to take note of answers in the way that he did, because it allows me to deal with the range of questions asked by the opposition in question time today. The elephant in the room—the question of the economy; the issue that the coalition claimed was their issue—was absent from their questions list today. Indeed, they were offended by the truths that were put by Senator Evans in answer to a question which was put to him today. We actually expected that the opposition would try and defend their record from when they were in government. But they were not game to do that today. They avoided the question of the economy because they knew that everything that Senator Evans said in answer to his question today was correct. Inflation is our most pressing domestic challenge. It is an inescapable fact that, under the coalition, our rate of underlying inflation grew and grew to the point where for the first time in an election campaign we saw the Reserve Bank increase interest rates, such was the pressure on the economy from growing inflation—inflation which was, in effect, caused by the inaction of the coalition when in government in relation to capacity constraints on the economy. There were 20 occasions on which the Reserve Bank warned their government that those pressures were leading to problems in the economy.
We saw the December CPI data released in January, showing underlying inflation at 3.6 per cent—well over the danger threshold so far as the Reserve Bank was concerned. That is the highest underlying inflation in 16 years. Right through the coalition’s time in government and for a substantial part of the time of the previous government, that rate of underlying inflation had not been reached. But the pressures in the economy under the stewardship of the coalition had grown to a point where it is now clear that we have seen not only an increase in interest rates and pressures from outside our economy increasing interest rates but also the probability of an additional interest rate rise predicted at 70 per cent. They are the challenges that the Labor government now faces in taking the reins of this economy. The fact that the coalition were not prepared to ask one question on the economy today—their first opportunity in this chamber—indicates that they realise they made a shambles of the economic management of this country. Under their stewardship they ignored the warnings from the Reserve Bank—20 warnings about capacity constraints—and we are now paying the price. Unfortunately, home owners and those with credit cards and other debts are likely to pay the price for some time to come. It will take some time for this government to manage the economy and to get it back under control after this opposition, when in government, allowed it to escape their control to the point where the Reserve Bank, as I said, for the first time in history increased interest rates during an election campaign—such was the nature of the pressure that the Reserve Bank felt was coming on this economy.
Let there be no doubt that Labor, in government, has a steely determination to win the war on inflation. We will take responsibility for fixing the problem, a problem that Labor did not create. That is why Prime Minister Rudd has outlined the decisive action we will take by implementing his plan to fight the inflation legacy that we have inherited. We have noted that the opposition now deny that the highest underlying inflation in 16 years is a problem. Frankly, if they cannot see it is a problem, it is no surprise that they allowed the problem to get out of control when in government. As I said, the fact is that home owners, credit card holders and anyone with a debt in this country, except those who were fortunately enough or wily enough to lock in interest rates in the past, will now pay a price in the immediate future and perhaps for some time to come on the mortgages and the credit card debts that they have. They will have the coalition government, the Howard government, to thank for the pressures that they are facing. (Time expired)

"Birmingham, Sen Simon",LP,2008-02-13,"—I am pleased to support the motion that the Senate take note of the answers given by ministers to questions without notice asked today. I do so particularly wishing to focus on Senator Evans’s answer in relation to Indigenous communities, but before I get to that I would like to dwell for a moment on Senator O’Brien’s remarks about the economy.
No amount of hyperbole from Senator O’Brien, Mr Rudd, Mr Swan, Senator Ludwig or anybody else in this chamber or elsewhere can change the reality of the great economy that the Labor Party has inherited, with 35-year lows in unemployment, strong growth in GDP and strong and stable inflation within the Reserve Bank’s target range. No amount of hype can change the reality of a strong economy inherited by those opposite, who are indeed a very lucky and fortunate government to have inherited that economy. What people like Senator O’Brien and Mr Swan need to be very mindful of is that their commentary now can change and influence the economy we get for the future. Mr Swan, in particular, needs to stop urging the Reserve Bank to increase rates. He needs to stop this inflationary crisis of his own making, and he needs to be very careful, mindful and judicious in the comments he makes as the Treasurer of this country.
As I said, in particular I wish to address Senator Evans’s response to the issue of our Indigenous communities. Both yesterday and today have been very symbolic, and I welcome and embrace the changes made in the opening of the parliament yesterday and also the very sincere apology given by both houses of the parliament today. I hope that these symbolic acts will ensure that we take a very positive step forward as a nation towards reconciliation, healing and forgiveness between Indigenous peoples who feel they have been wronged over the years and the rest of the Australian community.
But that symbolism must be matched by the practical. We have seen the Rudd government already place high importance on symbolism across a range of areas, starting with the signing of Kyoto and now in the Indigenous affairs portfolio. While I embrace that symbolism, I expect to see real action that backs it up, action in Indigenous communities that addresses the fact that we have real and great disadvantage—which the previous government recognised and acted on very sincerely. This disadvantage sees low educational standards, low life expectancy, poor health standards, low social capital and poor housing. These are the challenges that need to be met and confronted head on.
Instead, we have a government that appears as though it is going to take us backwards in Indigenous policy. The previous government took some great steps last year in trying to tackle endemic disadvantage in our Indigenous communities, particularly in Indigenous communities in the Northern Territory. We now see a government that is committed to rolling that back by reintroducing a permit system, which was discredited and which was a reason behind the harm caused in many of these communities. We now see a government that is going to reintroduce CDEP, a program that provided sit-down money and that did not encourage the economic development of the communities.
We heard before from my colleague and friend Senator Bernardi about some of the comments of the Labor Party’s former federal president, Warren Mundine, in regard to this—the fact that the permit system did not stop crime and that it is a fallacy to say it helped law and order. Indeed, it is a fallacy. Senator Evans claims that reintroducing permits can help protect these communities. That was not the case for decade after decade when these permits existed. Senator Evans needs to reconsider the logic of his arguments there because, as the Australian reported on 18 January this year:
History shows pedophiles, sly groggers, porn peddlers and other undesirables either ignore permits or collude with the gatekeeper.
The permit system did not work. Labor claims that permits will help the development of communities. That also is shown to be a fallacy. Galarrwuy Yunupingu, former Australian of the Year and land rights campaigner, when speaking last year in relation to the Howard government reforms, said that he believed this new model would empower traditional owners to control the development of towns and living areas.

"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2008-02-13,"—I wish to take note of the answer provided by the Minister representing the Minister for Education. Firstly, we are pleased that the Labor government is moving on preschool, but I was disappointed in the minister’s ability to answer the question concerning the many other issues that plague Indigenous education.
Even if you just focus on preschool, there are some huge problems to be addressed here. It is not enough to say that all four-year-olds need to be in preschool in remote areas. What we know is that there are measures that need to be put in place to see that they thrive in these circumstances—one of which is that bilingual education be made available to them. That certainly needs Indigenous education workers who are locally based, because the evidence shows that they will attract attendance and they will be much more successful in the transformation from childhood through preschool into school.
There are huge problems both within preschool education and beyond. The 2004 inquiry of the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Workplace Relations and Education had an enormous number of very serious and worrying findings and made 34 recommendations for action. I think none of those recommendations was taken up by the last government, and I would hope that this new government would make an announcement as soon as possible that it will do so.
Some of the health problems associated with Indigenous education—and we have had many inquiries on this subject—include diseases like otitis media, which, if untreated, can cause deafness and even complete deafness. This is a major problem for children attending school. If they cannot hear anything, then they are not likely to turn up day after day. We also know that there are very, very high levels of trachoma. A study recently conducted showed that in north-west Australia up to 50 per cent, or more, of children have active trachoma, which can lead to blindness.
As with so many other issues for Indigenous people, it is not wise and it is not possible to solve problems by simply taking them one at a time. In the case of education, it is to do with the availability of teachers who are properly skilled in Indigenous education in these remote areas. It is to do with the necessity of providing a learning environment which is both culturally suitable and which includes the use of the language spoken by that child. We need to fix some of those health problems which, frankly, can only be fixed if we fix the housing problems. The extent of problems in Indigenous communities is such that cherry-picking bits and pieces and coming up with bright ideas, as Labor has done—and again I welcome it—is not enough. What we want to see from Labor is a much more comprehensive approach and one which will solve some of the educational problems across the board.
Let me just mention a couple of the other problems we discovered. In the Northern Territory there are Aboriginal communities where there are substantial sized primary schools but no availability whatsoever of secondary schools. Why the Commonwealth has allowed the Northern Territory to get away with this for so long, I cannot imagine. There are schools that are poorly equipped—frankly, you would not put your dog in some of the ones that I have been into—and yet we have seen no substantial increase in funding for infrastructure. The Northern Territory is still, as I understand it, funding schools on the basis of average attendance. In other words, at the beginning of the semester or when the weather is right—when it is not the wet season—there may be too many students to fit even in the classroom, because they are funded for the average. There will be huge class sizes. As a result, students drift off, they become uninterested in education—if they ever were interested in the first place—and they disappear. That has to be fixed.
With regard to housing, as I said, it is not uncommon in Indigenous communities for 20 people to be in one house. This means there are very few books for children. There is no time for quiet study or advancement of their education. (Time expired)

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2008-02-13,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
This report is the latest in a long line of reports from the Immigration Ombudsman and responses from the immigration minister. It is the first response from the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship under the new Labor government, Senator Chris Evans, whom I congratulate in being appointed to that extremely important role.
Senators would recall that the relevant section of the Migration Act, section 486O, was put in place a couple of years ago following a fair bit of agitation from a number of backbenchers in the then government, most notably from the member for Kooyong, Mr Georgiou. Section 486O required the Ombudsman to investigate the long-term detention of every person who was in immigration detention for over a year. I remind the Senate and the community that people in immigration detention have not been charged, let alone convicted, with any offence. It is so-called administrative detention which leads to people being jailed, at least in these cases, for a year or more.
The minister’s response relates to 154 assessments made by the Commonwealth Immigration Ombudsman, and I note and welcome the remarks of the new minister expressing his serious concern that so many detention cases have taken so long to resolve. It is over two years since this section was put in the Migration Act and it was meant to assuage community concerns about the large number of people who were in administrative detention—jailed in effect—for years and years without charge or accusation of any wrongdoing. The clear impression given at the time was that the government would investigate all the existing cases and try to minimise, in the future, the likelihood of people being in immigration detention for prolonged periods of time.
But, as the minister’s response notes, 12 of the individuals referred to in the Ombudsman’s statement remain in immigration detention and he also notes that an additional 61 people currently in immigration detention have been detained for longer than two years. It is important to continue to draw attention to the fact, detailed throughout these reports—and this is just the latest in a long line—that outrageously prolonged jailing of people who have neither been charged with a crime, nor convicted or even accused of any breach of the law, continues to this day and is continuing now. There are 61 people detained in immigration detention for two years or more and they are not all asylum seekers, I should add, as there are a range of reasons why people end up in immigration detention.
The key issues and concerns of the community which were so strong and led to that widely publicised backbench revolt have dissipated since that time, I believe in part because people assume that the problem no longer exists. The problem still exists. I welcome the fact that the new minister has specifically in his response indicated his serious concern that many of these cases have taken so long to resolve and that there are such a large number of people. Nobody should be jailed without charge or trial for years at a time—that is simply an abomination—yet we have 61 people who have been in administrative immigration detention for two years or more.
I welcome the minister’s indication of his desire to try and resolve these cases quickly and that is a positive move. It is a different type of comment to that attached to statements in the past from previous ministers. I note with most cases detailed here that the people who were investigated, who had been locked up for prolonged periods and who had got out, were given permanent protection visas—meaning they were refugees all along. So they suffered that enormous amount of unnecessary trauma of long-term detention, at great taxpayer expense, yet ended up being given visas at the end of it all anyway. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

"McEwen, Sen Anne",ALP,2008-02-13,"—In June 2007 I rose in this place to record the extent to which many South Australian workers and, in particular, former employees of James Hardie had become victims of the debilitating and often fatal diseases associated with that company and the asbestos industry generally. Those victims often included the workers’ families and, over time, others unwittingly exposed to the now recognised dangers of the products. At that time I made particular mention of some people whose long dedication to exposing the dangers of asbestos, as a raw material and in the many product forms it took, was responsible for the education of workers and the public, leading to the legislative prohibition of the product. Two of those noted at the time were Bernie Banton and Jack Watkins.
Bernie Banton died at age 61, in late November 2007, of mesothelioma contracted from working in the asbestos industry. Mr Banton was front and centre in the bitter fight for justice for victims of asbestos diseases, and his passing was marked by tributes from workers and their unions and the parliamentary leaders of all sides of politics. He and his six-year campaign will be long remembered through the compensation fund established as a consequence of his energies.
Bernie had survived Jack Watkins by less than a month. Jack passed away in his sleep on Tuesday, 16 October 2007, as a result of chronic emphysema. He was aged 72. Jack was born in pre-war Birmingham, and his early childhood was marked by the bombings and desolation of that city and the subsequent post-war shortages and poverty of his working-class family. Leaving school at age 13, Jack worked at those labouring jobs reserved for those who, through no fault of their own, were poorly educated. He quickly came to understand the dirty and often dangerous nature of those jobs. He also joined a union, a continuous characteristic and passion throughout his whole life. Jack married young, and his wife, Cathy, became his greatest supporter and a source of inspiration and fierce pride for him. He and Cathy worked hard to provide an upbringing and home life for their two children that was better than their own had been. Despite a measure of success from their labours, in 1966 Jack and Cathy decided to migrate to Australia.
Following their arrival, finding and holding jobs was sometimes difficult for Jack because, despite the need to provide for his family, he could not just ‘roll over’ when confronted with job issues; he was compelled to speak up. This included advocating for his own and other families over issues arising from their initial hostel accommodation in Adelaide. His preparedness and ability to tackle such issues led to a period as an organiser with the plumbers and gasfitters union. A following stint in the building and construction industry led inevitably to a similar role with the Builders Labourers Federation, which, along with other building unions, was increasingly involved in exposing the incidence of asbestos in the building and construction industry.
The painful death of a union member from asbestos exposure, and the subsequent devastating effect on the worker’s family, drove Jack to a focused and lifelong fight for the control and eradication of those materials and for justice for the victims of their effects. As an organiser with the Builders Labourers Federation, Jack was equally at home in arguing his case ‘from the stump’ at meetings of members, where he made health and safety ‘union business’, as he was with employers and parliamentarians. His input into formal asbestos awareness campaigns was extensive. Jack’s approach to campaign activity was at times very unorthodox but, more often than not, very effective. In circumstances where he believed formal approaches were either too slow or meeting such resistance as to place workers, and indeed the public, at risk, Jack was never one to shy away from direct action. There were many occasions during the early 1970s when workers and the public would arrive at buildings in the central business district of Adelaide to be confronted with a bright yellow sticker emblazoned with a black death’s head and the legend ‘Danger’ affixed to the front doors. Jack correctly assumed that the ensuing inquiry would provoke awareness of, and action around, asbestos products in those buildings.
A continuing part of Jack’s energies was focused on schools where it was found that young people were suffering likely exposure to the material. Perhaps in part as a consequence of him being denied a proper education, Jack had a passion for the continuing education of the young. Through the actions of Jack Watkins and others, South Australia as a state now enjoys a reputation as a national leader in asbestos safety management and legislative control. Such has not always been the case. During a period of time when the South Australian parliament was debating early legislation for the control of asbestos, Jack was confronted with an instance of lunacy—presumably industry led—suggesting that asbestos was so safe you could eat it. Appalled that such dangerous, indeed life-threatening, nonsense was being repeated in the parliament, Jack again took direct action. During the debate, from the Strangers Gallery, he sprinkled a white substance to the chamber floor below. The reaction from those parliamentarians below was not as if they were receiving manna from heaven; rather, it was described as pandemonium. In the midst of this, Jack was arrested, handcuffed and brought before the Speaker. Charged with contempt of parliament, Jack was banned from its precincts for three years and he was forbidden to even mount the steps of parliament house. For that period his presence at parliament house demonstrations was always publicly acknowledged as being from ‘the terrace below’.
Jack later pointed out that his action was not driven by contempt but by frustration that the rate and pace of legislative change was not such that it prevented injury, illness and death of workers. He understood very well the powerful tools provided by legislation and was a tireless worker for, and later major architect of, South Australia’s asbestos laws. The resultant publicity was, however, a platform from which Jack would capably argue the case to ban the production and use of asbestos and to control and restrict, where necessary, the use of other dangerous and injurious materials. In 1979 the South Australian government established the Asbestos Advisory Board, in the affairs of which Jack participated as a member from inception until his death. During the late eighties the then South Australian Trades and Labour Council appointed Jack as the council’s Asbestos and Toxic Waste Liaison Officer to coordinate trade union and associated campaigns and to establish and maintain one of the very first asbestos registers in Australia. It is a mark of Jack’s commitment that, after the grant funds were exhausted, he continued the project without any salary.
Jack fought both state and federal governments for the remediation of the Islington Railway Workshops site, in Adelaide, and its conversion to a public park. The site was finally cleared of asbestos and toxic wastes, landscaped and named the Jack Watkins Memorial Park. Jack insisted that it stand as a tribute to workers who have died from an asbestos related disease. In 2001 Jack was awarded the Centenary Medal for services to workplace health, particularly in the area of asbestos investigation and education. From its formation in 2005, he became President of the Asbestos Diseases Society of South Australia and was a member of the Asbestos Victims Association and the Asbestos Coalition.
Often described as an industrial ‘hard man’—and most certainly a formidable opponent—Jack was also a man who was awed by the natural world and had an intense love of the written word, poetry and verse. He was a proud man, dedicated to his family, and the death of his wife, Cathy, from cancer was a profound loss to him. Jack was posthumously awarded the inaugural lifetime achievement award for occupational health and safety by SafeWork SA. The citation notes his decade-long contribution at the grassroots level in advocating for and supporting those affected by asbestos. Jack’s participation in the development of South Australia’s asbestos laws and regulations will long stand as testimony to his dedication and activism and is his legacy to workers and their families.
His commitment and achievement remains an inspiration to those continuing in the struggle to prevent asbestos disease and to secure justice for those already afflicted. Jack’s passing should also stand as a reminder to those of us who can effect positive change that the work to avoid or ease the suffering of those with industrial diseases is far from over. A thumbnail of Jack’s life and activism appears in the book Movers and Shakers, which was launched just two days after his death. That book records stories of activists who have made a difference in South Australia. Jack Watkins was certainly a mover and shaker.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Mr Jack Watkins</title>,Adjournment,25,1
