"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2003-10-09,"—I believe a reading of the amendment will indicate that a word was simply left out of the original motion and that it makes no material difference. It just makes the motion make sense, if you like, grammatically.
—Thank you for that explanation.
—I move the motion as amended:
That the Senate notes, with concern, that the statement by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) on so-called `Senate reform' was provided to the media at midday on Wednesday, 8 October 2003, but that advance copies had not been provided to senators through the usual channels until three and a half hours later.

"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2003-10-09,"—I move:
That the Migration Amendment Regulations 2003 (No. 6), as contained in Statutory Rules 2003 No. 224 and made under the Migration Act 1958, be disallowed.
Labor is today disallowing migration regulations relating to temporary protection visas put forward by this Liberal-National Party government. Labor will not vote to extend a bad system, a flawed system, to even more people. The Howard Liberal government has used temporary protection visas in a way that the name makes clear cannot ever have been intended. The Howard Liberal government uses temporary protection as a type of visa to keep people in long-term limbo. Labor's refugee and asylum seeker policy released last year made clear that we do not support a system of long-term rolling protection visas. Short-term temporary protection can be appropriate, but long-term limbo is just a recipe for misery.
Having adopted this as our policy some time ago, it was clear that Labor could not and would not support the Liberal government's latest attempts to spread the system to even more people. Labor is moving to disallow these new regulations for two key reasons. Firstly, the regulations seek to extend the failing, rolling TPV system to a new class of people. These regulations seek to cover people who arrived lawfully—perhaps as tourists or students—and then make a protection claim. Secondly, the regulations give the minister even more extensive personal powers at a time when this ability to exercise the existing powers are being questioned through the Senate ministerial discretion inquiry, the so-called cash for visas inquiry.
So let us go to the details of these regulations and why Labor is voting against them. The government's regulations seek to initiate several significant changes to our onshore humanitarian system. As noted above, the regulations would extend the temporary protection visa, TPV, system that applies to unauthorised arrivals to those who arrive on another type of visa and then later make a protection claim. Effectively, this means everyone seeking protection onshore will only ever get temporary protection. Labor cannot support such a scheme. 
Secondly, the regulations seek to extend the minister's personal discretion to grant permanent protection or allow people to apply for permanent protection if the minister considers it is in the public interest. This is from a former Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs who, for the past six months, has been under serious scrutiny for his role in the cash for visas scandal, currently the subject of a full Senate inquiry process. The evidence is mounting that the former minister, still a minister in another portfolio of course, misused his powers of personal discretion, creating a very strong perception within the community that if you are able to make contact with someone who is close friends with the minister—and even make donations to the Liberal party—you have a better chance of getting a visa granted. Expanding your own personal discretion powers when the way in which they are exercised is already under question shows a very strange set of standards from a minister of the Crown. Labor will ensure not only that Mr Ruddock is held to account for his expansive and, perhaps, improper use of ministerial discretion for the past 7½ years but also that the new minister, Senator Vanstone, deals with the problems she has inherited and that greater accountability and transparency is introduced into a system that is open to corruption.
 Thirdly, the regulations seek to remove the seven-day rule for those who arrived prior to 27 September 2001, a rule that effectively stopped people who had stayed in another country on their way to Australia for more than seven days and had not sought protection there from ever being able to apply for permanent protection in Australia. This measure is regarded by many as positive and, on its own, it could be supported. In fact, Labor asked the Liberal government to separately provide for this measure, but it has refused to do so. The seven-day rule is a punitive measure that now appears to be completely unworkable, impossible to assess and possibly unlawful. Therefore, the Liberal government is trying to rectify problems of its own creation in this set of regulations. 
The Liberal government has even said that this measure was simply tidying up unintended consequences of its own previous legislative changes. A bit of mea culpa and accepting responsibility for getting it wrong in the first place would not go astray. Such remorse is never shown. There is never any admission by anyone in this government, including the former minister, that they ever do anything wrong. It is always, `Blame someone else.' However, it cannot be expected when it is noted that this slightly beneficial measure would have applied only to some and the seven-day rule would continue to apply to everyone arriving after 27 September 2001.
Finally, the regulations allow for temporary protection visas to be granted for shorter periods than under the current 36- or 60-month rule. The former minister for immigration claims that this has been done to allow family groups who arrive separately to be dealt with together, but the regulations give this power in an unrestricted way. The power could also be used for other purposes, including for putting all people from certain nationality groupings onto short-term visa periods. Lamely, the Liberal government has tried to attack Labor for opposing these regulations, and it has wheeled out the same old chestnut saying that Labor is soft on border protection. As anyone can see from the description of these regulations above, not one of them has a skerrick of relevance to border protection. In fact, they apply to people who lawfully cross our borders and then claim.
The Liberal government's contention and argument is wrong. It is silly and it is baseless, and their claims on this front show how desperately political the Liberal government have become in this area. They try to paint every migration measure through the prism of so-called border protection. Despite this hysteria, Labor will continue to assess each piece of legislation on its merits. In making their spurious claims about Labor, it is worth reminding the Senate that when One Nation initially raised the idea in 1998 of only ever granting temporary protection to asylum seekers, the former minister, Mr Ruddock, responded with outrage, stating:
What One Nation would be saying is that they have no place in Australia. They are only here temporarily. Can you imagine what temporary entry would mean for them? It would mean that people would never know whether they would be able to remain here. There would be uncertainty, particularly in terms of attention given to learning English, in addressing the torture and trauma so they heal from some of the tremendous physical and psychological wounds they have suffered. So I regard One Nation's approach as being highly unconscionable in a way that most thinking people would clearly reject.
That was the former minister, Mr Ruddock, in 1998. Yet how quickly the former minister and the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, changed their tune when they saw the political opportunity present itself a few years ago, and now they are trying it on again. We now see a Liberal government and a minister for immigration prepared to implement the worst of One Nation policies on the one hand while claiming they are making our immigration system more fair and consistent. The refugee advocacy groups have not swallowed this line, and the many thousands of people on TPVs have not swallowed this line. We believe that many hundreds of communities throughout Australia who have worked and lived with TPV holders over the past four years are also not prepared to swallow this line. 
The former minister also specifically chose to use regulations or delegated legislation, as he so often did in this area, rather than to have a full debate through the use of primary legislation, even though at least traditionally major changes such as these would be undertaken through the introduction of an amending bill. The former minister knows full well that the changes that he was introducing were going to significantly change the way Australia exercises its responsibilities under the UN refugee convention, yet he still opted for this course. With such a major change as ensuring that no onshore protection claimants would be eligible for anything other than a series of rolling temporary protection visas, the former minister should have used primary legislation that would be open to the full and proper scrutiny of both houses of parliament. Both the former minister and his department have admitted to—almost boasted about—the design of these regulations, intentionally combining some beneficial measures in these regulations with a much more unpalatable measure to extend the seriously flawed and unfair TPV regime of this government to all people arriving in Australia and making a claim for protection.
The way in which the regulations have been drafted, tying the implementation of each of the provisions to the rest of the regulations, also means the Liberal government has intentionally created a situation where we can only disallow the measures as a whole. That is what is required under the law and the regulation determining how the Senate deals with these matters. Despite written requests to the former minister, Mr Ruddock, he has refused to contemplate separating these measures. Therefore, we have a situation where the beneficial measures are being sacrificed for the sake of not allowing the more sinister measures through. The minister has designed it this way, but the public can understand and see through this tactic, and they are the ones calling strongly for Labor and others to oppose these regulations. 
It should also be noted that, although refugee advocates have in the past argued for consistency, such as in the abolition of the seven-day rule and the alignment of family claims, this new approach, to take the lowest common denominator, is certainly not what they were looking for. We have already received strong representations from many refugee advocacy groups and thousands of individual letters asking us to disallow the regulations on the basis that, firstly, consistency will be delivered only by extending the bad part of the TPV system to all onshore applicants; secondly, the seven-day rule will continue to apply to everyone post 27 September 2001; and, thirdly, the power to grant visas may be used for classes of applicants other than just family groups. In fact, the Refugee Council of Australia has developed an extensive position paper in response to the Liberal government's proposed changes to TPVs, highlighting the inherent problems with this government's policy on temporary protection for asylum seekers. The UNHCR has also raised serious concerns about these measures.
In conclusion, Labor believes that Australia must have stronger border protection and that it should deter both the misuse of our migration system by people without genuine claims and the practice of people-smuggling that encourages people to arrive unauthorised. But altering the temporary protection system for those with genuine claims does not meet this objective. Labor believes that the Liberal government has cynically manipulated and perverted the temporary protection visa class since its original inception in 1999 where it is now being used purely as a disincentive to anyone from applying for protection in Australia. In contrast, Labor believes that a well-managed TPV system can deliver benefits both to us as a nation wishing to deter people-smuggling and to people seeking temporary refuge from untenable situations in their home country.
Labor have already announced that we would keep a short-term TPV for asylum seekers who have arrived unauthorised and at the expiration of this short-term TPV we would assess fairly and transparently whether the circumstances from which they have fled have significantly changed. If nothing has changed, they would then be granted a temporary protection visa—not just another temporary visa, as this Liberal government would do. We have also announced that we would give priority to family reunion applications from those who have settled in the regions of Australia designated as being in need of population and having labour force shortages.
In conclusion, I would like to emphasise that Labor is disappointed that the previous immigration minister, Mr Ruddock, was not prepared to separate the measures within these regulations. The fixes to the parts of the TPV regime which are currently unfair and unworkable are tied to the draconian expansion of temporary protection to all onshore applications. We have asked on several occasions for the Liberal government to allow this separation to happen. We have asked the new immigration minister, Senator Vanstone, to consider this request. She could decide that today she will mark out a new era for immigration policy in this country, but until she does we will vote against these regulations and ensure that temporary protection visas are not the only type of protection visa that asylum seekers applying here can receive.
This is a matter of principle and a matter of international precedence. If our international obligations under the refugee convention mean so little to this Liberal government that they are prepared to duck, weave and pervert the use of domestic law in the way they have tried to do in this instance, then we believe that as a responsible Labor opposition we have no alternative but to disallow in total the new measures they have put forward. It is time that this Liberal government were held to account for their misuse and abuse of this parliament through using delegated legislation for matters that should clearly be considered and debated through primary legislation. It is also time that the actions of the previous minister for immigration, Mr Ruddock, in making the immigration system so dependent on his own personal use of ministerial discretion whenever it suited him were completely exposed.
Labor oppose these regulations and today move to disallow them. In addition, we ask the Liberal government to come back to this place with an amended set of regulations if they are in fact serious about fixing the existing problems they have created from the TPV regime.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION AMENDMENT REGULATIONS 2003 (NO. 6)</title>,<title>Motion for Disallowance</title>,Miscellaneous,21,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2003-10-09,"—The Democrats will support this motion to disallow migration regulations. I say at the outset that it is very disappointing to be in a situation where we are forced to do so and therefore negate some positive measures that will assist many people. Most of the time when I am talking about the disgraceful policy Australia has towards refugees I try to be reasonably gentle towards the Labor Party, encouraging them to slowly move towards a better policy. They have moved a small way, but not very far, as can be seen from the previous speech by Senator Sherry. I know Senator Sherry is not the portfolio holder so he has simply got his marching orders but, frankly, Labor's approach on this issue has been a combination of breathtaking hypocrisy and absolute stupidity. I am absolutely furious that we are in a situation where we have to damage the future of a whole lot of people simply because of their inability or unwillingness to take an alternative approach. They had an opportunity a couple of weeks ago—through an amendment that the Democrats moved to legislation—to prevent the government from introducing this expansion of temporary protection visas and they chose not to take it.
Senator Sherry says that the public understand this government's tactic and see through it. I am afraid that the public do not, and that is why the public have been repeatedly urging us to simply disallow these regulations and then introduce new ones that will reintroduce the positive measures. Unfortunately, the Senate cannot introduce regulations. The Democrats attempted to do that through primary legislation and were thwarted by the ALP on the excuse: `The government won't accept it, so why bother voting for it in the first place?' A fabulous argument! But we will continue to do so. We will seek to reintroduce the positive measure in this through amendments to other legislation when it comes up. I put the government on notice about that. I make no apology for it, because it is an example of where this government quite openly and deliberately has intertwined three distinctly different issues in regulations and made them impossible to be separated.
An official from the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, Mr Walker, made that absolutely clear at a Senate committee hearing into the legislation. The departmental official also said it is fair to say that it is an approach that has not been used before. As was said by Senator Ludwig at the time, it is an approach that is effectively designed to prevent the Senate from disallowing part of it. I suppose you could say that is clever politics, that is the government being cute, but if they want to abuse the process in that way then we will have to explore other avenues to get outcomes that reflect what the Senate desires to do, and that will have to be through amendments to primary legislation. That is not the best way of doing it but is the only option we have if the government continues to pursue approaches of intertwining separate measures in regulations as a deliberate mechanism to prevent them being separately disallowed.
Senator Sherry said we should hear some mea culpa from the government about this seven-day rule, fixing up an unintended consequence of previous legislation. It probably would be nice to hear that from the government, but personally I am pleased that they actually made an attempt to fix this because it is an area many groups have been trying to get them to address for a long period of time. Speaking of mea culpa, how about a mea culpa from the Labor Party, who supported the legislation that had that consequence in it and plenty of other negative consequences that still exist today? To simply pretend that the mess that things are now in in relation to refugees in Australia is somehow all the government's fault is a very convenient ignoring of quite recent history.
We even hear, quite rightly, Senator Sherry pointing out Mr Ruddock's outrage when One Nation talked about temporary protection visas in 1998. There was outrage from the Labor Party as well, as there should have been, as there was from the Democrats. That outrage did not count for much a year later when the government introduced temporary protection visas and the Labor Party supported them and did not support a Democrat attempt to disallow the introduction of those temporary protection visas. We refer to, as was done, the policy of the UNHCR and of the refugee council regarding TPVs. They are quite unequivocal in their criticism of the temporary protection visa regime, yet Senator Sherry goes on to point out that it is still part of Labor Party policy. Great stuff!
Nonetheless, we are pleased that we are not extending the policy to require temporary protection visas for people who arrive in an authorised fashion. That is a welcome move and, obviously, one that the Democrats strongly support. As a party we have consistently and strongly opposed the introduction of temporary protection visas from the first instant and, indeed, even voiced concerns when the safe haven visa was first introduced for the Kosovo refugees, because of the potential for it to be abused and misused in the future by the minister and the absolute and unaccountable power that the minister got from it. Of course, we have been proven right in relation to that as well.
This is a situation where we are trying to figure out the lesser of two evils. Certainly, the Democrats would have preferred the ability to remove the evil altogether and leave the good behind. Instead, we are having to throw out a significant measure—and it is a significant measure—to remove the problem of the seven-day rule for a whole group of people. The seven-day rule applies for a whole lot of other people. I would be interested to hear why Labor thinks it is good for it to be removed for one group of people but still supported legislation that brought it in for a whole lot of other people.
It should be emphasised that temporary protection visas are unnecessary and incredibly cruel. Sure, people's circumstances can change at home, and they may only want temporary refuge from that persecution, but it should be for that person once they have been found to have been legitimately fleeing persecution to decide for themselves when they want to go back. Many refugees do. Many people who have got permanent visas here as refugees—some who have become citizens—have subsequently gone back when circumstances have changed. But let us have people being able to make that decision for themselves. Let us not have an unaccountable, non-transparent government process deciding whether it is safe for somebody who has been found to be a refugee to be flung back into a horrendous situation. Let us not have people living with complete uncertainty on temporary visas, not knowing whether they will be forced back in the future, not being able to properly settle in Australia and not being able to make the contribution to their new country that they would like to make.
Temporary protection visas are bad across the board. They remove the power of refugees to determine their own future and leave it in the hands of bureaucrats. The regime removes the power of refugees to get on with their lives and recover from the trauma that they have experienced, and basically leaves their future in someone else's hands. Nobody should be put in that situation, least of all people as vulnerable and as damaged as many refugees are. The entire temporary protection visa regime should be abolished and the Democrats will continue to work towards that goal. We will continue to encourage the Labor Party to further shift their position to recognise that their acquiescence all the way back in 1999 was a bad mistake. In my view, that is where they really lost the debate with the government about refugee policy—when they caved in and kept their head down for the next two years—rather than when the Tampa appeared on the horizon. It was too late by then.
In the meantime, this attempt to further expand TPVs will be defeated, and that is a welcome move. The Democrats will seek to move amendments to future legislation to address what the government is trying to do with part of these regulations—that is, deal with the anomaly to do with the seven-day rule and also the alignment of family visas. It should be emphasised that by doing this the Senate is significantly harming the circumstances of a large number of people. We had the opportunity to take an alternative approach that would not have had this outcome, and that opportunity was not taken up. The Democrats will be looking for other opportunities and hope that we have more success down the track in relation to that.
Certainly, a message needs to go back to those many Australians who, quite rightly and welcomely, urged the Senate to prevent the expansion of temporary protection visas. They need to know that the Senate cannot introduce a regulation to reinstate the bits that we like. That is not within our power. It is unfortunate, although not surprising—I do not expect the public to understand the intricacies of delegated legislation and how that power works here—that they were not aware of that. We will certainly be making sure that they are, because the pressure will need to be kept on to try to reintroduce the positive measure regarding the seven-day rule. It just will not be able to be done via regulation. We will seek to do it through other means. It is only one component of the very large number of areas where refugees are suffering in the Australian community.
All the reasons that the Senate is disallowing this measure in relation to temporary protection visas go back to what was wrong with temporary protection visas in the first place. Whilst this decision of the Senate—a positive decision—will prevent a greater number of people being put on temporary protection visas, it should be remembered that there are nonetheless many thousands of refugees in Australia on temporary protection visas. For many of them, those visas have expired and they have reapplied and have not been assessed. They are then left in absolute limbo with no idea whether they could be deported within a couple of weeks or a month. Try getting on with your life in that sort of circumstance!
All of those people are being prevented from being reunited with their immediate families. They cannot leave Australia without being unable to return, and their families will never get permission to come here. That is one of the fundamentally evil parts of the temporary protection visa. Australians are probably not aware that there are nine men—refugees—on temporary protection visas with wives and young children who have been on Nauru for two years and who are being prevented from rejoining their husbands. They are being told that they are separate individuals who do not meet the criteria for refugee status even though their husbands do. They are being told that they have to return to Afghanistan and Iraq, and maintain and perpetuate—probably for all time—that separation between husband and wife and, most cruelly, father and young children, some of whom have never seen their fathers.
I challenge any senator in this place to talk with any of those people and not recognise the absolutely unspeakable cruelty that is being inflicted on them, particularly on those children. That is why the temporary protection visa regime should be abolished across the board. That is why it is welcome that at least it is not being expanded. But let us not think that that is really addressing the core of the problem. The core of the problem is thousands of people whose lives are in limbo, whose lives are being destroyed and whose children's futures are being stolen. We still have a long way to go to reverse that situation.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION AMENDMENT REGULATIONS 2003 (NO. 6)</title>,<title>Motion for Disallowance</title>,Miscellaneous,21,1
"Minchin, Sen Nick",LP,2003-10-09,"—The moving of this disallowance motion shows that the Labor Party simply cannot be trusted on immigration matters or border protection. The Australian Democrats' support of it shows how completely out of touch they are. God forbid they will ever be in government, and they never will be. I will turn now to the package of regulations we are dealing with. It comprises three quite deliberately balanced elements that together are designed to improve the integrity and effectiveness of Australia's effort to protect refugees and contribute to international resettlement, and I emphasise the latter. These regulations will ensure that Australia's onshore protection arrangements are consistent and fair. They build on the work already done to remove incentives for people to misuse our onshore protection provisions by using travel to Australia and refugee claims to obtain residence at the expense of refugees, who are in need of resettlement.
This package has three basic elements: it restores access to permanent protection for temporary protection visa holders who did not lodge a further protection visa application prior to the introduction of legislation on 27 September 2001; it broadens coverage of TPV arrangements to include all asylum seekers arriving in Australia, not just those who arrived unlawfully, and we stand firmly behind that provision; and it provides the ability to grant TPVs and offshore temporary humanitarian visas for periods shorter than those currently stated in the regulations. The real issue is the consequence of disallowance. Disallowance would mean that 2,400 TPV holders would lose entitlement to a permanent protection visa if they were successful on reconsideration and that the government's capacity to align family situations would be removed.
Senator Sherry raised the issue of splitting up this package, and the government have made it quite clear that we will not do that. We will not do that because this package ensures greater consistency and closer alignment with international practice, which emphasises that for most refugees the appropriate response is to provide interim protection until they can return home in safety. That is something the Democrats completely and utterly fail to understand or acknowledge. It will also ensure that the beneficial elements are balanced with some which send a very clear signal regarding border protection. The integrity of our immigration arrangements is vital to Australia's national security, and that is utterly consistent with public opinion. The package will also ensure that Australia's efforts to protect refugees and contribute to international resettlement are improved. We strongly oppose this disallowance motion and trust the Senate will not disallow these important regulations.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION AMENDMENT REGULATIONS 2003 (NO. 6)</title>,<title>Motion for Disallowance</title>,Miscellaneous,21,1
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2003-10-09,"—I want to exercise very briefly my right of reply. I point out to the Senate chamber and to those listening to the debate that the new Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, Senator Vanstone, is not here. If these regulations are, as Senator Minchin has claimed—incorrectly—so important to Australia's security, what happened to the minister at her first opportunity to come in and contribute to the debate? She squibbed it. She did not turn up; she did not front. If they are so important, the minister should have been in here to make a contribution. As I have stated, Labor will be voting to disallow these regulations, and I look forward to Labor's disallowance motion being carried by the Senate chamber.
Question put:
That the motion (Senator Sherry's) be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION AMENDMENT REGULATIONS 2003 (NO. 6)</title>,<title>Motion for Disallowance</title>,Miscellaneous,21,1
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,2003-10-09,"—With respect to this motion, I am a bit disappointed that while we are here we will not be taking the opportunity to deal with matters such as government business or other business. In other words, we should utilise some of the waiting time on the two days that the parliament will be recalled. That would be useful, since a number of senators over a period of time have complained about the lack of time, for example, of estimates committees to give full consideration to the expenditure of the various government departments. I know there has been concern that there have not been enough days put aside for the consideration of estimates, which are coming up early next month. My point is that, if we are here, we should utilise the time to consider legislation or the budget estimates.
I realise the latter case could create some security problems should there be a lot of people coming and going to front up to estimates committees. I foresee that happening, but I cannot foresee that it would be a problem if we were to deal with government business, for example, during that particular time. I am not going to move the amendment unless there appears to be support around the chamber. For example, we could add words to the end of the motion to the effect that half an hour after the conclusion of the address by the President of the United States, the Senate resumes its sitting and continues business in accordance with the routine of business specified in standing order 57 for a Thursday; or we could specify that it be for government business or whatever. If there is support for this, I will move an amendment to this particular motion to give effect to that. I am not an expert in security affairs but, if we were to deal with government business, for example, that would not mean there would be a whole lot of people coming and going into the parliament for the purposes of the estimates committees. In that case, I would be happy to support the restriction of the business of that particular time to government business. Obviously, I am only one senator. I will be interested to see what the opposition and other senators have to say.",SENATE,<title>ADDRESS BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Miscellaneous,23,1
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2003-10-09,"—I broadly support the sentiment of what Senator Harradine has said. It is unrealistic to have estimates committees meeting at that time, but I do know that, as we speak, certain Senate committees are considering hearings on that day. Issues of witnesses and hearing times are being examined. I do not think it is realistic, given that we have made decisions in the chamber about the estimates timetable, for estimates inquiries to meet during that two-day period. The difficulty we have as we address this issue is the fact that we do not know when either President Bush or President Hu will address the proposed joint sitting.
An additional problem is that we do not know at this stage what other official functions are proposed, if any, around the two official visits, which makes it very difficult for the Senate to make decisions about its program. The only realistic way for the Senate to sit during this period is, as Senator Harradine suggested, for us to limit any business to government business. There are genuine logistical concerns at the moment about when President Bush and President Hu are going to address the joint sitting and about what other functions are proposed. I respectfully suggest and I am sure all senators would agree that, if senators and members are being invited to other functions, there ought to be an option to attend those functions when the Senate is not sitting. This is a courtesy that we extend to all other visiting heads of state and should be extended on this occasion. We have to be consistent with how we have approached these issues in the past.
One possible course of action for the Senate, which I would commend at this stage, is to pass Senator Hill's motions about the meeting of the Senate with the House of Representatives to hear an address from President Bush and also from President Hu and for consideration to be given a little later next week, when there may be clarity about the timetabling and program, as to how we deal with the question of the Senate sitting at that time. In these circumstances, because of all the uncertainties, I would only contemplate the Senate sitting if it were to deal with government business. I do not think it is possible for us to organise anything else. I would have thought the government would find that acceptable, given their public statements over recent hours about the role of the Senate. There is a possibility of finding a way through, but that may not be possible today. It may be better for us to address this, armed with more information and knowledge about the proposed timing and official functions, at some stage next week.",SENATE,<title>ADDRESS BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Miscellaneous,23,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2003-10-09,"—The Greens do not support the motion, but we recognise that the numbers are here for it to pass. We believe that the right place for a visit from another head of state to our parliament is in the Great Hall of Parliament House if the parliament itself is not sitting. The expense and the disruption—and we are just hearing a debate about how to cobble together some form of bandaid to get some value out of the recall of parliament—are not warranted in a non-sitting period.
The recall of parliament ought to be due to a matter of great national moment, when there is a crisis and an urgency afoot which warrant a debate of the elected representatives of this great parliament. When it comes to foreign heads of state visiting the country in a parliamentary non-sitting time, that should be a matter for the Prime Minister to arrange either in the Great Hall or at some other function where the address can be televised and where members of the public and members of parliament who want to can take part.
I would remind the Senate that just two weeks ago Senator Nettle and I moved that, if we are going to have heads of state addressing the parliament, it ought to be extended beyond the President of the United States. But the whole of the rest of the Senate voted against that, including the government. Within two weeks, we had the Prime Minister overriding that government decision and extending an invitation to address parliament to the President of the People's Republic of China, President Hu—and we will be dealing with that motion next. It is quite remarkable that, two weeks before these events, there has not even been a time set for the recall of parliament and the hearing of these speeches.
Underwriting that is the failure of the government of the day to assert that this is the Australian people's parliament, that a time will be set that is convenient, but that we are not going to have that time dictated by the visitors' needs only. The parliament is pre-eminent here. It was a remarkable lapse of the dignity of this country and in the prime ministerial responsibility that the news of the impending visit of President Bush and his addressing this parliament came from Washington and not from Canberra. The symbolism of that is written into the procedures we are now dealing with.
Australia is an independent nation. Australia is ours. This parliament is ours and the recall of this parliament is the business of the Prime Minister and the houses of parliament, not a bureaucratic announcement leaked from Washington. The Prime Minister should be saying to his counterparts in Washington in the strongest possible terms that that was an affront to the dignity of this country and he should ensure that it will not happen again.
When it comes to the visits of heads of state who are going to address parliament—and we believe it should be when parliament is sitting, and at other times it should be in the Great Hall—let us make those addresses a working part of the democracy which is so important to the houses of parliament. Let us have the representative democracy which we stand for—particularly in this Senate—express itself. I know at the moment the Prime Minister has reform of the Senate on the books because he wants to move us further towards a presidential style of government, but that is not our Constitution. This is much more a working democracy. It is with that in mind that, on behalf of the Greens, I move the amendment as circulated:
Omit paragraph (1)(c), substitute:
(1) (c)	concurs in the provisions of the resolution of the House relating to the conduct of that meeting with the following additional provisions:
(i)	a representative of the Australian Greens shall make welcoming remarks immediately after the Leader of the Opposition;
(ii)	following the address by the President of the United States, Senators and Members may make speeches of not more than 5 minutes each and ask questions of the President of the United States and the Prime Minister.
Innovation in working democracy, which is surely based in the representatives who are elected by the people, demands that we look at the evolution of parliamentary process—I am here referring to the third time a United States President has addressed the combined houses of this parliament—with input from the houses of parliament. I do not think that these matters should simply be left to the Prime Minister of the day. We stand for representative democracy and not simply a presidential form of government, no matter how much the Prime Minister of the day—Labor or Liberal—might want it.
We put forward these amendments seriously. The Greens are represented in both houses of parliament. It is our wish that we be able to address the Presidents of the United States and of the People's Republic of China, as the government and the opposition are going to do under this motion. We have a different point of view but it is a point of view which has large public support in Australia—that is why we are represented in both houses of parliament. Our point of view ought to be given freedom of expression so that visiting heads of state understand that we have a plurality of viewpoints in this country and not just a two-party system, as the Prime Minister and indeed the opposition might like it to be. There are another 20 or 30 per cent of voters out there—moving towards a third of voters—who deserve to have their point of view put on any occasion in this parliament.
Here we have a situation where a special exception is being made. A President of the United States comes to the parliament and the other parties and, indeed, Independents, are excluded from the proceedings that then take place. Indeed, under the prescription that we have here and have had in the past, which has evolved without input from the houses of parliament, members of parliament are left mummified in their seats listening to three speeches, with no input, no response and no ability to take part in the robust debate which is the hallmark of our living and working democracy. So, beyond moving to take part in the address of welcome to the two leaders, we believe that members and senators—several or a dozen of them—from the whole spectrum of the parliament ought to be able to add a word at the conclusion of those speeches and to ask questions of the visiting heads of state and our own Prime Minister. That is democracy with a capital `d'.
We have rules of debate which ensure that such an input will be healthy and enlightening and that we will get some information on great matters of the day—such as the war in Iraq and the arbitrary and, we submit, illegal imprisonment of Australians. Two Australian citizens, Mamdouh Habib and David Hicks, are being held illegally in Guantanamo Bay under the authority of the President of the United States, and we have received the alarming news that these men may well have been tortured. Should we not be able to ask the visiting President what is happening to our Australians, why it is that those Americans who were in Guantanamo Bay have been repatriated to their homeland and their judicial system but the Australians in Guantanamo Bay are treated as second-rate citizens and held incommunicado without their legal rights? The indications are that they have been tortured, against all decent human sentiments let alone international law, and there is no end in sight for that predicament. They ought to be repatriated or brought to trial, as the American prisoners were, and this applies to all those in Guantanamo Bay. But these two men remain under the custody of the President of the United States, without trial and with all their rights removed. This again is an infringement of the dignity and the rule of law of this nation of Australia. Ought this not be a reasonable matter to be raised when the President of the United States addresses the joint chambers in two weeks time?
There is the matter that Senator Nettle has been raising by way of motion just today of the so-called free trade agreement between our two countries, which will exclude, amongst other things, the impediment to free trade in agricultural products and which has very big potential social, environmental and cultural impacts for Australia. We are very much the small nation negotiating with the big nation in this matter. Ought we not be able, if we are having the elected President of the United States addressing the parliament, to ask the President about such important matters to do with our nation's welfare? Of course we should. If we are bringing visiting heads of state into our chambers of parliament to address us, let us make it an exchange. That is democracy.
—I note one senator opposite objects. If he wants to be part of the inability to speak, if he wants to be gagged, if he wants not to be able to speak as the representative of his Victorian electorate, that is his prerogative. But we Greens want to have a say in every debate that takes place in this parliament. We can do so with dignity and with well-informed input. We can do so in a way which will garner information which is important to the many citizens in this community who feel frustrated that we seem to be hapless and helpless in a situation where we have many questions to put to visiting heads of state but no opportunity to do so.
Our amendment is no political ruse. It is a well thought out contribution to improving democracy in this parliament. The Prime Minister wants to reform the Senate—and we will defend it against that `de-provement', that diminution of democracy involved in those moves by the Prime Minister. But, at a joint sitting in the other place, let us not be sitting on our hands with our mouths closed, therefore effectively with our minds closed, to an address from a head of any other country as if it were not in our domain to sensibly engage in a discourse. That is what democracy is about. The age of empire, regal procession and pronouncements from the throne are behind us. This is the age of democracy and equality of all persons globally. So let us not revert but let us go forward and ensure that, when institutions like our great parliament are being changed without there having been a passage of legislation—and in this case I am referring to heads of state addressing our parliament—we have input and that we reach for a democratic outcome better than the one that has been presented to us. For those reasons, and in the name of democracy, I strongly recommend the Greens' amendment. I indicate that we will also be supporting the Democrats' amendment to ensure that, if parliament is recalled, the business of parliament is gotten on with in the rest of those two days on behalf of the people of Australia.
 (Senator Cherry)—I call Senator Allison.

"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2003-10-09,"—Perhaps you would like to make your own speech, Senator McGauran, when it is your turn. I foreshadow that the Democrats will have two amendments. The first of these would shift the conduct of the meeting to the Great Hall. We have argued for some time—in fact, back in 1991—that the Great Hall is the place for official receptions. This is where the Queen addresses parliamentarians. I will talk to those amendments after we have dealt with this one, but I want to indicate that the Democrats will not support the Greens' amendment despite the appeal it might have of asking questions directly of both presidents. I think the amendment is most unlikely to be agreed to, either by the rest of this parliament or by the President himself, so I do not think it is a realistic proposition. Our main concern here is that, in the first instance, it is in the wrong place. We would prefer that the Senate seriously consider our own amendment—one that would shift the place of this reception or joint sitting or whatever you want to call it to a much more appropriate venue. Whilst it has some appeal, I think it would be a world first to invite a President from another country and then subject him or her to questions from this place. I will speak further to this point when I move those amendments.
Question put:
That the amendment (Senator Brown's) be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>ADDRESS BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Miscellaneous,23,1
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2003-10-09,"—I move Democrat amendment (1) on sheet 3122, in the name of Senator Bartlett:
(1)  Omit paragraph (1) (c), substitute:
(1) (c)	concurs in the provisions of the resolution of the House relating to the conduct of that meeting, except that the place of meeting shall be the Great Hall.
This amendment seeks to move the conduct of that meeting to the Great Hall. There have been only two other occasions when a visiting head of state has addressed the parliament in a joint sitting, or in any sitting for that matter, and on both occasions they were conducted in the House of Representatives, where the Senate was invited to be. The first was in 1992, when President George Bush Sr came to Australia, and on that occasion the parliament was recalled for a joint meeting.
That was the first of what obviously has become a precedent. It was repeated in 1996 when President Clinton was in Australia—although, on that occasion, it was not necessary to recall parliament because it was a sitting week. We argued back in 1991 when it was agreed that President Bush would address the parliament that this place was reserved for parliamentarians and that the Great Hall was the proper place to accept visiting dignitaries. In fact, as I said earlier, even the Queen has not addressed the parliament in a joint sitting, except when she is representing the government. She is our own head of state and has not been invited to do as we are doing with President Bush. Indonesian leaders and other Chinese leaders have addressed parliamentarians as part of a dinner or a lunch in the Great Hall. In the view of the Democrats, this is an appropriate approach to take.
One can now ask: what are the rules? Is it the case that any head of state who comes to this country is going to have an `as of right' to address a joint sitting of the parliament? I am not sure that that is clear to any of us here, yet it ought to be. Either we have got a protocol that we are now changing—in which case we all should know what the rules are going to be—or we do not. Do we keep making exceptions? Is the Chinese leader addressing the parliament because a day earlier President Bush is addressing the parliament? 
We need to ask the government why it is that the protocols are changing and why it is appropriate for this to now be a place where we should be addressed rather than the Great Hall—which, as I said, is set up for much larger numbers of people. It seems to the Democrats that not only is it something of a waste of money to recall the parliament without having the parliament conduct business—which goes to the question of the second amendment—but it is also the case that we are now in some sort of limbo as to what the future brings with regard to dignitaries addressing parliamentarians. I think it is appropriate that we shift the function, and I ask the Senate to support that motion.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I seek your clarification. We are dealing with only notice of motion No. 1, are we? 
 (Senator Cherry)—Yes.
Question put:
That the amendment (Senator Allison's) be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>ADDRESS BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Miscellaneous,23,1
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2003-10-09,"—I move Democrat amendment (2):
At the end of the motion, add:
(3)	That on Thursday, 23 October 2003, the routine of business of the Senate shall be as follows:
(a)	before the suspension of the Senate for the address, government business only; and
(b)	following the address:
	(i)	Government business only,
	(ii)	At 2 pm, questions,
	(iii)	Motions to take note of answers,
	(iv)	Any proposal pursuant to standing order 75,
	(v)	Government business,
	(vi)	At 7.20 pm, adjournment proposed, and
	(vii)	Adjournment.
I have moved this amendment so that, on the day of the address by the President of the United States of America, the Senate can take advantage of the fact that we have been recalled and so that there is a fairly normal routine of business in the Senate following the suspension of the Senate for that address. We have said a number of times recently that this is a very short sitting year; in fact, it is one of the shortest on record that has not been an election year. Senator Faulkner has indicated that the ALP is of a mind to consider this but not at this point in time. It seems to us that this motion would still allow us, when we know the time of the address, to adjust it. For that reason, I put it forward.
The government, in its paper tabled yesterday, has indicated that there is a deadlock in the Senate—a claim that I would strongly dispute—but if the government is serious about the Senate dealing with its legislation then this is an opportunity for us to do that. As I have said, there is a very low number of sitting days—just 60. It was the second lowest but is now the lowest as we have added two sitting days to Senate estimates. I do not think the government can claim that the Senate is obstructionist and at the same time give us just 60 days in one year to deal with legislation. If the government does not want to deal with its own bills, then I am sure there are plenty of private senators' bills that we could deal with in this place. The Democrats would be quite happy to do that. However, I think our first call is to deal with government legislation.",SENATE,<title>ADDRESS BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Miscellaneous,23,1
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2003-10-09,"—I want to reiterate what I said a short time ago that the view of the opposition is that if the Senate is to sit at the time of President Bush's visit then it would be appropriate to deal with government business at that time. Senator Harradine and I both indicated to the chamber a little time ago that there is clearly a difficulty with this particular part of the motion of the Australian Democrats, in that we do not yet know when either President Bush or President Hu will address a joint sitting of the parliament. Obviously, we need to know that as we look at developing some sort of routine of business for both of those days if the Senate is to sit.
The other issue is that we are not aware at this stage what other official functions might also be held surrounding the visits of President Bush and President Hu. I do think it is reasonable if there are official functions—such as lunches, dinners or other functions—for senators, as always, to have an opportunity to attend those functions. In this chamber, we have always taken account of the fact that senators do wish to attend those sorts of functions and the Senate routine of business has often been adjusted, as senators would be aware, to accommodate those sorts of functions.
At this stage not only do we not know when the official addresses will take place but we do not know what other functions may be organised that senators and members will be invited to. That is why it is so difficult, as we are debating this matter, to determine some sort of routine of business as is proposed in the spirit of the amendment that Senator Allison has moved in relation to the visits by President Bush and President Hu. So there is a difficulty here. My suggestion a little earlier was that the Senate look at this issue when we have some more information about the scheduling of both the address to the joint sitting of parliament and the scheduling of any other functions that might hang off the visits of these two heads of state. It seems to me to be sensible for us to look at that issue next week when we have more information. However, I repeat what I said before that it is the opposition's view that this would be a preferred time to deal with government business. That seems the sensible way for us to deal with these matters, which I think was one of the two suggestions that Senator Harradine had offered to the Senate a little earlier as we discussed these matters. That would be the preferred approach of the opposition. If we were able to look at this issue at some stage during the next sitting week, with more information available to us about what is planned for the official sittings and the official functions surrounding the two visits, that would seem to me to be eminently sensible. I commend that course of action to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>ADDRESS BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Miscellaneous,23,1
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,2003-10-09,"—What Senator Faulkner said is entirely logical, and I support what he said. The motion itself reveals the problems of making a decision such as this without all of the information as described by Senator Faulkner. For example, the amendment in part states: 
(3)	That on Thursday, 23 October 2003, the routine of business of the Senate shall be as follows:
(a)	before the suspension of the Senate for the address, government business only; and
(b)	following the address:
	(i)	Government business only,
	(ii)	At 2 pm, questions,
What happens, for example, if the address is at 2 o'clock? Where do we stand then? There is nothing at all in this amendment that states that business in the Senate starts at 9.30. If the address starts at 2 p.m., then it is a bit premature to be making a decision that at 2 p.m. there will be questions. I do feel that there is an inherent problem if we deal with this matter now. Let us wait, as suggested by Senator Faulkner, for all the information to come in and let us deal with this matter next week. For my part, I agree with what Senator Faulkner has said this morning. Let us deal with government business and get on with the job rather than deal with all of these other matters, including questions, motions to take note of answers, any proposal pursuant to standing order 75 et cetera. You can imagine what that would all be. At this stage I am not prepared, without all the information available, to vote for the amendment.",SENATE,<title>ADDRESS BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Miscellaneous,23,1

"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,2003-10-09,"—This is a very serious matter that we are dealing with here now. The proposal is to allow President Hu, who is a dictator—he is not elected and certainly not democratic—to address the democratically elected parliament of this country in the chamber. I take the view that, if we accept this, it will set a very bad precedent indeed and will reflect on the elected chambers—the House of Representatives and the Senate. Whatever might be said about President Bush, at least he is the democratically elected head of the United States. President Hu is not democratically elected and not part of the democratic process. Indeed, the record of the Chinese government is a very, very bad one when it comes to democracy. It is a one-party state and the people of China continue to be oppressed by a one-party state.
It is time to stop being polite about the daily horrific human rights abuses continuing in China. The Australian government has been pursuing polite dialogue for decades with no effect. There is no outcome of these so-called dialogues that it is having. Unfortunately, when it comes to human rights the government is constantly taking its eye off the ball as it sees the more attractive prospects of trade, big cash deals and so on. I am not suggesting that we should not have dialogue with the Chinese—not in the least—including trade dialogue, but we should stand up against the human rights abuses which are manifold and continue to oppress the people of China.
As a trade unionist I was very concerned about the jailing of Chinese labour leaders. As recently as May, two Chinese labour activists were convicted and sentenced to seven years jail and four years jail respectively. They had organised thousands of sacked workers in a peaceful protest against the loss of their jobs. And we are going to hail President Hu and provide him with a forum in a democratically elected parliament. There is also the continued oppression of Christians who refuse to be part of the official Chinese government churches; the continued oppression of members of the Falun Gong; the one-child policy, which uses sterilisation, fines, imprisonment and other punishments to force compliance, including forced abortion; the arrest and forced repatriation of North Korean asylum seekers; the continued restriction on freedom of expression, religion and association in Tibet; and the execution of 150 people in June 2002 for drug related crimes to mark the UN International Anti-Drugs Day on 26 June.
Human Rights Watch is correct to state that the Australian government's continual reluctance to deal with these issues would undermine its bid to lead the UN Commission on Human Rights. This is a sad day if we accept a proposal that we fete President Hu in the democratically elected chamber of this parliament to address its members, all of whom have been democratically elected and stand against gross violations of human rights. Let us make a stand on this. Under these circumstances, if there is going to be an address situation provided for President Hu then let it be in the Great Hall rather than in a chamber of this elected parliament.",SENATE,<title>ADDRESS BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Miscellaneous,24,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2003-10-09,"—I congratulate Senator Harradine for that speech about the impending visit and podium given to the President of the People's Republic of China, President Hu. I appeal to the opposition to think about this. There is more at stake here than simply giving a podium to a head of a rich and powerful trading nation in terms of that trade. Let us make no mistake about this: Prime Minister Howard's move—against the vote of his own party in this chamber two weeks ago—to have President Hu take the rostrum in the House of Representatives in two weeks time is all to do with money, the big dollar. It is a decision that is abhorrent to those of us who value human rights, human dignity, democracy and liberty—the very things that Prime Minister Howard said he stood for in going to war in Iraq. These ideals would be sacrificed for this `ceremonial day', as members of the government would call it. I foreshadow I will be moving an amendment.
I am well aware of President Hu's record, not least because he was the supremo in 1989 in the crackdown on Tibetans in Lhasa. He was there; he directed it. Forty people were killed and hundreds were imprisoned. The right of religious expression and political rights were totally taken away under sufferance of death and torture of the seven million people of Tibet. Since then he had a major role in the crackdown in Tiananmen Square, for which an earlier Prime Minister of this country shed tears. This man is now being invited to take the podium in the House of Representatives, with the elected representatives of this parliament muzzled under this arrangement of Prime Minister Howard and the Labor opposition—who are about to obsequiously agree to it and who have no good record when it comes to dealing with humans rights abuses in China.
Let me read from the US Department of State's current assessment on human rights practices in China. This was issued at the end of March this year. It states:
The Government's—
that is, President Hu's government now—
human rights record throughout the year remained poor, and the Government continued to commit numerous and serious abuses.
However, the Government took some steps to address international concerns about its human rights record during the year: A number of prominent dissidents were released; senior representatives of the Dalai Lama were allowed to visit the country; the Government agreed to extend, without conditions, invitations to visit to the U.N. Special Rapporteurs on Torture and Religious Intolerance and the U.N. Working Group on Arbitrary Detention; reform of the legal system continued; and the scope of religious activity allowed in Tibetan areas expanded slightly.
Late in the year, these positive developments were undermined by arrests of democracy activists, the imposition of death sentences without due process on two Tibetans, and the trials of labor leaders on 'subversion' charges.
Authorities were quick to suppress religious, political, and social groups, as well as individuals, that they perceived to be a threat to government power or to national stability. Citizens who sought to express openly dissenting political and religious views continued to face repression.
The United States Department of State report goes on to say:
Abuses included instances of extrajudicial killings, torture and mistreatment of prisoners, forced confessions, arbitrary arrest and detention, lengthy incommunicado detention, and denial of due process. Conditions at most prisons remained harsh. In many cases, particularly in sensitive political cases, the judicial system denied criminal defendants basic legal safeguards and due process because authorities attached higher priority to suppressing political opposition and maintaining public order than to enforcing legal norms or protecting individual rights.
The Government infringed on citizens' privacy rights.
The Government continued to implement its coercive policy of restricting the number of children a family could have.
The Government maintained tight restrictions on freedom of speech and of the press; self-censorship by journalists and writers also continued. The Government continued and at times intensified its efforts to control and monitor the Internet.
The Government severely restricted freedom of assembly and continued to restrict freedom of association and freedom of movement.
While the number of religious believers continued to grow, government respect for religious freedom remained poor and crackdowns against Muslim Uighurs, Tibetan Buddhists, and unregistered groups, including underground Protestant and Catholic groups, continued.
The Government denied the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) permission to operate along its border with North Korea and deported thousands of North Koreans, many of whom faced persecution upon their return. Citizens did not have the right peacefully to change their Government.
The Government did not permit independent domestic nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) to monitor human rights conditions. Violence against women (including imposition of a birth limitation policy coercive in nature that resulted in instances of forced abortion and forced sterilization), prostitution, discrimination against women, abuse of children, and discrimination against persons with disabilities and minorities all were problems. In Xinjiang, where security remained tight, human rights abuses intensified.
The Government continued to deny internationally recognized worker rights, and forced labor in prison facilities remained a serious problem. Trafficking in persons was a serious problem.
The Government's violation of internationally accepted human rights norms stemmed from the authorities' extremely limited tolerance of public dissent, fear of unrest, and the limited scope or inadequate implementation of laws protecting basic freedoms.
	...	...	...
Approximately 1,300 individuals were serving sentences under the Law Against Counterrevolutionary Activity, a law that no longer existed; many of these persons were imprisoned for the nonviolent expression of their political views.
Credible sources estimated that as many as 2,000 persons remained in prison for their activities during the June 1989 Tiananmen demonstrations.
Can you imagine! Further, it states:
Since December 1998, at least 38 leaders of the China Democracy Party have been given long prison sentences on subversion charges.
Let me put it this way: if Prime Minister Howard were in China and moved to represent the Liberal Party, President Hu would put him in jail. If opposition leader Simon Crean were in China and moved to set up either an independent trade union or the Labor Party, he would go to jail. If I or Senator Bartlett wanted to establish a Greens or a Democrats party in China—or, indeed, Senator Harradine, or any of the other Independents, wanted to stand as an Independent for parliament and led a campaign on that—President Hu would send us to jail.
We are giving a podium to President Hu to give us a speech to which there is no response. That is why the Greens will be moving that if this is going to happen—this travesty of democratic avocation in our parliament—then surely there must be interaction. Surely we must have a right to interact with anybody who comes into our parliament. I remind the Senate that, during the debate on land rights, when I moved for an Indigenous person like Michael Mansell—representing the Indigenous people of Tasmania—to come and take some time of my speech and address the parliament on the matter, that was voted down. So we do not have a place in this parliament for Indigenous Australians to give an address on a matter that is germane to their rights, but we are affording a place to a dictator who has blood on his hands—who has directly repressed political, labour, religious, women's, minority, disabled and cultural rights in his country—because Prime Minister Howard and the corporations that have such open access to his door say that it is good for trade. We must not trade our strongly held democratic and human rights in that manner.
If the President of China comes to this country—and welcomed he must be, because that is the nature of an open and inclusive society; and we hope we may be able to send him back a little enlightened about how to open up society and not fear freedom and democracy—then let his address be given in the Great Hall of this Parliament House or to the Press Club. If we are to entertain the thought of President Hu coming to the rostrum to address the several hundred representatives elected by the people of Australia, for goodness sake, let us not even mock the situation in the Great Hall of the people in China, where nobody can speak on any subject unless permitted to do so. We are not mummies. We are not here just to listen. We are here to take part in debate. That is the basis, the essence, of democracy. We can do that with dignity—a dignity that President Hu has not shown to the thousands of his people languishing in jail because they have a different point of view—and so we ought. Senator Allison said this would be a world first. This is not the first time we have had a world first in democracy in this country. The vote for women, secret voting and the Hare-Clark system are some examples of that.
I think we are going to have a far greater reciprocation of visits of heads of state in this rapidly-globalising world, but let democracy keep pace with that. Let us not be in a situation where the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition give welcome to President Hu and he gets the podium under the same conditions as he would do in the fake parliament in China—that is, he gives a speech, he gets applause and nobody gets up to question him. Are we to rubber-stamp that Chinese absence of democracy or are we to encourage democracy by example? Let President Hu go home and more rapidly open up his country to the democracy that everybody from Tibet to Hong Kong to East Turkestan—indeed, all the people within that Chinese realm—deserve to have. I cannot believe that we are being so obsequious about this. I cannot believe that Prime Minister Howard thinks so little of democracy as the fulcrum of our society when it comes to decision making or that the Labor opposition, for that matter, is not going to support a move to have some repartee—some democratic to-and-fro—with any individual brought into our parliament, let alone the repressive leader of the People's Republic of China.

	(vi)	At 3.45 pm, adjournment proposed, and
	(vii)	Adjournment.
This amendment, apart from the date, is identical to amendment (2) which I moved earlier. I make the point in moving this that I hear the debate, which is accurate insofar as we do not know what time various functions might be held, but it seems to me that, if the will of the Senate about a sitting of some sort—whether or not we deal with government business; whatever the case may be—were to be expressed at this point in time, at least we would have some certainty that bookings and staff arrangements could be made. There will be plenty of time to vary this motion next week, when and if we finally find out what time things are going to happen. That way we will know that it is necessary to be here in the early part of the day and we will know when we are going to adjourn. It seems sensible to at least give an indication at this point in time that it is the intention of the Senate to sit, deal with legislation and make the most of that day. While the Senate chose not to support the last amendment, I suggest to honourable senators that this is another good argument. Senator Faulkner has indicated that the ALP may be inclined to support such a proposal, and this would be a good chance to express that so that we have some certainty about the day.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2003-10-09,"—I would have been prepared to delete item (1)(c)(i) if it had tempted the Labor Party to support the Greens amendment, but I do not think that is going to happen. Therefore, I move the Greens amendment as circulated:
Omit paragraph (1)(c), substitute:
(1)(c)	concurs in the provisions of the resolution of the House relating to the conduct of that meeting with the following additional provisions:
(i)	a representative of the Australian Greens shall make welcoming remarks immediately after the Leader of the Opposition;
(ii)	following the address by the President of the People's Republic of China, Senators and Members may make speeches of not more than 5 minutes each and ask questions of the President of the People's Republic of China and the Prime Minister.
This amendment provides for a Greens representative to make a welcoming speech and allows members of the combined houses to question the President of the People's Republic of China and the Prime Minister for five minutes each after the address in the name of democracy.
 (Senator Cook)—The question is that the motion moved by Senator Brown be agreed to.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. I do not think there should be a division at 12:45 p.m. on any matter. It is not in the interests of the Senate; senators are leaving the building and so forth. Senator Brown is absolutely entitled to press this issue, and he has indicated he intends to do that. I respectfully suggest to all senators in the chamber that we deal with this matter at a later stage. I seek leave to hold the division at a later stage.

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2003-10-09,"—My understanding is that Senator O'Brien wished to speak on the Civil Aviation Amendment Bill 2003. Civil aviation is an important issue in Queensland and in other states. It is difficult to deal with it comprehensively in one piece of legislation or through one amendment such as this. This is a non-controversial piece of legislation to amend the Civil Aviation Act. Perhaps I will make a declaration: being both a private pilot and a glider pilot—
—You are?
—Yes. I do have some knowledge of the civil aviation—
—You have absolute expertise; don't be modest!
—I have some knowledge of civil aviation, but I digress. From my experience as a private pilot, what troubles me in this instance is that there is sometimes an inability for communication to come all the way down the line to the area in which I engage. As a private pilot and a glider pilot I know that we have difficulties such as the regulations, which are quite extraordinary. Wearing another hat, I was on the Senate Regulations and Ordinances Committee. The Civil Aviation Authority have put through an extraordinary number of different regulations. We have asked them to simplify some of the legislation, to bring it to a place where people can understand it and for it to be written in plain English. For pilots who are not full-time commercial pilots but partake in flying part time as aviation enthusiasts it would be helpful if the regulations were written in plain English and promulgated in such a manner that pilots could understand and meet the regulations in that area.
There is not just one regulation. There is a range of orders and other pieces of legislation that you have to get your head around. There are a number of books that you have to be familiar with, together with amendments that come out every six months, and there are various maps that you have to understand. I think I can speak on behalf of the many pilots I know when I say that any assistance that the Civil Aviation Authority provides is helpful in getting your head around the amount of material that is put out. I do not want to take up the time of the chamber with this matter, so I will not continue too long, but this is an opportunity for me to at least express a view on behalf of other pilots for whom I know it would be helpful if the Civil Aviation Authority learnt to be more responsive with the legislation they put out and understand the needs of part-time pilots.
One of the other areas that has always troubled me is ensuring that private pilots who pursue gliding and ultralighting interests can participate in these pursuits. I also have a student licence for ultralighting, and that requires you to join the ultralights association. To be a glider pilot, you have to join the Gliding Federation of Australia. Then, if you want to keep up with news in the private pilots field, there is another organisation you could join as well. You can imagine that, at the end of 12 months, you could have spent a lot of money not on flying but on joining all these associations. They do serve a worthwhile purpose, but you would hope that the civil aviation authorities would be able to ensure that recreational pilots can participate in those particular pursuits. In sports aviation, there are recreational pilots who do paragliding and ballooning. In that whole recreational area, you would really hope that the authorities could interact and develop a better framework so that people did not have to join all those organisations. That is not to say that we would not want those organisations supported.
The other area is regional airports, where a lot of these pursuits are carried on. Currently many of them are in the responsibility of local authority areas. You get different responses from the local authority areas about the upkeep of the landing areas and such. One of the issues that always comes up is the place from where I do both gliding and ultralighting—a small country strip in south-east Queensland. From time to time it really does require the local council to consider doing a little bit more in the area. But they have other pressures and other residents to consider, so they have to strike a balance in that area.
You really expect that, in many instances, the Civil Aviation Authority and government authorities would take up the issue and ensure that, if they are going to encourage recreational pilots, the areas from which they fly are similarly well supported from a government perspective. They are some of the broad issues that I face. I certainly do not have the time to go through the many more issues I could talk about in respect of this field—
—I'll just find out if Kerry is coming or not.
—My understanding is no, so I will wrap up at this point. I did think I needed to say a few things about the issues that face recreational pilots.",SENATE,<title>CIVIL AVIATION AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,26,1
"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2003-10-09,"—I appreciate Senator Ludwig's comments. As he is obviously well aware, the government is very responsive in this area, as it is in most areas. I will indicate that a couple of government amendments were adopted in the Main Committee of the House of Representatives which tidy up some aspects of the bill. The amendments to governance and application of savings provisions were necessary, as the bill was not enacted in time for new governance arrangements to take effect from 1 July this year. The amendment that inserted schedule 2 took on board representations from the aviation industry. I want to thank the opposition for its cooperation and constructive input into the development of these amendments.
I also indicate that the Democrats have indicated to me that they support the bill. Unfortunately none of them are able to be in the chamber, but they did ask me to indicate their support for the bill. Passage of this bill will ensure that the already excellent aviation safety outcomes in this country will be maintained and improved. I thank the Senate for its support.

"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2003-10-09,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Family and Community Services (Senator Patterson) and the Minister for the Arts and Sport (Senator Kemp) to questions without notice asked by senators today relating to Centrelink and Telstra's outsourcing of information technology.
I would like to open my comments today by reflecting on some of Senator Patterson's responses to questions asked of her today, particularly to Senator Webber's question. Her defence for not answering the question effectively was that it was out of context. What we are about to see here is a decline in the Family and Community Services portfolio comparative to the one Labor observed in the Health and Ageing portfolio under her watch. It is worth reflecting for a few moments on some of the disturbing trends that emerged in the health portfolio while it was under her watch. One that has really stuck out in my mind is the decline in the number of people—which can be seen by looking at some of the statistics—who actually attended a GP last year. My colleague in the other place Julia Gillard placed on record that three million fewer people presumably needed to see a doctor last year. Labor contends that a reasonable proportion of those people surely did not go to the doctor because they could not afford to. Labor has documented very effectively how health costs have risen and how basic health services have become unaffordable for Australians.
It is scary to think what havoc could be wreaked upon the Family and Community Services portfolio. If what we have seen today and earlier this week are any indication then it is not looking good for Centrelink or for the Department of Family and Community Services in terms of what they are going to be able to do for the people in this country who are most in need. What those people need is a compassionate minister who understands their problems and does not take the coalition's harsh and unjust approach to enforcing the unreasonable repayment of debt that has clearly accrued through no fault of the people who have incurred it. It has accrued through mismanagement of the portfolio and the programs within it.
I would now like to comment on Senator Kemp's answer to my question about Telstra's offshore IT outsourcing. I know many senators are aware that I have taken a particular interest in IT outsourcing. Telstra's involvement in this issue has quite a fascinating history and, as I have a few minutes, I would just like to run through it. Back in 1996-97, Telstra, as part of the IBM GSA consortium, managed to secure—without a competitive process—a contract with the Department of Finance and Administration. At that time, IBM GSA were one of the largest companies touting for work under the government's IT outsourcing program, which it is rumoured they had a very big hand in designing for the coalition government.
It is ironic that in response to criticisms at the time about the lack of Australian involvement in the IT outsourcing program, which strongly favoured large multinational companies with the business model to respond to what the coalition was putting out to tender, it was actually Telstra who formed another consortium, which was 51 per cent controlled by Telstra, with the same partners as IBM GSA—IBM and Lend Lease—but of a different proportion. Telstra were able to assist the government directly by forming a new company called Advantra to tender on government work. They managed to land a $90 million contract for the group 5 agencies which, incidentally, include the Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, the ACCC and the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. They secured $90 million worth of work and gave the coalition government a way out when it came to claiming that one of the contracts had gone to a company that was majority Australian owned. It did. It went to Advantra, which was Telstra.
Further down the track, IBM GSA—still with Telstra's 30 per cent shareholding—secured the health contract, which was worth an enormous amount of money: some $350 million. Since then the wheels have fallen off these partnerships: Advantra has now become Telstra Enterprise Services, and both Lend Lease and IBM have pulled out. Telstra Enterprise Services still provide the services for DCITA, the ACCC and the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, but they are fully owned and run by Telstra—they are an in-house outfit.
The supplementary part of my question to the minister today related to security and privacy of data held by Telstra—an important issue. Do the changes mean that customer information is held offshore and not covered by the privacy and security laws in the jurisdiction of our country of Australia? That also begs the question whether the data held by Telstra Enterprise Services—now a subsidiary fully owned and fully controlled by Telstra—is also held offshore and not protected by the privacy and the security laws of the Australian jurisdiction. The minister does need to come back to the Senate and answer these questions properly.

"Eggleston, Sen Alan",LP,2003-10-09,"—Senator Lundy is off on a bit of a frolic, attacking the government over things on which the government has a very strong record—namely, our record in bringing in the A Fairer Medicare package and our record in seeking to outsource government IT. That was a great success for many reasons—it lowered the cost of IT services to the government and, by outsourcing IT services, we saw a great stimulation of the Australian internal or domestic IT industry. 
I was on the Finance and Public Administration References Committee which held an inquiry into the question of the success or otherwise of the government's outsourcing of its IT program. Senator Lundy was on that committee as well, and it is a funny thing that she seems to recall the evidence that was given in a very different way to the way that I recall it. I recall it as an overall great success story: the government had a hotchpotch of IT which was not appropriate to various departments, it was outsourced to various contractors in groups, and the end result was a great reduction in costs to the Commonwealth. We ended up stimulating the domestic IT research industry, both strengthening the industry and increasing employment in the Australian IT industry. We were also able to gain a better understanding of the specific IT requirements of various departments of the Australian Public Service. 
In some cases, the conclusion was that it was better, and that it was in the public interest, for IT to remain in-house in various departments. In most cases, however, it was seen to be preferable to outsource it. This was a great initiative of former minister for finance Mr Fahey. I must say the IT outsourcing initiative has been one of the great success stories of the Howard government. So I do not really understand what it is that Senator Lundy is criticising. She is perhaps criticising the success—perhaps she is being a bit envious—of the initiative and the flexibility which the Howard government showed in undertaking the outsourcing of IT.
The other point that Senator Lundy raised was what she called the `decline' in general terms of the health services during the watch of the former minister, Senator Patterson. That is utter nonsense. During the term of Senator Patterson, the government introduced the A Fairer Medicare package, which provided an extra $917 million to strengthen Australia's universal health system. The fact of the matter is that that package was designed to preserve bulk-billing, in particular for people who are health care card holders, of which some seven million people in the Australian community are. 
There were incentives provided to bulk-bill concession card holders, ranging from around $3,500 per annum for GPs in urban and outer metropolitan areas to some $22,050 for GPs in remote and rural areas so GPs would get a higher rebate for bulk-billing people on health care cards and, thus, be more likely to continue bulk-billing them. That was a very good initiative of the Howard government to preserve bulk-billing for the most needy people in our community. The doctors, of course, retain the right to determine their own billing practices, as they do now, but the A Fairer Medicare program will certainly mean that the people most in need in our community will be able to be bulk-billed. That is a very important achievement.
The other thing to say about our package is that the real universality of Medicare relates to the fact that hospital treatment is freely available to all Australians, regardless of their income level. That is what the universality of Medicare is really about and it is a great service that Australia has. The ALP may like to criticise the Australian health system, but in fact we have one of the most magnificent and effective health systems in the world—the envy of many countries.

"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,2003-10-09,"—I might start where Senator Eggleston just left off. For at least 20 years under Medicare Australia has had one of the greatest health systems in the world. It is recognised universally as the best health system. Unfortunately, under this government its quality and access is declining due to the mismanagement of this government. It is also due to the fact that this government really does not like Medicare—it never has—and it is doing nothing about restoring Medicare to its pre-eminent position as the best health system in the world. I find it fascinating that in his remarks Senator Eggleston outlined to the Senate the details of the government's so-called `Fairer Medicare package'. The previous Minister for Health and Ageing, Senator Patterson, said herself that she did not really understand this package; she said it was like `living in la-la land'. Those were her words when she was talking about her own package. She also said it had a `snowflake's chance in hell' of getting through the Senate. That is another quote from Senator Patterson. She also actually said, as the minister for health, charged with promoting this package, that it was not really the package she would have liked to have put forward.
Those are the facts of the matter. Senator Eggleston knows he has just given us an explanation of a package that has now been disowned by the government itself. The Prime Minister has given the job to Tony Abbott to try to fix this. Whether or not the Minister for Health and Ageing can fix it is a tall order. I doubt that he can fix the crisis in health care in this country. The minister is already talking about adding another $500 million to the health care package in order to try to convince the Democrats to put it through the Senate. When the states were asking the Commonwealth for an extra $1.5 billion for the public hospital system, this government said `No, there's no more money.' Now this government is saying it has suddenly found another $500 million to prop up its A Fairer Medicare package. This government has just announced that it has a $7½ billion surplus, so there is plenty of money washing around—plenty of money taken out of taxpayers' pockets that should be put back into fixing Medicare.
Let us get back to Senator Patterson, the demoted former Minister for Health and Ageing. Senator Patterson succeeded the previous former minister for health, Dr Wooldridge. We all remember Dr Wooldridge. He presided over the decline in Medicare bulk-billing, the crisis in medical indemnity insurance and the fact that private health insurance premiums continued to skyrocket despite the 30 per cent subsidy. Minister Wooldridge presided over a system where relations with the states deteriorated to a level where the reform agenda in health ceased to operate. Minister Wooldridge, we all know, was a failure. Eventually, he decided to leave government and leave the parliament at the last election, making sure of course that he could fix up a job for himself as a consultant for the health industry before he left.
The Prime Minister appointed Senator Patterson to take over. Things did not get any better; they actually got worse. Bulk-billing has continued to decline even further, there is a huge crisis in medical indemnity insurance in the health industry at the moment and thousands of specialists around the country are going on strike, withdrawing their services from public hospitals. And this government does nothing. Senator Patterson presided over this crisis, along with Senator Coonan. Check the record. What did some members of the profession say about Senator Patterson? They said things like, `She was the worst health minister ever', that she `lacks clout with her cabinet colleagues', that she was absolutely `pathetic' and that she was `embarrassing'. She was even described as `Monty Pythonish'. These were comments made by health professionals. They did a survey of the pharmaceutical, consumer and medical groups, which gave her a score of between one and five out of 10 for her performance.
—Mr Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. Senator Forshaw may be leaving the Senate in view of his poor performance in the preselections for the New South Wales Labor Party, but he is making a very silly speech at present. I think some people would find it quite offensive. Senator Patterson is a very much respected member of this Senate and this government, and to have to put up with this childish abuse from Senator Forshaw is quite disgraceful. Could you kindly rule that his comments are out of order.
—Senator Kemp, there is no point of order and you know it.
—Senator Kemp knows it; that is why he has the job he does at the moment.
—Senator Forshaw, address your comments to the matter before the Senate.
—These were comments made by professionals in the health industry about the former minister. She has now been dumped from the portfolio and has been given control of Family and Community Services. It was in recognition by the Prime Minister that she presided over a huge crisis in health—(Time expired).",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Answers to Questions</title>,Questions Without Notice,29,1
"Webber, Sen Ruth",ALP,2003-10-09,"—I also rise to take note of answers given by Senator Patterson. In doing so, I would like to focus on the debacle that her health policies inflicted on my home state of Western Australia. Since this government has been in office, and particularly in her time as health minister, the proportion of bulk-billing general practitioner services in WA has decreased from 79.8 per cent in 1996-97 to 66.1 per cent in 2002-03. That is a massive decline. What is the major contributor to a decline in bulk-billing? It is the lack of access to GP services—the lack of access to doctors.
In Western Australia the shortages of GPs are most severe in the outer Perth metropolitan areas, such as Ellenbrook—and I will come back to the case of Ellenbrook shortly—Clarkson, Merriwa, Mindarie, Quinns Rocks and Butler, as well as some of the rural and remote areas. But some of our newest suburbs are missing out because Senator Patterson, when she was the Minister for Health and Ageing, refused to provide adequate incentives for doctors to practise in those communities.
Many of our rural and regional communities also do not have access to private GPs, with people instead being forced to rely on public hospitals—which is something else the minister neglected to adequately resource. In the Kimberley and Pilbara regions—regions that will be familiar to Senator Cook—there were fewer than 10 private GPs for a population of over 80,000 people. This government's lack of policy response to the provision of GP services—and, particularly, the former minister's lack of policy response to the provision of GP services—in rural and remote areas forces 80,000 people in the Kimberley and Pilbara regions to rely on state provided public hospitals to access their medical care.
Another great thing due to Senator Patterson's complete mismanagement of the health system is the lack of funding in the current health care agreement. Due to her cutting funding that was alluded to by Senator Forshaw earlier, more than 25,000 Western Australians could now miss out on public health treatment, thanks to the federal government's funding arrangements that Senator Patterson introduced. For Western Australia the new funding arrangements mean that there will be at least $80 million less spent in our public hospital system over the next four financial years, thanks to Senator Patterson. As I say, that can translate to more than 25,000 patients not getting the treatment that they need and deserve.
But let us focus on the minister's package that will supposedly get GPs to service outer metropolitan, rural and remote areas. Let us have a look at some of the comments from the Perth and Hills Division of General Practice. The division has advertised widely to get a GP to practise in the suburb of Ellenbrook. Ellenbrook, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics March report, has the fastest growing population in Australia. From 1996 to 2001, it has grown by 847 per cent. There are now approximately 5,500 young families living in the area of Ellenbrook. They do not have one GP to service them. They are all forced to travel widely or to rely on the Swan District Hospital.
The Perth and Hills Division of General Practice have had a look at the package that was proposed by Senator Patterson. They have advised that it will have absolutely no impact on the provision of GPs in that area and that there is no incentive for a GP to actually move out to Ellenbrook to practise. They say there is far too much red tape in the entire package and that it is hard to find out which GPs will be eligible for assistance under her package and which ones will not. The package does not make a distinction for a medium-size community like that—the community is too large to set up a sole practice, yet it is not large enough to attract anyone from the corporate medical sector—and, therefore, the package is completely irrelevant to its needs.
The other thing the former Minister for Health and Ageing was famous for is this. Remember the dramatic demise in bulk-billing and the heated disagreement because she was starving our public hospital systems of adequate resources? What was the minister's response to that? Remember when she decided to change the language? (Time expired)

The documents read as follows—
Government Response to the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence And Trade References Committee Report on Materiel Acquisition And Management In Defence
Introduction
The Government welcomes the report prepared by the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee on Materiel Acquisition and Management in Defence.
It is pleasing to note that the Committee has acknowledged the positive progress that has been made to date in relation to material acquisition and management in Defence. 
The report also indicates that further improvements can be made within Defence to improve procurement and Defence industry outcomes. This is consistent with the Government's previously expressed view, that while the management of major Defence acquisitions has improved significantly since the establishment of the Defence Materiel Organisation, there is still a way to go. It is also consistent with the Government's decision last year to commission the Defence Procurement Review, which will report on the key challenges associated with the management of Defence projects, how these are currently being addressed, and any potential improvements that can be made.
The following section addresses the specific recom-mendations contained in the Committee's report. Comments on the benchmarks against which the Committee has proposed ongoing review of the Defence Materiel Organisation follow the specific recommendations.
Recommendations
Recommendation 1.
The Committee recommends that in the years 2004 and 2006 the Defence Materiel Organisation seeks advice on the perceived effectiveness of System Program Offices from the Defence Industry Advisory Council, the Australian Industry Group Defence Council and the Australian Industry and Defence Network. That advice should be complied into a short report, submitted prior to the 2004 and 2006 Budget Estimates to the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References and Legislation Committees, and to the Defence Subcommittee of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade.
Government Response 
Agree.
Defence will seek views from non-government and industry sectors and will make these results available to the committees.
Recommendation 2.
The Committee recommends that special training and professional development be undertaken jointly by capability and acquisition staff to ensure that all staff have a clear understanding of, and unequivocal commitment to, and the skills and knowledge to fully implement the practices specified in the Capability Systems Life Cycle Management Manual 2002.
Government Response
Agree inprinciple. 
Ensuring that staff have an understanding of the Capability Life Cycle Management Manual 2002 requires an appreciation of the processes, policies, tools and training that underpin the capability systems life cycle. 
As of May 2003, all Capability Systems and DMO staff have had access to an on-line IT system that provides process and reference information at a one-stop shop. Priority has been given to core processes constituting the capability management life cycle.
Recommendation 3.
The Committee recommends that:
(a)	AusIndustry undertake a specific pro-motional initiative to encourage and assist Small to Medium Enterprises (SMEs) to properly register their R&D activities with AusIndustry; and
(b)	The DSTO develop a special program to nurture partnerships between the DSTO, the CSIRO and SMEs with respect to research and development in areas of mutual interest, and to expand existing mechanisms by which SMEs can seek R&D and technology advice.
Government Response
Agree in principle.
(a)	This recommendation is addressed to AusIndustry which has advised that this is consistent with the marketing initiatives it already undertakes. The Department of Industry, Tourism and Resources has advised that, as a result of strong marketing, 1,200 additional firms registered with AusIndustry between February 2002 and February 2003. The vast majority of these firms were SMEs, and the figure represents an increase of more than 50 per cent. AusIndustry has also reduced the size of the registration form from 13 to seven pages.
(b)	The Defence Science and Technology Organisation already operates a number of initiatives in this area and further develop-ment will be encouraged.
Recommendation 4.
The Committee recommends that during Budget Estimates the DMO table before the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee an audited summary of the feedback provided by industry to the DMO via the 360 degree scorecard process.
Government Response
Agree.
The Department will respond to the Senate Committee as requested.
Recommendation 5.
The Committee recommends that:
(a)	the Senate request the Auditor General to direct that the proposed 2003-04 audit of DMO by the Australian National Audit Office include a cultural audit that will assess:
-	DMO's espoused corporate values and standards and staff compliance with these;
-	management and staff values, behav-iours and competencies measured against the capability requirement;
-	employee attitudes, morale, beliefs and motivation;
-	employee understanding of, for example, the DMO's customers, industry partners, strategies business plans, roles and contributions to the overall mission of Defence;
-	communication processes;
-	the effectiveness of change management programs, employee commitment to them an the extent of the benefits materialising; and
-	compliance with health and safety regulations.
(b)	on the basis of that cultural audit the Under Secretary Defence Materiel shall engage a suitably qualified change management specialist to assist the DMO to respond to the findings and recommendations of the audit.
Government Response
(a)	This issue is a matter for the Senate.
(b)	Disagree. Defence's response to the outcomes of any audit needs to be considered in the light of the audit findings.
Recommendation 6.
The Committee recommends that:
(a)	a panel of suitably qualified case managers, endorsed by industry, be established within the Industry Division of the DMO to handle complaints or disputes that have not been resolved in a timely way between the two parties immediately concerned;
(b)	the case managers be trained, and given broad powers to explore issues across all levels and divisions within DMO and the relevant Service arm;
(c)	case managers shall report their findings and recommendations to the Under Secretary Defence Materiel, with copies to the Vice Chief of the Defence Force and the Project Governance Board (where applicable);
(d)	the DMO publish an account of its complaint handling and dispute resolution method which sets out the time lines to be observed, the role and powers of the case managers, and specifying the USDM as the ultimate decision maker in respect of a dispute.
Government Response
Defence accepts the need to deal with complaints expeditiously and constructively. The DMO will publish its complaint handling and dispute resolution procedures on its web site in order to make them publicly available. 
The Inspector General also has an independent role in complaint handling and resolution. 
Recommendation 7.
The Committee recommends that the Defence Industry Advisory Council commission the development of an efficient formal mechanism for the promotion and handling of unsolicited proposals from SMEs. That mechanism should be applied at the level of the System Program Offices and be coordinated by the DMO's Industry Division. Receipt of unsolicited proposals should be promptly acknowledged, and a time frame specified within which follow-up should occur.
Government Response
Agree in principle.
Guidelines for the recently announced Defence Unsolicited Innovation Proposals Scheme will be released at the Defence + Industry Conference being held on the 24-26 June 2003. Industry was consulted in the development of this scheme.
Recommendation 8.
The Committee recommends that:
(a)	in the latter half of 2003, the Defence Materiel Organisation convene a major seminar involving relevant Defence and industry representatives to assess the effectiveness of the 1998 Team Australia policy and to shape recommendations accordingly; and 
(b)	the proceedings of the seminar be tabled in the parliament along with a response from the Minister for Defence to the recom-mendations emerging from the seminar.
Government Response
Agree in principle.
Defence has encouraged a `Team Australia' approach to the Joint Strike Fighter project and more recently the United States littoral ships project. Development of the concept and its application in practice will be the subject of debate at the Defence + Industry Conference being held on the 24-26 June 2003.
Recommendation 9.
The Committee recommends that:
(a)	in the event that a project milestone is missed or that a supplier flags a delay in the provision of a contracted deliverable, then the project manager shall instigate a written report on the matter to the USDM, with copies to the Project Governance Board and the relevant Service Capability Management Board; and
(b)	should agreement between project manager and contractor about how to remedy the matter not be arrived at within 15 days of such a report being submitted, a case manager from Industry Division shall be commissioned to negotiate a remedy. The case manager shall report to the USDM within 15 working days. In the event that a remedy has not been negotiated, the matter shall be referred to the Project Governance Board for a determination as to how to proceed. The USDM shall then make a final decision taking into account the advice of the Project Governance Board.
Government Response
Disagree.
Vigorous action is needed when milestones are missed or likely to be missed but the Government does not support the detail of this recommendation for a number of reasons.
Firstly, the highly prescriptive approach does not reflect the reality of project management and the need to tailor solutions to the particular problem. Secondly, Industry Division staff are not necessarily the most experienced in resolution of project management issues. Thirdly, the time frames proposed are unrealistic, particularly where the reasons for the delay are complex. Finally, the recommendations do not take account of the need to protect Defence's legal position. 
DMO has released Project Management Methodology (version 2), which provides more practical project management guidance to project managers on risk management, exception reporting and dealing with contract delays or disputes. This Project Management Methodology guide provides a clear delineation of roles and responsibilities between a project and Project Governance Boards. The introduction of the Project Management Methodology (version 2) may deliver the outcome desired by the Committee.
Recommendation 10.
The Committee recommends that the Senate request the Auditor General to:
(a)	produce, on an annual basis, a report on progress in major Defence projects, detailing cost, time and technical performance data for each project;
(b)	to model the report on that ordered by the British House of Commons and produced by the UK Comptroller and Auditor General; and
(c)	to include in the report such analysis of performance and emerging trends as will enable the parliament to have high visibility of all current and pending major projects.
Government Response
This is a matter for the Senate. The Government notes that there is already substantial scrutiny of the Defence acquisition program by the Auditor General.
Recommendation 11.
The Committee recommends that, in the event of Defence entering a long term partnership with a particular supplier, the DMO should remain in regular contact with the unsuccessful bidders. The DMO should report progress with the partnership, update potential suppliers on any changes to capability requirements emerging during the course of the partnership, and keep them abreast of strategic developments. The DMO should assist potential suppliers to be in a competitive position if and when an existing partnership expires and renewal is sought.
Government Response
Disagree.
Progress of the partnership would largely be commercial-in-confidence and significant changes in capability requirements are already publicised through the updated Defence Capability Plans or specific announcements in relation to the variation.
Assisting potential suppliers to be competitive is not practical as DMO would only be able to provide non-confidential information about requirements, not the incumbent's performance.
The proposal would also divert scarce, experienced resources from higher priorities.
Recommendation 12.	
The Committee recommends that:
(a)	once a contract has been awarded for a Defence project valued at over A$100,000, the details of the winning bid should be published, with the provision that information about specific matters which bear the necessary quality of confidentiality may be withheld from publication where detriment to either the contractor or Defence would ensue. Prior to publication of the details, Defence should seek a formal opinion from ANAO as to whether that publication meets the appropriate standards of transparency; and
(b)	Defence should publish, with the contract details, a brief statement setting out its reasons for selecting the winning bid.
Government Response
Disagree. 
Defence gazettes all contracts over $2,000 and already publishes summary detail of contracts valued over $100,000, in accordance with the Senate Order. Defence responds to parliamentary committees on the release of specific contracts, in camera if necessary where there are confidentiality aspects.
Publishing of further detail would add to costs, given the size of contracts and the inclusion of sensitive data. It could reduce the quality of bids if it was to set benchmarks for individual pricing data.
Recommendation 13.
The Committee recommends that the Senate, under Standing Order 164, order the production, upon its completion, of the report by Director of Trials (DTRIALS) of the Review of Test and Evaluation in Defence, and that the Senate refer the document to the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee for examination and report.
Government Response
This is a matter for the Senate. However, if it is the wish of the Committee, the Review of Test and Evaluation in Defence report can be provided to the Committee when completed. 
SUGGESTED PERFORMANCE BENCHMARKS
The Committee intends to monitor closely all aspects of the Defence Materiel Organisation over the next few years, culminating in a formal review of the organisation at the end of 2005. The Committee will also be examining the performance of the DMO undertaken by the Australian National Audit Office.
Government Response 
The Government agrees in principle to these benchmarks. They are quite detailed and not all can be reasonably accommodated, however best efforts will be made to do so. The specific responses to each of the benchmarks are below. 

Performance Benchmark
Comments
Adherence to the requirements of the Capability Systems Life Cycle Management Manual 2002.
The intent of this benchmark is supported. DMO will use the manual as a steering point for continued development of its own policies and procedures, and shall work with Capability Systems staff to ensure that these requirements are consistent.
Adherence to the Goals and Values set out in the Defence Materiel Guide 2002.
The intent of this benchmark is supported, however it would be difficult to provide meaningful data for benchmarking
Achievement of the objectives and performance indicators contained in the DMO Balanced Scorecard.
Supported. 
Full compliance with the Business Rules specified in the DMO's Corporate Governance Framework.
While compliance is clearly the objective, this benchmark would be exceptionally difficult to measure and impose a significant increase in workload across the organisation.
Implementation, by the end of 2004, of the Defence Business Model for in-service support, including a Customer-Supplier Agreement between Output Executives and Enabling Executives, and Service Level Agreements between the SPOs and the Force Element Groups.
The intent of this benchmark is supported. DMO is progressively implementing a Defence Customer-Supplier model in accordance with Defence policy. However it should be recognised that this will be an evolving process as parties work together to continuously improve performance measures.A correction should be made to this benchmark, as Service Level Agreements may not be made between just Systems Project Offices and Force Element Groups.
Between 2003-05, the Air 87 Armed Reconnaissance Helicopter project, the Airborne Early Warning and Control Aircraft project, and the replacement Patrol Boats project shall meet all scheduled milestones.
Not supported. It is unreasonable to expect that every milestone will be achieved. The suggested approach is that non-achievement of scheduled milestones will only be acceptable where sound analysis demonstrates that the associated risks are manageable and project level critical dates are not compromised.
Tracking and managing of enterprise risk in accordance with the DMO Risk Management Plan.
Supported. DMO is currently establishing processes and structures to support systematic and coordinated risk management in accordance with the DMO Risk Management Plan.
Achievement, demonstrated by the results of the annual Defence Staff Survey, of the DMO's goal to `create a climate where people are valued for doing their best.'
Supported. Staff attitude survey data can be provided to the Committee.
Timely provision by DMO to the Senate Committee, on an annual basis, of an audited summary of the industry feedback on the effectiveness of the Systems Project Offices.
Not supported. This benchmark is disconnected with the first recommendation made in the report, which seeks information on Systems Project Offices in 2004 and 2006. It would be preferable if the recommendation, rather than the benchmark was accepted.
Full compliance with the Defence Procurement Policy Manual and the requirements of the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997.
DMO agrees with this benchmark as the policy and guidance is already in place to achieve it. However, measurement of this benchmark will be difficult.
Achievement by 2005 of tendering costs as a percentage of contract value being at a level equivalent to commercial industry standards.
Not supported. DMO does not agree with this performance benchmark due to the practicality of collecting the data and the utility of comparison with a commercial benchmark.Public accountability and associated processes prevent the DMO from meeting commercial industry standards and the nature of Defence projects generally exceeds the complexity and risk observed in the private sector.
For each project, acceptance of materiel capability to be on the basis of fulfillment of the requirements of the Operational Concept Document and the Test Concept Document.
The intent of this benchmark is supported. DMO accepts the intent of this benchmark. Policy, training and guidance are already in place to facilitate achievement of this benchmark.It should be noted that projects approved before the implementation of the Capability System Life Cycle Management model were done so on the basis of a business case and contain different forms of documentation.
Successful implementation, by the end of financial year 2003-04, of policy and guidelines for achieving world's best practice in the acquisition and maintenance of software intensive systems, with particular references to independent verification and validation and the management of safety critical systems.
The intent of this benchmark is supported. Policy and guidance for Independent Verification and Validation will be in place by the end of 2003-04. Safety related systems policy and guidance is in place, but is currently undergoing revision and updated and will be implemented prior to the end of 2003-04. Best practice in acquisition and maintenance of software systems requires ongoing implementation, piloting, evaluation and reissuing revised guidance. In addition to implementing policy and guidelines, the necessary tools and training are required to evolve with software standards, lessons learnt and revised policy.
Establishment of a formal and transparent complaint handling mechanisms using a case management approach for implementation from the beginning of 2004.
Not supported. The government will only consider the use of case managers when the complaints are of a serious nature involving conflict of interests, fraud or criminal activity.DMO is prepared to document its dispute resolution processes.
Independently verified enhancement, each year, of the involvement of Australian industry in Defence acquisition projects, in accordance with the Australian Industry Involvement Manual 2001.
Not supported. Australian industry involvement will vary each year due to the Defence Capability Plan.
Establishment, by the end of financial year 2003-04, of a database of all Professional Service Providers engaged by Defence which will include details of the location and project upon which the PSP is engaged, the length of time for which the PSP has been involved in the project, and the anticipated duration of the PSP's engagement.
This is a resourcing issue rather than a benchmark and is being addressed from a whole of Defence perspective. For DMO to establish a separate DMO database is cost prohibitive.
Implementation, by the end of 2004, of a fully functioning inventory and asset management system (SDSS) with common software and common processes across all three ADF services.
Supported.
By the end of 2005, full integration of SDSS with Defence's financial management system.
Supported. Such integration is unlikely to be achieved through a single system.
In each of 2004 and 2005, at least twenty DMO staff will have completed the Masters degree level Project Manager Development Course.
The intent of this benchmark is supported. The critical number of staff completing the course will depend on staff availability and funding, considering that the indicated costing of this benchmark is $800,000 per annum.
In each 2004 and 2005 at least three DMO staff will have participated in an industry exchange/work experience program of no less than 6 months duration.
Supported in principle but will be dependent on staff availability and funding.
By September 2003, the endorsement by the Defence Capability Committee of the report by DTRIALS addressing Defence's Test and Evaluation policy.
Supported. Defence Capability Committee members responses on the report are due by the end of May 2003.
By the end of 2004 each Systems Program Office and business unit will have established quality management systems, and 50 per cent will have been formally accredited.
The intent of this benchmark is supported. Twenty-nine per cent of the existing systems have been accredited and accreditation of the remaining systems is an ongoing activity. The priority is on ensuring that high quality processes are in place, documented and applied, rather than achievement of an accreditation.
By the end of 2005, the DMO will have achieved accreditation to ISO standard of its corporate level quality management system.
Not supported. The priority is on ensuring that high quality processes are in place, documented and applied, rather than achievement of an accreditation.
The Defence and Industry Advisory Council will have met at least twice per year in 2003, 2004 and 2005.
The Defence and Industry Advisory Council meets at the request of the Minister for Defence.

JOINT STANDING COMMITTEE ON FOREIGN AFFAIRS, DEFENCE AND TRADE
VISIT TO AUSTRALIAN FORCES DEPLOYED IN THE INTERNATIONAL COALITION AGAINST TERRORISM 
RECOMMENDATION 1:
The Minister for Defence should consider issuing an Australian campaign medal to those Australian Defence Force personnel who have served on operations in support of the International Coalition Against Terrorism (paragraph 8.13).
Government Response:
Not Agreed. Following the release of the Committee's report, the Interdepartmental Committee on Honours and Awards to Defence Force Personnel considered the issue and is of the view that special circumstances do not exist to warrant recommending a change to existing policy. 
Government policy is normally that only one Australian military service medal is awarded to recognise a single type of service. In the case of the deployment of Australian Defence Force personnel to operations in support of the International Coalition Against Terrorism, the Government has agreed to issue the Australian Active Service Medal with clasp “ICAT”. At a future time, should a foreign award be offered for service to the International Coalition Against Terrorism, the Government will favourably consider supporting the proposal under the provisions of the Guidelines Concerning the Acceptance and Wearing of Foreign Honours and Awards by Australians.
RECOMMENDATION 2:
The Minister for Defence should:
	expedite the awarding of the Australian Service Medal to those Australian Defence Force personnel deployed as part of OPERATION SLIPPER who have already returned from their deployment; and
	ensure that, in future, the Australian Active Service Medal is awarded immediately upon completion of a tour of duty (paragraph 8.14).
Government Response:
Agreed. Defence has made, and is making, every effort to expedite the processing of medals for personnel deployed with the International Coalition Against Terrorism. Defence will make every effort to ensure medals are issued by the dates requested by the Component Commands, as already occurs and indeed occurred for deployments to East Timor. The dates are normally set prior to the end of a tour of duty. The processing period is approximately 14 weeks, but is often achieved in a shorter time. This period ensures that only entitled personnel receive medals following exhaustive assessment by Defence and subsequent approval of all awards by the Governor-General.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reports: Government Responses</title>,Committees,33,1
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2003-10-09,"—by leave—This statement is made on behalf of the Hon. Tony Abbott, Minister for Health and Ageing. The order arises from two motions moved by Senator Allison as agreed by the Senate on 8 October 2003 and it relates to a number of matters. With regard to the advice provided by the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation in August 2002, as outlined in question on notice No. 1750(3) relating to the options for vaccination programs ahead of the ATAGI recommendations. I wish to inform the Senate that the ATAGI finalised its recommendations in the document Australian Immunisation Handbook, 8th edition. This handbook was approved by the National Health and Medical Research Council on 18 September this year. I will now table this handbook.
With regard to submissions received by the National Health and Medical Research Council as part of its public consultation on the draft 8th Australian Immunisation Handbook, I wish to inform the Senate that, as a general rule, submissions received as part of a public consultation process are treated by the NHMRC as confidential. The Department of Health and Ageing will discuss with the NHMRC a process to consult with the authors of the submissions to seek their agreement to tabling these documents. With regard to the request for all documents relating to government funding, its requirements of and the subsequent performance of the National Consortium for Education in Primary Medical Care Alternative Pathway Program since its inception, which should include any review documents, I wish to inform the Senate that this request potentially concerns large numbers of documents. Is it possible for the senator to be more specific?
With regard to the latest reports admitted by the MBS Attendance Item Restructure Working Group, I table that report. Finally, with regard to the most recent draft National Drug Research Strategy, as prepared by the National Drugs Research Committee, I wish to inform the Senate that the draft National Drug Research Strategy is a working document. Of the parties involved, only the Commonwealth has cleared the document. The Department of Health and Ageing will contact the other parties to see if they are prepared to clear the document.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL DRUG RESEARCH STRATEGYHEALTH: VACCINATION PROGRAM</title>,<title>Returns to Order</title>,Miscellaneous,35,1

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2003-10-09,"—Turning to the ministerial statement that the Prime Minister made yesterday dealing with Senate reform, when thinking about proposed changes affecting the Senate that politicians and others have raised, it is worth bearing in mind the current raft of bills facing rejection, including the government's unfair workplace relations bills which seek to give employees reduced rights in workplace issues. There are other bills of that ilk that are currently in the pile. In June this year the Prime Minister put forward a raft of proposals to assist the government in overriding the Senate's rejection of government bills. Mr Howard was quoted during the closing address to the Liberal Party national convention as saying:
Tragically for Australia the Australian Senate is recent years, so far from being a state's house or a house of review has become a house of obstruction.
This particular statement belongs in the same category as other untruths purported by this Howard government since coming into power in 1996. The proposal suggests the need to eliminate the idea of a double dissolution followed by an election for all members of both chambers before a joint sitting could be convened to vote on a bill that the Senate had found to be flawed or one which the Senate had refused to pass according to what was acceptable to the government. This is on the face of it a complete turnaround by someone who, when he was in opposition, argued that our Senate was—and I quote:
... one of the most democratically elected chambers in the world—a body which at present more faithfully represents the popular will of the total Australian people at the last election than does the House of Representatives ...
That was from the Commonwealth parliamentary debates of not that long ago—8 October 1987. We have had a dramatic turnaround by Mr Howard since that period. You also have to put that in context. There were Senate reform proposals floated between 1985 and 1988, and it was not an issue that he had not turned his mind to. They were clearly there during that period. There was a constitutional committee and debates occurring during that period.
During the period of Mr John Howard's prime ministership, 1,269 bills have been passed by the Senate. Only 25 bills have been negatived—seven twice—and 11 have been laid aside by the government—four twice. This is not a bad ratio of bills passed considering the coalition received only 42.69 per cent of the primary vote in the last election. The truth is that both sides of politics have taken advantage of the Senate's power to amend or negative government bills. But, sadly, only the Liberals have blocked supply. The Howard government attempted to clarify its stance on undermining the powers of the Senate by claims of electoral mandate. It seems that that catchcry is used far too often to justify any course of action that is desired by an executive government. An overwhelming push by the government is the claim that it has the responsibility and the right to have the parliament enact legislative proposals that it campaigned on during the election process. We know that is a broad brush because not all issues are canvassed during campaigns. This house and the House of Representatives does deal with emergent issues and new issues that arise post campaigns. If governments were only to deal with the broad sweep of electoral promises or in some instances their core promises then it would be a bereft house of legislation.
The Prime Minister's ever-changing views, however, could be highlighted after the 1998 election when he said:
I have a very simple view about the political process in this country. And that view is that elections are opportunities for opposing political forces to lay their plans in detail before the Australian people and when the Australian people have made a decision it is the obligation of the victor in that political contest to implement the plans laid before the Australian people. There is nothing complicated about it.
What Mr Howard did not include in that statement was the decision by the Australian people to leave the Senate, more commonly known as the house of review, under non-government control. That is to say, the majority of Australian people elected the Howard government but did not trust them enough to put the review process within their hands. The Prime Minister did not include comments like those he made in 1987. I will repeat them for those who may have missed them last time. He said that the Australian Senate was:
... one of the most democratically elected chambers in the world ... 
The Howard government has floated a range of ideas, some of which are in the `you must be joking' basket. Government proposals, although not directly endorsed, include abolishing equal representation of the states, a proposal that seems to fly in the face of what is entrenched in the Constitution. Of course, these matters have now coalesced into the document that we now have before us. But it is worthwhile mentioning that this was not the only proposal that the Howard government had flagged in the lead-up to this ministerial statement. There were a number of proposals that were in that basket of goods that could have been brought forward. So it should come as no surprise to this government that there are issues that we would like addressed as well.
Then there is the idea of reducing the number of minor parties or senators, or eliminating them altogether by imposing a minimum percentage of first preferences. I raise these issues not as matters that are before us today but to remind the government that these are their ideas that they brought forward but saw as not fit to put on the table. It is not actually surprising that they did not put them on the table; they are in many senses in the `too hard' basket or the `mad' basket.
The government suggested other matters but, in truth, the government suggested that minor parties are using their balance of power for political opportunism, which ultimately reduces any common purpose to the lowest denominator. Again, the Australian people chose to have a Senate which was not in the government's hands. The public expects its Senate to be a check and balance on the political process. Political opportunism—I am not going to run away from a statement like that—is not unheard of but it is the government that must seek support from the minor parties or the opposition to ensure its bills pass.
Reform of Senate procedures to make a smoother and more accountable upper house in this parliament is a positive thing but this attempt by the Howard government is something which we have said we will look at more closely. We would expect that it is not in the realm of being a political stunt; we would expect that it is a serious attempt to look at these issues more broadly. What we have is a 100-year tradition in Australia with polls and election results that show the Australian voters prefer to have two houses with separate mandates, if the government wants to rely on mandates as its mantra.
In the last election, the Australian people showed their distrust of the government when they elected a nongovernment controlled upper house. Australians expect each house to do what it was elected to do. The checks and reviews used in the Senate form the basis of a sound and equitable decision-making process in relation to proposed bills, which become, in most cases, laws. We have processes already in place to ensure that all legislation deemed controversial has the capacity to be reviewed by Senate legislation committees, we have general processes, including the regulations and ordinances committee, to view delegated legislation and we have the scrutiny of bills committee to look at the bills which come before this parliament. This is a part of the process specifically designed to ensure sticking points within legislation can be examined beforehand and held up to the light to examine whether there are issues that require amendment or further discussion. The government is unable, in part, to accept this process.
How can the Senate be accused of blocking legislation when the coalition government fails to present bills for debate that it has listed on its own program? This week alone, several bills were pulled from the legislative program and, at the end of the year, my colleagues opposite will—as they often have in the last couple of years—shout from the rafters that the Senate has not performed its duty in passing enough bills. The point, of course, is that this place can only pass those bills put before it. The government sometimes—I will give it the benefit of the doubt—comes up with a wish list of bills that it wants passed, there is insufficient time for that to occur, the government knows that and builds that into its program. The government understands that process and you can wonder whether or not it is simply a tactic to put a little bit of pressure where it might help in the passage of other bills which it deems more urgent in the legislative program.
To argue that there is such a thing as Senate obstructionism is to ramp up the issue, which I referred to earlier, as to whether or not this is a serious attempt by the Howard government to look at reform or whether it is a political stunt. If they go down the road of obstructionism and the grey area that is associated with that, it can only be to one end; it cannot be a serious attempt to look at Senate reform.
In cases such as the passage of the goods and services tax, the government did a deal with the Australian Democrats to ensure the bill would pass, yet it cries foul when other bills fail to pass muster. Perhaps it has not been able to get the Democrats on side; perhaps it has not been able to get the other four Independents on side; perhaps it has not been able to persuade the opposition of the merits of that particular piece of legislation in toto—it might have been able to persuade the opposition in part but then it might have failed to accept real amendments to the bill which have been put forward and which would make it far better. It seems that the government has one view when in opposition and quite another when in government and it seems, in some parts, quite another depending on the particular bill that is before it.
The government's intention to reform the deadlock provisions of the Constitution in section 57 and proposals for a referendum to give the government the power to push blocked legislation through the Senate without going to a double dissolution is a matter—and the chamber understands that process—that has been examined before by a number of committees. There were two substantive reviews, which I referred to earlier: the 1959 review and the 1985 review, which substantially covered this issue of Senate reform.
The Australian Senate has evolved into a unique body clearly a product of the early federalist model. But the Constitution of Australia made the position of the Senate as clear as the founding fathers could make it. Section 53 and section 57 are closely tied together. The end of section 53 states:
Except as provided in this section, the Senate shall have equal power with the House of Representatives in respect of all proposed laws.
What this appears to say is that the Senate has full power to pass or reject any bill, including a money bill. However, it is plain that the laws appropriating revenue or money or imposing taxation must originate in the House of Representatives and the Senate may suggest amendments although not amend.
Of course, what was perhaps at first not clear to delegates to the convention debates back in the 1890s was that differences in fact could arise between the two houses of parliament and that a deadlock may occur. Section 57 was provided as a means of resolving deadlocks by resort to a simultaneous dissolution of both houses. It is a long section and not particularly clear, although subsequent cases have since clarified its operation. In short, the section provides that if the Senate, with an interval of three months, twice rejects a proposed law or fails to pass it, or passes it with amendments which the House of Representatives does not accept, then both houses of parliament can be dissolved by the Governor-General on advice from the Prime Minister. If the disagreement continues a joint session is called by the Governor-General and, if it is passed by an absolute majority of the total number of both houses, it becomes law.
It is clear that sections 53 and 57 came from the convention debates of the 1890s as a compromise. But then, the Senate's practices, the House of Representatives' practices and perhaps life tell us that there are compromises that have to be worked with. Six double dissolutions have in fact followed. Interestingly, the third double dissolution in 1974 resulted in the first and only joint sitting convened under section 57. It was, of course, followed by the fourth double dissolution in 1975—and I do not know whether the five minutes remaining will allow me to do justice to the 1975 issue—
—Don't try.
—so I will not dwell on that. I might find time during an adjournment debate, perhaps, to deal with the duplicity of the coalition government during that period. I might, if time permits, deal with it later—and certainly, if Senator Abetz is in the chamber, I will take the opportunity.
In reality section 57 has been used by an opposition to gain government. That is what it was used for. There flowed from that a number of court cases. Two opposition senators challenged the validity of the double dissolution in the High Court in Cormack v. Cope. There were also another two cases: Victoria v. Commonwealth and Petroleum and Mineral Authority Act 1973 and Western Australia v. Commonwealth, which was colloquially referred to as the `Territory senator's case'. They did clarify the position of section 57 to the extent that by 1988 a constitutional commission appointed by the government in 1985 to review the Constitution reported that, as a result of those three cases, at least the following points were settled: (1) the section operates distributively, thus the government can stockpile bills; (2) there is no time limit within which a double dissolution must occur following the second rejection of a bill by the Senate; (3) the three-month interval runs from the Senate's rejection of or failure to pass the bill; and (4) section 57 is justiciable in relation to whether an occasion has arisen in which a joint sitting is valid.
It is worth noting that the six double dissolutions show that a formal mechanism was necessary to resolve interhouse conflicts. For Labor, constitutional reform is a long-held conviction—reform not solely about the moment or advantaging the government in power. To disappoint Senator Abetz, I do encourage Senate reform, but I encourage debate about Senate reform even more to ensure that any model that is thrown up is held up to the light and scrutinised for the best possible outcomes. For Mr John Howard, however, constitutional reform appears to be—and I hope to be persuaded that I am wrong in this—only desirable when the Liberals are in government. Regardless of the Liberals' double standards and opportunism, Labor does welcome the fact that Mr Howard wants to look anew at constitutional reform. His exclusive focus on Senate powers, though, may be transparent or he may be able to convince us that it is a wider avenue that he will trod.
—`Tread'—get it right.
—`Tread', I should say. 
—Sack your speech writer!
—I departed, unfortunately. At the Liberal Party National Conference in June he announced his intention to prepare and issue for public debate a discussion paper on the proposal on the settlement of deadlocks originally recommended in the 1959 report of the parliament's Joint Committee on Constitutional Review. The report did propose a new constitutional provision allowing for a joint sitting of the two houses to pass disagreed legislation after a period of three months has elapsed. However, it also recommended the current double dissolution provisions be maintained substantially unaltered; that the Governor-General have the power to terminate a joint sitting, regardless of whether or not the disputed bill had been voted on; and that, if a general election occurred less than 12 months after a deadlock occurred, a joint sitting could be held after the general election. All of these the Prime Minister failed to mention.
We need to understand the effect of Mr Howard's June proposal, taking as an example the ASIO bill. What we now have before us is a ministerial statement which does highlight two proposals. It is an issue about which we have said that a broader approach is necessary. If the government is serious about constitutional reform and about Senate reform, I do not think the deadlock provisions alone should be addressed in isolation. Other important issues like the removal of power to block supply and fixed four-year terms for both houses must also be addressed. They should form part of the overall discussion. The removal of the power of the Senate to block, defer or reject supply is integral to any reform of Senate powers. In addition, one of the models also proposed by the Joint Committee on Constitutional Review in 1959 was revisited by Mr Howard early last month; he called it the Lavarch model, which looks very similar to, if not the same as, the original proposal. Of course, this floated the idea of a constitutional alteration to allow for a joint sitting. But, of course, that was not in isolation either.",SENATE,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Constitutional Reform: Senate Powers</title>,Ministerial Statements,37,1
"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2003-10-09,"—The Prime Minister yesterday launched an attack on Australia's democracy. Our parliamentary democracy has evolved and strengthened since its birth over 100 years ago. Our democracy and our parliament are built on the principle that checks and balances are provided to protect us from the abuse of power by an executive government. The strongest brake on the abuse of power by a government is the Senate. Any attack on the Senate is an attack on the greatest strength of Australia's democracy.
The Prime Minister wants the public to believe that his proposal is moderate and reasonable and is not an attack on the Senate. This is simply not the case; in fact, the opposite is true. The Prime Minister's proposal is a head-on attack on the powers of the Senate. It will not improve the workings of this chamber or strengthen our democratic institution—the parliament. The Prime Minister's proposal will instead make the Senate irrelevant. It will turn the Senate into a toothless forum for discussion, and the Senate will have no more power other than to shout into the wind of government decree. It will be powerless to halt the march of prime ministers and their arrogance.
The reason why the government cannot get all of its most controversial legislation through the parliament is that it does not have majority support. Let me repeat that central fact: this government does not have the support of the majority of Australians. The morning after every election, most Australians wake up to the news that the party which they voted against has come to power. Only 43 per cent of the Australian voters in the last election chose for their primary vote—their first choice—the coalition. Yet the Prime Minister wants 100 per cent of the power. Mr Forty-Three Per Cent wants 100 per cent of the power. This is a minority government making a grab for absolute power.
The Howard government have only ever received the support of 47 per cent of the Australian population. That was in their first election. The coalition dropped as low as 37.7 per cent of the vote in the Senate in 1998. But the coalition believe that they are the only people who should have a say on what becomes the law of the day in this country. We see governments constantly ignoring the voices of dissent in the House of Representatives. The government are now seeking to be able to ignore the different and the dissenting voices that are in this chamber, in the Senate.
This is not what our founding fathers and mothers had in mind. The Prime Minister writes in his document that proportional representation ensures a legitimate voice in the parliament for a cross-section of interests. The founding fathers and mothers of our Constitution would agree with the Prime Minister about the importance of proportional representation. Electoral reform since this democracy's birth has a long and proud history of recognising the value of proportional representation. Catherine Helen Spence, who was the most significant founding mother of our Constitution and who features on the $5 note, was a vocal advocate for proportional representation. She had a pamphlet which came out in 1861 that spoke on this issue, called A Plea for Pure Democracy. In the 1891 constitutional convention, proportional representation was raised and discussed as a favourable option. In the 1898 constitutional convention a decision could not be reached on the voting method to be used. So the first vote for the parliament in this country combined a single member electorate vote in the mainland states with proportional representation in Tasmania. Proportional representation was then, of course, introduced to be the electoral system for the Senate by the Chifley government in 1948.
The Australian Greens believe that there is need for electoral reform. We believe that electoral reform should be pursued to bring greater democracy to our parliament and to give greater power to the voting population of Australia. Our Constitution deliberately leaves open the option of expanding proportional representation in the House of Representatives. It allows it to occur by a simple act of parliament rather than requiring a referendum. The Greens believe that the single most important reform for achieving a more pure democracy in this country is to introduce proportional representation into the House of Representatives. Proportional representation exists in Australia in the ACT Legislative Assembly, in Tasmania and in most local councils in my home state of New South Wales. It has been adopted throughout continental Europe, in the European parliament, and in Ireland, Scotland, Wales and New Zealand. Recently the Blair Labour government committed to consideration of proportional representation for the House of Commons in the United Kingdom. Where we have seen proportional representation being introduced as an electoral system here and overseas, we have seen a greater proportion of women being elected to our parliaments. This is what the Prime Minister means when writing in the document tabled yesterday that proportional representation allows a diversity of voices to be represented in our parliaments.
The Australian Greens released a paper last week that outlines four options for bringing greater democracy into our parliament by bringing proportional representation into the House of Representatives. I seek leave now to table both the Greens paper on proportional representation in the House of Representatives and also the Greens paper released yesterday critiquing the Prime Minister's proposal, which was circulated to whips earlier today.
Leave granted.
—The options that the Greens have canvassed for reform include making each state an electorate and electing MPs for each state through proportional representation in these states. The paper also puts forward a proposal about introducing the Hare-Clark system, like we see in Tasmania and in the ACT—splitting the country into a number of electorates and electing a handful of members in each of those electorates. It also suggests the MMP system, the mixed members proportional system, used in New Zealand and in Germany, that combines single member electorates with state-wide proportional representation.
The Prime Minister's proposal does not focus on the value of proportional representation. Proportional representation is about giving power to Australian voters, but the Prime Minister's proposal is about giving power to the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister's proposal is a direct attack on the Australian people who support the role that the Senate plays in scrutinising legislation, in improving government proposals for laws that affect all Australians and in providing a check on executive power. Australian voters vote differently in the Senate to how they vote in the House of Representatives. They do that because they recognise the check and the balance that the Senate provides on the executive government of the day. They want the executive government's power to be balanced, to be moderated, by a Senate of a different political composition. At every election in recent times we have seen more and more people vote for political parties that are not the two major parties. Yet the direction of the Prime Minister's reforms is taking away the power of that increasing number of voters who are putting non-major parties into the Australian Senate. The Australian Greens have a word of warning for the Australian Labor Party in this debate.

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2003-10-09,"—I have an interest in this area. We talk about protecting children's rights and our obligations under the Convention on the Rights of the Child but is this government really doing anything worth while to protect children at risk within our community? The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, the Hon. Larry Anthony, has announced a range of initiatives specifically designed to assist children at risk. In fact on two occasions—in two different media releases—he announced the same initiative. He said:
The Prime Minister recently announced funding of $10 million for the first practical steps to be taken through the National Agenda for Early Childhood. Funding will go towards early childhood intervention and prevention programs focusing on early child and maternal health, early learning and care, and supporting child friendly communities.
I would like to know—perhaps Senator Abetz will be able to assist in this instance—whether this includes our Indigenous communities, or was the Prime Minister just generalising when he said `a national agenda'? 
What is the federal government doing in the area of Indigenous children's health? From figures released by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare it would seem, frankly, that it is not doing much. Recent figures show that Indigenous death rates greatly exceed the corresponding Australian death rates at all ages despite underidentification of Indigenous people in death registrations. This was a matter that I went to yesterday and dealt with under table 7 of this report which highlighted the differing treatments with respect to our Indigenous people and our children.
While figures show favourable trends for mainstream Australian children, those same figures are not quite so glowing in relation to Indigenous children's life expectancies. The life expectancy after birth is still much lower for Indigenous people. Indigenous people account for only 2.2 per cent of the Australian population. Less than one-third of the Indigenous population lives in capital cities with easy access to mainstream health services. The infant mortality rate of Indigenous children is more than three times higher than for the rest of the population. Some people might suggest that this is a crisis.
What is the government doing to address this rate? Let us have a look. The government has released reports showing child abuse and neglect are more likely to occur within the family and that mental illness, drug and alcohol problems and low income are the major risk factors, yet nothing is being done to address this in remote rural communities. The Commonwealth continually fobs program responsibilities onto the state governments. One should applaud the state governments for their initiatives to bring better services to communities. But what exactly is the Commonwealth doing for Indigenous communities on a national scale, with a national agenda and with a national focus? The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs has not announced a single positive initiative designed to protect and assist Indigenous children. In fact, I have looked closely at his ministerial web page over the past 18 months and the only reference to Indigenous children was in a report called Child Protection Australia 2001-2002 First National Results which shows an increase of substantiated cases of child abuse or neglect. It may not be his area but if the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs is going to put out national agendas for children then he should include Indigenous children as part of that and he should deal more substantively with it. In that report there was a reference to Indigenous children. It states:
The situation for indigenous children continues to be particularly bad. At 30 June 2002, the rate of indigenous children on care and protection orders was nearly six times the rate of other Australian children. The rate of substantiations for indigenous children in Victoria and Western Australia was nearly eight times that for other children.
This is atrocious. But it is not the figure that is atrocious; it is the lack of action by this government on a national scale which is atrocious. Yet instead of doing anything about it the government, in its second and third combined report under the Convention on the Rights of the Child, claimed:
The Australian Government is providing significant support and assistance to families. We are of the firm belief that the best way to tackle child abuse is through prevention and early intervention strategies. 
The report further claims that the Australian government continues to address the needs of Indigenous children. It is clearly not doing enough. The minister announced the National Agenda for Early Childhood to provide directions for a whole-of-government approach to investment in early childhood. As I said, the office needs to do more.",SENATE,<title>DOCUMENTS</title>,<title>Convention on the Rights of the Child: Reports</title>,Documents,38,1
"Ferris, Sen Jeannie",LP,2003-10-09,"—Tonight I want to reflect on the very successful Bennelong Society conference which was held at the end of August here in Canberra. I have had the privilege of serving as President of the Bennelong Society for the past 12 months, since the former Indigenous affairs minister Senator Dr John Herron took up his position as Australian Ambassador to Ireland. The Bennelong Society was formed in 2000 to promote debate and analysis of Aboriginal policy in Australia and to inquire into the causes of some of the problems facing Aboriginal people. Indigenous policy debate in Australia is currently going through a very important period, with renewed focus on both Aboriginal self-governance and the need to address both the poor conditions that exist in some Aboriginal communities and the likelihood of a successful outcome for any policy changes that could be made.
Most Australians are aware of the internal upheavals ATSIC has been through in the last 12 months. The federal government's important review of ATSIC will soon be released with proposals for reform of that body. Following a landmark meeting in July between the Prime Minister and Indigenous leaders to discuss the issue of violence and abuse in Indigenous communities—drug and alcohol abuse and, in particular, the tragic consequences of the abuse of women and children—the Prime Minister made a personal pledge to work with state governments to improve conditions for Indigenous people. This government is committed to addressing the problems of passive welfare, violence, and alcohol and sexual abuse that are challenges in remote communities where Indigenous people live.
This year's Bennelong Society conference, with the title An Indigenous future? Challenges and Opportunities, was a timely opportunity to debate and discuss various policy issues. Speakers at the conference came from across the country to present a range of papers on the future of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission, land rights, native title and the challenges faced in remote Indigenous communities. The Hon. Philip Ruddock, the former minister for indigenous affairs, opened the conference with his speech on the future of ATSIC as he saw it. The Hon. John Hannaford, one of the three-member ATSIC review panel, set out the perspective he brought to the review of ATSIC, having travelled around the country to numerous Indigenous communities.
The conditions in remote Indigenous communities have been seen by the Bennelong Society as the single most challenging issue facing Indigenous Australia for quite some time. Chris Marshall, who has 30 years of experience working in remote Aboriginal communities, and former minister for Aborigines in the McMahon Liberal government, the Hon. Peter Howson—a long-time contributor to the Indigenous policy debate—both addressed delegates on the problems that exist in remote Aboriginal communities and the possible solutions to these problems.
Chris Marshall argued that a middle ground must be sought between assimilation and separate development. Mr Marshall argued that there is no need to promote assimilation. Even in the most remote communities there is rapid cultural change, and therefore there is a need to support remote Indigenous townships so that the casualty rate of this rapid process of cultural change can be minimised. He argued that remote communities are not a lost cause—there are still a lot of positive things happening in these communities. However, he made the case that the key variable for improvement in remote communities is the ability of the generally non-Indigenous adviser or administrator to facilitate participatory management, community development and community cohesion. There is no doubt that skilled intervention is required. Communities can no longer continue as passive recipients of services. They must be active participants in the planning and implementation of development.
Peter Howson, Vice-President of the Bennelong Society, also outlined to the conference how policies of the last 30 years have failed Aboriginal Australians. Mr Howson argued that the very serious problems that now exist in remote communities had their origin in the policies of the separation of Aboriginal people and the withdrawal of Indigenous advisers from these communities since the early 1970s. Policies that provide and maintain infrastructure in remote communities, in combination with the extensive provision of welfare, have created and sustained what he called ghetto like communities based on welfare dependency. He argued that this must be addressed as a matter of urgency.
Former Labor government minister Dr Gary Johns reinforced this message. He called on Aboriginal people to become independent of government, a result that can be achieved only through education. Governments cannot preserve Aboriginal culture and difference. Indeed, he pointed to the polices of separation of land, separation of culture and separation of communities that were promoted by many academics. He argued that this policy had failed. It had failed many Aboriginal people. He said that Aboriginal people must look beyond remote communities to secure their future.
The conference began with a dinner on the evening of Friday, 29 August, at which we were able to honour two of the Ngarrindjeri, so-called dissident, women who exposed the fiction of secret women's business in the early 1990s that resulted in a ban on the construction of a bridge to Hindmarsh Island. Dulcie and Dorothy Wilson were presented with Bennelong medals by the Hon. Ian McLachlan AO, the former defence minister and former federal member for the seat of Barker, which included Hindmarsh Island at the time of the controversy. I take this opportunity to pay tribute once again to the courage these women showed in standing up to great cultural pressures and revealing the truth in relation to secret women's business.
Other issues discussed at the conference included native title and land rights. In the lunchtime address, Mr George Savell, former Chief Executive Officer of the Association of Mining and Exploration Companies, reflected on his 20 years of involvement in Australia's mining and agricultural industries and on the mining industry's experience of native title and land rights. While expressing a great deal of dissatisfaction with the past operation of the Native Title Act and with what he described as its unworkable processes, Mr Savell did articulate a much more optimistic view for the future operation of the act and its effect on the mining industry. The federal member for Solomon in the Northern Territory, David Tollner, spoke at the conference on the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act of 1976. South Australia's shadow Attorney-General, the Hon. Robert Lawson QC, spoke on the South Australian Pitjantjatjara Land Rights Act of 1981. Ray Evans discussed land rights, focussing on the post-Wik and post-Yorta Yorta landscape.
In conclusion, I would like to take this opportunity to thank all those contributors to the conference, especially those who travelled great distances to come to Canberra to make this year's conference the great success that it was. All papers given at the conference are available on the Bennelong Society's web site, which can be found at www.bennelong.com.au. I urge all Australians interested in Indigenous policy debate to visit the Bennelong Society web site.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Indigenous Affairs: Bennelong Society Conference</title>,Adjournment,40,1
