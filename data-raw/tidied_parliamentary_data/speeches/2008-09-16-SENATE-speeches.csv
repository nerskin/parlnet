"Xenophon, Sen Nick",IND,2008-09-16,"—The social and economic fabric of Australia is inexorably linked with the viability and the vibrancy of our small and medium business sectors, which are responsible for employing millions of Australians. These businesses, their employees and, above all, the consumers of their goods and services deserve a strong and effective Trade Practices Act, an act that is clear in achieving its objective of maximising benefits to consumers that flow from having a competitive environment within a framework that is fair to large and small businesses alike. I commend the government and the Minister for Competition Policy and Consumer Affairs, Chris Bowen, for introducing the Trade Practices Legislation Amendment Bill 2008 and for seeking to grapple with what are clearly deficiencies within the current act. I hope this bill is the first step in coming years to tackle what are clearly inadequacies with trade practices laws in this country.
One of the most glaring inadequacies—the effectiveness of the misuse of power provisions in section 46—was exposed in the High Court’s 2003 decision in what is known as the Boral case. It is worth reflecting for a moment on the shameful conduct of Boral and the absence of a remedy in the act for the aggrieved parties. Boral engaged in a price war from 1993 to 1996 with its concrete masonry products in the Melbourne market. It sold its goods lower than its variable costs—in other words, below cost. It could do so because of its deep pockets. There was a strong suggestion that consumers in the rest of the country were paying higher prices to, in effect, subsidise the artificially low prices in the Melbourne market.
Two smaller competitors, Rocla and Budget, closed down their Victorian masonry operations in May 1995 and June 1996 respectively. Another smaller operator, C&M, came dangerously close to being driven to the wall after this sustained low-cost pricing—many would say predatory pricing—by Boral. The ACCC took action, but its prosecution was ultimately unsuccessful when the High Court took such a narrow view of the ‘market power’ definition in section 46. The High Court’s interpretation also put so many unrealistic hurdles in the way of a successful section 46 prosecution that it rendered the section virtually useless. The hurdles included a requirement to show evidence that a big business could only be prosecuted if it had the ability to raise prices without losing business—in other words, it needed to be a monopoly. In addition, the High Court applied a secondary test that big businesses facing prosecution also needed to be able to recoup their losses as part of engaging in predatory prices. This is a test requiring, in effect, proof of something in the future, a near impossible evidentiary exercise. Unless you have a time machine, you will never be able to prove it. In that respect I welcome the government seeking to remove the requirement for recoupment in section 46. However, the government has not addressed the very narrow primary test for market power which still requires proof of a big business being able to raise prices without losing business. Until this very narrow primary test is overcome, section 46 will remain next to impossible to enforce.
The proposed amendment to section 46 also seeks, in effect, to codify the take advantage test in section 46. The setting out of the criteria on the surface appears to provide some clarity. But I have a concern that it may have the effect of merely codifying—in effect entrenching—the existing very narrow interpretation by the High Court of the take advantage test. In the High Court decisions in the Melway and Rural Press cases, the court held that a big business was only taking advantage of its market power if it was doing something unique with that market power. According to the High Court, if a big business had engaged in the same conduct with or without market power, it was not taking advantage of its market power and therefore it would not be in breach of section 46. What that in effect means is that the take advantage threshold would only be breached if a big business was engaging in conduct that could be attributed only to the fact that it had market power.
An analogy that has been put to me is that it is a bit like saying that if you rob a bank because you think you will get away with it you will not be charged if there was a chance you might also rob a bank believing you could not get away with it. It is confusing and there is certainly a lack of fairness, a lack of realism in the take advantage test. It really is Alice in Wonderland stuff. This is an artificial test, one where it is difficult to imagine a big business would ever be found to be taking advantage of its market power. Whilst I do not oppose the amendment, I ask the government to indicate how it believes this amendment would make it easier to cross the take advantage threshold. The ineffectiveness of section 46, as outlined in the Boral and other cases, led to the so-called Birdsville amendment passed just 12 months ago by this parliament. I commend Senator Barnaby Joyce for his relentless advocacy for small businesses and for this amendment in particular and for the former government for enacting it and for the former opposition for voting for it.
To say, as the now government says, that the Birdsville amendment should now be scrapped because the test of market share, rather than market power, is too uncertain is something that I cannot countenance. I see no reason why the Birdsville amendment cannot coexist with the proposed amendments to section 46 the government is seeking. What is wrong with letting the small businesses of Australia have an alternative—and some would say clearer—remedy for predatory pricing? These two subsections can and should coexist.
The concept of market share is not unknown in competition law. Canadian competition regulators look to market share as part of a benchmark to determine whether anticompetitive conduct has occurred. Those commentators who say the Birdsville amendment is unworkable or uncertain have failed to provide any real evidence in support of their claims. They fail to recognise the safeguards and inherent thresholds in the Birdsville amendment—namely that, firstly, substantial market share must be established; secondly, goods have to be sold below their cost; thirdly, they must be sold for a substantial period of time below their cost; and, fourthly, that it must be for an anticompetitive purpose. Senator Joyce is nodding, so I think I am on the right track there.
This amendment has only been law for less than a year. It is simply premature for the government to seek to ditch a provision that on the face of it has great potential to enhance competition. Research from the United States, including the work of Professor Skidmore and his colleagues, indicates that laws against below-cost pricing in the petrol industry have led to lower prices for consumers using similar concepts that I see in the Birdsville amendment.
I now refer to the other amendments in this bill. Firstly, I refer to the amendment that seeks to mandate the requirement that one of the ACCC’s deputy chairs has knowledge of and experience in small business matters. It seems, on the face of it, reasonable. However, it should be noted that the ACCC has had a small business commissioner since 1998. The key to assisting small businesses is, I believe, to ensure that the laws are effective, enforceable and accessible. Having a small business deputy commissioner is, of itself, no substitute for laws that are weak and ineffective and in practical terms unenforceable either because of narrow judicial interpretation or because it is just too costly for a small business to run the case.
Secondly, I support and commend the government for repealing the thresholds for unconscionable conduct. But I note and endorse the comments of Associate Professor Frank Zumbo from the Australian School of Business at the University of New South Wales who, in his evidence to the Senate Standing Committee on Economics, saw its use as being part of a broader reform process. He said:
... unless you change the substantive meaning or the substantive flaws in 51AC as they currently exist—that is, a lack of definition of unconscionable conduct in the section itself—removing the cap will not be of any practical assistance.
That is why I will move a second reading amendment that this issue be referred to the economics committee for an inquiry on the need to develop a clear statutory definition of unconscionable conduct and the scope and content of such a definition. I move:
At the end of the motion, add “and that the following matter be referred to the Economics Committee for inquiry and report by 3 December 2008:
The need to develop a clear statutory definition of unconscionable conduct for the purposes of Part IVA of the Trade Practices Act 1974 and the scope and content of such a definition”.
In relation to the jurisdiction of the Federal Magistrates Court I note the opposition does not support this amendment. I remain to be convinced that this will assist small businesses in a practical sense given that it is very expensive for a small business to bring action in any court let alone in the Federal Magistrates Court, let alone in an area of law as complex as trade practices law, particularly given the circumstances where the High Court has narrowly interpreted key provisions of the act.
My question to the government is: why has the ACCC been excluded from bringing an action in the Federal Magistrates Court? They can do so in the Federal Court but the government seeks to preclude the ACCC from bringing such an action in the Magistrates Court. Surely, if the government wants to assist small businesses, it should allow the ACCC to bring an action in the Federal Magistrates Court on behalf of small businesses, just as it can in the Federal Court.
I foreshadow an amendment for the committee stage to allow the ACCC to bring such actions in the Federal Magistrates Court. I also ask of the government: what funds or resources will the government make available to assist small businesses to bring cases before the Federal Magistrates Court? What is the point of having the right to a day in court if you cannot afford to get there in the first place?
Finally, in relation to the ACCC’s information gathering powers I broadly support the amendment under section 155. But it is reasonable for the government to disclose how these new powers for the ACCC will interact with the court’s power to order discovery or other interlocutory orders, and I look forward to an explanation from the government in this regard. If the Australian economy is going to serve the people of Australia, we do not just need free markets; we need fair markets. I look forward to the committee stage of this bill.",SENATE,<title>TRADE PRACTICES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,3,1,speech
"Fielding, Sen Steve",FFP,2008-09-16,"—Fifteen months ago Family First introduced legislation to stop predatory pricing. Why? Because our competition laws were too weak and did not adequately deal with anticompetitive conduct like predatory pricing. Predatory pricing is a real problem because it can drive small businesses out of the market, and when you knock small businesses out of the market you get less competition, which results in driving up prices for consumers.
Last year, when Family First introduced its plan to stop predatory pricing, small business had already been waiting for government action for more than three years. That is how long it took to action recommendations from the Senate Standing Committee on Economics. Predatory pricing is where large and powerful businesses use their substantial market power or substantial financial power to drop their prices in one area to drive out competitors. Not only are small businesses affected, with some forced to shut up shop because they can no longer compete, but Australian families are also affected, suffering from higher prices in the long term. The Trade Practices Act states:
The object of this Act is to enhance the welfare of Australians through the promotion of competition and fair trading and provision for consumer protection.
The welfare of Australians is central, but to achieve that we need a mechanism to protect consumer welfare, which is fair trading and competition. There is a danger that, without the appropriate regulation, unfair trading and distorted competition can lead to higher prices and less choice for consumers as well as the loss of the benefit of small businesses to local communities. Family First acted on predatory pricing because Australia had some of the most concentrated markets in the world. Our grocery market is one of the most concentrated in the world, being dominated by just two players, and now our petrol market has gone the same way with Coles and Woolworths.
In September last year, with the support of both major parties, predatory pricing amendments were passed by this parliament. Family First’s plan to address predatory pricing was similar to what was eventually passed last September with the support of both Labor and the coalition. In fact, Family First’s plan went further by also adding substantial financial power to capture those big businesses that may not have substantial market share but have very deep pockets to price in such a way as to drive out competitors. Family First’s plan also introduced an effects test. The effects test would mean that those corporations that do have financial or market power would need to be careful in how they use that power so it does not have the effect of substantially lessening competition or eliminating competitors. Up until now it has proven nearly impossible to prove predatory pricing by intent only.
It was interesting that the ACCC supported an effects test in evidence to the 2004 Senate committee inquiry but did not take it any further. Last year, when the Senate looked at Family First’s predatory pricing plan, the Fair Trading Coalition pointed to problems in the operation of the Trade Practices Act to stop anticompetitive practising, arguing:
… as markets become more concentrated (as is the case in many sectors of the Australian economy) Australia needs to have strong and properly administered laws which guard against the misuse of market power and in particular, predatory behaviour by large businesses. Without significant laws against such behaviour, the FTC believes that large businesses will continue to take advantage of their market power, resulting in further concentration of markets. That concentration will eventually lead to a loss of competitors and thus competition in markets, a loss of choice for consumers and ultimately less price competition, which further disadvantages consumers.
At the same inquiry, there was widespread concern that, as Professor Frank Zumbo said:
… s 46—
of the Trade Practices Act—
is not operating effectively to prevent large and powerful corporations from engaging in predatory conduct or other abuses of market power.
So that was the background to some of the changes. Even though Family First still believes the predatory pricing laws that were passed last year by the Senate did not go far enough, it seems odd that the Rudd government now wants to undo some of those gains. Family First is not convinced that the changes made last year cannot be used by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to improve competition in the Australian marketplace.",SENATE,<title>TRADE PRACTICES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,3,1,speech
"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,2008-09-16,"—I would like to thank senators who have taken part in the debate on the government’s Trade Practices Legislation Amendment Bill 2008. This bill delivers on the government’s promise to reform important areas of the Trade Practices Act, including strengthening section 46. The bill directly addresses predatory pricing. It aligns the predatory pricing prohibition in section 46 with the general prohibition against the misuse of market power, ensuring that it does not discourage legitimate discounting. It also ensures that it is not necessary to prove recoupment to establish predatory pricing.
The bill also strengthens section 46 more generally, by clarifying the meaning of ‘take advantage’ for the purposes of section 46. In particular, it addresses the 2003 Senate inquiry’s finding that the present test focuses on a corporation’s physical capacity to engage in conduct rather than its rationale for doing so. The bill also enhances the prohibitions against unconscionable conduct in business transactions. In particular, it repeals the monetary thresholds which currently limit the operation of 51AC of the Trade Practices Act and section 12CC of the ASIC Act. It enhances the protection afforded by both sections by focusing the prohibitions on the wrongdoing involved rather than the arbitrary monetary thresholds. In addition, the bill includes three amendments that improve the ability of the act to be effectively enforced. Firstly, it provides the Federal Magistrates Court with the jurisdiction to hear section 46 matters in appropriate cases. Secondly, it clarifies the ACCC’s section 155 powers, ensuring that it can fully investigate suspected contraventions of the law and act to protect consumers from harm. Thirdly, it requires that a deputy chairperson of the ACCC has experience in or knowledge of small business matters.
The amendments contained in the bill were announced by the government on 28 April this year and an exposure draft was released publicly on 1 May. They were also largely foreshadowed as opposition amendments to the Trade Practices Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2007. Those amendments, however, were not adopted in the final version of that bill, despite many of them being recommended by the 2004 Senate inquiry into the effectiveness of the Trade Practices Act in protecting small business. At the time, the government, then in opposition, noted that the amendments would be pursued following a change of government.
I would like to thank the Senate Standing Committee on Economics for its timely consideration of, and report on, the bill. The committee’s inquiry attracted a large number of submissions from groups interested in trade practices reform.
The government’s bill is supported by leading business groups, including the Council of Small Business Organisations of Australia and the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, as striking the right balance. The bill also has the support of leading academics and legal practitioners.
I now turn to issues raised by senators during the course of the second reading debate on the bill. In relation to the treatment of predatory pricing under the act, the 2004 Senate inquiry considered that the act would be strengthened by making predatory pricing a clearer target of section 46. The government’s amendments achieve this objective. They do it in a way that is consistent with the longstanding prohibition in section 46(1) against the misuse of market power rather than through the uncertain and imprecise wording of the Birdsville amendment.
Considerable amendments have been made to clarify the meaning of ‘market power’ since the Boral decision. In 2007, amendments were made to section 46 which addressed the leveraging and coordination of market power. Those amendments also ensured that more than one corporation may have substantial market power and that a corporation may have such power even though it does not substantially control the market or have absolute freedom from competitive constraint. Those amendments were supported by the government when we were in opposition.
However, the government does not support the present operation of the Birdsville amendment. Its present reference to market share has given rise to confusion and may chill beneficial price competition. Both the method for calculating market share and what amounts to a substantial market share are unknown. The ACCC has publicly stated that section 46(1AA) as currently drafted adds considerable uncertainty to the law and that it should be amended to clarify the protection that it provides.
The argument has been made that the Birdsville amendment simply requires time to be tried and tested in the court. However, it may take many years for the uncertainty it has created to be resolved, increasing enforcement costs for the victims of predatory pricing and stifling procompetitive conduct. It is the role of the legislature to make good laws, not to leave the law-making to the courts.
The Birdsville amendment’s reliance on market share has also put Australia out of step with international best practice in regulating predatory pricing. As noted by the OECD, competition regimes are converging towards the notion that unilateral conduct provisions should be applied only to firms that have substantial market power. In addition, by operating in relation to market share, the Birdsville amendment may not capture the conduct of many powerful firms. For example, it may not capture powerful firms who are entering new markets, are operating in markets where products or services are purchased infrequently on the basis of long-term contracts, typically through bidding processes, or derive their power by controlling upstream markets.
In contrast, market power is a well-established concept in competition law which allows the court to consider all the relevant characteristics of a market in determining whether a firm has acted anticompetitively. Such factors include the size of a firm, including its market share; the size and number of its competitors; the barriers to entry or expansion; profit margins; degree of vertical integration; and a variety of other factors. As noted by the International Competition Network, a key advantage of market power is that it involves a multifaceted analysis that reaches well beyond market share.
I note the opposition’s amendments will remove a key benefit of the government’s bill in relation to the treatment of recoupment by the courts. The bill clarifies the role of recoupment in predatory pricing cases under section 46(1AA). At present section 46 does not expressly provide whether it is necessary to prove recoupment in order to establish a case of predatory pricing. Submissions to the 2004 Senate inquiry raised concerns about this lack of clarity and its impact on the effectiveness of section 46. In particular, concerns were expressed that it may be necessary to prove recoupment in order to establish a predatory pricing case following the High Court’s decision in the Boral case. The Senate inquiry recommended that section 46 be amended to clarify that it is not necessary to prove recoupment when establishing a breach of section 46 for predatory pricing. The government’s bill gives effect to this recommendation. Section 46 should clearly provide that recoupment is not legally necessary in order to establish a breach for predatory pricing. Recoupment may be an indicator of such behaviour, but it should not be an essential precondition. By opposing the government’s amendment the opposition would return section 46 to the uncertain and undesirable position resulting from the High Court’s Boral decision.
The opposition opposes the extension of the Federal Magistrates Court jurisdiction to cover section 46 matters. I note that the Senate inquiry in 2004 concluded that the Federal Magistrates Court could resolve a number of section 46 cases with a cost saving for all sides. The Federal Magistrates Act 1999 permits the Federal Magistrates Court to transfer proceedings to the Federal Court when appropriate. Such a transfer may occur in complex and resource-intensive cases or where the amount being claimed is beyond the $750,000 jurisdictional limit of the Federal Magistrates Court. The Federal Magistrates Court could clearly be utilised in relation to cases where section 83 of the act applies. Section 83 allows parties to rely on factual findings from previous court proceedings. By expanding the jurisdiction of the Federal Magistrates Court to include section 46 claims, the court would be empowered to hear such matters. At the same time, the government’s bill does not limit that jurisdiction solely to matters arising by way of section 83, in recognition of the fact that litigants should have direct recourse to the Federal Magistrates Court in appropriate cases.
The views of the Law Council have been raised in relation to the Federal Magistrates Court amendment. I note that in its submission to the economics committee on this bill the Law Council recognised that a case brought with the assistance of section 83 in the Federal Magistrates Court ‘might well be justified’. The council submitted that the case for such claims to be brought in the Federal Magistrates Court is much more compelling up to the limit of the Federal Magistrates Court’s existing $750,000 jurisdictional limit. The opposition’s refusal to accept the government’s amendments to the ASIC Act in schedule 3 of the bill fails to recognise the existing jurisdiction of the Federal Magistrates Court. The FMC already has jurisdiction in relation to claims of unconscionable conduct in financial service. That jurisdiction was bestowed on the Federal Magistrates Court by the opposition when they were in government. The government’s amendments simply recognise this existing jurisdiction in clarifying the law. The same applies to the amendments to the unconscionable conduct provisions of the Trade Practices Act, which have been opposed by the opposition.
This bill delivers on the government’s commitment to strengthening laws promoting fair competition. It delivers for small business and consumers. It builds on the agenda implemented by this government to reform the Trade Practices Act. Working families will benefit from the government’s reforms because they will facilitate effective competition, which should result in lower prices, greater choice and better quality products and services.

"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2008-09-16,"—It is very appropriate that Senator Fifield ask a question today, as his former employer was at the Press Club today, where we saw yet another attempt by those opposite to rewrite history.
Opposition senators interjecting—
—Order! Resume you seat, Senator Conroy. When the chamber is ready, we will proceed with question time.
—When it comes to the economic legacy of the former Treasurer, I would rather take the advice of the IMF and Treasury. What they say is that his reckless spending left Australia with a legacy of high inflation and high interest rates. In June 2007, the IMF revealed that the former Treasurer’s last two budgets—
—Mr President, on a point of order: this actually was a serious question. The world is facing very serious financial strife. Lehman Brothers has collapsed, and the other banks have been sold out. This is a serious question. Can the minister answer a serious question rather than immediately indulging in party-political propaganda? The people of Australia want to hear the answer to the question about what is going on in global financial markets and the impact on Australia. Mr President, I would ask you to ask the minister to answer the question.
—Mr President, on the point of order—although I do acknowledge that Senator Minchin indicated this is the first serious question they have asked for a fair while—I make the point that Senator Minchin wants to debate the issues. Senator Conroy is attempting to deal with a question about the Australian economy. He is putting that in context, and it is a perfectly appropriate response. While the opposition may not like it, the reality is that it is in order for Senator Conroy to answer the question this way.
—There is no point of order, as I cannot instruct or tell a minister how to answer a question. But I draw the minister’s attention to the question and the issue of relevance.
—We are facing one of the most difficult times in global financial markets in more than 20 years.
—We know that.
—Yesterday you were laughing at it. Yesterday every time those on this side of the chamber—
—Order! Senator Conroy, resume your seat. Your comments should be directed to the chair and not across the chamber.
—I accept your admonishment; I should not react to the interjections. But those opposite continued even as late as yesterday, at the mention of the global financial situation, to break into peals of laughter. How embarrassed they look today when their new Leader of the Opposition, Mr Turnbull, described it:
We are presently facing, probably, the gravest economic crisis globally in any of our lifetimes.
That demonstrates how out of touch those in this chamber on the opposite side have been. The global financial crisis is buffeting confidence and share markets around the world and slowing the economy. Five of the world’s seven largest developed economies recorded zero or negative growth in the three months to June this year. Global stock markets have fallen by around 20 per cent since the turmoil began and consumer confidence in economies across the whole OECD has fallen to its lowest point in almost 30 years.
Recently the IMF First Deputy Managing Director, John Lipsky, had this to say:
The global economy is facing its most difficult situation in many years as we grapple with the financial crisis that erupted last August—
that is, August 2007. We continue to see the consequences of these developments which have their origin in the US subprime market. As has already been mentioned, overnight Lehman Brothers, formerly the fourth largest US investment bank, filed for bankruptcy in the US. It has also been announced that the Bank of America has agreed to buy Merrill Lynch, the world’s largest brokerage firm, and concerns have also been expressed for the financial health of AIG, the world’s largest insurer. The government has been briefed on developments by Treasury and the relevant regulators following yesterday’s quarterly meeting of the Council of Financial Regulators. The regulators are continuing to closely monitor events in the US and remain in close contact with their international counterparts. It is clear that we are not immune to these global difficulties. We are, however, better placed than most countries to weather the storm. The fundamentals of our economy remain strong. (Time expired)

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2008-09-16,"—I will provide what information I can to Senator Fisher in response to her question. I can inform the Senate that on 10 September the New South Wales government reached agreement with Clyde Agriculture to purchase the land and associated water rights of Toorale Station for some $23.75 million. The purchase of Toorale Station in New South Wales is in accordance with the principles of buying from willing sellers at market prices and will be assisted through a substantial grant from the Commonwealth to New South Wales for this purpose.
The purchase of Toorale Station will return an average of 20 billion litres of water to the Darling River each year, peaking at up to 80 billion litres in flood years. I can say that significant environmental assets that will benefit from this purchase include some wetlands of national importance at Menindee Lakes as well as the Darling River itself. Of course the recent CSIRO sustainable yields audit for the Barwon-Darling system also found that the middle zone of the Darling River, between Bourke and Menindee Lakes, is in poor condition. When the water-sharing plans for the Warrego and Darling rivers are finalised, Toorale Station’s 14 billion litre per year water entitlement and flood plain harvesting rights will be transferred to the Commonwealth Environmental Water Holder to boost environmental flows in the northern Murray-Darling Basin.
In relation to the second part of Senator Fisher’s question, which goes to the Sugarloaf pipeline, I can inform the Senate that the Victorian government has provided assurances that there will be no reduction in flows to the environment, and particularly to the Murray, as a consequence of this particular project. I can also say to the Senate that the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts, Mr Garrett, has imposed conditions to ensure that those assurances from the Victorian state government are met. Specifically, it is a condition of Mr Garrett’s approval that no water can be taken from savings allocated to the Living Murray Initiative, from the Water for Rivers entitlements or from environmental reserves and that all water-savings projects supplying the pipeline are compliant with the EPBC Act.

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2008-09-16,"—The information I have and I can assist Senator Fisher with is this. The project was assessed at the state level by an independent advisory committee, which has reviewed the project impact assessment report and the public submissions received in relation to it and has also held public hearings. I can also indicate to the senator that this assessment process was accredited under the EPBC Act to address matters of national environmental significance, which of course are matters for which Mr Garrett is responsible, as you would appreciate. If there is any other information I can provide to the senator I am happy to do so, but I will ask Mr Garrett, as minister for the environment, as well as my colleague Senator Wong. (Time expired)

Leave granted.

The answer read as follows—

Further Information For Senator Boswell Question Asked Thursday 4 September
[Senator BOSWELL—Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. When will the government advise the 74,400 families receiving family tax benefit and the 18,800 families receiving childcare benefit that they will receive reduced benefits from July 2009?]
In April each year, FTB instalment customers receive a New Financial Year Assessment (NFYA) letter advising them of the need to update their Income estimate for family assistance purposes for the coming financial year. At this time, customers will be advised to include in their income estimates from the 2009-10 financial year onwards, any amounts to be salary sacrificed to superannuation and net financial investment losses that will need to be taken into account in determining their new income estimate.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: ADDITIONAL ANSWERS</title>,<title>Pensions and Allowances</title>,Questions Without Notice: Additional Answers,7,1,speech
"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2008-09-16,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Special Minister of State (Senator Faulkner) to a question without notice asked by Senator Fisher today relating to the Murray-Darling Basin system.
I just want to repeat it, because I cannot believe that Senator Faulkner did not understand the impact of the question. The question related to the Labor government paying an amount of $24 million to buy a water entitlement of some 14 billion litres to feed into the Murray-Darling system. If you did not know too much about that proposal, one might say that it is a good initiative. But there are some concerns about that purchase, which my colleague Senator Heffernan raised in the Senate a couple of days ago, which really do demand some serious investigation by the relevant authorities. I note that Sir Rod Eddington, who is the Labor government’s trusted adviser in several areas, is a member of the board of the vendor company which is receiving the $24 million.
The purchase was to put 14 billion litres into the Murray-Darling system. But, at the same time, this Labor government is facilitating the Victorian Labor government taking out of the Murray-Darling system some 74 to 110 billion litres of water for the north-south pipeline in Victoria. I emphasis that they are paying $24 million to get 14 billion litres into the system and giving away for free something like 80 billion litres. Something like five or six times the amount of water that is being put into the river, they are allowing out. What hypocrisy, what absolute stupidity of this government and a minister, Senator Wong, who is quite clearly incapable of dealing with the very difficult issues of water in Australia. The senator is an abject and complete failure in her task as Australia’s water minister.

Senator Sterle interjecting—

—Order! Senator Sterle!
—Thank you for your protection, Mr Deputy President, but I do not need it from someone like Senator Sterle. Nobody takes too much notice of what he might say. Senator Wong, the minister, has been an abject failure in relation to water and certainly in relation to the Murray-Darling system. Mr Garrett gave EPBC Act approval for this pipeline, which will suck some 80 billion litres out of the Murray-Darling system to go down to Melbourne to flush toilets. It did not take him all that long to make that decision.
It seems funny the way that the Labor government and Mr Garrett deal with applications under the EPBC Act. You see, up in my state of Queensland Mr Garrett has just made a number of decisions under the EPBC Act—quite quickly—to stop developments in Cairns and Townsville and much needed coal port developments in the Rockhampton area. It did not take him long to determine those. But it has taken him at least nine months—because that is as long as he has been there—to not make a decision on the application under the EPBC Act in relation to the Traveston Crossing dam in Queensland, an environmentally disastrous proposal by the Queensland government.
I am just making this point: what is the difference between the decisions that Mr Garrett makes elsewhere and the decision that he has made in relation to the north-south pipeline and the decision he has not made in relation to the Traveston Crossing dam. The answer is this: the decisions that he has made in Queensland have been against developers, who would have helped with some of the infrastructure that we need. In relation to the Victorian decision, it was an application by his mates in the Victorian government. In the Queensland decision, he clearly should rule against it, but it is an application by his mates in the Queensland Labor government to allow approval for that particular dam. This whole incident and the impact of Senator Fisher’s question clearly show that the Labor Party is in disarray when it comes to water policy. This needs to be emphasised.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Murray-Darling Basin</title>,Questions Without Notice: Take Note of Answers,8,1,speech
"Hutchins, Sen Steve",ALP,2008-09-16,"—The issue that has been raised today is one of great importance, as we are all aware. Indeed, last week Senator Fisher and I, along with others, were involved in an inquiry over two days—here in Canberra and then in Adelaide—into the Lower Lakes and the Coorong. We received a number of submissions from government bodies and individuals about what should happen to that part of South Australia, where that water should come from and whether or not seawater should be put into these areas where there has not been any water for some time.
One of the things that struck me about our inquiry—I understand that Senator Fisher will be speaking shortly, and she may well agree with me, as I am sure Senator Heffernan will, too—is that we need to try to depoliticise this issue and make sure that we have a solid policy base from which to proceed. Senator Fisher would agree with me that that is not necessarily occurring with the opposition at the moment.
—You’re the government. You do something
—There are people in the opposition who clearly know what needs to occur. If you listen to some of the things that that maverick senator, Senator Heffernan, says—despite some of the other things that he says—he makes a lot of sense in a number of these areas.
The one thing that clearly comes out in all this is that if there were more water in this Murray-Darling system it would be used. But the fact is that we have not had sustained rainfall for some time. There are many communities in these areas that are very frightened about their future. That is why I say that this should be depoliticised. As we saw only last week—and Senator Fisher would agree with me—one of the minor parties, and I am talking about the National Party, took opportunistic shots during the inquiry. They took any opportunity to try and scare people and came up with bandaid solutions, or tried to pull magic out of the sky to make available water that is not there.
I say to the opposition: the water is not there. We are being confronted with issues that I am sure none of us would have wanted to have to deal with. But the fact is that there is no water. If you listen to some of your senior colleagues—
—There is no water, but you are taking water out and sending it to Melbourne.
—I will sit down and listen to you in silence.
—Do not acknowledge me, then.
—We have some very difficult demographic decisions that are going to be forced upon us in the next few years. I do not think that any of us like it. You cannot come in here with a South Australian badge on or a Queensland badge—

Senator Fisher interjecting—

—Order! Senator Fisher, I note that you are down next to speak in this debate, so I suggest that we listen to Senator Hutchins in silence.
—We have to come in here representing the Commonwealth of Australia. This is an Australian difficulty—an Australian problem. It is no good saying, ‘They are taking water from us up here and they are transferring it here.’ It is no good saying, ‘They are stealing it from New South Wales and they are not giving it to the Queenslanders.’ I am sure that even Tasmanians would like to get into the act just so they are not ignored.
This is a very serious issue. People are very frightened. Their futures are at stake. They are demanding of the Commonwealth government and of the Commonwealth parliament some serious leadership in this. People should not come in here and say, ‘They are stealing water from the Murray and giving it to Melbourne,’ and ‘They are stealing water from the Murrumbidgee and giving it to South Australia.’ We have to come in here and act responsibly, particularly—and I say this to Senator Fisher—the major parties. You would recall, as I do, the opportunistic actions of the Greens last week. They had to be checked by the CSIRO the next day. There are plenty of people out there who are going to exploit this for political reasons. It is up to us in the major parties to make sure that that does not occur.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Murray-Darling Basin</title>,Questions Without Notice: Take Note of Answers,8,1,speech
"Fisher, Sen Mary Jo",LP,2008-09-16,"—I rise to take note of the answer given by Senator Faulkner to my question about the empirical undertakings for the government’s decision on the one hand to put water in and on the other hand to take water out, which applies equally to government decisions to take water out on the one hand and put it back in on the other. The Prime Minister promised Australians evidence based policy. Tragically, in respect of water it is becoming clear that there is no method to Labor’s water madness. There is no evidence based policy formulation and, as a consequence, there is no accountable action being taken. This means both a failure to act strategically and a failure to act transparently in respect of the Murray-Darling Basin.
Senator Faulkner’s answer exhibited this failing essentially in three ways. The first way in which this failure to deliver strategically and transparently is illustrated by the government is in respect of bringing water back into the system. The second way that this failure is demonstrated is in respect of having a plan to bring water back into the system. What is the evidence based plan to redistribute it on a fair and equitable basis? The third way in which this failure is demonstrated by the Rudd government is in respect of the lack of a strategic plan and the lack of transparent actions to better collect, store, use and reuse water.
Senator Hutchins is right to the extent that he says that this is a national problem that demands national solutions. It is not about state versus state or, should I say, it should not be about state versus state, nor should it be about city versus country and nor should it be about user versus user. But Senator Wong is also right when she at another time said, ‘We are faced with some very hard choices.’ Well, Prime Minister Rudd and team, take the hard decisions, do the hard actions, because hardness of necessity in this context means some will have to bear pain. Where is the Rudd government’s evidence based policy to underpin what the government must do and must have the courage to do in inflicting some of that pain to bring the Murray-Darling Basin back in terms of its ability to water Australia—and water Australia it can. So, in respect of the government’s failure to act strategically and transparently in bringing water back into the system: that means its failure to address the overallocations and that means its failure to bring back into the system water which is already available.
The Rudd Labor government proposes instead to buy Toorale Station, to purchase a food and fibre production unit. Where is the government’s empirical analysis that shows that Toorale Station is the right place in Australia—one of the best places, presumably, in Australia—to take out food and fibre production at a time when we are facing food issues globally? Where is the government’s empirical analysis to show that Toorale Station is one of the best places to take out of food and fibre production and give to the environment? Let us hope that the government actually visited Toorale Station and did a bit of an inspection tour and ensured that Toorale Station is a place of national interest that justifies returning it to the environment as a national park.
On what basis does the government justify its buyback plan for irrigators? Where is the evidence based policy in terms of giving irrigators the incentive to put water back into the system—to give back, essentially, the overallocations? All the government has demonstrated thus far is a failure to understand water use and a failure to understand farmers. Sorry, that is not all they have demonstrated, but it is a significant part of the failure that they have demonstrated. (Time expired)

"Farrell, Sen Don",ALP,2008-09-16,"—I rise to take note of comments by Senator Faulkner. This of course is my first opportunity to congratulate you formally, Mr Deputy President, on your accession to your position. I am very pleased to see a fellow South Australian in a senior position in this chamber. Of course we do have another fellow South Australian who is doing an absolutely fantastic job at the moment on this issue of water, and that of course is Senator Wong. I would just like to put on record my congratulations for the steps that she has taken to deal in a serious way with the issues of water, particularly for my own state. I think it contrasts very dramatically with what we saw under the previous Howard government. It was full of South Australians—
—Hear, Hear!
—Yes, Senator Minchin was one of them. It was full of South Australians. There was Senator Hill, Senator Vanstone and Mr Downer, and even Mr Pyne got there in the end. It was full of South Australians, but not one drop of water was purchased for South Australia despite all of those South Australians being in that cabinet. This previous government never lost an opportunity to lose an opportunity when it came to the Murray River.
—It is losing water very quickly—
—This government has taken the issue of water security—

Senator Fisher interjecting—

—You had your go. Let me have a go now. You never lost an opportunity to lose an opportunity when it came to the Murray River. Now when we finally get a South Australian minister who is prepared to do something serious about the water issue—for drinking water in South Australia, for water for irrigators but, most importantly, to bring the Murray back to life—

Senator Fisher interjecting—

—We have got a minister who is prepared to do that and what do we find?
—With what? How?
—We have a minister who is prepared to do that and what do we find? We find the opposition criticising the decision to buy this station. At last somebody is starting to do something about the water issue in South Australia, and it is the Labor government.

Senator Fisher interjecting—

—Order! Senator Fisher, you have had your turn. I suggest you listen to Senator Farrell in silence.
—We have a government now that is prepared to do something about saving water in South Australia. This is the down payment; this is the first instalment of a Labor government that is prepared to bring the Murray River back to life. I made the comment in my maiden speech that I am the only South Australian senator actually born on the Murray. I was born in Murray Bridge in 1954. I remember what it was like back then when we had free-flowing water. We have not got that any more because for 12 years the opposition simply ignored the issue of water. Labor is now starting to do something about it.
What are we going to do? The first thing we want to do is secure drinking water for South Australia. The best way of doing that in the longer term is through a desalination plant. The South Australian state Labor government was prepared to do something about that and, in order to support them, the Federal government came to their assistance and what might have been a 50 gigalitre desalination plant will now be either an 80 gigalitre or, with any luck, a 100 gigalitre desalination plant. That is going to start the process of getting us water security in South Australia for drinking water.
What else are we doing? We are starting to buy stations like Toorale Station as a part of a long-term process to increase the amount of water that flows into South Australia. Adelaide needs about 230 gigalitres of water a year. The Murray, as far as it relates to South Australia, needs about 900 gigalitres of water. We are starting this process of buying it back. The previous government did nothing to do that. We have started this process and we will continue to do that. We will continue to buy water. We are not going to force people who currently have water rights to sell those water rights, but we are going out there into the market to purchase this water to get it to where we need it, which is South Australia. We are not prepared to risk Adelaide’s long-term water supply so we are leaving some of that water—(Time expired)

"Nash, Sen Fiona",NATS,2008-09-16,"—I rise to take note of the answer given by Senator Faulkner to a question from my colleague—

Senator Marshall interjecting—

—No, I know she knows I know her name: Senator Fisher. I have some very serious concerns about this whole debate. The answer given by Senator Faulkner really leads us to the crux of this problem around Toorale Station. The purchase of Toorale Station shows such a lack of strategy and such an ad hoc approach that it is representative of the entire approach that the government is taking towards the situation with water around this country. I agree with my colleague Senator Hutchins when he referred earlier to ‘taking the politics out of this’. To my mind, there is no bigger issue at the moment for this country than water and how it is managed. Taking the politics out of it is very difficult because, as colleagues in this place know, we sit on either side of this chamber, as in the other place, and there are varying views.
Today I would like to talk about the impact that decisions like buying Toorale Station have on regional communities. We talk a lot about the situation with water around this country. We argue backwards and forwards across the chamber and through the media, but we have to remember that this is about people. This is about people who live in communities. It does not matter whether they live in Adelaide, Melbourne, along the Murray or anywhere else in this country that is dependent on water because it is those people that are being affected by our decisions—the decisions the government makes and the decisions that we try to get them to make or to change as the opposition. It is an absolute responsibility that we get that right because those people out in those communities need us to make the right decisions.
Where this gets incredibly difficult is that it has not rained. It does not matter how much policy we put in place, how many determinations we make to change policy or to do things differently—it has not rained. And around the country we collectively have to understand how important that very simple statement is. Mark Twain once said, ‘Whisky is for drinking and water is for fighting over.’ We have to stop fighting over this and put some practical, sensible policy measures in place. We have got to stop arguing about whether or not CO2 is causing climate change. We have to accept that the climate is changing, regardless of the reason for that climate change.
I am very concerned about the lack of planning and strategy that we are seeing from the government in terms of how their policy decisions are going to affect communities—not only rural and regional communities but also those metropolitan communities at the end of the line, if you like. There were references before to a committee, which is running an inquiry at the moment, commenting on the fact that there is a lack of information about the social and economic impact that is going to be brought on rural and regional communities as a result of the decisions on policy being made around water. And Toorale is a classic example. Around 100 jobs are directly being lost. The local community up there is going to be significantly changed in how it operates and, indeed, whether it is sustainable. And yet we have seen no investigation from the government of any kind on the social or economic impact on the community. And yet they have made an ad hoc decision to buy Toorale Station. There can only be some major implications. As I understand it, the government did not even go there to have a look, to actually see. They are working from some kind of evidence or advice provided. They have not even been to have a look.
So my absolute concern is that this strategy is ad hoc. We have seen recently a $50 million water buyback by the government, which effectively bought airspace in dams. I understand that we need to be concerned about the environment. We all are. There is no-one more concerned about the environment than farmers. I can tell you that now. It is their livelihood. It is how they live; it is how they make a living. I did notice that in one of the answers before concern was expressed about the impact on the environment of the pipeline in Victoria. There was no mention of impact on farmers and regional communities! I implore that we all work together on this but I argue that the government is going down a path of ad hoc strategy which needs to be fixed because there are significant life changing ramifications for those people who particularly live in our rural and regional communities right across the country.

"Mason, Sen Brett",LP,2008-09-16,"—You might remember in November last year that one of the defining points of the election campaign was the then Leader of the Opposition, Mr Rudd, at a school surrounded by an adoring throng—not the media on this occasion but school students—holding a laptop computer. He said of the laptop computer, ‘This is the toolbox of the 21st century.’ It was great optics and very good politics but also, of course, great spin. The education revolution became one of the centrepieces of the campaign, in particular the computers in schools program—the promise that every high school student would get their own computer.
Nine months later, however, we have all been expecting the good news but it seems perhaps there is a false pregnancy. After two rounds of estimates, several COAG meetings and increasing media scrutiny, we now know that the education revolution is a sham. This is symptomatic of the general approach of the Rudd government: clever rhetoric, I will give them that—often great rhetoric—attractive promises and lots of spin. But then the reality hits. It sounded like a good idea at the time, but they have not gone through with it. They have not done the costings, they do not know how they are going to implement it and it ends up being a shambles.
Let us just go back and look at the computers in schools program. There are roughly one million year 9 to 12 students in Australia studying at both public and private schools. The promise, on kevin07.com.au, was that there would be one computer for every student—in other words, roughly one million laptop computers provided. That was in November last year.
When we got to estimates this year, the promise then was not one computer for every student; it was that there will be access—the government will provide a computer so that all students can access a computer. So we have gone from one computer for each student to each student having access to a laptop computer. Then we get to June—to budget estimates.
—But wait—there’s more!
—There is more. We have kevin07.com.au, then Kevin 08 and then Kevin 08 version 2. Version 2 in the June estimates was different. This time the government admitted that in fact the aim was to supply one computer for every two students—that is, half as many as they initially said. So we have gone from an allocation of one million laptop computers to about half a million—half the computers they initially said they would provide. But it gets worse, much worse—the shambles goes on, as does the deception. We learnt in estimates that the government had budgeted $1,000 per unit. I can see my friend the chair of the estimates committee in which I serve, Senator Marshall, sitting over there and I am sure he will back me up on this. The government allocated $1,000 per unit: $500 for each laptop and $500 for all the other costs. There are start-up costs such as wiring, connection to the internet, networking computers and cabling. That is all part of the $500. Next are the ongoing costs such as maintenance, repair, insurance, security costs, storage costs, ongoing internet costs, air conditioning, electricity and so on and so on. And this is all part of the $500. Finally, of course, there is the cost to the education system of training teachers, upskilling them to make use of this new technology. All this for $500! It is an absolute fiasco.
The best estimates from industry are that the ratio is about one to four. So, if we have a unit cost of $500, the initial costs, the ongoing costs and the cost for the education of teachers to use this technology is roughly, let us say, $2,000. So it is being underbudgeted by $1,500 per computer. If we have half a million computers times $1,500 then we are left with a huge difference. What a farce. It was a great idea. It gave great visuals. It was great politics, great rhetoric and great spin. But that is exactly where it ends.
So who picks up the bill, because the $500 is not enough? Two groups of people. If the students go to independent schools for years 9 to 12 then their parents will pick up the bill, because the $500 will not pay for all of those costs. If the students go to state schools, where most Australian students go, then state governments will be expected to pick up that bill. What do state governments say about these ongoing costs, the set-up costs and the cost of educating teachers? Let me go through that. What did Mr Carpenter, the late Premier of Western Australia, say—
—I don’t think he’s late!
—You are probably right, Senator Marshall. That is a little bit rough even for Mr Carpenter. I should say the former Premier of Western Australia. Mr Carpenter got some things wrong but he got some things right. What he said was that the program was underbudgeted by about $3 billion—which again is about the average commercial ratio. Mr Carpenter said: ‘The Western Australia state government isn’t going to fund this proposal. This is a federal government initiative and they can pay for it.’ But what about some of the other states? Let us have a look at South Australia. I will read from the Australian of Friday, 12 September this year. The article says:
South Australian Education Minister Jane Lomax-Smith said the funding deal was predicated on the states being able to buy a computer and licence for $1000.
“The federal Government have agreed that the funding should cover the cost of the equipment and legitimate oncosts,” Dr Lomax-Smith said. “If what (schools) are suggesting is the state Government should fund a federal commitment (to pay for the licences), then I’m a little bit bemused. It is a federal government initiative.”
Just like the Western Australian government, the South Australian government will not pay for this fiasco. They have said that they will not do that. And it gets worse. In New South Wales the budget papers of the former Treasurer, Mr Costa, said this:
To date, the COAG Working Groups have primarily focussed on developing detailed implementation plans for the major Commonwealth election commitments, such as the Digital Education Revolution and the National Rental Affordability Scheme.
According to the budget paper, the COAG meeting:
… recognises that the Commonwealth election commitments and the policy objectives and programs underpinning them reflect the Commonwealth’s priorities and preferences for service delivery.
The budget paper continued:
Whilst some of these election commitments relate to NSW broad policy objectives, they do not necessarily reflect the core commitments and priorities of the NSW State Plan.
The NSW Budget therefore has been prepared on the basis that the Commonwealth fully pays for all “legitimate and additional” State costs in implementing the Commonwealth Government’s election commitments.
So there we have it: Western Australia, South Australia and New South Wales all saying they will not fund the Rudd government’s computers in schools program.
—So much for cooperative federalism.
—So much for that indeed, Senator Ellison. This is what you get when you have a government that does not believe in anything—that has, in fact, no soul. It is run by bureaucrats. It is process driven and there is nothing left of the heart and soul of the Labor Party. My friend Senator Marshall sits over there. He is no doubt an economic conservative as well. That is no doubt why he joined the Australian Labor Party. The problem is that you have two sorts of people in the ALP: Senator Marshall, who believes in something, and the other sort—and it is unpalatable and wrong—who believe in nothing. What has happened to the ALP is that such people are all that are left— (Time expired)

"Marshall, Sen Gavin",ALP,2008-09-16,"—In my very first speech in this place I said, among very many other important things, the following:
I believe education is a fundamental right that all people should have the opportunity to receive. It is an ingredient that all in our society are richer for and, in turn, it is the responsibility of all in our society to fund and control it. It is the basis for all invention, innovation, research development and leading social theory in our society. It is the key to equality, opportunity and prosperity.
That is why, after being in this place for six years, I am excited and thrilled that this newly elected Rudd Labor government is embarking on the much needed education revolution for this country. I think it is disappointing that Senator Brandis, who readily admitted in his contribution that he has dealt with all these issues already through the Senate estimates—
—You mean Senator Mason.
—Did I say Senator Brandis? I say sorry to both Senator Brandis and Senator Mason, and I hope neither of them sues me. Senator Mason readily admitted in his contribution to this debate that all these issues have been thoroughly dealt with through the Senate estimates process. All those issues and figures that Senator Mason talked about were thoroughly canvassed and adequately responded to by the department and the relevant minister at the table through many, many hours of Senator Mason’s questions, yet Senator Mason continues—based on a fabrication—to run the line that this government is not committed to the education revolution. Quite frankly this demonstrates the poverty of the previous government’s, the now opposition’s, position with respect to education as a whole.
Senator Mason well knows that some of those figures that were being quoted were on the basis of a single computer with singly purchased software in a single installation. That is clearly not the case and that was gone through and explained to Senator Mason hour after hour by the department. The costs of bulk purchasing of the many thousands upon thousands of computers and their software together with the bulk arrangements for the rollout of these computers in schools are nowhere near the costs that he quotes for a single individual unit. I think it is unfortunate that, based on that fabrication, Senator Mason wants to run the line that what we are doing in terms of an education revolution is not with the best intentions for the future of our economic development in this country and with the best interests of our community at heart.
I appreciate that Senator Mason is actually very passionate about education and I give him due credit in that respect. But it is a problem when in opposition—and I have seen it because I have spent quite some time in opposition—that rather than constructively addressing the issue he is trying to take this fabrication and expand it into an argument to undermine the very education revolution that this country needs. I thought that Senator Mason was better than that. One must wonder and question, given his contribution today, whether he actually thinks that rolling out computers to secondary school students is a good thing or a bad thing.
—You shouldn’t question that at all. What he said is that you screwed up the policy.
—Senator Brandis, maybe you should have been here for the contribution.

Senator Brandis interjecting—

—I will listen very carefully to your contribution to this debate later on. Senator Mason’s words stand for themselves. Given his attacks on the rolling out of computers, which are all based on a fabricated set of figures, one must question—
—They weren’t a fabricated set of figures.
—Maybe, Senator Brandis, you should listen a little bit more carefully to what I have just explained to you and which was explained hour after hour to Senator Mason. Either he did not listen to what the departmental officials were explaining to him or maybe, just conveniently, he did not want to hear, so he could keep running this fictitious case based on fabricated figures, which he knows—and I am disappointed that he is not better than this and that he is not actually lifting his game to a higher level—is simply a political stunt to undermine the education revolution that this country so needs. One would have thought that he could have actually got up and told us about what they did when they were in government. We did not hear anything about that because we know that what they, the now opposition, did in government was simply to de-fund education. They did worse than stand still.
In the House today Minister Gillard talked about the latest OECD figures from 2005—and they are the latest figures available. They showed that public school funding during the life of the previous government was 4.3 per cent of GDP in this country against the average OECD figure of five per cent. We were ranked 19th in the OECD. That is very close to the bottom. In early education spending we were 24th out of 26 in the OECD. So it is not surprising that Senator Mason cannot come in and contribute to this debate based on any record of the previous government and instead simply wants to undermine our education revolution, which is so needed to fill the neglect that was left by the previous government.
The initiatives that the Minister for Education, Employment and Workplace Relations has undertaken in her portfolio touch on a number of bases. The education revolution is not just a slogan. The education revolution is a response to over 12 years of Liberal Party neglect.
Opposition senators interjecting—
—I will be very interested to hear those senators interjecting opposite get up and defend the record of the previous government, because that record is absolutely atrocious.

Senator Brandis interjecting—

—I wait to hear your contribution in this debate, Senator Brandis; you seem to have a lot to say in your interjecting from the sidelines, but let us hear your contribution. If you total up all the new commitments in education that the Rudd Labor government has made since the election, the figure is around $17.6 billion committed to our education revolution. Against what?
—Did The Hollowmen write your speech for you?
—Senator Brandis, if you want to keep interjecting, tell us what you spent. In your contribution to this debate, you can tell us what your government spent, because it pales into insignificance with our plans for an education revolution.
There are many reasons that this education revolution is needed. Research undertaken by the previous government last year showed that 44 per cent of Australian businesses were having trouble recruiting the people they needed. They were your figures, Senator Brandis. What we have in this country is a skills crisis. This government has made fixing it a national priority, and that does not mean just plugging the skills gaps we have today; it means building the skills we will need for tomorrow. That is in stark contrast to everything the previous government did. It was always about short-termism, always about blaming everybody else but never about a long-term vision of what this country needs. That is why this government has undertaken the education revolution. The people on the opposition benches should be applauding us for these initiatives, but instead we heard from Senator Mason a fabricated set of figures, which he then based a whole argument on, to try to undermine the massive commitment that this government is making to the future of our economy, our education system and our society.
This government has made massive new investments in every stage of the learning journey. At the heart of this initiative, it is essential that we overcome disadvantage and improve educational outcomes. We need a skilled workforce to fill the jobs of the future—white-collar, green-collar and blue-collar jobs—and that is a fact that the opposition apparently failed to recognise in their entire term of office.
Moreover, the government need to address the challenges of 12 years of climate change denial by the previous government. We need smart citizens to make climate change adaptation work on the ground and the education revolution will ensure that we have people with these skills to handle the new technologies climate change will summon forth, to hold down increasingly knowledge intensive jobs and to contribute creatively to the innovation process.

"Milne, Sen Christine",AG,2008-09-16,"—I rise today to comment on this important matter brought before the Senate in relation to the planning, costing and implementation, in a timely manner, of the flagship election promise, the ‘education revolution’. Frankly, I am concerned that there is not going to be an education revolution in Australia but that we are actually going to see a reformation of where the Howard government has been and that this government is going to head in exactly the same direction. A revolution implies excitement; it implies a change. It implies something different, innovative, new—an energy in the sector.
I do congratulate the Rudd government for its undertaking to put computers in schools. That is a critically important bit of infrastructure that the Australian education community needs, but I note and take on board what has been said about how that has actually been rolled out, because it is absolutely true that schools are being short-changed in the rollout of computer programs. What is happening is that schools are being forced to buy cheaper laptops and spend up to 30 per cent of their grants on licensing and government fees. That is just the reality. I went to a school in north-eastern Tasmania where they are having to rewire whole sections of the school because they do not have the most basic wiring able to accommodate the equipment that is now required if they are actually going to deliver education in the way that they hope to.
According to a recent newspaper report, South Australian public schools are paying $250 for licensing fees for each new computer and a $40 state government administration fee. They pay $6 a student to cover existing licences, but replacement computers do not attract the $250 fee. In fact those schools which are the most disadvantaged, and therefore have the fewest computers and are now getting new computers, will pay the highest fees because they are not replacement computers and therefore they have to pay additional licensing fees. In some states—New South Wales, Victoria and Western Australia—the state governments have agreed to absorb the licensing fees and pay the whole of the grant to the school, but in other states this is not the case.
New South Wales has stumped up the money to give schools wireless access and I think that is a good idea as well. But the South Australian Secondary Principals Association has said that allowing the states to administer the scheme has led to funding inequities. In South Australia, for example, they had hoped to be leading edge nationally, but that is not the case. If you are a disadvantaged school and have not been able to build up the number of computers, nearly all of the computers will be new and they will carry the $250 fee. Hallett Cove School in Adelaide’s south is paying more than $51,000 on Microsoft fees, administration costs and so on and so forth.
What we are finding is that, whilst in theory it is a good idea, in practice it has not rolled out smoothly or uniformly across the country. The other thing to point out is that the same arrangement was made for privileged schools and completely underprivileged schools and so it has not addressed the inequity in the system. That is the point I really wanted to address today in terms of the education revolution. You cannot have a revolution in education unless you fund it.
Giving people computers is not a revolution on its own. It is no use putting a computer in front of a young person if you do not have teaching staff who can actually help them to discern what is good and reliable information, what is information that might be suspect and how to negotiate the internet, because the information superhighway is not uniform in quality.
The issue of public school funding is a critical one, and I am concerned that we are shortly going to see a break with the past when the government introduces its new funding for the next quadrennium. What we are most likely going to see is the splitting off, for the first time, of funding for private schools from funding for public schools, and that the public school funding will not come until after the negotiations with the states later this year. What this means is that the private schools will get their certainty early—within the next few weeks—and the public schools are going to have to wait till much later in the year. Politically, it is quite a savvy tactic because it allows the private schools to get their money without the public schools being able to have a point of comparison and reference for some time. On the other hand it allows the government the opportunity to negotiate a much better deal with the state governments. If one were less cynical one would hope that the motivation may be for the government to at last sit down and negotiate with the states to get a real injection of funds into public education.
As we know, under the Howard government the share of Commonwealth funding to public education slipped backwards. We would need an investment of $1½ billion upfront now to bring public education up to the same share it had in 1996, when the Howard government took office. So let us not fail to remember that under the Howard government for a decade the share of Commonwealth funding for public schools in Australia slipped right back. For all those years we had Julia Gillard, now the Deputy Prime Minister, saying that when there was a problem in the education sector the Howard government looked around for someone to blame: generally in question time it was the education unions and then it was state Labor governments.
But I have to say that Minister Gillard is now doing exactly the same thing—she is looking around for people to blame and she is generally blaming teachers. I will not have it. I am not going to stand in this parliament and allow governments to blame teachers for educational performance. In fact, you need to have your best teachers in the most difficult schools if you are going to get the best outcomes and offer equitable education outcomes. By setting up systems where you reward people on the basis of the educational attainment of students in schools, you are setting up a system whereby you end up with your best teachers not necessarily wanting to be in those difficult schools, and therefore those difficult-to-staff schools.
I want to put a line in the sand here and say that it is time as a society we thought much more about the place of schools in our community and about how we value teachers in our community and the job that they do. The whole society must recognise the value of teachers and what they bring to the classrooms. Computers are one thing, but it is the human management skills and the human teaching skills that are critical. We need smaller class sizes. We need a policy whereby if we have inclusion of students with disabilities of any kind, whether they are physical or mental disabilities or learning problems, there are smaller class sizes. We have to support the inclusion policy with enough aids to be able to allow students in those circumstances to learn.
I would like to see the Rudd government go back and have a look at how the states have handled the rollout of computers in their schools. It should look at the fact that, because some state governments have subsidised it and others have not, students are not receiving the computers in the equitable way the government promised they would. The fact that it is costing so much for reconfiguration of classrooms, for rewiring, for licensing fees and so on, is also undermining the value of these computers. But computers alone will not do it. We have to fund education adequately and increase the share of public education funding as a matter of urgency.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Education</title>,Matters of Public Importance,18,1,speech
"Humphries, Sen Gary",LP,2008-09-16,"—Before I talk about the failure of the education revolution, I want to address the last point that Senator Milne made, which has also been made by other speakers in this debate, and that is the claim that the Howard government allowed public school funding to slip during its time in office. That claim is based essentially on a trick with the numbers. Senators should be aware that during the life of the Howard government there was a significant increase in the number and the proportion of school students in Australia who attended non-government schools. Of course, the constitutional arrangements in Australia are very clear: the federal government has prime responsibility for the funding of non-government education and the state governments have responsibility for the funding of state schools. And it was that growth in non-government school enrolments that drove an increase in the size of the non-government funding sector. But it is absolutely not true to say that the Howard government neglected the funding of government schools. I illustrate that point by observing that, in the life of the Howard government, enrolments in government schools increased across Australia by approximately two per cent and funding of government schools by the federal government increased by more than 70 per cent in real terms. To increase funding by that level over that period of time is not an indication of neglect, and those opposite should know better than to manipulate figures in that way.
On the matter of public importance, let me say that I think the education revolution launched by the government is essentially a slogan in search of an intellectual underpinning. It is also in search of some real dollars to make it actually work. I see in this policy nothing but intellectual drift; a sense that the government hit upon a great idea—a sexy idea—that the pollsters said would really turned people’s knobs before the election last year, and the details of how this would actually work to change the landscape of Australian education were to come later. The details are coming through in dribs and drabs, convincing nobody that Labor has a coherent and consistent approach towards improving education outcomes in this country.
The best evidence of that phenomenon is the speech that the Prime Minister gave a couple of weeks ago in Canberra at the National Press Club to announce the so-called philosophical underpinning of the education revolution. He talked about transparency in education, performance reports for schools, the right of school principals to be able to hire and fire teachers and performance pay for good teachers. They are great ideas, but where do those ideas come from? They were borrowed directly from the education reforms announced by the then education minister, Brendan Nelson, in 2004.
—It was hardly a revolution.
—As Senator Nash has pointed out, it was hardly a revolution. In fact the nearest we got to a revolution was apparently in the Labor Party caucus when these plans were announced. People were saying: ‘We have been opposing these approaches for some years. We have been opposing performance pay for teachers. We have been opposing league tables for schools. We are not in favour of that. Why are you announcing it, Prime Minister?’ Indeed, the question remains: what exactly is Labor’s approach? Why was Labor prepared to back state governments that resisted these reforms during the life of the Howard government? Why are they now prepared to back them in the face of, presumably, some misgivings on the part of the state governments now that they are in government at the federal level? It just does not add up. Labor is thrashing about to try and find some basis for proceeding.
While they are doing that they are also cutting back on the essentials of a solid education system, which was so important to the way in which the former federal government implemented education reform and improved education outcomes. The best illustration of how badly they have mismanaged this exercise is their abolition of the very successful $1.2 billion Investing in our Schools Program. I do not think that there is a single senator in this chamber who would not, at one stage, have gone to a school in their state or territory and seen the good that that program did to the fabric and the morale of both government and non-government schools across this country. That program made an enormous difference to the quality of outcomes students were getting. Incidentally, it was purchasing computers for schools at a much greater rate than we are seeing at the present time. How many computers have appeared on the desks of Australian students as a result of the Rudd government’s education revolution? Not one. We are yet to see the very first computer arrive. When it does we will no doubt have a big media splash about it. But so far there are no results for this program. We delivered many, many computers to government and non-government schools through Investing in our Schools and, sadly, that program has been abolished.
We have also seen, courtesy of the former government, the release, very belatedly, of national literacy and numeracy tests. The tests were conducted in May and it was only in the last week or so that these test results have been finally released, making them much less useful to Australian schools and parents than they should have otherwise have been. It tested students in years 3, 5 and 7.
Having established that certain students have certain problems, the question then needs to be asked: what can a government committed to an education revolution do about assisting the particular needs of those students? Again, we had an answer to that question. We had the Even Start National Tuition Program of $450 million to provide tutorial vouchers worth $700 per student to ensure that students in this country who were falling behind had some means of catching up. As we know, no school system, no matter how good, is capable of making sure that every student marches at the same pace. For those that fall behind we had a solution. What has this government’s response been to that particular program? It has been, of course, to abolish Even Start with $450 million down the gurgler.
Their Trade Training Centres in Schools program was much vaunted as the answer to the problem of shortages in trades across the country. Again, it was poorly conceived and has produced very little in the way of tangible results. Just 34 schools across Australia are to receive funding to date. That is 1.3 per cent of the nation’s 2,600-odd schools, and it is very doubtful whether the funding allocated will produce any meaningful outcomes for schools in terms of building the appropriate facilities, maintaining them, depreciating them and providing for staffing and training and so forth. So the education revolution so far is a miserable parody of the promises that were made to the Australian community and we have yet to see them realised. We have yet to see the philosophy behind this revolution properly explained to the Australian community.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Education</title>,Matters of Public Importance,18,1,speech
"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2008-09-16,"—Earlier today when I saw this motion from Senator Mason I thought that it was quite audacious on this of all days. I was pondering in the chamber a moment ago with my interjections that perhaps the good senator was seeking the education portfolio. Consider the content of the motion—
The failure of the Rudd government to appropriately plan, cost and implement in a timely manner its flagship election promise, the ‘education revolution’.
You can only help but reflect on the inconsistency of the opposition’s current approach. On the one hand we have: ‘Everything is being pushed off to review after review after review. All this government is about is reviews.’ Then, on the other hand, we have: ‘They are not doing anything now. They are not doing anything immediately.’ The Rudd government has achieved an awful lot in the short time that has been available in relation to this agenda.
Senator Humphries made the point—and did cover some other relevant areas to this debate—that the education revolution is not just about the sexy idea of improving digital infrastructure in schools. There is a hell of a lot more to the agenda. He suggests that the Australian public needs to know more about the philosophy and the background being covered here. There is a mighty lot of information that can be referred to to sustain that case. We have before us now a ground-breaking, unprecedented COAG agenda.
Let us look at a couple of the key priorities of that agenda. But before I do that I also want to put before the Senate some other facts about school funding. Senator Humphries says that the funding between government and non-government schools has been misrepresented in the discussion by some parties. Others have suggested that we are really only looking at the rollout of digital infrastructure. But the real point is: what is education spending as a proportion of the total government spend? That was where we went backwards under the Howard government. Let me be very clear and very fair: for the benefit of the Senate I will now I will apply exactly the same measurement criteria to their previous period and to our current period, and let us look at the difference. The previous government was heading for a decrease in education spending from 7.54 per cent in 2007-08 to 7.47 per cent in 2008-09. Under the same measurement basis, the current government has increased its spending from 7.83 per cent in 2007-08 to eight per cent in 2008-09.
These small figures, when you are not looking at the total context of these scenarios, do not quite paint the full picture, so let me do that. In our first budget we allocated $19.3 billion to education initiatives, including not only the $1.2 billion for the digital education revolution, which will over time provide access to a computer for every student in years 9 to 12, but also the $11 billion for the Education Investment Fund, a national curriculum for all students in English, maths, science and history as well as national Asian language studies programs, and the $2.5 billion trades training centres program across Australia, which will help to provide robust trade skills for students and keep them engaged in schooling. That is the broader context. Senator Humphries can raise implementation issues. Indeed, Senator Milne also mentioned implementation issues, although she, in far better perspective, made the point that we do need to be mindful of how well these programs are being implemented. The flexibility and the preparedness to deal with that is something that I think this government has and is quite prepared for and able to do.
The final point I make about keeping students engaged in schooling takes me back to the COAG agenda. We know that during the Howard government era keeping our students engaged in high school was, to the disgrace of Australia, going backwards. We had an appalling standard—if you look at other OECD countries—on the schooling and retention in schooling of our secondary school students. Worse than that, whilst most other OECD countries were going forwards, we were going backwards. This is not an issue to do with the debate between government and non-government schools; this is a pretty basic, clear benchmark for our school education. Why is it so basic? I encourage any of the senators to have a look at this document about quality education that was recently released by the government. Very clearly, it highlights for all of us the impact and the difference it makes for students to complete year 12. Any government concerned about social justice or inclusion cannot look past a simple benchmark such as improving the level of students remaining in our institutions until year 12. The consequences of them not doing so are appalling.
Let me move to the other area that is part of our COAG agenda. The secondary schooling benchmarks are one key area, but another area very close to my own heart is early childhood. It is another area where we measure very, very poorly—in fact, possibly worse—on OECD standards. What did the Howard government do in that area? It talked about having a national agenda for early childhood. It talked about it repeatedly, but it never had a plan. It never had a plan, yet we have had Senator Mason here today criticising at this early stage of the Rudd government our ability to appropriately plan, cost and implement our education revolution. Early childhood is a key part of our education revolution. A key part—and, again, the former government talked about it—is ensuring that every Australian child has one year of access to preschool education before they make the transition into our schools.
So our COAG plan is about the transition into schools and also about the transition out of schools. That plan is something that is easily available for any senator to refer to. As I said, it is groundbreaking and it is unprecedented. Yes, we will have implementation problems with the states. It is not easy to roll out these types of agendas across areas where you have had state management of delivery across a whole range of policy areas as well, but I believe the Rudd government will achieve that end.

"Cash, Sen Michaelia",LP,2008-09-16,"—It has been interesting to sit here and listen to those on the other side espousing the good things that the Rudd government has done since coming to office in relation to education. I, too, have to acknowledge one thing that the Rudd government is good at. But it has nothing to do with education. It is all about media spin—spin over substance every time; 10 out of 10 on the report card for that one. I think it is fair to say that the greatest success of the Rudd government to date is its capacity to produce spin rather than substance when dealing with important policy issues. After all, the Rudd government was elected as a result of media hype and media spin, with a range of so-called policies that, in the main, comprised of glib lines designed to entice and entrap the voter into believing that a Rudd government would actually deliver the educational needs of the nation. After nine months we can now see how the worm has turned and how the voter has now learnt that they got taken for a ride based on spin, rhetoric and a few glib political lines rather than substance.
Labor’s so-called education revolution has to be seen for what it is, and that is a fraud on the people of Australia, who were entitled and are entitled to expect more from this government. Let us look at the promises made by Mr Rudd in relation to the Productivity Places program, a Labor election commitment to deliver an additional 450,000 training places over four years. The spin on that is absolutely fantastic. Mr Rudd sold this policy as ‘a core piece of our overall armoury in fighting inflation’. This was the commitment: up to 20,000 places were offered to jobseekers from 1 April to 30 June. That was phase 1. From 1 July, up to 66,000 training places would be available to existing workers looking to upskill. But what is the reality in terms of this government delivering on this election promise? The reality is that the Rudd government has failed to meet their own expectations that were placed on the program when it was launched. Labor failed to fill even half of the 20,000 training places before phase 1 ended on 30 June. After selling this policy as ‘a core piece of our overall armoury in fighting inflation’, this is a gross failure by the Rudd government.
Only 3,300 places of the 66,000 places that are available to existing workers have been filled, because the Rudd government has only negotiated agreements with three states. This is in stark contrast to the coalition’s work-school vouchers. This was a simple, fully funded federal government initiative which allowed every jobseeker who wanted to improve their skills the opportunity to do so.
Now let us look at Mr Rudd’s plans to hand over all of the Australian technical colleges to the states, in favour of—and you have to love this one—a resource stretched trade training centre policy. Labor’s proposal, or spin as I like to call it, is to build state-of-the-art trade training centres in all 2,650 secondary schools around the country. Each school can apply for between $500,000 and $1.5 million to build or upgrade vocational education training facilities. The problem is that the funding available for each school program is grossly inadequate to provide proper trade training.
The coalition, however, spent an average of $24 million for each Australian technical college. In contrast, the Rudd government is offering each school an average of just $900,000 over 10 years. The funding is so paltry schools will be lucky if they can update woodwork rooms at best. This will not create 2,650 state-of-the-art trade training centres.
The evidence is clear. The Rudd Labor government’s education revolution is now being seen by the public for the fraud that it is. The Rudd government has during its time in office failed to deliver its education revolution, which was hailed as a flagship election policy. Clearly, the Rudd Labor government has failed the people of Australia, and the people are entitled to feel cheated. The product that was advertised to the people of Australia and that they bought is not the product that is now being delivered. If the Labor government were subject to the provisions of the Trade Practices Act, they would be sued by the people of Australia for misleading and deceptive conduct and the people of Australia would win hands down.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Education</title>,Matters of Public Importance,18,1,speech
"Arbib, Sen Mark",ALP,2008-09-16,"—Two weeks ago in my first speech to the chamber I talked about the importance of education to our country’s future, the importance of education in transitioning our economy, the importance of education in allowing us to take advantage of new science and technology and the importance of education in providing opportunities for all Australians to improve their own and their families’ livelihoods. That is why I was absolutely astonished on hearing of this MPI raised by Senator Mason.
I was astonished because I believe one of the main causes for the coalition’s defeat at the last election was their poor record in and neglect of our education system. In short, the former Howard Liberal government’s legacy on education was appalling. There was 12 years of underfunding, 12 years of inaction and 12 years of neglect. The sheer hypocrisy of investing so little in education is galling.
In 2005, Australia’s public spending on education as a percentage of GDP was 4.3 per cent, which was well below the OECD average of five per cent. We now rank 19th overall behind Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom and many other European countries. Yet the Liberals still have the nerve to come into this chamber and challenge the Rudd government on its commitment to education.
It was not just underinvestment that characterised their 12 years in government; it was also extreme ideology. Just like in the workplace with Work Choices, the coalition was ideologically driven on education. Former Prime Minister John Howard’s ideological extremism on history, curriculum and student unions is well known and supported by all those on the opposite of the chamber. For the Liberal Party, education was a wedge to try and attract votes rather than a pathway to skills and a brighter future. The Rudd government believes passionately in education and this is why we are undertaking an education revolution at every level: primary, secondary and tertiary. Importantly, we are also delivering on our election commitments.
Last May in our budget the government met its commitment on schools, providing support for technology, infrastructure, curriculum and resourcing through a $3 billion down payment on building a world-class education system. We are attempting to make the jump into the 21st century. With the information age right at our doorstep it is of the greatest importance that a modern, vibrant economy equips our children with the means necessary to prosper in the world economy. Therefore, the government will spend $1.2 billion over five years as part of the digital education revolution, providing computer equipment to every secondary school—years 9 to 12—through the National Secondary School Computer Fund. In the last two months alone we have approved $116 million for the funding of 116,000 new computers in 896 secondary schools right across the country. This is happening now. Some senators may laugh, but this is serious. These are computers that are going into schools now. Children in years 9 to 12 will have computers to use to improve their schooling and to improve their livelihood, and it is happening right now.
On childhood education we are also delivering on our commitments. Again, going back to the OECD figures, their report in 2005 on education showed that just 0.1 per cent of Australia’s GDP was spent on primary institutions compared to the OECD average of 0.4 per cent, ranking Australia 24 out of 26 countries on education—and this mob over here are proud of their record on education? You have got to be kidding me! Twenty-fourth out of 26 countries! That is why the government is spending $577 million on getting the basics right. There is an action plan on literacy and numeracy and under this program funds will be available to support schools across the board, focusing on those schools and students that are most in need of help.
The Australian government will also commit $5 million per annum over four years to support the activities of the National Curriculum Board to develop a national curriculum. The previous government talked about it; we are delivering on it. It is not just a national curriculum, but national testing—testing that is taking place right now in our schools. The results were out last week. And it is not just about curriculum and testing; it is also looking at the future of languages. The National Asian Languages and Studies in Australian Schools Program will be vital in our commercial, social and cultural engagement with Asian nations, and it is rightly recognised by the Prime Minister in high schools where language teaching and training and support is so needed.
On skills we are also taking up the fight. A recent survey by global business consultant Grant Thornton International found that the shortage of skilled workers was the biggest single barrier to business expansion in Australia. Therefore, in the area of skills training, which the former government talked about but did very little about, the Rudd government’s trade training centres will provide $2.5 billion over 10 years to enable all secondary schools right across the country to apply for trade training centres. Already we have provided more than $90 million for these trade training centres and almost 100 schools nationwide will benefit.
Not only is the Rudd government committed to the education of children, it is also committed to ensuring that our children have the best facilities possible. The Rudd Labor government’s Local Schools Working Together policy has allocated $62 million to build facilities to be shared between government and non-government schools with 25 projects right across the country to build shared facilities such as assembly halls, computer and science laboratories, libraries and sporting facilities. And it is not just schools. The education revolution is also about universities and we are spending $500 million for campus renewal through the Better Universities Renewal Fund. After 12 years of the previous government’s neglect, the Rudd government is taking education seriously. (Time expired)

"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2008-09-16,"—I move:
That, for the purposes of paragraph 48(1)(a) of the Legislative Instruments Act 2003, the Senate rescinds its resolution of 19 June 2008 disallowing the Health Insurance (Dental Services) Amendment and Repeal Determination 2008, made under subsection 3C(1) of the Health Insurance Act 1973.
During the election last year we announced we would be delivering a $290 million Commonwealth Dental Health Program to help reduce public dental waiting lists that had blown out to 650,000 across the country. We also announced that we would be delivering the Medicare Teen Dental Plan, which will involve an investment of $490 million. This means that we would be investing, in total, $780 million over the next four years in dental health—compared to the previous government, which spent less than $4 million on dental health over the four years until the 2007 election. So that is $780 million over four years compared to $4 million over four years.
At the same time we made it absolutely clear that we would abolish the Howard government’s poorly targeted and failing chronic disease dental scheme. We were entirely open about our policies. We made it clear that in order to fund our dental program we would have to redirect funding from the Liberal scheme to the Labor scheme—not unreasonable, given we won the election. We had made a choice, and so did the public. They chose in favour of Labor’s better targeted dental programs. That choice was necessary to maintain our budget surplus, and that is the clear choice now facing the Senate.
Today’s motion will decide whether the government can implement the dental policies which the Australian public voted for or whether the government will have to suspend its investment in public dental services because of the economic vandalism of those in the opposition. The motion will decide whether the government can provide a million more dental consultations and treatments for needy Australians, especially pensioners and concession card holders, or whether these people will continue to languish on public dental waiting lists because of the opposition’s irresponsible approach.
It has been estimated that there are about 650,000 Australians languishing on public dental waiting lists. Thirty per cent of Australians are reported to have avoided dental care due to the cost of services. Fifty thousand people each year end up in hospital with preventable dental conditions, putting more pressure on our hospitals. Tooth decay is Australia’s most prevalent health problem, with gum disease ranking as the fifth highest. Over a quarter of the Australian adult population have untreated dental decay—untreated because they are not accessing the dental care they require.
This alarming state of affairs is even worse amongst the poorer, most needy Australians. Concession card holders such as pensioners have lost on average 3.5 more teeth than non-concession card holders. As the member for North Sydney himself said, under the Liberal government things had got to the point where:
Dentistry remains out of reach to those on low incomes with around 30 percent of Australians unable to see a dentist because of cost.
That quote is from 6 March of this year by the member for North Sydney. It is clear from these terrible facts that we need action on dental health, particularly for disadvantaged Australians, such as pensioners.
Rather than addressing these problems, the Howard government spent much of the past decade cynically playing the blame game. They did nothing but say, ‘Dental health is not our responsibility; blame the states.’ But it was the Howard government that helped create some of these problems in the first place. One of their first acts of government was to scrap Labor’s Commonwealth Dental Health Program in 1996. They ripped $100 million a year from Australia’s public dental system and this led to the explosion in public dental waiting lists which we see today. Six hundred and fifty thousand people waited, sometimes for years, for treatment. Then, belatedly, the Howard government introduced a dental scheme which was not targeted at people most in financial need and which had a referral process and eligibility criteria so complex and restrictive that few people could access it.
The previous government’s failed chronic disease dental scheme deserves a little bit more scrutiny. Labor recognises that, for those able to navigate their way through the complicated referral process and the red tape, the former government’s chronic disease dental scheme offered some help. But many people missed out—often the most needy people in our community. For example, in the four years up to 31 July 2008, under the Liberals’ chronic disease dental scheme no-one under the age of 30 received any services in the Northern Territory, despite it having some of Australia’s most needy Indigenous communities. This is a fact. No-one under the age of 15 has received any services in South Australia. This means that no child born in South Australia or the Northern Territory during the term of the Howard government received any help from the scheme. Only three people under the age of 20 received any services in Tasmania, Senator Colbeck, under the previous government’s scheme. Only nine people under the age of 25 received any services in Western Australia—and I am looking at a Western Australian senator as I am speaking—under the previous government’s program. Only 21 people under the age of 10 received any services in my own home state of Victoria. That is, on average, less than one person every two months.
Moreover, the former government’s scheme was not targeted at the most disadvantaged, such as pensioners and concession card holders. Under the Liberal scheme, a multimillionaire could get help but a pensioner with a toothache could not. Under the Liberal scheme, if you were a pensioner and you had a toothache, how much help do you think you could get? The answer is none. If you were a pensioner and needed a tooth extracted, how much help could you get? That is right—none. If you were a pensioner in any part of Australia and needed a simple filling to save a tooth, how much help could you get? That is right again—none.
In addition, take-up of the Liberals’ chronic disease dental scheme has been highly skewed, with many states receiving far less than a fair population share. While one in five concession card holders live in Queensland, about 18.9 per cent, it has received only 4.4 per cent of benefits under the chronic disease dental scheme. While one in 11 concession card holders live in South Australia, about 8.9 per cent, it has received only 2.5 per cent of benefits. Again to my colleague from Western Australia, while one in 12 concession card holders live in Western Australia, about 8.5 per cent, it has received only 0.7 per cent—less than one per cent—of benefits for necessary care. While three per cent of concession card holders live in Tasmania, Senator Colbeck, it has received only 0.3 per cent—less than half of one per cent—of benefits.
These figures show clearly that the Liberals’ chronic disease dental scheme has failed. It has failed pensioners, it has failed the poorest, most disadvantaged people in our community with the worst dental health and it has failed our kids and our teenagers. It has failed to help them maintain their teeth to prevent much worse problems later on in life. That is why the government is seeking to redirect funds from the Liberals’ failed program to support better-targeted dental programs, such as the Commonwealth Dental Health Program and the Medicare Teen Dental Plan.
We have made a decision—as governments need to—that we should be helping the most needy people in our community first in the most effective way possible. But, thanks to the economic vandalism and irresponsibility of the opposition, Labor’s more targeted approach is being put at risk. In particular, if the motion before the Senate fails, the government will have to suspend implementation of the Commonwealth Dental Health Program. A million additional dental consultation and treatment services will not be able to be provided—one million services that would benefit pensioners and concession card holders.
If the opposition gets its way, every state and territory would miss out on the additional services and investment in public dental services they would receive under the CDHP. The Liberals are clearly returning to form. They ripped $100 million a year from public dental services when they were elected in 1996 and they still want to block the Rudd government from any further investment in public dental care. This means that every state and territory is at risk of missing out on more dental services. If the Senate blocks the government’s motion, pensioners and concession card holders will miss out on a range of benefits under the CDHP.
States and territories would receive considerably more under Labor’s CDHP than they received over the last four years to 31 July 2008 under the Liberals’ failed scheme. I will go through those figures because I noted your earlier interjection. Victoria—my home state—would receive 3.7 times more funding; Queensland would receive 11 times more funding; South Australia would receive 10 times more funding and—the Western Australian senators should be very conscious of this fact—Western Australia would receive 35 times more; Tasmania would receive 38 times more funds from our scheme than the existing scheme; and the Northern Territory—and I know there are Northern Territory senators present as well today—would receive 174 times more money from our scheme than from the existing scheme.
About 6.6 million people as concession card holders would be eligible for treatment under the CDHP. About 4.3 million of these people are pensioner concession card holders and their dependants. This compares to the Liberals chronic disease dental scheme, which is not targeted to concession card holders. Only about 1.1 million people meet the complex eligibility requirements of the Liberals’ scheme.
The CDHP has a number of priority areas: people with dental related chronic diseases, Indigenous Australians and preschool children aged zero to four years. The CDHP priorities for people with dental related chronic disease includes people with cancer, transplant patients, cardiac patients and people with HIV-AIDS. So it is simply untrue for Senator Colbeck to claim, as he has done, that the CDHP will not benefit people with chronic disease. It is simply not true, Senator Colbeck. The Liberals’ chronic disease dental scheme has also had little benefit in particular for Indigenous Australians and children, with no young people at all up to the age of 14 receiving services in South Australia or the Northern Territory over four years.
The CDHP includes a number of initiatives to support and expand the dental workforce, including the establishment of new public dental clinics, improved training for dentists and fly-in fly-out services to remote areas. The Liberals’ chronic disease dental program does not include any funding for workforce or rural initiatives. There is no funding for rural initiatives under your scheme. All of these initiatives which will help pensioners, people with chronic diseases, children and Indigenous Australians will not be able to be implemented if the Senate supports the opposition’s politically opportunistic and irresponsible approach.
The opposition is demonstrating its economic irresponsibility in its claim that you can have it both ways and keep both the Liberal’s failed dental scheme and Labor’s better targeted policies. The Rudd government is committed to economic responsibility. That means we will have to maintain a strong budget surplus and make tough choices. The Liberal opposition is blowing a multi-billion-dollar hole in the budget. The Charter of Budget Honesty costings which Labor took to the election are consistent with what the government is doing and include savings from closing the Liberals’ failed scheme in order to pay for Labor’s better policies. Compare our commitments to the previous government’s record of ripping $100 million a year from public dental services and leaving 650,000 people to languish on public dental waiting lists.
It is a very clear choice today in this chamber whether or not you want to stick with a policy that is untargeted and failing or go for a targeted expansion in dental health care in this country. I urge senators, particularly those from the smaller states, to listen to those statistics that I described and understand exactly where your ideological binge is getting you to. You are going to be denying, massively, your own state populations if you vote to keep the existing scheme and not implement Labor’s.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH INSURANCE (DENTAL SERVICES) AMENDMENT AND REPEAL DETERMINATION 2008</title>,<title>Motion for Disallowance</title>,Motions,26,1,speech
"Colbeck, Sen Richard",LP,2008-09-16,"—Senator Conroy’s presentation here this afternoon demonstrates what happens when someone comes into the chamber not knowing anything about what they are talking about. In fact, it was one of the most embarrassing performances I have seen here for quite some time, because Senator Conroy does not even understand his government’s own election promises. The figures that he provided to the chamber before—and he might like to get up and clear up his misrepresentation of those election promises to the Senate later on—are not the figures that are in their election policies. In fact, I have spent quite a deal of time interrogating the Labor Party’s election policies through the estimates process, and his numbers are just plain wrong.
The government talked about $290 million for the Commonwealth Dental Health Program over three years, not over four years as Senator Conroy has just told the Senate, and, according to the government’s election promises, the Teen Dental Plan was for $510 million over three years. So the figure that he quotes is what has actually been appropriated by the government since the election, not what they promised the Australian people they would spend before the election.
When the election promises went through the Charter of Budget Honesty—and I notice Senator Conroy has now left the chamber—via the Department of Finance and Deregulation, the teen dental program was costed down from $510 million to $326 million. It was then re-announced at $340 million and has been finally costed in the budget at $360 million over three years, the fourth figure we have had since the initial election promise was made. If you go back to how much the Labor Party promised the Australian people they would spend on dental programs at the election, it was $800 million over three years. Their commitments are actually $150 million short of what they promised they would spend. If you go back and do the numbers, that expenditure is $150 million short of what they promised the Australian people at the election.
For them to come in here now and tell us that we are stopping them from implementing a program because of the funding is an absolute absurdity, because they are the ones who have not kept their promise to the Australian people to spend $800 million. Minister Roxon’s spokesperson said before the election when questioned on the costing of the election promises that the government would spend $800 million. That needs to be clear to start with. The commitment was to spend $800 million and, at this point in time, over the term of the parliament they are $150 million short. That immediately kills off any suggestion that any action of the opposition is irresponsible financially, because Senator Conroy has come in here with a set of speaking notes that do not represent the true facts with respect to the government’s election policies.
His comments about the program over the last four years are also deceptive, misleading and dishonest. The enhanced dental scheme that the government is seeking to disallow as part of the removal of this Medicare item only came into effect in November 2007. For Senator Conroy to come in here and quote figures over four years is completely and utterly dishonest. By going back four years, he renders his quotes completely irrelevant because they bear absolutely no resemblance to what has happened since the program was enhanced post the budget last year and taking effect in November 2007. So Senator Conroy can come in here and quote figures from four years ago all he likes, but they bear absolutely no relevance whatsoever to this debate. The figures should be targeted at what has happened within this scheme over the last eight or nine months—since November last year is the time frame of relevance for this scheme. All of Senator Conroy’s figures, all of his assertions and all of his pointed suggestions to senators from different states around this chamber this evening are completely and utterly irrelevant because they relate to a time frame that is not associated with the enhanced dental program that we are talking about here today.
Since this scheme went through its process of disallowance earlier in the year, the reaction that I have had from all over Australia to the importance of this scheme has been quite extraordinary. I had a phone call from an elderly citizen in the electorate of Robertson who actually got into the dentist’s chair only to be told that the dentist would not treat him because of threats from Minister Roxon about the use of the program. This chamber legitimately disallowed the Medicare item that would remove this initiative. This chamber legitimately went through that process and yet Minister Roxon has actively discouraged doctors and dentists from taking up this program—even though doctors and dentists from all over Australia understand the value and importance of this program. The reaction has been extraordinary.
I received correspondence from a Dr Passmore in Sydney. Senator Conroy talked about this being a scheme for the rich. I am not sure whether or not Senator Conroy is suggesting that Medicare should be means tested—I will leave that for him and the government to respond to. But I thought that the universal access obligation associated with Medicare was one of the things that we were all proud of—that anybody could get access to Medicare. Senator Conroy says that this is a program for the rich. Dr Passmore has two practices in Sydney, one in the more affluent suburbs and one in the western suburbs. He practices 1½ days a week at Granville and has another practice in the Labor electorate of Reid. If this is something that only rich people can access, the real experience of the doctors on the ground is what should be considered. In the time that the scheme has been operating, Dr Passmore has not referred one patient from his practice in Turramurra in the electorate of Bradfield, and yet in the western suburbs he has referred 150 patients—all from those lower socioeconomic areas.
Can I say to you, Mr Acting Deputy President, that we should look at the impact of this scheme. I have pictures here of the sorts of things that are being treated. These pictures are a terrible demonstration of the need for this program. And yet the government, while quite dishonestly going back over four years to quote its statistics, believes that there is no place or need for this particular scheme. What the government would prefer to do is to refer people to the state system, back into those huge queues where there is no capacity. Last time I spoke to the department about this at estimates, and even in some documentation I have seen since, the government was still negotiating this initiative with the states. It had no idea how this was going to work. The department could shed no light on how the scheme was going to work and how it would integrate into the existing schemes that operate within the states. It had no idea. The government talks about the opposition stopping the initiative from being brought forward. I have not seen any legislation. I have not heard of any draft legislation. There is nothing on the Notice Paper for the House of Representatives.
All the government is doing is trying to throw up a smokescreen for a failure that it has had in a thought bubble that it put up before the election. The reaction around the country from doctors and from the oral health association has been quite extraordinary in relation to this particular program. I do not think any of us realised what was going on. The allegation from the government is that all the effort was being put into New South Wales and none into any of the other states. But the government has made absolutely no effort at all to let people know this program is there—in fact, quite the opposite; the minister has written threatening letters to dentists suggesting that they not participate in this process because the program is going to end and so there is no benefit in a referral. Yet when you look at what this program can provide to a patient versus what the government’s program can provide to a patient the comparison is quite stark.
The Commonwealth Dental Health Program is estimated at $14.63 per person for those eligible, whereas the program the government want to remove provides $2,165 of dental support per annum over two years. So you just cannot compare the programs. It is quite clear that this program has real relevance. Even in the previous debate we had as part of the disallowance motion, government senators said there needed to be a broad suite of measures as part of this program to look after dental services in the country. We said at the time that this was part of that broad suite. We do not have any problem with the government bringing in their Commonwealth Dental Health Program. We think that is quite legitimate. We think it was quite dishonest of them to say before the election that they were going to spend $800 million and then after the election underspend that by $150 million—and then come in here and blame us for being ‘financially irresponsible’. They are the ones who cannot meet their election campaign commitments. They do not seem to have any remorse in respect of that. As far as they are concerned, as long as the program is being met they are doing the job. But the clear commitment in their election policies was for $800 million. That was confirmed in a statement from the now minister’s office prior to the election.
So I think the government have got a bit of a nerve coming back in here trying to reverse this process. I really do. They talk about the will of the parliament. They talk about evidence based policy. Well, the evidence is that this program has doubled in numbers of participants almost every month since it started. The government talk about a failed system, a system that is hard to access. But they quite dishonestly talk about four years that are not relevant to the current debate. So not only are all of their arguments basically completely without foundation as far as what we are talking about here this afternoon goes but also it is quite dishonest to come in here and say that this program has failed. It is obviously a successful program. It is obviously greatly needed. If you look at the pictures that have been provided to me of people who need assistance under this program, you see that it is quite clear that this program should remain in place. The government have $150 million up their sleeve to spend to maintain their dental promises over three years—not the $780 million over four or five years that they talk about, which is their budget allocation. They ought to keep their election promises. They ought to work with the parliament to see this scheme stay in place. The opposition retains its position with respect to the enhanced Medicare dental scheme because it believes that it has a real role to play in the dental care of Australians. We will not be supporting the motion.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH INSURANCE (DENTAL SERVICES) AMENDMENT AND REPEAL DETERMINATION 2008</title>,<title>Motion for Disallowance</title>,Motions,26,1,speech
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2008-09-16,"—The Greens will not be supporting this motion either. We are deeply concerned about the dental health of Australians and deeply concerned about a dental program that is now proving to be effective. The Greens are well aware that it was not as effective before as it became in November, when the threshold went up over two years to nearly $4,500. That meant that many people could access dental treatment for the first time. Many people for the first time ever were finally able to access dental treatment. These are people who are suffering from chronic illness and this dental treatment made and is making a very significant impact on their lives. I will read through a few stories shortly.
The Greens position, as the Minister for Health and Ageing quite correctly pointed out in the media today, has for a very long time been one of support for a Commonwealth dental scheme. There is absolutely no doubt about that. Just as the Greens very strongly support a universal public health scheme, so do we support some sort of universal dental plan. However, we would like to point out that the program that we are now talking about getting rid of, dentistry is for the first time part of mainstream health and funded under Medicare. Therefore, this actually meets a key part of Greens policy. So, far from the Greens now voting against their policy, we are actually supporting a key part of our policy—to fund dental services through Medicare.
The government said to the Greens that it is one or the other. The Minister representing the Minister for Health and Ageing here today said, ‘If you do not support this motion we are not going to be able to fund our Commonwealth dental health program, so we will have to cut this other funding program.’ It is not the Greens fault that the government has decided to invest $31 billion worth of surplus money into tax cuts. The government made the decision, so do not try to shoot it home to the Greens—thank you very much—that we are the ones that are going to be doing in the Commonwealth dental health plan. You did it in yourselves by deciding that you were going to provide $31 billion in tax cuts and to, unwisely, cut into this country’s surplus. I agree that money should be invested into dental health outcomes for Australians and particularly for those low-income Australians who cannot afford adequate dental health cover and who have never or very rarely been able to access dental health services. Don’t come back and blame the Greens for your bad decisions. It is very disingenuous. The Greens are very well aware of our dental policy and we do not need to be reminded of that by the government, thank you very much.
This program is helping thousands of Australians who have been accessing these health services, in some cases for the first time. The numbers accessing the services have doubled, as Senator Colbeck said. When the minister for health first announced these changes earlier in the year, she said that the program had failed. That word has been used here tonight and it has been used in the media—the scheme was failing and had not been providing proper support. In the past, it had not been. But the numbers that we have been provided show that, since November, there has been a doubling in the uptake of this program and that over 640 services have been provided to the chronically ill.
I must point out here that the accusation has also been made that this is for rich people—that it is not means tested. The Greens position is, as I have said, that we have a universal health system, so of course we do not agree that it should be means tested. We have done a lot of consultation on this. I acknowledge that we voted differently last time but since then we have carried out a lot of consultation. We have talked to a lot of patients, dentists and doctors who have very clearly pointed out that it is low-income people who have been accessing these services.
May I just ask members in the chamber how many wealthy people who have chronic illness they see running around with bad teeth? I tell you what: dental pain is one of the worst pains you can deal with. People talk about it being one of the most shameful things that they have to deal with. It affects your whole life. So, if you can afford it, you go and get it fixed. The people that have been accessing these services are overwhelmingly those that cannot afford these services.
Dr Passmore told us that he participates in two practices, one in a wealthy suburb and one in a non-wealthy suburb, and that the people in the non-wealthy suburb are the people who have been accessing his services. It was also pointed out that some states have not been accessing these services as much as New South Wales but  it would be interesting to know how they have been promoted and whether doctors have been particularly focused on this issue in New South Wales. That there is an overburden of people with chronic illness in New South Wales who have dental problems is quite obvious. The reason may be that New South Wales is not investing enough in dental services; however, to make the chronically ill and the people who can least afford it carry that can is not fair either. Yes, state and territory governments need to be fixing that, but do not expect the chronically ill to pay for it literally through their teeth.
There are already 650,000 people on waiting lists. The people who would be able to access these services are now going to be forced back onto those waiting lists. We have been told tonight that the new system is going to fund 995,000 services, yet there are 655,000 people already on the waiting lists. So the people who urgently need this dental work will be forced back onto the waiting lists and will not be able to access the most immediate remedies that they need and which they can actually access now through this program.
There is also a dispute about how many people have already been to their GP, have been referred, who should have been receiving treatment and have not been able to receive treatment because we did not know whether the program was stopping or starting. One of my staffers rang up Medicare for some advice and got two different answers. If a person who is usually pretty good at working their way through the system got two different answers, I suspect that Australian punters out there who have been ringing up to try and work their way through the maze will also have had different answers. I suspect, too, that GPs and dentists have. I do not think it is true to say that people knew what was going on. To say that Aboriginal people have not been accessing it is partly true—I have seen the figures; I know they are not accessing it as much—but I have also taken the trouble to speak to a dentist who is working in a remote community and was told that, as we all know, dental services are stretched in remote communities for various reasons, including unfamiliarity with some of the Medicare administration requirements. Dentists up there have only just started making use of this provision and it was around the same time, unfortunately, that the minister announced it was being withdrawn.
That dentist spoke of people’s shame—Aboriginal people suffer the same shame that non-Aboriginal people do when they have bad teeth. When they are having their front teeth in particular extracted, they will not smile. He said that this program had just started to be taken up and had just started to make a difference. He was dismayed at the ending of the scheme because he thought that it was a good way of delivering a service to Aboriginal people in remote communities.
If one of the reasons that the figures are skewed is that the information on service provision has not been good or people have not been able to access the information, you do not then cut the service. Surely, you improve the information available to dentists, to doctors and to the community about the service, which is, as I have said, highly valued by the community. My office has been overwhelmed by the number of people who have contacted us to tell us their stories and how much this program has meant to them. They have told us what a difference it has made to their lives, to their wellbeing, to their self-respect and in some instances to them being able to get a job because they have felt so bad about their dental problems that they have not felt confident enough to participate in the workforce. The service has multiple impacts on people.
I think every member of the Senate has received the photos that show absolutely what this program means to people. My office received a phone call today from a lady in very tragic circumstances. She is suffering from cancer and I am not going to go through the whole story. She was dismayed when she found out that she probably was not going to be able to access the service. Now she is not going to be able to get the funding she needs to do some very important dental work that would mean a difference between a good quality of life and an extremely poor quality of life for her.
We heard of another example of people who were suffering from chronic hepatitis C, who were unable to eat the more nutritious food that they needed because of their poor dental health. Instead of eating soft food, which is more likely to be high in sugar and fat and which only adds to their chronic illness, if they were able to access this sort of program, it would greatly assist them in terms of their quality of life and their health outcomes.
If this program disappears, these people will go back onto waiting lists and their conditions will worsen. For example, a person suffering from a severe iron deficiency was told to increase his consumption of red meat. He was unable to do so because he could not chew due to his rotten teeth. By the time he finally got to see a dentist under the scheme, all his remaining teeth had to be removed and he was provided with false teeth. That is what happens when you are stuck on waiting lists. The problem gets worse and worse.
The Commonwealth dental health plan, which is what the government said they want to replace this service with, was supposed to begin on 1 July. It did not. It is dependent on funding agreements with the states, and these are to be signed in the very near future, but that has not happened yet. If the scheme is withdrawn now, people who are currently receiving treatment will have nowhere to go. Even if they have somewhere to go at the moment, they will go onto waiting lists, and the funding that is available for those services is not going to provide the sort of care that they need and which they can receive under the current program to deal with the extent of their problems.
I am not here by any stretch of the imagination defending the coalition, because I do not agree with a lot of their health policy plans, so I do not want anyone running away with that wild idea. However, this program was a good program. It is genuinely helping people who are suffering, who have chronic illnesses and who have poor dental health. They need support. I am not about to support a motion that cuts off that little support. It is quite obvious that it is fulfilling a desperate need out there. The doubling of the use of the service in that short space of time says there is a big need out there.
Yes, the Greens support a Commonwealth dental health scheme, but not at the expense of those people who are currently receiving much needed support. Funding has been cut to public dental services and the states have not been performing properly, but I say again that you do not then inflict that pain on low-income workers—on the people who have the least capacity to pay. It is the wealthy people who have the capacity to pay; low-income people do not have the capacity to pay. If we support this motion to rescind the disallowance of the dental services determination, the minister would whip in another instrument to get rid of this program. It would not immediately be replaced with a Commonwealth dental scheme as they say. The time frame is quite loose on that and there is absolutely no guarantee that the people who are currently being treated under this scheme or who would be eligible to be treated under this scheme will be able to be treated in a timely manner that deals with their problems and symptoms immediately under the new scheme.
The government need to come back with a better funding proposal for their dental scheme. They need to show the Greens how they are going to properly look after the people who currently are able to access treatment under this scheme, which is proving extremely valuable and worth while and delivering results to thousands of Australians. They need to show us how these people can be treated and also how they are going to get their Commonwealth dental plan up.
Don’t dare blame the Greens if the government decide they are not going to fund their Commonwealth dental plan. When they announced those tax cuts, they made a decision about how they were going to spend that money. Australia can afford both—don’t you try to tell me that we cannot. We can. We are a caring society and we can afford both.

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",IND,2008-09-16,"—Can I say firstly I think the questions put by Senator Siewert towards the end of her contribution are very relevant ones and they deserve a comprehensive and considered answer from the government. I rise to speak briefly on this motion. The previous government’s dental scheme relied on the referral of patients by GPs so that dental services could be accessed through Medicare according to demand. This plan cost $490 million and due to its reliance on Medicare requires a disallowance by this house. The Rudd government wishes to replace this scheme with two new schemes, the Commonwealth Dental Health Program and the Medicare Teen Dental Plan, at a cost of $780 million. The funding for this was factored into the last federal budget on the assumption that the funding for the previous scheme would be stopped—and I note the question by Senator Siewert: why can’t we fund both? That is a reasonable question. It is a question I have posed to the government.
However, I note that the previous scheme was poorly accessed in most states, with my home state of South Australia receiving only 2.8 per cent of the funding. I have had an email from a ministerial adviser to the Minister for Health in South Australia. The minister’s office asserts in that email that, on the basis of the available figures, South Australian patients comprised 1,256 out of the 44,774 patients who accessed the chronic disease dental scheme from 1 November 2007 to 31 July 2008. That is about a 2.8 per cent share of the national total, compared to the 8.7 per cent which South Australia will receive under the Commonwealth Dental Health Program. The minister’s office also says that total benefits provided to SA patients under the old scheme amounted to $2.5 million from 1 November 2007 to 31 July 2008. This is a 2.4 per cent share of the total expenditure, compared with $24.7 million which SA will receive under the Commonwealth government’s proposed scheme. The office goes on to state that, in comparison with the former scheme, the new scheme will provide for 85,600 visits over three years, which will see dental waiting times reduce from around 19 months now to about 12 months. That is the position of the South Australian government. Anyone who knows about my relationship with the South Australian government could never accuse me of being a spruiker for that government, but I think it is a fair point that has been made by the minister’s office. I have taken that into consideration insofar as it impacts on the citizens of South Australia.
It seems to me the dilemma is that the government is not prepared to fund the chronic dental scheme and so what do you do with the available resources? That is my concern, although I think Senator Siewert’s question as to why we cannot fund both is one that must be answered by the government. I see benefit in the proposed new dental scheme that the government wants to implement, and that will be a good thing for South Australians. But I also note the concern that those with a chronic dental problem will no longer be able to access this scheme on the basis of the government’s position.
By the government’s own admission, thousands of people with chronic dental needs who are currently receiving assistance under the old scheme will miss out under the new scheme because they do not qualify for concession cards. That is obviously a real concern. Anyone who has had to wait longer than a day for an appointment with a dentist to treat something as minor as a toothache or a minor chip will appreciate how distressing dental pain can be. If we then consider those suffering chronic dental pain, and how chronic pain dominates all aspects of one’s life, it is not acceptable that these people be deserted to suffer. It is not acceptable for those currently receiving support or those on the cusp of the concession card threshold to be suddenly facing huge dental bills. It is a case where we should not be robbing Peter to pay for Paul’s teeth.
I can say that I have had some very useful discussions with the minister and the minister’s office, and I appreciate that. I have sought further information as to the extent to which like-for-like treatments could be funded in South Australia for chronic dental conditions in relation to the proposed new scheme that is currently in abeyance. I have also sought information on how many South Australians with chronic dental needs would lose out due to these changes and how many new treatments would be afforded for like-for-like treatments. I accept in good faith that the government will be providing me with those details in due course. However, I think there are some legitimate concerns raised by the opposition and by the Greens about this. I think more needs to be done to convince me that this is the way to go. So, on balance, I cannot support the government’s position on this, but I look forward to further discussions and perhaps a further commitment from the government in relation to the matters of concern that have been raised in the course of this debate.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH INSURANCE (DENTAL SERVICES) AMENDMENT AND REPEAL DETERMINATION 2008</title>,<title>Motion for Disallowance</title>,Motions,26,1,speech
"Fielding, Sen Steve",FFP,2008-09-16,"—Regrettably, the government has made this debate a choice between one dental health program and another. That makes it an enormously difficult decision because both the Rudd government’s Commonwealth Dental Health Program and the previous government’s Allied Health and Dental Care Initiative have merit. One helps people with chronic disease with their dental problems, while the proposed new government scheme helps with reducing dental waiting lists. If you look at both of those you think, ‘Gee, they are both pretty important things.’ And when you look to see which one has more merit than the other, there are arguments for going both ways.
We have been in discussion with the minister and we are aware that there are winners and losers, which is unfortunate with this particular issue. Dental services in Australia have been mammothly underfunded for many years. People have been suffering while governments dither about providing enough money and resources to fully tackle this problem. There are more than 480,000 people waiting for public dental care, with waiting times averaging between one and 1½ years. There are reports that some patients have waited for 10 years to see a dentist. I will say that again—there are 480,000 people, and some of them have been waiting for 10 years to see a dentist. That is in Australia—it is not another country; it is in Australia—and that is a disgrace. And here we are today, squabbling and saying that you can have one and not the other.
We have had a lot people contact our office on this issue. There are strong merits for both schemes. The Rudd government’s proposal to put money into the dental system will see a reduction in the waiting lists. It is nowhere near enough money, but I do not think that anyone in this place would deny that the Rudd government’s system would reduce the waiting lists. It has also become clear that the previous government’s scheme, the chronic disease dental scheme, was actually serving a need for Australians who have debilitating chronic dental needs. We could say that we could let go of the chronic disease dental scheme if the new proposal by the Rudd government would help those people with chronic dental diseases. We have sought some assurances from the minister about priorities being given to people on the chronic disease lists and we have had an assurance that the needs of people with chronic dental diseases would be factored into the waiting lists.
I am swayed both ways but, at the end of the day, I think there is enough money in the system to allow both schemes to run. That is the conclusion that Family First has come to, and it has not come to it lightly, frankly. I think both systems have merit and both seem to address different issues. Ultimately I really believe that Family First would continue to seek the continuation of both. If the government wants to force us into choosing one or the other, I think that they are going to find that we will hold onto the chronic disease scheme now and see whether the government can put more money into the system. There is money there and they can put it in if they want to. It is a choice that they can turn back on themselves; it is a choice that they can make as to whether they actually do something about the waiting lists. But I think the needs in the chronic disease area are also real. I would just say that dental services in Australia have been mammothly underfunded collectively and we need to work out how we can have both. With the resources we have in Australia, I think we can have both.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH INSURANCE (DENTAL SERVICES) AMENDMENT AND REPEAL DETERMINATION 2008</title>,<title>Motion for Disallowance</title>,Motions,26,1,speech
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2008-09-16,"—I will take the opportunity to close the debate on this matter. This afternoon we have heard contributions from a range of senators in this place. One of the issues I want to address is that raised by the theme that went through all of the debates—that there is a need to address the dental issues in the Australian population. Those needs have not been addressed by the Liberals in the last 11 years. They did not take the matter seriously. In fact, in 1996, they withdrew substantial moneys from the system. We now have a view, expressed at least between the minors and the Greens, that the issue does need to be addressed.
Prior to the election of the Rudd government we took a responsible position by making it perfectly clear that we would abolish the former Howard government’s poorly targeted and failing chronic disease dental scheme. It was not working. It was not providing the benefits that people should have received. What it was doing was targeting those who would otherwise not need the service. For those who did need the service, such as pensioners and people on concession cards, it was not adequately, and in some cases not at all, addressing their dental needs. We had a clear choice that we took to the election, which was either a scheme that the Labor minister for health had put forward or a scheme that the former government had maintained. And the choice was made. The public chose in favour of Labor’s better targeted dental programs. The choice was necessary to maintain our budget surplus, and it is clear that that is still facing this Senate.
In a perfect world we might all be able to give everyone perfect outcomes. This is not a perfect world. There are choices that need to be made and there are tough decisions in tough economic times that need to be made. The Rudd government has put forward a perfectly proper process. Prior to the election it took an economically responsible path to maintain both a strong budget surplus and make tough choices. It did not take the easy way out of promising everybody an outcome. You cannot do that because all you are then doing is contributing to blowing out a multibillion dollar hole in the budget. The Charter of Budget Honesty provided a system where we would be costing our election promises and, having done so, it then provided the way forward where we could say that these included savings from the Liberal’s failed scheme in order to pay for Labor’s better policies. That is the process we took forward. Our commitment, compared to the previous government’s record of ripping $100 million a year from public dental services and leaving 650,000 people languishing on public dental waiting lists, was a clear vote at the last election for Labor’s policies.
We are now in the process of ensuring that we can proceed with ours while shutting down theirs. So, in response to Senator Xenophon’s arguments about some of the process issues around our scheme, we are happy to engage with senators in respect of the detail of how our program will be rolled out. What we are doing today is shutting down the existing scheme. It is not economically sensible to try to maintain both schemes. It was not what we tried to do before the election. We made that clear. The public made a choice about that. We then ensured that at the first opportunity we would roll out our new scheme and, of course, the savings from the existing scheme to be closed down would be used to fund election commitments. Why? It was to maintain a proper surplus of $22 billion to ensure that we could be responsible economic managers and also address the dire needs of those people who need dental assistance. To do that through our programs, which are targeted and designed to assist those people who need assistance, is the Labor way. It is the Rudd government’s way to ensure that we have the proper outcome. It is not about waving a magic wand, unfortunately, and hoping that everybody can benefit with the two schemes still running. That is not the position we are in. We have before us today the opportunity to shut one system down and give the Rudd government the opportunity to roll out its scheme to address dental issues that exist in the community and to start to target it to those people who are in need. That is the position we are now in.
In terms of the arguments that have occurred in this chamber, the main one from the opposition was held during the election campaign. Senator Conroy earlier this afternoon went through the reasons why their program was in dire need of closing, and still needs to be closed down. It had failed abysmally. It had also been wrongly targeted and it allowed people to gain access to a system that they did not need because they could afford it themselves. It is a program that needs to be closed down and it needs the Senate to do so. It can only be done through this system that we have before us. When you look at the Liberal’s chronic disease dental scheme, you see that it was highly skewed, with many states receiving far less than a fair population share. One in five concession card holders lived in Queensland—18.9 per cent—but it only received 4.4 per cent of benefits under the chronic disease scheme. That is just one example of the scheme that the Senate will maintain if it does not support Labor’s position. To continue that scheme would be unfair and unjust for those people. The money could be better spent being targeted by Labor’s proposal.
This government does not have a magic wand to wave around and say, ‘We can maintain all of the schemes; we can maintain all of the programs of the Liberal government.’ To do that would not recognise that in truth there was a change at the election. There was a change for the better. The population voted for the Rudd government’s plans not only in dental care but in health and a whole range of other programs. The opposition are stalling in respect of this matter. They have to accept that we do have a mandate in this issue and we should be allowed to get on with managing these schemes. The opposition can take the opportunity to be critical of our scheme but they should support our mandate to allow us to govern and to provide the outcomes that we said we would, to provide the election commitments that we said we would and to provide the savings to maintain the strong surplus that we said we would. I was not going to take up much time in respect of this matter. It is coming up to the time for another debate to occur. On those words, I urge the Senate to close down the existing Liberal scheme.
Question put:
That the motion (Senator Conroy’s) be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH INSURANCE (DENTAL SERVICES) AMENDMENT AND REPEAL DETERMINATION 2008</title>,<title>Motion for Disallowance</title>,Motions,26,1,speech
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2008-09-16,"—I move:
That, for the purposes of paragraph 48(1)(a) of the Legislative Instruments Act 2003, the Senate rescinds its resolution of 19 June 2008 disallowing the Health Insurance (Dental Services) Amendment and Repeal Determination 2008, made under subsection 3C(1) of the Health Insurance Act 1973.
During the election last year we announced we would be delivering a $290 million Commonwealth Dental Health Program to help reduce public dental waiting lists that had blown out to 650,000 across the country. We also announced that we would be delivering the Medicare Teen Dental Plan, which will involve an investment of $490 million. This means that we would be investing, in total, $780 million over the next four years in dental health—compared to the previous government, which spent less than $4 million on dental health over the four years until the 2007 election. So that is $780 million over four years compared to $4 million over four years.
At the same time we made it absolutely clear that we would abolish the Howard government’s poorly targeted and failing chronic disease dental scheme. We were entirely open about our policies. We made it clear that in order to fund our dental program we would have to redirect funding from the Liberal scheme to the Labor scheme—not unreasonable, given we won the election. We had made a choice, and so did the public. They chose in favour of Labor’s better targeted dental programs. That choice was necessary to maintain our budget surplus, and that is the clear choice now facing the Senate.
Today’s motion will decide whether the government can implement the dental policies which the Australian public voted for or whether the government will have to suspend its investment in public dental services because of the economic vandalism of those in the opposition. The motion will decide whether the government can provide a million more dental consultations and treatments for needy Australians, especially pensioners and concession card holders, or whether these people will continue to languish on public dental waiting lists because of the opposition’s irresponsible approach.
It has been estimated that there are about 650,000 Australians languishing on public dental waiting lists. Thirty per cent of Australians are reported to have avoided dental care due to the cost of services. Fifty thousand people each year end up in hospital with preventable dental conditions, putting more pressure on our hospitals. Tooth decay is Australia’s most prevalent health problem, with gum disease ranking as the fifth highest. Over a quarter of the Australian adult population have untreated dental decay—untreated because they are not accessing the dental care they require.
This alarming state of affairs is even worse amongst the poorer, most needy Australians. Concession card holders such as pensioners have lost on average 3.5 more teeth than non-concession card holders. As the member for North Sydney himself said, under the Liberal government things had got to the point where:
Dentistry remains out of reach to those on low incomes with around 30 percent of Australians unable to see a dentist because of cost.
That quote is from 6 March of this year by the member for North Sydney. It is clear from these terrible facts that we need action on dental health, particularly for disadvantaged Australians, such as pensioners.
Rather than addressing these problems, the Howard government spent much of the past decade cynically playing the blame game. They did nothing but say, ‘Dental health is not our responsibility; blame the states.’ But it was the Howard government that helped create some of these problems in the first place. One of their first acts of government was to scrap Labor’s Commonwealth Dental Health Program in 1996. They ripped $100 million a year from Australia’s public dental system and this led to the explosion in public dental waiting lists which we see today. Six hundred and fifty thousand people waited, sometimes for years, for treatment. Then, belatedly, the Howard government introduced a dental scheme which was not targeted at people most in financial need and which had a referral process and eligibility criteria so complex and restrictive that few people could access it.
The previous government’s failed chronic disease dental scheme deserves a little bit more scrutiny. Labor recognises that, for those able to navigate their way through the complicated referral process and the red tape, the former government’s chronic disease dental scheme offered some help. But many people missed out—often the most needy people in our community. For example, in the four years up to 31 July 2008, under the Liberals’ chronic disease dental scheme no-one under the age of 30 received any services in the Northern Territory, despite it having some of Australia’s most needy Indigenous communities. This is a fact. No-one under the age of 15 has received any services in South Australia. This means that no child born in South Australia or the Northern Territory during the term of the Howard government received any help from the scheme. Only three people under the age of 20 received any services in Tasmania, Senator Colbeck, under the previous government’s scheme. Only nine people under the age of 25 received any services in Western Australia—and I am looking at a Western Australian senator as I am speaking—under the previous government’s program. Only 21 people under the age of 10 received any services in my own home state of Victoria. That is, on average, less than one person every two months.
Moreover, the former government’s scheme was not targeted at the most disadvantaged, such as pensioners and concession card holders. Under the Liberal scheme, a multimillionaire could get help but a pensioner with a toothache could not. Under the Liberal scheme, if you were a pensioner and you had a toothache, how much help do you think you could get? The answer is none. If you were a pensioner and needed a tooth extracted, how much help could you get? That is right—none. If you were a pensioner in any part of Australia and needed a simple filling to save a tooth, how much help could you get? That is right again—none.
In addition, take-up of the Liberals’ chronic disease dental scheme has been highly skewed, with many states receiving far less than a fair population share. While one in five concession card holders live in Queensland, about 18.9 per cent, it has received only 4.4 per cent of benefits under the chronic disease dental scheme. While one in 11 concession card holders live in South Australia, about 8.9 per cent, it has received only 2.5 per cent of benefits. Again to my colleague from Western Australia, while one in 12 concession card holders live in Western Australia, about 8.5 per cent, it has received only 0.7 per cent—less than one per cent—of benefits for necessary care. While three per cent of concession card holders live in Tasmania, Senator Colbeck, it has received only 0.3 per cent—less than half of one per cent—of benefits.
These figures show clearly that the Liberals’ chronic disease dental scheme has failed. It has failed pensioners, it has failed the poorest, most disadvantaged people in our community with the worst dental health and it has failed our kids and our teenagers. It has failed to help them maintain their teeth to prevent much worse problems later on in life. That is why the government is seeking to redirect funds from the Liberals’ failed program to support better-targeted dental programs, such as the Commonwealth Dental Health Program and the Medicare Teen Dental Plan.
We have made a decision—as governments need to—that we should be helping the most needy people in our community first in the most effective way possible. But, thanks to the economic vandalism and irresponsibility of the opposition, Labor’s more targeted approach is being put at risk. In particular, if the motion before the Senate fails, the government will have to suspend implementation of the Commonwealth Dental Health Program. A million additional dental consultation and treatment services will not be able to be provided—one million services that would benefit pensioners and concession card holders.
If the opposition gets its way, every state and territory would miss out on the additional services and investment in public dental services they would receive under the CDHP. The Liberals are clearly returning to form. They ripped $100 million a year from public dental services when they were elected in 1996 and they still want to block the Rudd government from any further investment in public dental care. This means that every state and territory is at risk of missing out on more dental services. If the Senate blocks the government’s motion, pensioners and concession card holders will miss out on a range of benefits under the CDHP.
States and territories would receive considerably more under Labor’s CDHP than they received over the last four years to 31 July 2008 under the Liberals’ failed scheme. I will go through those figures because I noted your earlier interjection. Victoria—my home state—would receive 3.7 times more funding; Queensland would receive 11 times more funding; South Australia would receive 10 times more funding and—the Western Australian senators should be very conscious of this fact—Western Australia would receive 35 times more; Tasmania would receive 38 times more funds from our scheme than the existing scheme; and the Northern Territory—and I know there are Northern Territory senators present as well today—would receive 174 times more money from our scheme than from the existing scheme.
About 6.6 million people as concession card holders would be eligible for treatment under the CDHP. About 4.3 million of these people are pensioner concession card holders and their dependants. This compares to the Liberals chronic disease dental scheme, which is not targeted to concession card holders. Only about 1.1 million people meet the complex eligibility requirements of the Liberals’ scheme.
The CDHP has a number of priority areas: people with dental related chronic diseases, Indigenous Australians and preschool children aged zero to four years. The CDHP priorities for people with dental related chronic disease includes people with cancer, transplant patients, cardiac patients and people with HIV-AIDS. So it is simply untrue for Senator Colbeck to claim, as he has done, that the CDHP will not benefit people with chronic disease. It is simply not true, Senator Colbeck. The Liberals’ chronic disease dental scheme has also had little benefit in particular for Indigenous Australians and children, with no young people at all up to the age of 14 receiving services in South Australia or the Northern Territory over four years.
The CDHP includes a number of initiatives to support and expand the dental workforce, including the establishment of new public dental clinics, improved training for dentists and fly-in fly-out services to remote areas. The Liberals’ chronic disease dental program does not include any funding for workforce or rural initiatives. There is no funding for rural initiatives under your scheme. All of these initiatives which will help pensioners, people with chronic diseases, children and Indigenous Australians will not be able to be implemented if the Senate supports the opposition’s politically opportunistic and irresponsible approach.
The opposition is demonstrating its economic irresponsibility in its claim that you can have it both ways and keep both the Liberal’s failed dental scheme and Labor’s better targeted policies. The Rudd government is committed to economic responsibility. That means we will have to maintain a strong budget surplus and make tough choices. The Liberal opposition is blowing a multi-billion-dollar hole in the budget. The Charter of Budget Honesty costings which Labor took to the election are consistent with what the government is doing and include savings from closing the Liberals’ failed scheme in order to pay for Labor’s better policies. Compare our commitments to the previous government’s record of ripping $100 million a year from public dental services and leaving 650,000 people to languish on public dental waiting lists.
It is a very clear choice today in this chamber whether or not you want to stick with a policy that is untargeted and failing or go for a targeted expansion in dental health care in this country. I urge senators, particularly those from the smaller states, to listen to those statistics that I described and understand exactly where your ideological binge is getting you to. You are going to be denying, massively, your own state populations if you vote to keep the existing scheme and not implement Labor’s.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH INSURANCE (DENTAL SERVICES) AMENDMENT AND REPEAL DETERMINATION 2008</title>,<title>Rescission</title>,Motions,26,2,speech
"Colbeck, Sen Richard",LP,2008-09-16,"—Senator Conroy’s presentation here this afternoon demonstrates what happens when someone comes into the chamber not knowing anything about what they are talking about. In fact, it was one of the most embarrassing performances I have seen here for quite some time, because Senator Conroy does not even understand his government’s own election promises. The figures that he provided to the chamber before—and he might like to get up and clear up his misrepresentation of those election promises to the Senate later on—are not the figures that are in their election policies. In fact, I have spent quite a deal of time interrogating the Labor Party’s election policies through the estimates process, and his numbers are just plain wrong.
The government talked about $290 million for the Commonwealth Dental Health Program over three years, not over four years as Senator Conroy has just told the Senate, and, according to the government’s election promises, the Teen Dental Plan was for $510 million over three years. So the figure that he quotes is what has actually been appropriated by the government since the election, not what they promised the Australian people they would spend before the election.
When the election promises went through the Charter of Budget Honesty—and I notice Senator Conroy has now left the chamber—via the Department of Finance and Deregulation, the teen dental program was costed down from $510 million to $326 million. It was then re-announced at $340 million and has been finally costed in the budget at $360 million over three years, the fourth figure we have had since the initial election promise was made. If you go back to how much the Labor Party promised the Australian people they would spend on dental programs at the election, it was $800 million over three years. Their commitments are actually $150 million short of what they promised they would spend. If you go back and do the numbers, that expenditure is $150 million short of what they promised the Australian people at the election.
For them to come in here now and tell us that we are stopping them from implementing a program because of the funding is an absolute absurdity, because they are the ones who have not kept their promise to the Australian people to spend $800 million. Minister Roxon’s spokesperson said before the election when questioned on the costing of the election promises that the government would spend $800 million. That needs to be clear to start with. The commitment was to spend $800 million and, at this point in time, over the term of the parliament they are $150 million short. That immediately kills off any suggestion that any action of the opposition is irresponsible financially, because Senator Conroy has come in here with a set of speaking notes that do not represent the true facts with respect to the government’s election policies.
His comments about the program over the last four years are also deceptive, misleading and dishonest. The enhanced dental scheme that the government is seeking to disallow as part of the removal of this Medicare item only came into effect in November 2007. For Senator Conroy to come in here and quote figures over four years is completely and utterly dishonest. By going back four years, he renders his quotes completely irrelevant because they bear absolutely no resemblance to what has happened since the program was enhanced post the budget last year and taking effect in November 2007. So Senator Conroy can come in here and quote figures from four years ago all he likes, but they bear absolutely no relevance whatsoever to this debate. The figures should be targeted at what has happened within this scheme over the last eight or nine months—since November last year is the time frame of relevance for this scheme. All of Senator Conroy’s figures, all of his assertions and all of his pointed suggestions to senators from different states around this chamber this evening are completely and utterly irrelevant because they relate to a time frame that is not associated with the enhanced dental program that we are talking about here today.
Since this scheme went through its process of disallowance earlier in the year, the reaction that I have had from all over Australia to the importance of this scheme has been quite extraordinary. I had a phone call from an elderly citizen in the electorate of Robertson who actually got into the dentist’s chair only to be told that the dentist would not treat him because of threats from Minister Roxon about the use of the program. This chamber legitimately disallowed the Medicare item that would remove this initiative. This chamber legitimately went through that process and yet Minister Roxon has actively discouraged doctors and dentists from taking up this program—even though doctors and dentists from all over Australia understand the value and importance of this program. The reaction has been extraordinary.
I received correspondence from a Dr Passmore in Sydney. Senator Conroy talked about this being a scheme for the rich. I am not sure whether or not Senator Conroy is suggesting that Medicare should be means tested—I will leave that for him and the government to respond to. But I thought that the universal access obligation associated with Medicare was one of the things that we were all proud of—that anybody could get access to Medicare. Senator Conroy says that this is a program for the rich. Dr Passmore has two practices in Sydney, one in the more affluent suburbs and one in the western suburbs. He practices 1½ days a week at Granville and has another practice in the Labor electorate of Reid. If this is something that only rich people can access, the real experience of the doctors on the ground is what should be considered. In the time that the scheme has been operating, Dr Passmore has not referred one patient from his practice in Turramurra in the electorate of Bradfield, and yet in the western suburbs he has referred 150 patients—all from those lower socioeconomic areas.
Can I say to you, Mr Acting Deputy President, that we should look at the impact of this scheme. I have pictures here of the sorts of things that are being treated. These pictures are a terrible demonstration of the need for this program. And yet the government, while quite dishonestly going back over four years to quote its statistics, believes that there is no place or need for this particular scheme. What the government would prefer to do is to refer people to the state system, back into those huge queues where there is no capacity. Last time I spoke to the department about this at estimates, and even in some documentation I have seen since, the government was still negotiating this initiative with the states. It had no idea how this was going to work. The department could shed no light on how the scheme was going to work and how it would integrate into the existing schemes that operate within the states. It had no idea. The government talks about the opposition stopping the initiative from being brought forward. I have not seen any legislation. I have not heard of any draft legislation. There is nothing on the Notice Paper for the House of Representatives.
All the government is doing is trying to throw up a smokescreen for a failure that it has had in a thought bubble that it put up before the election. The reaction around the country from doctors and from the oral health association has been quite extraordinary in relation to this particular program. I do not think any of us realised what was going on. The allegation from the government is that all the effort was being put into New South Wales and none into any of the other states. But the government has made absolutely no effort at all to let people know this program is there—in fact, quite the opposite; the minister has written threatening letters to dentists suggesting that they not participate in this process because the program is going to end and so there is no benefit in a referral. Yet when you look at what this program can provide to a patient versus what the government’s program can provide to a patient the comparison is quite stark.
The Commonwealth Dental Health Program is estimated at $14.63 per person for those eligible, whereas the program the government want to remove provides $2,165 of dental support per annum over two years. So you just cannot compare the programs. It is quite clear that this program has real relevance. Even in the previous debate we had as part of the disallowance motion, government senators said there needed to be a broad suite of measures as part of this program to look after dental services in the country. We said at the time that this was part of that broad suite. We do not have any problem with the government bringing in their Commonwealth Dental Health Program. We think that is quite legitimate. We think it was quite dishonest of them to say before the election that they were going to spend $800 million and then after the election underspend that by $150 million—and then come in here and blame us for being ‘financially irresponsible’. They are the ones who cannot meet their election campaign commitments. They do not seem to have any remorse in respect of that. As far as they are concerned, as long as the program is being met they are doing the job. But the clear commitment in their election policies was for $800 million. That was confirmed in a statement from the now minister’s office prior to the election.
So I think the government have got a bit of a nerve coming back in here trying to reverse this process. I really do. They talk about the will of the parliament. They talk about evidence based policy. Well, the evidence is that this program has doubled in numbers of participants almost every month since it started. The government talk about a failed system, a system that is hard to access. But they quite dishonestly talk about four years that are not relevant to the current debate. So not only are all of their arguments basically completely without foundation as far as what we are talking about here this afternoon goes but also it is quite dishonest to come in here and say that this program has failed. It is obviously a successful program. It is obviously greatly needed. If you look at the pictures that have been provided to me of people who need assistance under this program, you see that it is quite clear that this program should remain in place. The government have $150 million up their sleeve to spend to maintain their dental promises over three years—not the $780 million over four or five years that they talk about, which is their budget allocation. They ought to keep their election promises. They ought to work with the parliament to see this scheme stay in place. The opposition retains its position with respect to the enhanced Medicare dental scheme because it believes that it has a real role to play in the dental care of Australians. We will not be supporting the motion.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH INSURANCE (DENTAL SERVICES) AMENDMENT AND REPEAL DETERMINATION 2008</title>,<title>Rescission</title>,Motions,26,2,speech
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2008-09-16,"—The Greens will not be supporting this motion either. We are deeply concerned about the dental health of Australians and deeply concerned about a dental program that is now proving to be effective. The Greens are well aware that it was not as effective before as it became in November, when the threshold went up over two years to nearly $4,500. That meant that many people could access dental treatment for the first time. Many people for the first time ever were finally able to access dental treatment. These are people who are suffering from chronic illness and this dental treatment made and is making a very significant impact on their lives. I will read through a few stories shortly.
The Greens position, as the Minister for Health and Ageing quite correctly pointed out in the media today, has for a very long time been one of support for a Commonwealth dental scheme. There is absolutely no doubt about that. Just as the Greens very strongly support a universal public health scheme, so do we support some sort of universal dental plan. However, we would like to point out that the program that we are now talking about getting rid of, dentistry is for the first time part of mainstream health and funded under Medicare. Therefore, this actually meets a key part of Greens policy. So, far from the Greens now voting against their policy, we are actually supporting a key part of our policy—to fund dental services through Medicare.
The government said to the Greens that it is one or the other. The Minister representing the Minister for Health and Ageing here today said, ‘If you do not support this motion we are not going to be able to fund our Commonwealth dental health program, so we will have to cut this other funding program.’ It is not the Greens fault that the government has decided to invest $31 billion worth of surplus money into tax cuts. The government made the decision, so do not try to shoot it home to the Greens—thank you very much—that we are the ones that are going to be doing in the Commonwealth dental health plan. You did it in yourselves by deciding that you were going to provide $31 billion in tax cuts and to, unwisely, cut into this country’s surplus. I agree that money should be invested into dental health outcomes for Australians and particularly for those low-income Australians who cannot afford adequate dental health cover and who have never or very rarely been able to access dental health services. Don’t come back and blame the Greens for your bad decisions. It is very disingenuous. The Greens are very well aware of our dental policy and we do not need to be reminded of that by the government, thank you very much.
This program is helping thousands of Australians who have been accessing these health services, in some cases for the first time. The numbers accessing the services have doubled, as Senator Colbeck said. When the minister for health first announced these changes earlier in the year, she said that the program had failed. That word has been used here tonight and it has been used in the media—the scheme was failing and had not been providing proper support. In the past, it had not been. But the numbers that we have been provided show that, since November, there has been a doubling in the uptake of this program and that over 640 services have been provided to the chronically ill.
I must point out here that the accusation has also been made that this is for rich people—that it is not means tested. The Greens position is, as I have said, that we have a universal health system, so of course we do not agree that it should be means tested. We have done a lot of consultation on this. I acknowledge that we voted differently last time but since then we have carried out a lot of consultation. We have talked to a lot of patients, dentists and doctors who have very clearly pointed out that it is low-income people who have been accessing these services.
May I just ask members in the chamber how many wealthy people who have chronic illness they see running around with bad teeth? I tell you what: dental pain is one of the worst pains you can deal with. People talk about it being one of the most shameful things that they have to deal with. It affects your whole life. So, if you can afford it, you go and get it fixed. The people that have been accessing these services are overwhelmingly those that cannot afford these services.
Dr Passmore told us that he participates in two practices, one in a wealthy suburb and one in a non-wealthy suburb, and that the people in the non-wealthy suburb are the people who have been accessing his services. It was also pointed out that some states have not been accessing these services as much as New South Wales but  it would be interesting to know how they have been promoted and whether doctors have been particularly focused on this issue in New South Wales. That there is an overburden of people with chronic illness in New South Wales who have dental problems is quite obvious. The reason may be that New South Wales is not investing enough in dental services; however, to make the chronically ill and the people who can least afford it carry that can is not fair either. Yes, state and territory governments need to be fixing that, but do not expect the chronically ill to pay for it literally through their teeth.
There are already 650,000 people on waiting lists. The people who would be able to access these services are now going to be forced back onto those waiting lists. We have been told tonight that the new system is going to fund 995,000 services, yet there are 655,000 people already on the waiting lists. So the people who urgently need this dental work will be forced back onto the waiting lists and will not be able to access the most immediate remedies that they need and which they can actually access now through this program.
There is also a dispute about how many people have already been to their GP, have been referred, who should have been receiving treatment and have not been able to receive treatment because we did not know whether the program was stopping or starting. One of my staffers rang up Medicare for some advice and got two different answers. If a person who is usually pretty good at working their way through the system got two different answers, I suspect that Australian punters out there who have been ringing up to try and work their way through the maze will also have had different answers. I suspect, too, that GPs and dentists have. I do not think it is true to say that people knew what was going on. To say that Aboriginal people have not been accessing it is partly true—I have seen the figures; I know they are not accessing it as much—but I have also taken the trouble to speak to a dentist who is working in a remote community and was told that, as we all know, dental services are stretched in remote communities for various reasons, including unfamiliarity with some of the Medicare administration requirements. Dentists up there have only just started making use of this provision and it was around the same time, unfortunately, that the minister announced it was being withdrawn.
That dentist spoke of people’s shame—Aboriginal people suffer the same shame that non-Aboriginal people do when they have bad teeth. When they are having their front teeth in particular extracted, they will not smile. He said that this program had just started to be taken up and had just started to make a difference. He was dismayed at the ending of the scheme because he thought that it was a good way of delivering a service to Aboriginal people in remote communities.
If one of the reasons that the figures are skewed is that the information on service provision has not been good or people have not been able to access the information, you do not then cut the service. Surely, you improve the information available to dentists, to doctors and to the community about the service, which is, as I have said, highly valued by the community. My office has been overwhelmed by the number of people who have contacted us to tell us their stories and how much this program has meant to them. They have told us what a difference it has made to their lives, to their wellbeing, to their self-respect and in some instances to them being able to get a job because they have felt so bad about their dental problems that they have not felt confident enough to participate in the workforce. The service has multiple impacts on people.
I think every member of the Senate has received the photos that show absolutely what this program means to people. My office received a phone call today from a lady in very tragic circumstances. She is suffering from cancer and I am not going to go through the whole story. She was dismayed when she found out that she probably was not going to be able to access the service. Now she is not going to be able to get the funding she needs to do some very important dental work that would mean a difference between a good quality of life and an extremely poor quality of life for her.
We heard of another example of people who were suffering from chronic hepatitis C, who were unable to eat the more nutritious food that they needed because of their poor dental health. Instead of eating soft food, which is more likely to be high in sugar and fat and which only adds to their chronic illness, if they were able to access this sort of program, it would greatly assist them in terms of their quality of life and their health outcomes.
If this program disappears, these people will go back onto waiting lists and their conditions will worsen. For example, a person suffering from a severe iron deficiency was told to increase his consumption of red meat. He was unable to do so because he could not chew due to his rotten teeth. By the time he finally got to see a dentist under the scheme, all his remaining teeth had to be removed and he was provided with false teeth. That is what happens when you are stuck on waiting lists. The problem gets worse and worse.
The Commonwealth dental health plan, which is what the government said they want to replace this service with, was supposed to begin on 1 July. It did not. It is dependent on funding agreements with the states, and these are to be signed in the very near future, but that has not happened yet. If the scheme is withdrawn now, people who are currently receiving treatment will have nowhere to go. Even if they have somewhere to go at the moment, they will go onto waiting lists, and the funding that is available for those services is not going to provide the sort of care that they need and which they can receive under the current program to deal with the extent of their problems.
I am not here by any stretch of the imagination defending the coalition, because I do not agree with a lot of their health policy plans, so I do not want anyone running away with that wild idea. However, this program was a good program. It is genuinely helping people who are suffering, who have chronic illnesses and who have poor dental health. They need support. I am not about to support a motion that cuts off that little support. It is quite obvious that it is fulfilling a desperate need out there. The doubling of the use of the service in that short space of time says there is a big need out there.
Yes, the Greens support a Commonwealth dental health scheme, but not at the expense of those people who are currently receiving much needed support. Funding has been cut to public dental services and the states have not been performing properly, but I say again that you do not then inflict that pain on low-income workers—on the people who have the least capacity to pay. It is the wealthy people who have the capacity to pay; low-income people do not have the capacity to pay. If we support this motion to rescind the disallowance of the dental services determination, the minister would whip in another instrument to get rid of this program. It would not immediately be replaced with a Commonwealth dental scheme as they say. The time frame is quite loose on that and there is absolutely no guarantee that the people who are currently being treated under this scheme or who would be eligible to be treated under this scheme will be able to be treated in a timely manner that deals with their problems and symptoms immediately under the new scheme.
The government need to come back with a better funding proposal for their dental scheme. They need to show the Greens how they are going to properly look after the people who currently are able to access treatment under this scheme, which is proving extremely valuable and worth while and delivering results to thousands of Australians. They need to show us how these people can be treated and also how they are going to get their Commonwealth dental plan up.
Don’t dare blame the Greens if the government decide they are not going to fund their Commonwealth dental plan. When they announced those tax cuts, they made a decision about how they were going to spend that money. Australia can afford both—don’t you try to tell me that we cannot. We can. We are a caring society and we can afford both. Don’t try and blame the Greens when this goes down.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH INSURANCE (DENTAL SERVICES) AMENDMENT AND REPEAL DETERMINATION 2008</title>,<title>Rescission</title>,Motions,26,2,speech
"Xenophon, Sen Nick",IND,2008-09-16,"—Can I say firstly I think the questions put by Senator Siewert towards the end of her contribution are very relevant ones and they deserve a comprehensive and considered answer from the government. I rise to speak briefly on this motion. The previous government’s dental scheme relied on the referral of patients by GPs so that dental services could be accessed through Medicare according to demand. This plan cost $490 million and due to its reliance on Medicare requires a disallowance by this house. The Rudd government wishes to replace this scheme with two new schemes, the Commonwealth Dental Health Program and the Medicare Teen Dental Plan, at a cost of $780 million. The funding for this was factored into the last federal budget on the assumption that the funding for the previous scheme would be stopped—and I note the question by Senator Siewert: why can’t we fund both? That is a reasonable question. It is a question I have posed to the government.
However, I note that the previous scheme was poorly accessed in most states, with my home state of South Australia receiving only 2.8 per cent of the funding. I have had an email from a ministerial adviser to the Minister for Health in South Australia. The minister’s office asserts in that email that, on the basis of the available figures, South Australian patients comprised 1,256 out of the 44,774 patients who accessed the chronic disease dental scheme from 1 November 2007 to 31 July 2008. That is about a 2.8 per cent share of the national total, compared to the 8.7 per cent which South Australia will receive under the Commonwealth Dental Health Program. The minister’s office also says that total benefits provided to SA patients under the old scheme amounted to $2.5 million from 1 November 2007 to 31 July 2008. This is a 2.4 per cent share of the total expenditure, compared with $24.7 million which SA will receive under the Commonwealth government’s proposed scheme. The office goes on to state that, in comparison with the former scheme, the new scheme will provide for 85,600 visits over three years, which will see dental waiting times reduce from around 19 months now to about 12 months. That is the position of the South Australian government. Anyone who knows about my relationship with the South Australian government could never accuse me of being a spruiker for that government, but I think it is a fair point that has been made by the minister’s office. I have taken that into consideration insofar as it impacts on the citizens of South Australia.
It seems to me the dilemma is that the government is not prepared to fund the chronic dental scheme and so what do you do with the available resources? That is my concern, although I think Senator Siewert’s question as to why we cannot fund both is one that must be answered by the government. I see benefit in the proposed new dental scheme that the government wants to implement, and that will be a good thing for South Australians. But I also note the concern that those with a chronic dental problem will no longer be able to access this scheme on the basis of the government’s position.
By the government’s own admission, thousands of people with chronic dental needs who are currently receiving assistance under the old scheme will miss out under the new scheme because they do not qualify for concession cards. That is obviously a real concern. Anyone who has had to wait longer than a day for an appointment with a dentist to treat something as minor as a toothache or a minor chip will appreciate how distressing dental pain can be. If we then consider those suffering chronic dental pain, and how chronic pain dominates all aspects of one’s life, it is not acceptable that these people be deserted to suffer. It is not acceptable for those currently receiving support or those on the cusp of the concession card threshold to be suddenly facing huge dental bills. It is a case where we should not be robbing Peter to pay for Paul’s teeth.
I can say that I have had some very useful discussions with the minister and the minister’s office, and I appreciate that. I have sought further information as to the extent to which like-for-like treatments could be funded in South Australia for chronic dental conditions in relation to the proposed new scheme that is currently in abeyance. I have also sought information on how many South Australians with chronic dental needs would lose out due to these changes and how many new treatments would be afforded for like-for-like treatments. I accept in good faith that the government will be providing me with those details in due course. However, I think there are some legitimate concerns raised by the opposition and by the Greens about this. I think more needs to be done to convince me that this is the way to go. So, on balance, I cannot support the government’s position on this, but I look forward to further discussions and perhaps a further commitment from the government in relation to the matters of concern that have been raised in the course of this debate.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH INSURANCE (DENTAL SERVICES) AMENDMENT AND REPEAL DETERMINATION 2008</title>,<title>Rescission</title>,Motions,26,2,speech
"Fielding, Sen Steve",FFP,2008-09-16,"—Regrettably, the government has made this debate a choice between one dental health program and another. That makes it an enormously difficult decision because both the Rudd government’s Commonwealth Dental Health Program and the previous government’s Allied Health and Dental Care Initiative have merit. One helps people with chronic disease with their dental problems, while the proposed new government scheme helps with reducing dental waiting lists. If you look at both of those you think, ‘Gee, they are both pretty important things.’ And when you look to see which one has more merit than the other, there are arguments for going both ways.
We have been in discussion with the minister and we are aware that there are winners and losers, which is unfortunate with this particular issue. Dental services in Australia have been mammothly underfunded for many years. People have been suffering while governments dither about providing enough money and resources to fully tackle this problem. There are more than 480,000 people waiting for public dental care, with waiting times averaging between one and 1½ years. There are reports that some patients have waited for 10 years to see a dentist. I will say that again—there are 480,000 people, and some of them have been waiting for 10 years to see a dentist. That is in Australia—it is not another country; it is in Australia—and that is a disgrace. And here we are today, squabbling and saying that you can have one and not the other.
We have had a lot people contact our office on this issue. There are strong merits for both schemes. The Rudd government’s proposal to put money into the dental system will see a reduction in the waiting lists. It is nowhere near enough money, but I do not think that anyone in this place would deny that the Rudd government’s system would reduce the waiting lists. It has also become clear that the previous government’s scheme, the chronic disease dental scheme, was actually serving a need for Australians who have debilitating chronic dental needs. We could say that we could let go of the chronic disease dental scheme if the new proposal by the Rudd government would help those people with chronic dental diseases. We have sought some assurances from the minister about priorities being given to people on the chronic disease lists and we have had an assurance that the needs of people with chronic dental diseases would be factored into the waiting lists.
I am swayed both ways but, at the end of the day, I think there is enough money in the system to allow both schemes to run. That is the conclusion that Family First has come to, and it has not come to it lightly, frankly. I think both systems have merit and both seem to address different issues. Ultimately I really believe that Family First would continue to seek the continuation of both. If the government wants to force us into choosing one or the other, I think that they are going to find that we will hold onto the chronic disease scheme now and see whether the government can put more money into the system. There is money there and they can put it in if they want to. It is a choice that they can turn back on themselves; it is a choice that they can make as to whether they actually do something about the waiting lists. But I think the needs in the chronic disease area are also real. I would just say that dental services in Australia have been mammothly underfunded collectively and we need to work out how we can have both. With the resources we have in Australia, I think we can have both.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH INSURANCE (DENTAL SERVICES) AMENDMENT AND REPEAL DETERMINATION 2008</title>,<title>Rescission</title>,Motions,26,2,speech
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2008-09-16,"—I will take the opportunity to close the debate on this matter. This afternoon we have heard contributions from a range of senators in this place. One of the issues I want to address is that raised by the theme that went through all of the debates—that there is a need to address the dental issues in the Australian population. Those needs have not been addressed by the Liberals in the last 11 years. They did not take the matter seriously. In fact, in 1996, they withdrew substantial moneys from the system. We now have a view, expressed at least between the minors and the Greens, that the issue does need to be addressed.
Prior to the election of the Rudd government we took a responsible position by making it perfectly clear that we would abolish the former Howard government’s poorly targeted and failing chronic disease dental scheme. It was not working. It was not providing the benefits that people should have received. What it was doing was targeting those who would otherwise not need the service. For those who did need the service, such as pensioners and people on concession cards, it was not adequately, and in some cases not at all, addressing their dental needs. We had a clear choice that we took to the election, which was either a scheme that the Labor minister for health had put forward or a scheme that the former government had maintained. And the choice was made. The public chose in favour of Labor’s better targeted dental programs. The choice was necessary to maintain our budget surplus, and it is clear that that is still facing this Senate.
In a perfect world we might all be able to give everyone perfect outcomes. This is not a perfect world. There are choices that need to be made and there are tough decisions in tough economic times that need to be made. The Rudd government has put forward a perfectly proper process. Prior to the election it took an economically responsible path to maintain both a strong budget surplus and make tough choices. It did not take the easy way out of promising everybody an outcome. You cannot do that because all you are then doing is contributing to blowing out a multibillion dollar hole in the budget. The Charter of Budget Honesty provided a system where we would be costing our election promises and, having done so, it then provided the way forward where we could say that these included savings from the Liberal’s failed scheme in order to pay for Labor’s better policies. That is the process we took forward. Our commitment, compared to the previous government’s record of ripping $100 million a year from public dental services and leaving 650,000 people languishing on public dental waiting lists, was a clear vote at the last election for Labor’s policies.
We are now in the process of ensuring that we can proceed with ours while shutting down theirs. So, in response to Senator Xenophon’s arguments about some of the process issues around our scheme, we are happy to engage with senators in respect of the detail of how our program will be rolled out. What we are doing today is shutting down the existing scheme. It is not economically sensible to try to maintain both schemes. It was not what we tried to do before the election. We made that clear. The public made a choice about that. We then ensured that at the first opportunity we would roll out our new scheme and, of course, the savings from the existing scheme to be closed down would be used to fund election commitments. Why? It was to maintain a proper surplus of $22 billion to ensure that we could be responsible economic managers and also address the dire needs of those people who need dental assistance. To do that through our programs, which are targeted and designed to assist those people who need assistance, is the Labor way. It is the Rudd government’s way to ensure that we have the proper outcome. It is not about waving a magic wand, unfortunately, and hoping that everybody can benefit with the two schemes still running. That is not the position we are in. We have before us today the opportunity to shut one system down and give the Rudd government the opportunity to roll out its scheme to address dental issues that exist in the community and to start to target it to those people who are in need. That is the position we are now in.
In terms of the arguments that have occurred in this chamber, the main one from the opposition was held during the election campaign. Senator Conroy earlier this afternoon went through the reasons why their program was in dire need of closing, and still needs to be closed down. It had failed abysmally. It had also been wrongly targeted and it allowed people to gain access to a system that they did not need because they could afford it themselves. It is a program that needs to be closed down and it needs the Senate to do so. It can only be done through this system that we have before us. When you look at the Liberal’s chronic disease dental scheme, you see that it was highly skewed, with many states receiving far less than a fair population share. One in five concession card holders lived in Queensland—18.9 per cent—but it only received 4.4 per cent of benefits under the chronic disease scheme. That is just one example of the scheme that the Senate will maintain if it does not support Labor’s position. To continue that scheme would be unfair and unjust for those people. The money could be better spent being targeted by Labor’s proposal.
This government does not have a magic wand to wave around and say, ‘We can maintain all of the schemes; we can maintain all of the programs of the Liberal government.’ To do that would not recognise that in truth there was a change at the election. There was a change for the better. The population voted for the Rudd government’s plans not only in dental care but in health and a whole range of other programs. The opposition are stalling in respect of this matter. They have to accept that we do have a mandate in this issue and we should be allowed to get on with managing these schemes. The opposition can take the opportunity to be critical of our scheme but they should support our mandate to allow us to govern and to provide the outcomes that we said we would, to provide the election commitments that we said we would and to provide the savings to maintain the strong surplus that we said we would. I was not going to take up much time in respect of this matter. It is coming up to the time for another debate to occur. On those words, I urge the Senate to close down the existing Liberal scheme.

"Moore, Sen Claire",ALP,2008-09-16,"—Last month, many people in Brisbane gathered together in the suburb of Holland Park in south Brisbane to celebrate with the local Muslim community the amazing achievement of the centenary of the Holland Park Mosque in Queensland. This conjures up so much excitement when you think of the history that surrounds this building in the southern part of Brisbane. It is a great achievement because, as the local mufti, Imam Uzair Akbar—
Honourable senators interjecting—
 (Senator Marshall)—Order! Senator Moore, could you resume your seat for a moment. I call the Senate to order and ask those senators who are not going to listen to this debate to leave the chamber.
—They may be interested in the local mosque, Acting Deputy President Marshall. As the Imam said in welcoming people to his mosque, he grew up and was educated in England and there is no mosque in England that can claim to have a centenary of life behind it. On that basis—and I see that Senator Mason, who joined with us at the celebration, is here—we were able to celebrate and acknowledge the wonderful work, commitment and worship of the local Muslim community in our city. This was celebrated in many ways. One of the most rewarding parts of this celebration, and one which continues the mosque’s work with the community, is an extraordinary book by Mustafa Ally, a man who I have worked with over many years who came to live in Brisbane after growing up and working in South Africa. He took on the project of recording the history of the mosque with the local group and particularly with the help of Jenny Dean, who I met on the day.
I think it is an acknowledgement of the work of the Muslim community in our city that the start of this book has a foreword by the Hon. Kevin Rudd. The new Governor of Queensland, Ms Penelope Wensley, in what must have been one of her first official acts, put a message from the Governor. There were also the local people who had worked there over many generations to achieve what we now see as something important not just to the Muslim community but also to all of us in Queensland.
Those of us who have lived in the area cannot think of travelling through that part of Brisbane without looking up on the hill and seeing the green and white dome and the minarets. I remember as a small child being in the area and being lucky enough to visit the mosque. I remember being welcomed as family and as a schoolchild to come in and to learn more about the religion, to meet the people and to defuse some of the horrible myths that have built up over many years.
You can stand there and know that for a hundred years people have gathered on this one small piece of land in southern Brisbane. A group of people were there in 1906 when they worked with the local early settler Mr Henzell. They were welcomed onto that land where they met without the structures that they have today and from that time onwards they worked to get the money, buying the land in 1908 and establishing that corner of Brisbane as their safe place where they could practise their religion and welcome people there so that despite the various waves of Islamic immigration and visitation to our country there was a place there that they could call their own.
The early Afghan settlers who came into the western parts of Queensland as camel drivers were the first Muslims identified in the area. They had come to the southern parts of the country many years earlier. The first known mosque, at Maree in South Australia, was established in 1861. Then came other mosques in Adelaide in 1890, in Broken Hill in 1891 and in Perth in 1904. Then there was the Brisbane mosque in Queensland. I am sure that not many people who live and work in our country can understand that there have been people practising the Islamic faith living and working in our country for that long, and I think that is one of the great things the awareness of the celebration of the hundred years has brought home to many other people. Now through this book, which will be on the shelves of libraries and I hope in many schools, we see pictures and stories about the work, the commitment, the early services, and the key families who over so many years gave their hard work, their commitment and their faith to build our community.
At the beginning of the book it points out some people that should be acknowledged for how the mosque developed. It says:
Several groups serve to illustrate the diversity and the scale of contributions—all acknowledged with the greatest of respect.
The elders of the community whose dreams for establishing a place of worship, of learning, (Madrasa) for youth, and of community building for the sake of Allah (swt);
The Fijian people who contributed substantial funding to the project—sometimes their last and only one pound note—given for the sake of Allah;
The youth who would volunteer to work at the site to do whatever they could, perhaps best epitomised by Mr Yousef Goss who would go with his uncle to Brisbane on many occasions just to lend a small hand.
The Arabic calligrapher from Fiji who produced the script for the dome—
and which we can still see there—
which was then traced painstakingly by Nazeer Goss with his father.
The building team under the supervision of Shaffee Mohammed Golam Goss—bricklayers, tilers, labourers and landscapers.
Those who excavated the site and removed rubble load by load to prepare the way.
All those people gave their time and their effort so we could see where people could gather together and practise their faith.
At the beginning of the book it says—and it is old quote:
Whoever builds a Mosque for the love of Allah, Allah will build for him a mansion in paradise.
The many people who gathered at Holland Park last month can know that that work has led to sharing in some form of paradise. A particularly personal experience for me was that when we arrived there were so many small children there from very many different cultural backgrounds. They were so excited, running around sharing in the celebration of their faith and also enjoying the fete that was put on to mark the occasion.
I was able to talk with some of the ladies group there. Consistently through this book great credit is given to the various women’s groups over the years that have worked, often behind the scenes but now much more prominently, to raise funds to build a safe place. One of the fundraisers for the women’s group was a cupcakes stall. Somehow I found it particularly meaningful. The day before I had been at the local Catholic school fete in my own suburb. I had gone to the local ladies group at the Catholic school fete and bought cupcakes. For some reason it came home to me that there I was on two separate days in different parts of Brisbane working with different faith communities, both of whom worked so strongly in their own communities to provide so much social strength for so many people. The real strength of our community is based in groups of people who come together and share and work for others. And on these two separate days, at the Catholic fete and then the celebration of 100 years of the mosque, we had families celebrating and working with the same recipes. I found that to be a particularly meaningful moment. I want to congratulate the Islamic community of Queensland and of Brisbane, in particular. It is such a vibrant community that works so actively and with such enthusiasm across the board to build community and to ensure that all of us have a greater awareness of sharing our knowledge and our acceptance.
There were some tough times for the community. We know that after the September 11 acts overseas there were some pretty tough times across Australia. In Brisbane itself there were attempted fire-bombings and attacks on people in the streets, based purely on the way they looked and on their religion. That was forgotten last month when we celebrated the centenary of their mosque. Somehow I think it is also part of building our awareness and our knowledge. The chairperson of the community who led the welcoming ceremony last week, Mohammed Abdul Gaffar Deen, talked about his own personal experience over many generations of his family working there. He welcomed all of us to share in their celebration and we all hope that in the future we can go back to the mosque and celebrate future activities, knowing that we are welcome and knowing that whilst we share in building a mosque for the love of Allah, we will also hopefully share in paradise in the future.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Holland Park Mosque</title>,Adjournment,28,1,speech
