"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1998-07-02,"—Pursuant to contingent notice of motion, I move:
That so much of the standing orders be suspended as would prevent me from moving a motion relating to the conduct of the business of the Senate, namely, a motion to give precedence to general business notice of motion No. 1202.
I do this because this is an urgent matter. If you read today's Sydney Morning Herald , you would see that the AFP has reported that the Indonesian Attorney-General, Mr Andi Ghalib, announced yesterday that his department would conduct an audit of 13 foundations run by Mr Suharto and announce the results publicly. We have the situation where the new Indonesian government, which is putting increasing distance between itself and the Suharto family and their cronies, is doing audits into the Suharto foundations and an assessment of the legality of the dealings of the Suharto family during their long tenure of dictatorship in Indonesia. What we do know from Forbes Magazine  is that the Suharto family assets—which were estimated to be worth $40 billion before the crash—still remain estimated to be worth some $4 billion to $5 billion. That is not taking into account the so-called extended family of the Godfather, the assets of cronies who have done very well out of the Suharto family's period in power.
There have been direct calls to Australia and other countries from opposition parties in Indonesia, including the People's Democratic Party. A letter from the PDP says that the Suharto family or its associates have extensive assets in Australia. The party says that it wants the Australian government to freeze those assets and channel them to the people of Indonesia and pro-democratic groups in Indonesia. The PDP also says that the Indonesian people would not need an International Monetary Fund bailout and austerity programs if that money were to become available.
In this letter, the International Representative Office in Australia of the People's Democratic Party points out the need for a demand to be put on the Australian government to freeze the assets of Suharto. The party identifies three main components. The first component is First Pacific Davies, a real estate company under the First Pacific Group. The Salim Group is under the management of Liem Soei Liong, Suharto's long-term business friend, who is the major shareholder of the First Pacific Group. The PDP says that Suharto's family is represented in this group through his stepbrother Sudwikatmono.
The second component is the 2,098 square kilometre Tipperary Station in the Northern Territory. The letter from the People's Democratic Party says:
Bakrie brothers, who have a 50 per cent stake in the station were one of the closest cronies of the former president Suharto.
The third component is the Robina Land Corporation, which is currently developing Australia's biggest shopping precinct near the Gold Coast. The PDP says:
The owner of Robina Land corp is Robin Loh, a Singaporean businessman who has had close links with Suharto since 1975. In the late 60's he was Pertamina's (state oil company) major supplier of pipes and equipment and he had built a close relationship with Suharto through his crony, Ibnu Sutowo, the former corrupt director of Pertamina.
It is rumoured that there are more extensive assets of the family or associates of Suharto in Australia, including real estate assets in Western Australia. The Indonesian government is moving to do an assessment.
Notice of motion 1202 standing in my name calls for this assessment to be done by the Australian government so that in the event—and I think this is inevitable—of a call for a freeze of assets in Australia, the assessment has been done and some action can be taken to stop the hiding of these funds in the meantime. It is a very responsible motion. It is calling for action now because action later may be too late. It is in response to calls from opposition parties in Indonesia. It is a call that should be heard. I ask the Senate to support the motion for urgency so that we can debate the matter and have the motion passed.",SENATE,<title>INDONESIA: EX-PRESIDENT SUHARTO</title>,<title>Suspension of Standing Orders</title>,Miscellaneous,2,1,speech
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,1998-07-02,"—As Senator Brown and honourable senators would be aware, the issue before the Senate is the question of whether, in this circumstance, it is appropriate to reorder the business before the Senate to deal with this particular notice of motion standing in the name of Senator Brown. Most senators would acknowledge that, in the last sitting fortnight, we have had an extraordinary situation where not only opposition senators but senators around the chamber have cooperated with the government to ensure a significant number of late-night Senate sittings.
The Senate sat last Friday. The government plans to have the Senate sit again tomorrow. The opposition has very generously proposed that general business not be dealt with this afternoon to maximise the amount of time the government can utilise on its legislative program. The task during this suspension of standing orders is for the Senate to make a judgment about whether the motion that stands in Senator Brown's name should take precedence over a range of other matters that are before the Senate. That is how the opposition will be approaching its decision on this particular question. Senator Brown's general business notice of motion No. 1202 says:
That the Senate—
(a)	 notes moves within Indonesia and the United States of America to investigate the wealth and assets held by ex-president Suharto and his family and associates;
(b)	 calls on the Australian Government to establish an inquiry into such wealth and assets in Australia; and
(c)	 urges the Australian Government to take prudent measures to ensure that any future request from Indonesia for such assets to be frozen or returned is not compromised in the meantime.
Such a motion, on balance, ought to follow a formal request from the Indonesian government. For that reason, and because of the competing interests in terms of the Senate's program, the opposition will not be supporting Senator Brown's motion for the suspension of standing orders today.
The issue of the wealth and assets of former Indonesian President Suharto, his family and 
 associates is, in our view, in the first instance obviously a matter for Indonesia itself. An important point to make during this debate, as Senator Brown and honourable senators will be aware, is that  Indonesia has actually instigated its own investigation.
I want to make it clear that the Australian Labor Party whole-heartedly supports cooperation with Indonesia to conduct appropriate investigations into any such wealth or assets located in Australia. However, a proposal like this to establish an undefined inquiry without considering who might conduct it or what its terms of reference would be does have weaknesses and does take away from the seriousness of the proposition that is before the Senate. The Australian government should certainly be prepared to discuss this issue with Indonesia. If a request is made by Indonesia, it should conduct such investigations as may be necessary and appropriate.
Having said that, I point out that the issue of balance for the Senate to give consideration to today is whether the standing orders should be suspended to deal with this issue. (Extension of time granted) I thank the Senate for its courtesy. I was going to conclude with one more sentence. Actually, I cannot remember what I was going to say, if you really want to know. I know that I was going to make some comment about Senator Brown. I have no idea whether it was laudatory or condemnatory. Whatever it was, I am sure that it was right!",SENATE,<title>INDONESIA: EX-PRESIDENT SUHARTO</title>,<title>Suspension of Standing Orders</title>,Miscellaneous,2,1,speech
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,1998-07-02,"—The Australian government is aware that the Indonesia government has begun an investigation into corruption under the previous Suharto regime. Indonesian government ministers, the leader of the armed forces and the past and present Attorneys-General have confirmed that former president Suharto will not be immune from these investigations. The investigation itself is completely a matter for the new Indonesian government and people to undertake. An inquiry into the Suharto family wealth and assets in Australia would depend on a formal request from the Indonesian government. If such a request were to be made in the future, the government would consider it. At this 
 time, I oppose the suspension of standing orders as urgency has not been made.",SENATE,<title>INDONESIA: EX-PRESIDENT SUHARTO</title>,<title>Suspension of Standing Orders</title>,Miscellaneous,2,1,speech
"Bourne, Sen Vicki",AD,1998-07-02,"—The Australian Democrats, as I am sure honourable senators will remember, brought this up as a question a few weeks ago. We asked if the Indonesian government had approached us about this. Senator Hill was going to get back to me. I am sure that he will at some point. It sounds from what he just said as though the Indonesian government has not yet approached us. I think that is probably right.
There are a couple of very small points in this motion, probably in part (b), that I would want clarified and expanded before we agreed to it. I saw a draft of an amendment that the opposition had a week or so ago which covered my concerns. If we suspend standing orders, there does not seem to be a great deal of enthusiasm for discussion, so I do not think it would take very long to deal with it. I would quite like to see this dealt with as long as it did not take very long. We would agree to a suspension.",SENATE,<title>INDONESIA: EX-PRESIDENT SUHARTO</title>,<title>Suspension of Standing Orders</title>,Miscellaneous,2,1,speech
"Ray, Sen Robert",ALP,1998-07-02,"—The Senate is evolving every morning into a foreign policy making body. I do not believe that that is the purpose of the Senate. There is an executive and a foreign minister. They make decisions on behalf of the country, and our job is to scrutinise them. There is a whole range of methods by which they can be scrutinised. For instance, the prime committee of this parliament is usually acknowledged as being the foreign affairs and defence committee. It is certainly the biggest, the best remunerated and the best resourced committee in the parliament. I hope that the House of Representatives is still fulfilling that function and not us. That is the appropriate body to take these sort of resolutions through in the first event.
Senator Brown is devaluing the currency of Senate resolutions and the view of this place by every day getting up and moving some new foreign affairs resolution. We have made it quite clear—I do not know whether he accepts it yet—that we will not have those resolutions go through without debate. I think he can at least see the point in that.
—Here's an opportunity to debate it.
—I will come to that in a moment. One of the problems is that some of these resolutions are a bit like a curate's egg; they are good in parts. You can agree with part of it and not other parts. Therefore, taking them through without a debate does not give senators an opportunity to express a view as to why, on balance, they may support something with reservations, which can be taken into account when that resolution is carried. We have at least got to the position where the Labor Party—I think the government agrees, but it does not really want to say so—believes that you cannot carry foreign affairs resolutions at the drop of a hat.
I do not think Senator Margetts was surprised that what was regarded as a foreign affairs resolution about torture went through yesterday. We have said that the recognition of international days and the sort of issues Senator Margetts was talking about yesterday are appropriate to go through without debate. They are in recognition of an international day or an international issue. However, we do not believe that resolutions expressing an opinion or calling on the government to do something should go through without debate.
We then have to decide how many of these things we will debate, how long we will debate them and how much Senate time should be put forward in debating them. Inevitably, in part, we have to take into account two factors. The obvious one is whether it is absolutely urgent at the moment for us to pursue these issues. The second one reflects how much of the motion we agree on and how relevant we think the motion is. Certainly part (b) is jumping the gun. My understanding is that the Australian government has not had a request from the Indonesian government to investigate these matters.
I like to put ourselves in reverse. I wonder how we would feel if the Indonesian government set up an inquiry into certain high wealth Australian citizens. Would we feel at all offended if they decided to look into high 
 wealth individuals, especially people who own—
—If their actions are undertaken in Indonesia or their business is in Indonesia, it might well be appropriate.
—I am just asking in the theoretical, Senator Margetts, in terms of national sovereignty, without a request, how you launch such an inquiry. Or are you arguing that this particular family has high investment interests in Australia? Certainly no evidence has been adduced so far that that is in fact the case.
—That's what is being sought.
—Senator Brown says that that is what they are seeking. Well there is a limit to fishing expeditions, I have to say. You would need some evidentiary base before you would in fact authorise an inquiry. Senator Brown would respond, if he had the opportunity—he may yet have it—that it may exist, that it may be there. I do not think that is quite good enough in this case.
But, again, what it really comes back to is that, firstly, foreign affairs resolutions should not be carried by this chamber on the nod. Secondly, to successfully carry them, you have to argue the urgency of the matter. Thirdly, you then have to give some substantiation in the issue you are raising that it is actually relevant to the Senate and proper procedure. I do not think it is proper for this Senate at this stage to call on the Australian government to have an investigation into these matters prior to an official request coming from Indonesia.",SENATE,<title>INDONESIA: EX-PRESIDENT SUHARTO</title>,<title>Suspension of Standing Orders</title>,Miscellaneous,2,1,speech
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-07-02,"—In arguing for the need to suspend standing orders, I would like to remind the Senate that on a large number of occasions the Senate has played a very positive role in helping to shape and change foreign policy in Australia. I think it would be conceited of any government to think that it is the sole repository of information or ideas in relation to appropriate foreign policy lines.
I can give you some examples. I refer to the issue of bringing forward information on the Kurds in Turkey. Also, the information on 
 landmines, which a former foreign affairs minister from the Labor government said was hopelessly utopian, is now part of mainstream foreign policy. The issue of French nuclear testing also springs to mind. The issue of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, which the Greens brought up by way of notices of motion on several occasions, is now coming home to haunt Australia in relation to nuclear testing by India and Pakistan. Australia's role in that was not necessarily what was given to us by the foreign affairs minister at the time, or by the Department of Foreign Affairs. It seems that one of the options for this place is to go to briefings by Foreign Affairs or briefings by ministers to find out that the information is not necessarily correct or that it may be challengeable through other means.
We have constituents who believe that foreign affairs issues, and Australia's role in foreign affairs issues, are something that under democracy they have a right to have an opinion about. We as parliamentarians have a responsibility to express those opinions within the parliamentary sphere. I would fight very strongly for my belief that there is no way we should be gagged in presenting those concerns from our constituents, because the Greens believe that those community groups have a right to be heard.
I can talk about East Timor. Once again, issues such as this which maybe a few years ago were considered to be hopelessly utopian are now part of the mainstream agenda. There is also the matter of Bougainville, self-determination in many different countries and issues of human rights abuses. Bringing such matters forward into the parliamentary sphere is a very important and legitimate function of the Senate. I would challenge anybody to say this is not a legitimate and very important function.
The fact that it is more likely to be done by the minor parties in the Senate is indicative of the role the major parties play; it does not mean that it is not legitimate. So I therefore say that even the debate we have had today about the urgency of this motion has been a very useful exercise. It has brought the issue of the Suharto family and their assets on to the public agenda. It is on the public record, 
 and I believe it warrants further debate. Therefore, I support the suspension of standing orders.

"Woodley, Sen John",AD,1998-07-02,"—I present the report of the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee entitled The incidence and management of Ovine Johnes disease in the Australian sheep flock , together with submissions and the Hansard  record of the proceedings.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
I point out to the Senate that at this stage the report is in a photocopied form and that the printed form of the report will be available next week. This inquiry quickly turned into a much more complex issue than anyone thought it would at the beginning. I pay tribute to and compliment Senator Kerry O'Brien for his persistence in moving this inquiry. At the beginning, no-one thought it was the issue it turned out to be. I think the Senate owes Senator O'Brien a debt for being persistent in having this reference carried through.
An issue that became very clear as we proceeded into the inquiry was that one of the questions is certainly about the science of testing, and the possibility of any cure or vaccine which might be available really depends on what at this stage is incomplete science. We must get the science right in terms of this particular issue, and that remains to be concluded. For that reason, this is an interim report. The committee will continue to monitor the issue. I believe that it will revisit the issue when the actions taken by the federal government—belatedly, I might say—have had time to have some effect.
We believe that this issue cannot be dealt with any longer by the states in isolation. Part of the problem has been the inaction of the 
 New South Wales state government over many years. The government, having been notified in the early 1980s that this disease was prevalent in the Australian sheep flock, did not do anything for many years. The over-reaction of the Victorian government caused quite a serious problem for many sheep growers who discovered Ovine Johnes disease in their flocks and had to have all the flocks disposed of. That has caused some really serious problems for some of those growers.
We believe that the federal government must be involved. We are pleased that at long last it is becoming involved in this issue. It will have to put in some serious resources. The committee is prepared to wait and see just what comes out of the various actions and projected actions that will be taken. We were told in evidence on a number of occasions that, while a number of properties have been notified as having Ovine Johnes disease, the real number could be three to 10 times that number. If that is so, we really have a very large issue on our hands.
I particularly thank Andrew Snedden and John O'Keefe for their work in keeping this issue going and in writing the report we have before us. I also want to thank those who gave evidence. For many of them, it was a very emotional experience. They were talking about the devastation of their livelihoods and of the loss of flocks, particularly of the genetics in some of those flocks which are very important to sheep growers. You can imagine that at times the hearings were quite emotional. I compliment those who gave evidence. Even though it was a very emotional experience for them, they were prepared to help the committee to understand the extent and outcome of their having discovered this disease within their flocks.
The response of state governments has not always been appropriate. The tardiness of the federal government has also probably added to the emotional response that we had on the part of some witnesses. That is all I want to say at this stage. Again, I compliment the committee, the committee secretariat and Senator Kerry O'Brien for his persistence in having this reference brought to the attention of the committee.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee</title>,Committees,13,1,speech
"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,1998-07-02,"—I thank Senator Woodley for those kind remarks. I too would like to thank the committee staff for their work and time in relation to the preparation of this report and the gathering of evidence for it. It is important to note that this committee travelled to parts of Australia that probably a lot of Australians have not been to. I am not saying that they are so far-flung but a lot of people have probably not travelled to them. In one day, we travelled from a Launceston hearing to a Flinders Island hearing and then travelled to Melbourne. On another day, we commenced hearings in Hamilton, travelled to a Bairnsdale hearing and then travelled back to Melbourne. We have also had hearings in Orange in New South Wales and in Canberra as well as in Melbourne.
The work of Hansard staff was quite remarkable. They set up in a short time to record the evidence. They then dismantled and packed their equipment and loaded it on the aircraft to travel to another part of the country. They would then set up the equipment again, record more evidence and then dismantle it again in time for us to get a plane out for the next venue. I want to acknowledge that none of these committees could function properly without the very valuable assistance of Hansard.
I also want to acknowledge the work of Jack Lake, my staffer, who has been of great assistance. I know that a lot of people have been in contact with Jack when I have been in the chamber or away on committee business. He keeps me updated on just what has been happening in the industry. It would be inappropriate for me not to acknowledge the very important work that Jack Lake has done in assisting me in pursuing this matter and getting a grip on all the information that I need to pursue the matter.
In relation to the evidence that the committee received, I have to say that this committee's report is part of its inquiry into Ovine Johnes disease. Unfortunately, it provides yet another illustration of the lack of leadership by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Anderson. Unfortunately, it took the minister some time to come to 
 the view that OJD was a national problem rather than a regional one. He is reported as saying on 14 November 1997, on the question of a national eradication program for Ovine Johnes disease:
It is a question of the state governments and their various instrumentalities as well as industry agreeing on a national approach. And I have to say to you at the moment that that is not at this stage showing me overwhelmingly convincing signs of developing. Western Australia has a different perspective on this. Therefore, I just say that a watertight case with national agreement is a prerequisite for me being able to reasonably put this before the Commonwealth government.
Unfortunately, in the end, although the minister indicated he was not going to involve himself in this matter, he had to. It is good that he has done that to date. I think this report reflects the activities of the Commonwealth government in that regard, which, in effect, commenced earlier this year with the commissioning of a consultant's report on this matter.
Unfortunately, by the time the Commonwealth became involved, the Victorian government had chosen to launch its own campaign, with, I might say, disastrous results for a number of growers in that state. At the end of 1996 that state launched an eradication campaign which, I suggest, was ill-considered technically and offered inadequate compensation to growers who were either forced or persuaded to destock their flock.
A key recommendation in this report is a request to the Victorian government to immediately review the level of compensation paid to growers who were required to destock their properties as part of the state's eradication program. A study by Mr Andrew Patterson, an economist with the Victorian Department of Natural Resources and Environment, found that producers would lose between $22 and $47 a head, following destocking and the payment of compensation under the Victorian scheme. On the evidence we have received, it appears to me that these producers have been badly treated and that the Victorian government must revisit this matter, as I am sure this committee will with further inquiry into the matter.
A number of witnesses gave evidence to the committee that the Victorian scheme itself was badly flawed, and there was considerable evidence criticising the approach of the Victorian government to the control of the disease. That is the basis of the committee's findings in this regard. Producers told the committee that not only was the basic process wrong but there was a lack of counselling, information and support for affected farmers. The Victorian program was also described in evidence as not coherent, but as a series of ad hoc decisions made after hasty consultation with a committee with limited technical expertise.
The Victorian government, unfortunately, did not even bother to make a submission to the inquiry, despite the importance of this issue to hundreds of farmers in that state. Despite the fact that the committee formally wrote to the responsible minister, Mr McNamara, at the commencement of the inquiry inviting his input, he chose not to respond at all.
The Victorian Farmers Federation was also subject to criticism, particularly in relation to the amount and quality of information it supplied to its members concerning the Victorian scheme. The minister, Mr McNamara, after evidence was taken in Victoria, was provided with all submissions to the committee, together with the Hansard of the committee's Victorian hearings. Senators will note that the report says:
The committee received no reply and was disappointed in this apparent lack of interest by the Kennett Government in the experiences of Victorian producers affected by the Victorian OJD program.
Affected growers in New South Wales were also highly critical of the management plan applied in that state, with many producers suffering financial and social hardship as a result.
A further recommendation is for the development of a strategy to assist those regions affected by OJD. This strategy must involve those communities as well as local, state and Commonwealth governments.
The committee is of the view that the rural partnership program model, which was devel 
 oped by the former Labor government, provides the best means of assisting these farmers. That model allows communities access to a range of services from the Commonwealth, state and territory governments in a single submission. It allows rural communities the opportunity to develop strategies to address complex issues in an integrated way, and it allows the three levels of government to coordinate the delivery of support and other programs.
The committee also recommended that adequate funding be made available for ongoing research, and that is one of the key findings of the committee report. Research is the key to dealing with this disease. The problems with the approach taken to date in dealing with OJD has been a lack of political leadership and a lack of coordinated effort by all relevant agencies as well. As a consequence, main producers affected by the disease, and even producers in areas where the disease has been detected, have suffered severe economic and social hardship.
This is the first report on this matter, and once the national plan of action to deal with OJD is finalised, the committee will further consider that plan and report back to the Senate. But there is a clear and urgent need for all levels of government to work together with affected communities to develop and implement plans to enable those communities to effectively deal with this problem. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

And I have to say to you at the moment that that is not at this stage showing me overwhelmingly convincing signs of developing. Western Australia has a different perspective on this. Therefore, I just say that a watertight case with national agreement is a prerequisite for me being able to reasonably put this before the Commonwealth government.
Unfortunately, in the end, although the minister indicated he was not going to involve himself in this matter, he had to. It is good that he has done that to date. I think this report reflects the activities of the Commonwealth government in that regard, which, in effect, commenced earlier this year with the commissioning of a consultant's report on this matter.
Unfortunately, by the time the Commonwealth became involved, the Victorian government had chosen to launch its own campaign, with, I might say, disastrous results for a number of growers in that state. At the end of 1996 that state launched an eradication campaign which, I suggest, was ill-considered technically and offered inadequate compensation to growers who were either forced or persuaded to destock their flock.
A key recommendation in this report is a request to the Victorian government to immediately review the level of compensation paid to growers who were required to destock their properties as part of the state's eradication program. A study by Mr Andrew Patterson, an economist with the Victorian Department of Natural Resources and Environment, found that producers would lose between $22 and $47 a head, following destocking and the payment of compensation under the Victorian scheme. On the evidence we have received, it appears to me that these producers have been badly treated and that the Victorian government must revisit this matter, as I am sure this committee will with further inquiry into the matter.
A number of witnesses gave evidence to the committee that the Victorian scheme itself was badly flawed, and there was considerable evidence criticising the approach of the Victorian government to the control of the disease. That is the basis of the committee's findings in this regard. Producers told the committee that not only was the basic process wrong but there was a lack of counselling, information and support for affected farmers. The Victorian program was also described in evidence as not coherent, but as a series of ad hoc decisions made after hasty consultation with a committee with limited technical expertise.
The Victorian government, unfortunately, did not even bother to make a submission to the inquiry, despite the importance of this issue to hundreds of farmers in that state. Despite the fact that the committee formally wrote to the responsible minister, Mr McNamara, at the commencement of the inquiry inviting his input, he chose not to respond at all.
The Victorian Farmers Federation was also subject to criticism, particularly in relation to the amount and quality of information it supplied to its members concerning the Victorian scheme. The minister, Mr McNamara, after evidence was taken in Victoria, was provided with all submissions to the committee, together with the Hansard of the committee's Victorian hearings. Senators will note that the report says:
The committee received no reply and was disappointed in this apparent lack of interest by the Kennett Government in the experiences of Victorian producers affected by the Victorian OJD program.
Affected growers in New South Wales were also highly critical of the management plan applied in that state, with many producers suffering financial and social hardship as a result.
A further recommendation is for the development of a strategy to assist those regions affected by OJD. This strategy must involve those communities as well as local, state and Commonwealth governments.
The committee is of the view that the rural partnership program model, which was devel 
 oped by the former Labor government, provides the best means of assisting these farmers. That model allows communities access to a range of services from the Commonwealth, state and territory governments in a single submission. It allows rural communities the opportunity to develop strategies to address complex issues in an integrated way, and it allows the three levels of government to coordinate the delivery of support and other programs.
The committee also recommended that adequate funding be made available for ongoing research, and that is one of the key findings of the committee report. Research is the key to dealing with this disease. The problems with the approach taken to date in dealing with OJD has been a lack of political leadership and a lack of coordinated effort by all relevant agencies as well. As a consequence, main producers affected by the disease, and even producers in areas where the disease has been detected, have suffered severe economic and social hardship.
This is the first report on this matter, and once the national plan of action to deal with OJD is finalised, the committee will further consider that plan and report back to the Senate. But there is a clear and urgent need for all levels of government to work together with affected communities to develop and implement plans to enable those communities to effectively deal with this problem. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

"McGauran, Sen Julian",NP,1998-07-02,"—I move:
That the following matter be referred to the Committee of Privileges:
Whether there was an unauthorised disclosure of the report of the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority on the committee's third evaluation of the National Crime Authority and, if so, whether any contempt was committed by that disclosure.
I move this motion on behalf of the Chair of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on the National Crime Authority, Senator Ferris, although I am a member of the committee and am aware of the issue before the Senate that we seek to move off to the Senate Committee of Privileges.
It should be noted that the procedure followed in this matter has been proper and has the unanimous support of the committee. I need only refer to the President's words on Tuesday when she determined that the motion to refer the matter to the Privileges Committee may have precedence. The President said:
I am advised that the committee has followed the procedures laid down by the Senate in the resolution of 20 June 1996. This resolution requires that, in cases of unauthorised disclosure of committee documents, the committee concerned shall seek to discover the cause of the disclosure and come to a conclusion that the unauthorised disclosure has caused substantial interference with the work of the committee, before raising a matter of privilege under standing order 81. The committee having followed that procedure, the matter meets the criteria which I am required to consider.
The matter relates to the following. The committee had undertaken a comprehensive inquiry into the procedures and authority of the National Crime Authority. It was entitled, `Third evaluation of the National Crime Authority'. The committee examined such matters as the constitution, role, functions and powers of the authority; the efficiency and effectiveness of the authority; the accounta 
 bility and parliamentary supervision of the authority, and the need for any amendments of the National Crime Authority Act 1984.
At the time, the inquiry was undertaken in an atmosphere of great publicity and controversy over the role and actions of the National Crime Authority. I need only remind the Senate of the criticism of the authority and the publicity given to it by Mr John Elliott, let alone his appearance before the committee. I think it is agreed that, in that atmosphere, there are very few committees like the one that deals with the National Crime Authority. That warrants the utmost confidentiality and the confidence of the general public—and, indeed, of this parliament—because the committee members are exposed to extremely sensitive briefings, particularly in relation to organised crime and investigations under way.
This particular inquiry was no exception. It was important that the witnesses that came before the inquiry could be confident and assured that the evidence they gave, albeit in camera, would not find its way into the media and that it would remain confidential. Yet I have to say that this committee, during this inquiry, suffered a number of leaks—or, to give it its technical term, unauthorised disclosures of material regarding its proceedings. Inevitably they always turned up in the Melbourne Age.
Overall, the disclosures have hurt the committee's reputation as a watchdog over the National Crime Authority. Nevertheless, on each occasion—and I am referring to previous unauthorised disclosures—the committee secretary wrote to committee members asking them whether they had any further knowledge to add regarding the unauthorised disclosure, but we could not progress the matter any further than that. It was then judged by the committee that each individual unauthorised disclosure was not material in itself and, therefore, on those occasions we did not refer matters to the Committee of Privileges.
But the problem was that each disclosure added up to hurt the committee and to create a very material situation. Therefore, when it came to the unauthorised publication on 6 April in the Age newspaper, with this series of unauthorised disclosures behind us, the 
 committee simply could not ignore the matter any further. A description of the contents of the report and its major recommendations appeared in an article on the front page of the Age of 6 April headlined, `Call to boost NCA's powers'. This was on the day the report was tabled. No respondent and no committee member has been able to explain the unauthorised disclosures.
Therefore, at a meeting on 25 June, the committee resolved that the disclosure had a tendency to substantially interfere with its work and that accordingly the matter should be referred to the Senate Committee of Privileges. I believe it would have been negligent of the committee to have done otherwise.
It can be said that, frequently, committee reports around this place are leaked on the day of their tabling. There is evidence of that. It is true that the culprits are rarely, if ever, found. This should not lead to an attitude that no action should be taken, least of all with this particular committee dealing with the National Crime Authority, because the cascading effects and the consequences of being blase about these matters, about the fact we have been unable to find the person, are obvious. Discredit will be brought to the committee system.
To give a measure of the importance of this matter and why we are referring it to the Privileges Committee, I quote from the Age, which indeed had the report lock, stock and barrel. The opening lines read:
A parliamentary committee has recommended substantially greater powers for the National Crime Authority and has cleared the organisation of running a political vendetta against the Melbourne businessman Mr John Elliott. . . 
The committee has rejected Mr Elliott's claim that he was the victim of a politically inspired vendetta and that the NCA knowingly acted illegally.
From there it quotes directly from the report:
. . . is of the view that there is no evidence that the vigorous investigation and prosecution reflects a vendetta.
Then it quotes five recommendations straight from the report itself. Therefore, the NCA committee unanimously has considered the matter material and worthy of referral to the Privileges Committee.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Privileges Committee</title>,Committees,15,1,speech
"Ray, Sen Robert",ALP,1998-07-02,"—The opposition will be supporting the reference of this matter to the Senate Committee of Privileges. The normal procedure, when matters of this nature arise, is that the committee, or a representative of the committee, writes to Madam President laying out the case. Madam President normally seeks some advice from the expert on privileges matters—usually the Clerk of the Senate—and then reflects on the matter and determines whether it should be given precedence. Giving a matter precedence means that this chamber must, in fairly short order, debate it. If a matter was not given precedence, it would sit on the Notice Paper  either to come up in general business or, quite possibly, to be subject to a contingent notice of motion, the suspension of standing orders, precedence and debate at that stage. So it is a long and harrowing process if Madam President does not give a matter precedence.
There is no doubt that in the last two years the President of the Senate has taken these matters seriously and has given them serious consideration. In fact, I endorse all her adjudications on these matters. She has got it right every time. On this occasion she has again indicated that there is enough substance to the proposition put forward by the NCA committee to at least have precedence to go to the Privileges Committee. This is not an endorsement by Madam President that it must go. There is simply a prima facie case and enough elements in it to justify consideration by this chamber. The opposition generally takes the view that these matters should be dealt with on a formal basis, but they do not necessarily require debate.
On the last occasion a matter such as this came up, the matter was raised with Madam President. She gave it precedence, but it was not regarded as formal in this chamber. The reason it was not regarded as formal in this chamber and the reason the mover of the motion before us voted it down was that it directly concerned one of his colleagues. They were not even willing, despite the absolute precision of standing orders regarding the declaration of pecuniary interests, for the Privileges Committee to examine the matter 
 because it affected one of their own colleagues. This was one of the worst divisions the Senate has had in its history. A prima facie case was made but, for partisan, petty and political reasons, the coalition combined to defeat at least a reference and an investigation by the Privileges Committee.
In my view—I can now comment because the matter is not before the Privileges Committee—it may well have been a matter that, in the end, would have advantaged the minister concerned to have it go to the Privileges Committee. A very close reading of standing orders, especially in terms of intent, could well have meant the Privileges Committee bringing back a report that cleared that minister of contempt of the Senate. But in their rush to try to protect an embattled minister, all principle went out the window. No consideration to the convention of the Senate and to the rules of behaviour was to be countenanced. Because a colleague was under fire they threw all that out the window.
We on this side of the chamber are supposed to be the group in this parliament that are least hidebound by convention and rules. It is always interesting that, when it comes to the crunch, we on this side of the chamber tend to obey the conventions. We do not appoint the Senator Fields and Senator Buntons of the world. We do not rat on agreements about elections of deputy presidents. We do not do those things. In the end, when push comes to shove, the coalition just cannot help itself.
What Senator McGauran raises today is not a novel situation. It is becoming a perpetual situation, which I think he somewhat indicated in his speech. The leaking of committee reports or details of what is occurring in committees is an ongoing problem to the Senate. Let me tell the Senate, in general terms, what the Privileges Committee is up to at this point, without disclosing any of the details. We have five such cases before us at the moment and we are in the process—hopefully this afternoon—of resolving those cases to a point where we can advance the matter. In addition to that, we have tried to write a first chapter to the report covering the other five cases reiterating what the principles 
 should be in the behaviour of senators, to draw it to their attention and to then trust that they will obey that guidance in future.
People may say that this is long overdue, but we are going to reiterate that it is not acceptable behaviour to leak committee reports. Senator McGauran has given evidence today that those leaks have materially affected the workings of a committee. I assume, from what he said, that an element of mistrust has developed on the committee. Most committees in this parliament try to avoid high partisanship. On certain occasions it is absolutely impossible to do so. Let us be honest: sometimes we go in with our mind made up, we do our duty and we all accept the ground rules. But on many other occasions we go in with an open mind and, quite often, it stays open throughout the whole inquiry. Senators across the whole spectrum of the Senate come together, look at matters as objectively as they can, and bring down their findings.
When you look back over the history of the committee system of the Senate, you find that it does set an example to many legislatures around the world. I have often said that this place is nothing more than an anarchistic swamp, but that is mostly in the way this chamber operates. Outside the chamber, many of the things adopted by the Senate, in its committee system and its reports, have contributed enormously both to scrutiny, to policy development and to resolving what were intractable issues by way of agreement.
The Senate estimates committee process represents one of the finest scrutiny bodies of any legislature in the world. I have always said that, even if I could gain 39 votes in this chamber, I would never vote to abolish the estimates process. In my experience, it keeps the departments honest, it keeps ministers up to the mark. You say to yourself that you do not want to do this because, during the estimates committee process, if Senator Patterson or Senator McGauran were in opposition, they would catch us red handed, and vice versa. So we must make sure that the committee system operates well. Senator McGauran made assertions here today that the NCA committee will not work well in the future because it lacks basic trust amongst its members because 
 elements of its work continually are out in the public domain. He has talked about the article in the Age on 6 April, which does not come to mind, but I certainly would have read it at the time and expressed surprise at the detail of that report.
I turn to some of the difficulties and problems with Senator McGauran's motion. Senator McGauran has informed us that the secretary of the committee has written to all members about this unauthorised disclosure. Well, congratulations to the committee and to the secretary. Too often, the trend is that the committee refers these matters to a privileges committee without trying some investigation themselves. With this motion, we have the first building block placed there. The committee has done the appropriate thing; it has written to all members. I assume, although Senator McGauran did not say it, that all the responses were, `I didn't do it.' I assume that is what happened.
Now, all of a sudden, this goes to the Privileges Committee. What happens then, Senator McGauran? Can you give us a useful suggestion as to how we find out who the leaker is? We do not have the Federal Police, an inspector-general or a Star Chamber to be able to investigate. We cannot take a rubber hose to Senator McGauran and all his colleagues to find out and get them to fess up.
That is a problem, I think you would have to conclude—that it is very difficult for us to have better investigative powers in the committee. You cannot make a finding on deduction as to in whose interest the leak would be, because then you get the really smart ones leaking to embarrass their opponent because everyone will think their opponent leaked it. So we cannot do that.
If this is referred to the Privileges Committee, unless there is a break, unless there is some clue that we do not know about, we are going to struggle to find out who the leaker is. This does not mean that therefore Senator McGauran's reference is totally futile, because at least if the case is proved that there was a premature disclosure, the Privileges Committee can indicate that a contempt of the Senate has occurred. Unfortunately, it cannot appor 
 tion blame for it unless there is some evidentiary base as to who leaked this material.
It is not just a one-sided transaction. For this material to be published, a newspaper has to publish it; a journalist has to publish it. Being realistic, we know that in any circumstances at all there is no way we can pull the reporter in, find them in contempt and gaol them. That is not quite the way in which our political system works. Therefore, we have very limited powers. We can only really chase the leaker, not the person to whom the material was leaked.
We often send off a letter to journalists asking them why this occurred. You always get a three-page letter back from their editor accusing you of being Attila the Hun, saying, `How dare you, surely you know that journalists cannot disclose their sources.' All of those things come out in these proceedings and therefore make them very difficult to bring to a conclusion.
Finally, I hope that this chamber will get back to a situation, unless there are exceptional circumstances, in which, when Madam President gives precedence to a motion, we can knock it through on the nod. I still remain very disappointed that that did not occur in the previous debate in this chamber. That is one of the reasons why, in future, we may have to insist that these resolutions be moved in the way in which Senator McGauran has so moved today.
He has covered the key elements, which was essential before anyone could make a decision. He has said that there was an unauthorised disclosure. I will listen to the chamber later to see whether anyone will dispute that, but it appears to be so. He has said that it has materially affected the work of the committee and the trust within the committee. I accept that statement. He has also said that the secretary of the committee, at the behest of the committee, has written to all members and the indication is that no-one has owned up to this episode.
This proposed resolution should be carried today. It should be referred to the Privileges Committee. I have to be sanguine about the fact that, given our history, unless there is obvious evidence, it is very difficult to come 
 to a conclusion on these matters, other than to say that a contempt may have occurred. But to identify those guilty parties in the contempt is extremely difficult.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Privileges Committee</title>,Committees,15,1,speech
"Cooney, Sen Barney",ALP,1998-07-02,"—I add a few remarks to what Senator Ray has already said. He has brought forward a very important issue. It is an issue that we probably do not address often enough in this chamber. Senator McGauran has made out a prima facie case, which is the sort of case that should be made out, to send this matter to the Privileges Committee.
Senator Ray referred to the last issue that was before us, which was not sent off to the Privileges Committee. In a sense, that did raise a problem that, hopefully, will pass, and it is this: somehow the Privileges Committee was seen as a partisan committee. It is a political committee, there is no doubt about that, and there are people on it with strong political views. During my years as a member of that committee, it has never been a committee that has taken a particular approach for a political purpose. I know Senator Ray is the sort of person who would be upset, perhaps tears would even come to his eyes, if he thought that people regarded him as anything but a kind and tender person.
One of the reasons behind what happened last time was the perception that Senator Ray is a hard man, a man who would want to punish people if they did what was not right, a person who would allow his very great sense of justice to, in some way, be turned aside by a passion for revenge. That would be absolutely wrong, as you know, Madam Acting Deputy President. The point I want to make in all seriousness is that he chairs that committee fairly and well. On no occasion when I have been there have I heard him in any way take other than the approach which should be taken in a body of that sort.
Perhaps I can tell you the other people on that committee. There is Senator Coonan, Senator Sherry, Senator Eggleston, Senator Knowles, Senator Payne and me. They are all people whom we can trust, and it is an organisation that we can trust. One of the central figures in the way the Privileges Committee has worked over the years is Anne 
 Lynch, the Deputy Clerk. This is an appropriate time to pay her a great tribute for the way in which she has kept this committee going over the years—I think everybody would agree with that—and has made it a central committee of the Senate. The Privileges Committee does what many a committee does; it does the work that is appropriate for the Senate. I see Senator Heffernan over there nodding in agreement that he would like to see the Senate work as well as it could.
If I could echo what Senator Ray has said, the Senate committee system in Australia is an excellent system. It has attracted attention from around the world, and very positive attention at that. The Privileges Committee is a central part of that committee system. Senator McGauran presented his case well today and as it should be presented before the Senate.
—Jeff Kennett; remember Jeff Kennett?
—On this occasion, Senator Carr, we are not approaching this in a partisan way.
Honourable senators interjecting—
—We are listening to the material that is put before this Senate and we, not as party political people but as people who have a responsibility to the Senate, will do something about it.
Honourable senators interjecting—
—The best safeguard for the committee system is a sense of responsibility on the part of the Senate itself. In the end—
Honourable senators interjecting—
—Order!
—Thank you for calling for order, Madam Acting Deputy President, because the Senate can get unruly. I noticed you, this morning, bringing the Senate into its proper state. This leads on to the next point I want to make. It is only through a sense of honour and—
—Integrity.
—And integrity and a sense of what we need and owe to the Senate 
 that this system can work. It is a pity that anything concerning a senator has to go before the Privileges Committee because our own sense of the responsibility that lies on our shoulders, as elected members of the various states and territories which we come from, is what should keep us going, rather than the threat of penalties.
Perhaps I will pause there because I cannot remember the Privileges Committee handing out a penalty that, in itself, would seem to be terribly severe. Nevertheless, the finding is often a significant issue for people. Just in recent times we have made findings, and bodies against whom we have made the findings have accepted them and acted accordingly. That, I hope, is not yet a problem that has fallen upon any of the senators I can think of in this chamber. If it did, I hope they would accept that finding in a way that this chamber has assessed.
—And do you think the committee should have the power of imprisonment, Senator Cooney?
—I have been asked: does this committee have the power of imprisonment?
—No; should it have?
—In fact, it does not have, but the Senate does. On the recommendation of the Privileges Committee, the Senate can imprison people, Senator Cook.
—Do you think that is right, though?
—Depending on the severity of the offence—
—Senator, it would be better if you did not respond to the injections and if you kept to the topic.
—Thank you for bringing me back to the proper matter that is before me, Madam Acting Deputy President. I get distracted by these people. Thank you for bringing me back to a proper balance.
It would be a pity if ever the situation arose in this chamber where people use the Senate, through the processes of the Committee of Privileges, in a political way. What I mean by 
 that is not in a party political way but by bringing actions against people as a payback or as a means of embarrassing them. The conduct of the Privileges Committee should be on a high plane. It has been on a high plane and it is intended, as far as the committee members go, that they be kept on that sort of plane.
I say to Senator McGauran through you, Madam Acting Deputy President, that the matter about to go before the Privileges Committee on his instance will get the thorough, fair and learned consideration that it deserves.
There is only one thing I worry about with the committee: it takes a long time, because of the nature of things, to get matters disposed of. I do not know the way round this, because all members of the committee are very busy. I do think it is not a good thing to have people waiting for a long while for a decision about their fate. I would like to have a discussion about that at some time, because it is wrong that people are left in suspense for the period they are. I will talk to Senator Ray and the other members of the committee about that, but that is the one problem I can see with its present functions.
It is said by Senator Ray that we do not have the means of obtaining the information that we need as a committee—if we are going to impose anything on anybody to get them to produce evidence, we would have to bring them back to this chamber. That is awkward. I think that by and large it has worked well. The Deputy Clerk, Anne Lynch, is one of the main reasons—if not the main reason—over the years that the committee has kept going. It is running very well at the moment. In doing that, it is carrying on a tradition that has been set in the past by very learned people, and I can see that it will continue in the future. We hope to give your matter, Senator McGauran, the very proper consideration it deserves.

This is not an endorsement by Madam President that it must go. There is simply a prima facie case and enough elements in it to justify consideration by this chamber. The opposition generally takes the view that these matters should be dealt with on a formal basis, but they do not necessarily require debate.
On the last occasion a matter such as this came up, the matter was raised with Madam President. She gave it precedence, but it was not regarded as formal in this chamber. The reason it was not regarded as formal in this chamber and the reason the mover of the motion before us voted it down was that it directly concerned one of his colleagues. They were not even willing, despite the absolute precision of standing orders regarding the declaration of pecuniary interests, for the Privileges Committee to examine the matter 
 because it affected one of their own colleagues. This was one of the worst divisions the Senate has had in its history. A prima facie case was made but, for partisan, petty and political reasons, the coalition combined to defeat at least a reference and an investigation by the Privileges Committee.
In my view—I can now comment because the matter is not before the Privileges Committee—it may well have been a matter that, in the end, would have advantaged the minister concerned to have it go to the Privileges Committee. A very close reading of standing orders, especially in terms of intent, could well have meant the Privileges Committee bringing back a report that cleared that minister of contempt of the Senate. But in their rush to try to protect an embattled minister, all principle went out the window. No consideration to the convention of the Senate and to the rules of behaviour was to be countenanced. Because a colleague was under fire they threw all that out the window.
We on this side of the chamber are supposed to be the group in this parliament that are least hidebound by convention and rules. It is always interesting that, when it comes to the crunch, we on this side of the chamber tend to obey the conventions. We do not appoint the Senator Fields and Senator Buntons of the world. We do not rat on agreements about elections of deputy presidents. We do not do those things. In the end, when push comes to shove, the coalition just cannot help itself.
What Senator McGauran raises today is not a novel situation. It is becoming a perpetual situation, which I think he somewhat indicated in his speech. The leaking of committee reports or details of what is occurring in committees is an ongoing problem to the Senate. Let me tell the Senate, in general terms, what the Privileges Committee is up to at this point, without disclosing any of the details. We have five such cases before us at the moment and we are in the process—hopefully this afternoon—of resolving those cases to a point where we can advance the matter. In addition to that, we have tried to write a first chapter to the report covering the other five cases reiterating what the principles 
 should be in the behaviour of senators, to draw it to their attention and to then trust that they will obey that guidance in future.
People may say that this is long overdue, but we are going to reiterate that it is not acceptable behaviour to leak committee reports. Senator McGauran has given evidence today that those leaks have materially affected the workings of a committee. I assume, from what he said, that an element of mistrust has developed on the committee. Most committees in this parliament try to avoid high partisanship. On certain occasions it is absolutely impossible to do so. Let us be honest: sometimes we go in with our mind made up, we do our duty and we all accept the ground rules. But on many other occasions we go in with an open mind and, quite often, it stays open throughout the whole inquiry. Senators across the whole spectrum of the Senate come together, look at matters as objectively as they can, and bring down their findings.
When you look back over the history of the committee system of the Senate, you find that it does set an example to many legislatures around the world. I have often said that this place is nothing more than an anarchistic swamp, but that is mostly in the way this chamber operates. Outside the chamber, many of the things adopted by the Senate, in its committee system and its reports, have contributed enormously both to scrutiny, to policy development and to resolving what were intractable issues by way of agreement.
The Senate estimates committee process represents one of the finest scrutiny bodies of any legislature in the world. I have always said that, even if I could gain 39 votes in this chamber, I would never vote to abolish the estimates process. In my experience, it keeps the departments honest, it keeps ministers up to the mark. You say to yourself that you do not want to do this because, during the estimates committee process, if Senator Patterson or Senator McGauran were in opposition, they would catch us red handed, and vice versa. So we must make sure that the committee system operates well. Senator McGauran made assertions here today that the NCA committee will not work well in the future because it lacks basic trust amongst its members because 
 elements of its work continually are out in the public domain. He has talked about the article in the Age on 6 April, which does not come to mind, but I certainly would have read it at the time and expressed surprise at the detail of that report.
I turn to some of the difficulties and problems with Senator McGauran's motion. Senator McGauran has informed us that the secretary of the committee has written to all members about this unauthorised disclosure. Well, congratulations to the committee and to the secretary. Too often, the trend is that the committee refers these matters to a privileges committee without trying some investigation themselves. With this motion, we have the first building block placed there. The committee has done the appropriate thing; it has written to all members. I assume, although Senator McGauran did not say it, that all the responses were, `I didn't do it.' I assume that is what happened.
Now, all of a sudden, this goes to the Privileges Committee. What happens then, Senator McGauran? Can you give us a useful suggestion as to how we find out who the leaker is? We do not have the Federal Police, an inspector-general or a Star Chamber to be able to investigate. We cannot take a rubber hose to Senator McGauran and all his colleagues to find out and get them to fess up.
That is a problem, I think you would have to conclude—that it is very difficult for us to have better investigative powers in the committee. You cannot make a finding on deduction as to in whose interest the leak would be, because then you get the really smart ones leaking to embarrass their opponent because everyone will think their opponent leaked it. So we cannot do that.
If this is referred to the Privileges Committee, unless there is a break, unless there is some clue that we do not know about, we are going to struggle to find out who the leaker is. This does not mean that therefore Senator McGauran's reference is totally futile, because at least if the case is proved that there was a premature disclosure, the Privileges Committee can indicate that a contempt of the Senate has occurred. Unfortunately, it cannot appor 
 tion blame for it unless there is some evidentiary base as to who leaked this material.
It is not just a one-sided transaction. For this material to be published, a newspaper has to publish it; a journalist has to publish it. Being realistic, we know that in any circumstances at all there is no way we can pull the reporter in, find them in contempt and gaol them. That is not quite the way in which our political system works. Therefore, we have very limited powers. We can only really chase the leaker, not the person to whom the material was leaked.
We often send off a letter to journalists asking them why this occurred. You always get a three-page letter back from their editor accusing you of being Attila the Hun, saying, `How dare you, surely you know that journalists cannot disclose their sources.' All of those things come out in these proceedings and therefore make them very difficult to bring to a conclusion.
Finally, I hope that this chamber will get back to a situation, unless there are exceptional circumstances, in which, when Madam President gives precedence to a motion, we can knock it through on the nod. I still remain very disappointed that that did not occur in the previous debate in this chamber. That is one of the reasons why, in future, we may have to insist that these resolutions be moved in the way in which Senator McGauran has so moved today.
He has covered the key elements, which was essential before anyone could make a decision. He has said that there was an unauthorised disclosure. I will listen to the chamber later to see whether anyone will dispute that, but it appears to be so. He has said that it has materially affected the work of the committee and the trust within the committee. I accept that statement. He has also said that the secretary of the committee, at the behest of the committee, has written to all members and the indication is that no-one has owned up to this episode.
This proposed resolution should be carried today. It should be referred to the Privileges Committee. I have to be sanguine about the fact that, given our history, unless there is obvious evidence, it is very difficult to come 
 to a conclusion on these matters, other than to say that a contempt may have occurred. But to identify those guilty parties in the contempt is extremely difficult.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reference</title>,Committees,15,2,speech
"Cooney, Sen Barney",ALP,1998-07-02,"—I add a few remarks to what Senator Ray has already said. He has brought forward a very important issue. It is an issue that we probably do not address often enough in this chamber. Senator McGauran has made out a prima facie case, which is the sort of case that should be made out, to send this matter to the Privileges Committee.
Senator Ray referred to the last issue that was before us, which was not sent off to the Privileges Committee. In a sense, that did raise a problem that, hopefully, will pass, and it is this: somehow the Privileges Committee was seen as a partisan committee. It is a political committee, there is no doubt about that, and there are people on it with strong political views. During my years as a member of that committee, it has never been a committee that has taken a particular approach for a political purpose. I know Senator Ray is the sort of person who would be upset, perhaps tears would even come to his eyes, if he thought that people regarded him as anything but a kind and tender person.
One of the reasons behind what happened last time was the perception that Senator Ray is a hard man, a man who would want to punish people if they did what was not right, a person who would allow his very great sense of justice to, in some way, be turned aside by a passion for revenge. That would be absolutely wrong, as you know, Madam Acting Deputy President. The point I want to make in all seriousness is that he chairs that committee fairly and well. On no occasion when I have been there have I heard him in any way take other than the approach which should be taken in a body of that sort.
Perhaps I can tell you the other people on that committee. There is Senator Coonan, Senator Sherry, Senator Eggleston, Senator Knowles, Senator Payne and me. They are all people whom we can trust, and it is an organisation that we can trust. One of the central figures in the way the Privileges Committee has worked over the years is Anne 
 Lynch, the Deputy Clerk. This is an appropriate time to pay her a great tribute for the way in which she has kept this committee going over the years—I think everybody would agree with that—and has made it a central committee of the Senate. The Privileges Committee does what many a committee does; it does the work that is appropriate for the Senate. I see Senator Heffernan over there nodding in agreement that he would like to see the Senate work as well as it could.
If I could echo what Senator Ray has said, the Senate committee system in Australia is an excellent system. It has attracted attention from around the world, and very positive attention at that. The Privileges Committee is a central part of that committee system. Senator McGauran presented his case well today and as it should be presented before the Senate.
—Jeff Kennett; remember Jeff Kennett?
—On this occasion, Senator Carr, we are not approaching this in a partisan way.
Honourable senators interjecting—
—We are listening to the material that is put before this Senate and we, not as party political people but as people who have a responsibility to the Senate, will do something about it.
Honourable senators interjecting—
—The best safeguard for the committee system is a sense of responsibility on the part of the Senate itself. In the end—
Honourable senators interjecting—
—Order!
—Thank you for calling for order, Madam Acting Deputy President, because the Senate can get unruly. I noticed you, this morning, bringing the Senate into its proper state. This leads on to the next point I want to make. It is only through a sense of honour and—
—Integrity.
—And integrity and a sense of what we need and owe to the Senate 
 that this system can work. It is a pity that anything concerning a senator has to go before the Privileges Committee because our own sense of the responsibility that lies on our shoulders, as elected members of the various states and territories which we come from, is what should keep us going, rather than the threat of penalties.
Perhaps I will pause there because I cannot remember the Privileges Committee handing out a penalty that, in itself, would seem to be terribly severe. Nevertheless, the finding is often a significant issue for people. Just in recent times we have made findings, and bodies against whom we have made the findings have accepted them and acted accordingly. That, I hope, is not yet a problem that has fallen upon any of the senators I can think of in this chamber. If it did, I hope they would accept that finding in a way that this chamber has assessed.
—And do you think the committee should have the power of imprisonment, Senator Cooney?
—I have been asked: does this committee have the power of imprisonment?
—No; should it have?
—In fact, it does not have, but the Senate does. On the recommendation of the Privileges Committee, the Senate can imprison people, Senator Cook.
—Do you think that is right, though?
—Depending on the severity of the offence—
—Senator, it would be better if you did not respond to the injections and if you kept to the topic.
—Thank you for bringing me back to the proper matter that is before me, Madam Acting Deputy President. I get distracted by these people. Thank you for bringing me back to a proper balance.
It would be a pity if ever the situation arose in this chamber where people use the Senate, through the processes of the Committee of Privileges, in a political way. What I mean by 
 that is not in a party political way but by bringing actions against people as a payback or as a means of embarrassing them. The conduct of the Privileges Committee should be on a high plane. It has been on a high plane and it is intended, as far as the committee members go, that they be kept on that sort of plane.
I say to Senator McGauran through you, Madam Acting Deputy President, that the matter about to go before the Privileges Committee on his instance will get the thorough, fair and learned consideration that it deserves.
There is only one thing I worry about with the committee: it takes a long time, because of the nature of things, to get matters disposed of. I do not know the way round this, because all members of the committee are very busy. I do think it is not a good thing to have people waiting for a long while for a decision about their fate. I would like to have a discussion about that at some time, because it is wrong that people are left in suspense for the period they are. I will talk to Senator Ray and the other members of the committee about that, but that is the one problem I can see with its present functions.
It is said by Senator Ray that we do not have the means of obtaining the information that we need as a committee—if we are going to impose anything on anybody to get them to produce evidence, we would have to bring them back to this chamber. That is awkward. I think that by and large it has worked well. The Deputy Clerk, Anne Lynch, is one of the main reasons—if not the main reason—over the years that the committee has kept going. It is running very well at the moment. In doing that, it is carrying on a tradition that has been set in the past by very learned people, and I can see that it will continue in the future. We hope to give your matter, Senator McGauran, the very proper consideration it deserves.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,1998-07-02,"—The Democrats support the Veterans' Entitlements Amendment (Gold Card) Bill 1998 . This legislation relates to extending entitlements to veterans in relation to the gold card. We believe that it is a good thing. However, I would like to briefly mention the situation facing Vietnam veterans. I realise that, as with all things, affordability is an issue, but I urge the government to give greater attention to ensuring that the needs of Vietnam veterans are also adequately addressed.
I have spoken in this chamber a couple of times before about the fairly extensive and ongoing evidence of widespread health problems with Vietnam veterans and, just as importantly, their families, partners and children. There are not just physical illnesses with their children but also, unfortunately, instances of suicide. This is over and above 
 the normal range of illness in the community, which is evidence that the problems that Vietnam veterans have faced and the damage that has been caused to many of them are at risk of being extended to future generations. I am sure that all senators and Australians would agree that that is something we need to avoid at all costs.
I ask that the government, in its ongoing attention to veterans' issues, gives greater attention to the very clear and real needs, and obviously still inadequately met needs, of the Vietnam veterans community. Today I received a letter from the Vietnam Veterans' Federation of Australia relating to the most recent Vietnam veterans healthy study. It deals with illnesses in veterans and veterans' partners, which clearly demonstrates again the greater instance of ill-health amongst Vietnam veterans and their partners and children.
It also contains a repeated request to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Mr Bruce Scott, that the wives of Vietnam veterans whose husbands are currently in receipt of a gold card should themselves be granted a gold treatment card because of the ill-health which results from their caring role. The letter has various attachments indicating the reality of that ill-health. Whilst I commend the government for its move in this regard, I ask that it give greater attention to the needs of Vietnam veterans and their families and look at more ways of addressing the clear needs that are still not being adequately met.",SENATE,<title>VETERANS' ENTITLEMENTS AMENDMENT (GOLD CARD) BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,18,1,speech
"Tambling, Sen Grant",CLP,1998-07-02,"—I accept the comments and support of both the opposition and the Australian Democrats. We all recognise that it is important that there be an ongoing commitment to our veterans. The government is certainly very deeply conscious of the gratitude to Australian veterans for their courage, dedication and sacrifice. The particular initiatives outlined in this legislation relate to the extension of gold card health benefits to 50,000 veterans. It will mean an additional net cost to the Commonwealth of $508 million over four years. This new initiative has not been funded at the expense of existing benefits.
I appreciate the comments that the Australian Democrats have raised with regard to Vietnam. The government is aware that many deserving groups of people are also seeking access to the gold card, such as veterans from the Korean and Vietnam wars. Already 8,000 Korean-Malay veterans and 12,000 Vietnam veterans have been granted the gold card as a result of their individual level of war-caused disability or their financial situation. However, World War II veterans are generally older than their counterparts from the Korean and Vietnam wars and their health needs at this time are generally considered to be significant. The extension of the gold card to other groups of veterans will remain under review. Any views expressed by the veteran community will be taken into account. I appreciate the support of all the parties in the Senate.

"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,1998-07-02,"—The Aviation Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1997  makes a number of amendments to a range of aviation legislation, all of which are supported by the opposition. The amendments to the Air Navigation Act 1920 seek to clarify responsibility for sterile security areas at airports. The amendments to the Civil Aviation (Carriers' Liability) Act 1959 ensure that de facto spouses are eligible for compensation in the event of their partner's death or injury as a result of an air accident.
The main effect of the amendments to the International Airservices Commission Act 1992 transfers the role of allocating Australia's fifth freedom rights—that is, those between two points outside Australia; the so-called `beyond rights'—from the department to the International Airservices Commission, with appropriate grandfathering of existing rights for five years. There are also a number of amendments of a technical nature.
The amendments to the Airports Act 1996 and the Airports (Transitional) Act 1996 are largely of a technical nature, including those which are covered by the amendments to be moved by the government today, clearing up some problems that have arisen during the airport sales process. The bill also seeks to amend the Air Services Act 1995 to make promoting and fostering civil aviation in Australia a function of Airservices Australia. 
 The Labor Party supports this objective and this amendment; however, we wonder whether the government does.
Senators will no doubt recall the farce that surrounded the membership of the CASA board during 1996 and 1997, instigated by the disgraced former transport minister, Mr Sharp, which ultimately led to the resignation of the board of CASA and the Director of Aviation Safety, Mr Leroy Keith, an aviation regulator held in high regard around the world. Sadly, Mr Keith has now left Australia and is probably lost to our aviation industry forever.
Only in the last week have we seen the re-emergence of the doctrine of `affordable safety', with the proposed closure of CASA offices at Townsville, Archerfield, Coffs Harbour, Tamworth, Wagga, Jandakot, Moorabbin, Parafield and Darwin. Over 100 CASA staff are employed in these offices, and this is yet another example of the Howard government withdrawing services to regional Australia. This will not in any way improve safety outcomes in the Australian aviation industry and shows the total lack of commitment of this government to, in the words of the bill before us today, `promoting and fostering civil aviation in Australia'.
The opposition has been informed that this campaign of office closures is being developed by a Mr Wes Willoughby. We have been told that Mr Willoughby, who appears to occupy a new position of executive director at CASA, was appointed by the Chair of CASA, Dick Smith, only recently, after having been retained as a consultant for some time. Mr Willoughby was made redundant from the Civil Aviation Authority when Dick Smith was last in charge of aviation safety regulation in Australia. Not surprisingly, questions have been asked about the manner of Mr Willoughby's appointment. It is also alleged that Mr Willoughby is being paid $1,000 a day in this new role.
These rumours do have some currency within the industry, so I think it would be helpful for all concerned if the minister in the chamber at the moment could contact the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, Mr Vaile, and find out for me precisely what conditions Mr Willoughby is employed 
 under and how he was appointed. If these allegations are true, this is the third strike for Dick Smith. First we had the policy of no mandatory transponders in Class E airspace, the so-called see and avoid policy, which was ultimately abandoned because of industry pressure. Secondly, we had the advice to CASA staff that if they were not happy about how safety related complaints were handled by their superiors, they should go to the media. Now we have a program of office closures led by a person reputedly appointed under strange circumstances and being paid a substantial per diem. All of these actions have damaged our safety standards and our international safety reputation.
This government drove the previous CASA board and Leroy Keith from office for much less. Mr Vaile needs to think very hard about what will come next and at what point he must act in relation to the behaviour of the CASA board.
I would now like to turn to Airservices Australia. This is the public sector organisation that provides air traffic control and fire and rescue services at airports. It is a body that performs what is essentially a safety and regulation function—it is a bit like the local traffic police and fire brigade at an airport. In a statement yesterday in relation to terminal navigation services, the minister, Mr Vaile, said:
The owners of leased Federal airports can negotiate with Airservices for the supply of these services under commercial contract or by another service operator.
It is clear from this that private airport operators are now the ones making the decisions as to who provides air traffic control services at airports and that private companies will end up policing our skies.
Australia's airspace is a public good, and it should be regulated and policed by public bodies. Handing air traffic control over to private companies means less public accountability and more incentives to cut corners on safety. What follows the privatisation of Airservices, an aviation safety regime where if you do not like what you get from CASA you can try another? A Labor government will retain air traffic control in public 
 hands. The Howard government is drastically reducing aviation safety resources in order to reduce the costs of certain sectors of the aviation industry. The safety of Australian travellers and the general public is under threat because of the government's decisions.
The government's regional aviation policy is a total shambles, and this is not better illustrated than by the case of Launceston. As of yesterday, the terminal navigation charge at Launceston—that is essentially the charge for using the control tower—will increase by a massive 30 per cent. This is a result of the move to location specific pricing. The total charges levied by Airservices Australia for a typical commercial flight from Melbourne to Launceston will increase by 9.9 per cent and from Sydney to Launceston by 8.1 per cent. At the same time the charge for a typical flight between Sydney and Melbourne will fall by a staggering 14.8 per cent. So, again, we have the Howard government slugging regional Australia by increasing charges to access essential services.
But the problems at Launceston are greater than that. There is a small business called Bass Flight Services that provides flight training in Launceston. As a result of the new charging regime, their hourly costs for operating a small light training aircraft will increase by over $20. They have indicated that they will either have to move to another airport or close down. They and many other flight training operators have approached the government to fix this problem. I am told that those who have approached Minister Vaile's office and spoken to his aviation adviser have been hung up on. No doubt this is another example of the government's efforts in promoting and fostering civil aviation in Australia.
At the 11th hour, the minister backed down saying in a press release yesterday, the day the charges were to come into force, that Airservices would waive the charges during a transitional period. There was no mention of how long this period might be or what might determine how it will end. This looks very much to me like a stay of execution, not a pardon. But I do say this: I do hope that Minister Vaile will now actually consult with 
 the aviation training industry prior to any further actions in this regard—something he should have done in the first place.
The Labor Party is committed to the promotion of flight training as an industry in Australia and no more so than in Launceston. Recently, whilst acting as shadow minister for transport, I announced Labor's intention to work towards developing Launceston as an aviation training centre. I have had very useful discussions with both the chief executive officer of the airport and the principal of the Australian Maritime College and Labor's discussions with these and other organisations are ongoing.
The proposals have even received the grudging support of the member for Bass, Warwick Smith. But Mr Smith is a minister in a government that is putting up charges at Launceston airport, as well as other locations around the country, and is cutting regulatory services which will not only inhibit the growth of the industry but ultimately cost lives. This government is not about `promoting and fostering civil aviation in Australia'. We are. And, when elected at the next election, the people of Australia, particularly Launceston, will see the strength of that commitment.",SENATE,<title>AVIATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1997</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,22,1,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1998-07-02,"—As the Senate knows, I have amendments in circulation to the Aviation Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1997 . They were originally sent to both the government and the opposition many months ago. The revised amendments were circulated last week, as revised sheet No. 650, and I will be calling for a vote on the voices later in this debate. I thank both the government and the opposition for their willingness to consult on this bill and for their responses to my request for consideration of my amendments. I regret that I am unlikely to be successful. Nevertheless, I do thank them for their response.
Over the past decade we have all witnessed the debacle surrounding Sydney airport. I am sad to say that it is the view of the Democrats that a similar situation is developing at Perth airport, with the potential in due course to reach similar levels of community outrage and airport operational turmoil. Regrettably, the 
 failings of government that we have become familiar with in relation to the Sydney airport are again in evidence. These include a failure to ensure that adequate long-term planning is in place; a refusal to genuinely consult with and listen to local communities; a refusal to conduct proper and thorough environmental and social impact studies; a willingness to surreptitiously put commercially driven changes in place and then pretend to consult the public on how to ameliorate the effects of the changes; and a willingness to put commercial interests above the interests of sections of the community.
As governments move more and more in the direction of privatisation and deregulation, they are more and more inclined to back-pedal on community and environmental standards and safeguards so that what they call a `more attractive investment climate' can be created. We have had much reference to the backlash that is now starting to be exhibited in voting patterns, and I would suggest to you that this attitude helps create such a backlash.
This process of lowering or refusing to implement standards extends from the global, as in the case of greenhouse gas controls, right down to the very local. As is the case in so many cities, with Perth we have an increasingly busy airport which is now surrounded by residential suburbs in every direction. What was once a relatively countrified airport is now slap bang in the middle of suburbia. If the planners and the government will not keep houses away from airports, so allowing them to operate for 24 hours in reasonable freedom, then something has to give. People are more important than aeroplanes and a `quiet time' is essential.
Unlike the airports of the past, which were just arrival and departure points servicing a relatively modest number of flights, today's airports develop into small cities involving huge amounts of capital, extensive retail premises and ever increasing numbers of flights and people. Perth airport's new owners—and I remind the Senate that we opposed the privatisation of Perth airport as a monopoly—are on record as saying that they are working to `attract more aircraft, more pas 
 sengers and more freight'. That is quite a natural objective of someone who is in it for the money. Governments are presumably in office for the people, which is an entirely different objective. Those two objectives can conflict unless governments are more interested in markets and money than they should be, which is the case here.
A planning nightmare is rapidly unfolding, and no current government seems capable of coming to grips with it. Governments that are keen to allow real estate developers to pursue new housing developments right up to airport boundaries at the same time allow airport operators increasing flexibility in aircraft numbers and flight paths. It seems as though governments believe that, as long as they have created a climate for increasing money making, solving the problems that arise as a result can be ignored or left to the so-called marketplace. I remind you that markets are neutral—they have no morals.
Governments then shrug their shoulders and say what can they do about the problem they have created? We must ensure that proper regulation and controls are in place to protect the health, safety and quality of life of all the thousands of people who are affected by the operation of the Perth airport. The Perth problem is not as intractable as the Sydney problem. It is not as difficult as the Sydney problem. The purpose of our proposed amendments, after extensive consultation, was to get the government to move in time to address this problem.
The amendments I will move have four main purposes: firstly, to create a curfew at Perth airport between half past midnight and 5.30 in the morning, which would mean that for five hours at least a night there would be a `quiet time'—hardly an excessive request; secondly, to require the reinstatement of pre-existing Perth airport flight paths pending the completion of a full environmental impact statement and the preparation of an environmental management plan for the airport; thirdly, to create an ability to cap aircraft movements at Perth airport pending the completion of a full environmental and social impact statement and the preparation of an environmental management plan; and, fourth 
 ly, to prevent the use of Perth airport by training aircraft pending the completion of a full environmental impact statement and preparation of a management plan. I remind those senators who are not familiar with Perth that there are several other airports at which it is possible to conduct training.
Most senators will be well aware that provisions such as caps and curfews are either in place or under active consideration elsewhere in Australia and around the world. As Perth becomes increasingly busy, its residents should be afforded similar protections. We have at Pearce an airport which is solely dedicated to military purposes, and many airports around the world operate both military and civilian operations from a single airport. In Australia, Sydney, Adelaide and Essendon airports all have curfews, and the Howard government itself is committed to capping for Sydney airport.
The need for these amendments arises from a series of escalating changes introduced at Perth airport over the past couple of years. These changes have been introduced with insufficient genuine consultation and with only inadequate levels of environmental and social impact assessments. Two of the major changes and impacts now being felt around Perth airport are new flight paths introduced in December last year and the increasing presence of training aircraft and flights. The new flight paths, supposedly introduced as a trial and now seen as permanent, impose a wide range of health, safety and lifestyle impacts on a large number of suburbs and communities. As a result of these new flight paths, large numbers of non-jet aircraft are being sent over previously quiet suburbs. The increasing presence of training aircraft over densely populated areas surrounding the airport raises many concerns about safety as well as noise levels.
Other significant planned changes with serious implications include, firstly, a planned second wide-span runway for jet aircraft—and, as the Acting Deputy President, Senator McKiernan, would know, this has occasioned some debate and concern in the community at present; secondly, decreasing traffic controllers from four to two, at the same time as 
 ever increasing aircraft movements—and, as frequent flyers, the Acting Deputy President and I would be concerned if they reduced controllers below the safety level; and, thirdly, urban infill in the rural buffer surrounding Perth and Jandakot airports.
Large numbers of residents in a number of areas affected by new flight path regimes are now suffering stress and their lives and the lives of their families have been overshadowed by a dark cloud of noisy uncertainty as to what the future holds for them. Many residents have contacted my office to complain once they learned that I was interested in the topic. They speak, for example, of a barrage of noise commencing at 5 o'clock in the morning and involving up to 40 overflights by aircraft, many of them heading out on new flight paths to mining operations in the north of the state. It is just not fair. Many of those people bought their houses under the old regime, not the new regime, and they are experiencing a much diminished quality of life as a result. The necessity for a good sleep is something that every one of us understands. I cannot understand governments that cannot pay attention to it appropriately.
Residents speak of track shortening by aircraft traffic controllers, sending other aircraft over previously quiet areas. They speak of many planes flying overhead at below permissible altitudes. They speak of increasing numbers of training flights taking place over heavily populated residential areas and involving incessant noise as these planes circle overhead. As senators would be well aware, the smaller aircraft is often noisier than the bigger aircraft because of the noise of the engine concerned. They speak of the contrast between their lives a year ago when they lived with two to six flights a day and today when they regularly log 50 flights a day overhead. They speak of being or becoming increasingly tired and stressed. They cannot sleep. They say that they cannot sleep even when planes are not overhead because they are simply anticipating the renewed aircraft noise. This is intolerable.
They speak of constant excuses being made for all these impacts by airport managers. They rightly ask: if changes as major as these 
 can be imposed on so many people so quickly and with so little real notice, what will they try to impose in the future? My amendments attempt to give government the ability to deal with these issues. It is deeply concerning that bureaucrats in Canberra, who are not affected by the Canberra airport, give their ministers advice to ignore these kinds of protective devices and the ministers respond to them. I think it is atrocious.
Let me go back to the Sydney situation. I remind my fellow senators that the findings and recommendations of the Senate inquiry into aircraft and airport noise fell on deaf ears. That inquiry pulled together large amounts of information about the seriousness of the impacts of aircraft and airports, the inadequacies of government processes, and the need for careful assessments and planning. Many of the issues highlighted in that report apply directly to Perth, and many of the recommendations of that report should be implemented in the case of Perth.
One of the most fundamental elements of that inquiry was its exposure of the failings and duplicity surrounding the carrying out of environmental impact statements with regard to airports. Let us learn from the mistakes of the Sydney experience and ensure that they are not repeated in Perth. We can still avoid so much anger, frustration and despair if we put in place now the measures needed to address the legitimate concerns of residents. Those measures will simply mean that the airport we end up with will be an accepted and beneficial feature of Perth that is managed on an acceptable social basis, rather than being a deeply resented environmental health and safety hazard.
I tell both major parties that when you compete for government in any area affected by an airport you will continue to get stress, in terms of your political interaction with the people, for as long as they feel you do not attend to these needs appropriately and in a reasonable fashion.
I call on both state and Commonwealth governments to set up, as a matter of urgency, a high-level inquiry into environmentally and socially acceptable options for the future development needs of air transport in the 
 greater Perth region. As an important step in this direction, the amendments that I put forward were carefully compiled. I have here a social impact assessment report headed `Prioritising community consultation: a social impact assessment of the recent flight path changes over the shires of Kalamunda and Mundaring'. The research, commissioned by the Australian Democrats, was conducted by five persons in November 1997 for the Curtin University of Technology. Mr Acting Deputy President, I have approached both the opposition whip and the government member on duty earlier to request permission to table it. They have both agreed, and I therefore seek leave to table it.
Leave granted.
I advise the Senate that I do not intend to speak further to my amendments in the committee stage. I will move them and await the result on the voices.",SENATE,<title>AVIATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1997</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,22,1,speech
"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,1998-07-02,"—I too rise to speak to the Aviation Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1997 . Like my colleague Senator O'Brien, I would like to draw attention to the fact that, despite the minister having stated that this bill was for the purpose of promoting and fostering civil aviation in Australia, I too wonder, as a result of the debacle at Canberra airport with respect to terminal navigation service charges, whether or not that is the government's intent.
Looking at the situation at Canberra airport, we see with great regret that this government, through its inept imposition of its policies, has put the new owners of Canberra airport in an uncompetitive position with respect to TNS charges. This circumstance has quite some history, and I think shows flaws in both the process and the methodologies used by Airservices Australia in calculating the appropriate charge for Canberra airport. But, prior to looking at those processes and methodologies, we also need to revisit just how the status of Canberra airport was changed from its previously listed regional status to that of non-regional.
The implications of this were great for Canberra airport, specifically with respect to terminal navigation service charges, because 
 no longer was Canberra airport eligible under the subsidy provided by the government that would have capped TNS charges at $6.75. It is interesting to note at this point that Canberra International Airport Pty Ltd believes that it can provide the service for $6.25 per tonne. The situation that we now find ourselves in is that Airservices Australia has sought and gained the approval of the ACCC for the imposition of a charge, not $6.75 or indeed $6.25—as Canberra International Airport Pty Ltd indicated it could cost it out at—but at a rate of $8.34 per tonne.
Looking at the way Airservices Australia presented its arguments, it seems that it made a submission to the ACCC, prior to that determination on 26 June, seeking a charge of $9 per tonne. Airservices Australia has come up with this figure of $9 not on the basis of the calculations provided by the actual airport and the data available but on its own estimations of air traffic movements.
This draws into question the methodologies I spoke of earlier. The information and the way in which Airservices Australia prepared and documented its calculations for establishing the TNS charge appear to be fundamentally flawed. They appear to be based on an underestimated number of movements of aircraft traffic at the Canberra airport, hence shifting a greater burden onto that airport. I suppose what is almost unique about Canberra airport is that there is still a proportion of the military who utilise it and that that proportion, because of a structural barrier within the legislation, cannot be calculated into what a fair and appropriate charge would be with respect to TNS charges for Canberra airport.
The list goes on. My point is that, within the methodologies contained for the calculation of that $9 charge that Airservices Australia submitted to the ACCC, it varied greatly from Canberra International Airport Pty Ltd's own calculations, which showed that they could provide the same services for around $6.25. The upshot of this was that the ACCC supported, to a degree, the submission put before it by Airservices Australia to the tune of the new rate of $8.34. This represents a 60 per cent increase in the terminal navigation service charges for Canberra airport. I do not 
 see how this government can possibly argue that this represents any sort of progression, advancement or promotion of civil aviation in this country, particularly for an airport that was recently privatised and, therefore, is getting its grip on how it will be competitive as far as regional airports go.
I now turn to the process through which these new charges were established. Correspondence provided to me by Canberra International Airport Pty Ltd indicates that, although there is a requirement by Airservices Australia to consult with all parties in relation to this matter, it had great difficulty in getting access to Airservices Australia to present its case. It documents a series of attempts to make contact to discuss these issues to no avail, to the point where the final submission from Airservices Australia to the ACCC was presented without Canberra International Airport Pty Ltd being satisfied that it had had the opportunity to present its views and to enter some sort of discussion around the merits or otherwise of the data that Airservices had used to calculate the $9 rate.
Sadly, I believe that there has been some negligence on behalf of the ACCC because, between the time that the submission was received from Airservices Australia and the ACCC's decision on 26 June, no consultation took place with the Canberra International Airport Pty Ltd or the Canberra Airport Users Group—the group of very active general aviation users at that airport. In making that decision, the ACCC did so without having the opportunity to peruse or discuss with the proponents from the airport in depth the merits or otherwise of the case prepared by Airservices Australia, and as a result it has approved the $8.34 tonne rate at Canberra airport.
Interestingly, the ACCC did consider it to some degree and dropped it from $9 down to $8.34, which means that there must have been some assessment of the level of merit contained within the case of Airservices Australia, in the sense that it did reduce the amount somewhat. That indicates that perhaps the material put forward by Airservices Australia left something to be questioned in terms of its accuracy of content.
Nonetheless, this 60 per cent increase is now virtually unchallengeable. There is one opportunity for the Canberra Airport Users Group and the Canberra airport owners to challenge this, but it requires a judicial process and, no doubt, lengthy legal fees. In the meantime, this new charge came in on 1 July—yesterday—so already the Canberra airport is required to pay these increased charges.
We know that the move by the government or by Airservices Australia to location-specific pricing does have some justification, and it does make some effort to put in place more equitable charging regimes. However, in this particular circumstance, Canberra airport seems to be at a specific disadvantage. I know that other airports are affected in the same disadvantaged way, but I have chosen to focus my remarks on our local situation here in Canberra.
The latest development, with respect to this issue, is the minister's efforts to try to go into damage control. We have seen, just today and yesterday, the minister make some statements about the aviation training organisations, which were bound to be severely disaffected by the imposition of these massive charges. In fact, the minister appears to have back-pedalled somewhat and has provided some special rates. This, however, will not assist at all the general aviation airport users at Canberra airport. I have a letter from one of the Canberra airport users that I will refer to. It says:
As discussed, I understand that Transport Minister Vaile has made a statement today that the 13.09c/litre reduction in the Avgas levy will more than offset the introduction of the new Airservices charges. This is demonstrably false.
The basic trainer that my school uses is the Grumman Cheetah—it burns 35 lph. The saving in excise is, therefore, $4.5815 per hour. The additional cost of each landing (additional because we will still pay the airport owner landing fees) for Airservices new charges will be $8.32. The Cheetah weighs 998kg and the rate is $8.34/tonne.
Accordingly, if the aircraft only does one landing per hour—
and how realistic is that with a training school—
we are $3.74 per hour worse off. Obviously, if it does more landings we are more disadvantaged.
I think that sums up exactly, more than anything else, what the imposition is on Canberra airport users. Minister Vaile should at least acknowledge this situation and take it upon himself to intervene with respect to: firstly, Airservices Australia's calculations and methodologies in establishing that original $9 rate; secondly, the presence of the military at Canberra airport—which does have an impact on the aircraft movements and therefore the efficiencies contained within the air services and air traffic control staff efficiencies and so forth—and, thirdly, redressing the issue of Canberra's status as a regional airport, which is probably the most simple and practical way that they can avoid all of this kerfuffle and the unfair imposition of a 60 per cent increase in TNS service charges.
In summing up my comments I would like to make three points. First of all, this whole exercise has been presented by the minister as a gift to airport users—that in some way they will reduce their costs and create greater efficiencies. That may well be the case in some areas in the bigger airports, where I know the airline carriers have come to an agreement. Indeed, at Canberra airport the major airlines have come to an agreement and accepted the $8.34 charge, to the great disadvantage of every other airport user.
It must be said that, while there would be some advantage for the larger airlines in the larger airports because of the sheer economies of scale, it would be worth the trade-off of suffering a higher rate at a smaller airport like Canberra given the respective reduction in the number of air traffic movements. But that does not let the government off the hook when it comes to the disadvantage suffered by the local airport users and general aviation users at that airport. They cannot claim that there is an overall benefit to the civil aviation sector with respect to these changes.
Once again it is a regional airport. As I said, Canberra is one of about three or four that are in the same situation. It is regional airports and regional users that find themselves in exactly the position of being at a disadvantage. This is such a typical phenom 
 ena under this government. Yes, this bill is non-controversial. Yes, we are supporting it, but the changes contained in it do not excuse the minister for being so irresponsible as to allow this oversight to happen and to allow Airservices Australia to conduct themselves in the way they have with respect to Canberra airport.
Secondly, there is the issue of process. There are two examples throughout this whole mess where the Canberra Airport Users Group and the new owners of Canberra airport should have been provided with an opportunity to at least present their case. The first was in the preparation of the Airservices Australia submission and figures in arguing for the increase at Canberra airport. That was not available to these people. They have made representations to me that, in fact, they were dissatisfied with the response from Airservices Australia in their attempts to meet with them. The second was with respect to the ACCC in coming to their decision. There is a requirement that all interested parties be consulted with respect to that. That also did not occur.
The last point I want to make is what happens next? What happens next, given the processes, the legislative barriers that are in place and the inevitability of this decision sticking, will require a degree of either the minister intervening in this case with respect to Airservices Australia or Airservices Australia acknowledging that they were remiss in the way they calculated and applied the charges to Canberra airport in the first place and needing to revisit it. They are the two options. Everything else is pretty well inaccessible in terms of this particular group.
In the meantime, Canberra airport users will be suffering a 60 per cent increase in TNS charges. Some major airlines have agreed to that. For some it will mean the difference between their business being viable and their business going under. For others, it will make their experience at Canberra airport more expensive. Perhaps that will subsequently reduce their usage of that airport, hence putting Canberra, as I said at the start of my speech, at a distinct disadvantage. The government needs to think long and hard about its application of competitive policies, 
 particularly when it involves regional areas such as the Canberra region and putting our local airport at such a blatant and appalling disadvantage with respect to TNS charges.",SENATE,<title>AVIATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1997</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,22,1,speech

"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,1998-07-02,"—We have already had a second reading debate in respect of this measure. I do not really need to talk at length this afternoon in respect of it. It is a bill that, as I said last time, represents the fulfilment of yet another commitment made by the previous Labor government. It is quite interesting to note that, as we just about end the term of this government, this government is still introducing and debating legislation that was being prepared by the previous Labor government. We have never seen a government in the history of Australia run out of ideas so quickly. To keep its agenda running in this place, this government is still relying on legislation and ideas that we introduced some time ago.
As I say, it was an initiative that was heralded in the Justice Statement of May 1995 which, at that time, said:
. . . a forensic procedures bill to allow police to apply for court orders to take samples from suspected criminals for identification.
The statement went on to say:
The use of forensic samples is a very important tool in crime investigation. The compulsory taking of samples is necessary for effective law enforcement. The lack of such powers might advantage criminals. The Commonwealth legislation will build in substantial civil liberty safeguards.
As we promised in that statement, we did introduce a bill in 1995, and it passed through the House of House of Representatives. It was based on the Model Forensic Procedures Bill, developed by the Model Criminal Code Officers Committee of the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General. In turn, the model bill drew on the recommendations of the report on body samples and examinations, published by the Victorian Consultative Committee on Police Powers of Investigation. The 1995 bill found its way to the Senate. Following consideration by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee, a committee which reported in October 1995, the bill lapsed when the parliament was prorogued for the 1996 election.
The bill currently before us relies heavily on the 1995 bill, although amendments have been made adopting most of the 20 unanimous recommendations of the Senate committee. Only three of those recommendations have not been adopted in full. Recommendations 1 and 3 sought to limit the power to take body samples and to conduct examinations—particularly of breast swabs, in the case of recommendation 3—to circumstances in which the offence was punishable by imprisonment of five years or more. The government has applied this recommendation, save that it has reduced the scope of the exception to apply to indictable offences only. It also appears on the basis of further consideration that, in agreeing to recommendation 3, the Senate committee failed to fully appreciate the nature of the procedures contemplated by the relevant provisions. So we take no exception to the government's exemption or lack of implementation of recommendations 1 and 3.
Recommendation 2 prevented the taking of dental impressions. This recommendation was based on the state of forensic odontology as it was in 1995. We have been advised since that technological developments have been made that mean that less invasive techniques 
 for the taking of dental impressions are now available. As a consequence, we do not believe that that recommendation needs to be implemented either. The bill was in fact further referred to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Committee, which reported back in 1997. The majority on that committee, which included members of both the government and the opposition, suggested that only one further minor amendment should take place, and that amendment is now in fact incorporated.
More substantively, Senator Murray, on behalf of the Australian Democrats, has made a number of recommendations, the substance of which is now contained in the amendments moved on his behalf. I can say that, with the exception of amendment 14, which establishes a formal and broad review of the operation of the bill, the Labor Party will be opposing the amendments. I have no doubt in saying that they are born out of genuine concern by the Australian Democrats that some provisions in this bill may be abused. However, I believe that this view, well-meaning as it is, may in fact not be realised. But to the extent that we do have concerns, the broad review recommended and proposed by the Australian Democrats—as opposed to the more limited one recommended by the government—will also put sufficient leverage over the system to ensure that abuse is kept to a minimum. In conclusion, we do support the bill and we support only one of the Australian Democrats amendments, that being amendment No. 14.",SENATE,<title>CRIMES AMENDMENT (FORENSIC PROCEDURES) BILL 1997</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,23,1,speech
"Minchin, Sen Nick",LP,1998-07-02,"—The Crimes Amendment (Forensic Procedures) Bill 1997  has required a number of important issues to be addressed: firstly, striking an appropriate balance between the needs of law enforcement and the civil liberties of individuals; secondly, creating a Commonwealth law to end reliance on outdated and inconsistent state and territory provisions; and, thirdly, ensuring that the Commonwealth will have an influence over the rules that will apply to databases which will hold information derived from forensic procedures.
The bill has been subjected to very close scrutiny. The Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee considered it twice. Most recommendations of the committee's first report were accepted, and all of the majority's recommendations in the second report were accepted. The bill will be monitored to ensure that an appropriate balance between law enforcement and civil liberties is maintained, and it is proposed that that review occur after two years.
Senator Bolkus, on behalf of the opposition, has indicated support for the bill and has said that the opposition will in the end oppose all of the Democrats amendments except one, when they are considered during the committee stage. Senator Bolkus, I understand, believes that the protections in the bill are sufficient and that the Democrats' amendments, except for one, place unnecessary limitations.
However, Senator Murray, on behalf of the Democrats, believes that the bill raises some significant concerns. He has said that the bill significantly alters civil liberties but that, however, there is no information to suggest that advanced criminal detection rates will result from the bill. That is the position taken by the Democrats. The government would put the view that that is simply not correct. For example, there is increasingly more evidence to suggest that DNA profiling has dramatically improved the criminal detection rate in other countries.
Senator Murray also stated that the bill treats the question of relevance of evidence as a matter to be determined by the police, not the courts. In response, let me say that it has been a long-accepted practice that the police should, subject to strict rules, be able to pursue all relevant lines of inquiry in the investigation of an offence. If the police believe that it is necessary to obtain a forensic sample from a suspect, the bill's provisions provide the mechanism by which this can be performed. However, the bill ensures that the forensic procedure proposed to be conducted is performed only in accordance with strict safeguards. Those safeguards ensure that the information permitted to be gathered from a 
 person is relevant to the offence for which that person is a suspect.
Senator Murray also expressed the concern that the bill extends, presumably unduly, police powers. On behalf of the government I say that is not so. Australian Federal Police officers have similar powers available to them under state and territory laws. Enactment of the bill will ensure that suspects for Commonwealth offences will have greater safeguards than those currently available to them under state and territory legislation. With those few comments, I thank relevant senators for their contribution to the debate on this bill.
Question resolved in the affirmative.

Senator Alston interjecting—
—Order! Senator Bolkus, Senator Alston, stop yelling across the chamber. The question has been asked of Senator Hill, and he is the one who should answer it.
—Madam President, this has been a difficult issue that this government inherited from the previous Labor government. All honourable senators will remember the Australian people being assured by the previous Labor government that native title had in fact been extinguished by pastoral leases. They will recall what former Senator Bob Collins said on 20 December 1995—
—You know nothing about it!
—On a point of order, Madam President, is it acceptable for Senator Bolkus to constantly sledge across the chamber and say, `You know nothing about this; 
 you know absolutely nothing about it; you know nothing about it'? How can that possibly contribute to a sensible debate on a very important issue? How can it possibly enable Senator Hill to give a considered answer?
This is nothing more or less than a continued campaign of denigration to try and reduce the standards in the Senate and to ensure that answers cannot be heard. So, Madam President, I simply want to draw your attention to it in case you could not hear it because of the snide way in which Senator Bolkus normally says these things out of the back of his mouth.
—On the point of order, Madam President, can I suggest that it is of course disorderly for any senator to interject and, if you were to call Senator Bolkus or any other opposition senator to order, you would probably have to call Senator Alston to order far more regularly as the worst offender, the most constant offender in the chamber in terms of breaching the standing orders.	 All I would say on the point of order is that it is disorderly for any senator to interject, and of course everyone knows Senator Alston is the worst offender in the Senate.
—I make no comment on that.
—I was not planning to rise on the point of order but, in view of the comments that Senator Faulkner made, Madam President, you will be aware that virtually every time a minister gets up to attempt to answer a question we are subjected to a tirade of abuse from Senator Faulkner. So, as to his claims, I have to say, as bad as Senator Bolkus is, he is nowhere near as bad, in my view, as the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate who constantly sledges and makes it very hard for answers to be heard.
—There is no question but that interjections are disorderly. I think it is totally inappropriate to have some sort of competition to see who is the worst behaved in the place. Senator Bolkus is aware of the standing orders, and I would ask him, and other senators, to abide by them.
—Madam President, I was reminding the Senate of the state of affairs 
 which we inherited from the Labor government, and in particular the assurances that had been give by previous Labor spokesmen that in fact native title had been extinguished on pastoral leases. In particular, I was reminding senators of the statement of former Senator Bob Collins on 20 December 1995 on that issue when he said:
The question is an irrelevancy. It is an absolute nonsense.
I also remind honourable senators of what former Senator Evans, who was leading the debate for the Labor Party in this chamber, said:
. . . when this comes to be formally decided again—
that is, native title—
. . . the High Court decision will confirm that properly granted pastoral leases, for example, do in fact extinguish native title. The Prime Minister—
that is, Mr Keating—
. . . has said as much.
This was the state of affairs when we came to office. This is what pastoralists and the Australian people as a whole had been assured by the previous Labor government—
Opposition senators interjecting—
—Order! Senators on my left will cease interjecting. There is an appropriate time to debate these matters, and this is not it.
—Of course, as honourable senators know, when the High Court brought down its judgment, it proved to demonstrate that Labor had in fact misled the Australian people. What this government, the Howard government, then had to do was clean up the mess, and it has been most unhelpful to witness the approach that has been taken by the Labor Party ever since.
Madam President, just remember Mr Gareth Evans's contribution to the debate in the other place when he attacked the Prime Minister by saying:
He seems to never be so happy as when he is bashing blackfellas.
What a constructive contribution from the Deputy Leader of the Labor Party in this country! Or remember the contribution from 
 Mr Melham, the Labor Party's Aboriginal affairs spokesman, when he said on 29 May on the ABC's 7.30 Report :
There is only one thing missing from the debate about the stolen generations, and that is the white sheets and burning crosses, and that has been the undercurrent of this debate.
Madam President, that has been Labor's approach to this debate—to divide the Australian community, to incite anger, to create an atmosphere in which to make it as difficult as possible to find constructive and fair solutions to a very difficult problem. Of course, Mr Melham was at it again today. This time he has had to publicly apologise for his offensive contribution this morning.
These Labor frontbenchers have been allowed to poison the public debate in this country to a background of a very important national issue.

—I raise a point of order. Madam President, you will note that the minister has deliberately chosen not to answer either my question or my supplementary question.

—I was going to address the issue of financial assistance. The government made commitments about assisting the states and territories with financial assistance following the Wik decision. The government has told state and territory governments, particularly those most affected by native title, that the Commonwealth will look again at how it can assist the states with compensation liabilities and relevant administrative costs.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1998-07-02,"—Due to that unsatisfactory explanation, I therefore move:
That there be laid on the table by the Minister for the Environment (Senator Hill), before the adjournment of the Senate on 3 July 1998, answers to questions on notice Nos 1192, 1993 and 1203.
As late as the day before yesterday, my office again asked Senator Hill for the answers to these questions.
—Asked me?
—Yes, you—that is, my office asked your office. Senator Hill is responsible for the inaction in his office on this matter. It comes right from the top; it comes from his own failure to act, presumably because these questions are related to the environment.
The questions are important. Two of the questions are to do with the marauding impact on the Victorian forest environment of the regional forest agreement system. They were questions asking for explicit assurances about the regional forest agreement in the Central Highlands of Victoria. Two weeks ago, there was a response that one-quarter of one of those questions could not be provided at the time because there was a Victorian public servant away somewhere. There has been no answer since then.
The third question relates to the Basel Convention and the failure of Australia to ratify the important component of that convention which would prevent Australia, along with other OECD nations, from dumping toxic wastes in less well-off countries. We have seen Greenpeace alert the world of the hazardous waste being shipped out of Australia to Hong Kong. It is a despicable situation for Australia to be in, and we are in that situation because of the despicable failure of this minister to ensure that this government brought Australia into line with other enlightened developed countries. But the minister, who sits there reading a book—
—He's reading the standing orders!
—I am told that it is the standing orders he is reading. Whatever it is, he will need to read fast because the provision in the standing orders is that he has to do more than simply say, `I don't know what is going on in my office.' It seems that he does not know what is going on with his own legislation. We are told that there is important legislation coming before this parliament later today when somebody in his office gets the papers ready. What is that legislation about? It is about more dereliction of duty to the environment. It is about this minister shedding his national responsibilities to the environment through legislation which would deprive future federal governments of the responsibility and the authority which the Hawke government used to save the Franklin and later the Daintree, for example.
This minister has been such a comprehensive failure. Despite what I might have had to say about previous ministers, I am afraid they do not measure up to this minister when it comes to his ability to do the environment in. He is head and shoulders above the rest in his failure to be able to address the environment and act responsibly on behalf of the nation. Senator Faulkner looks like an absolute paradigm compared with this minister—
—Paragon. The expression is paragon of virtue!
—The reality is that this is a serious matter. The minister is not only failing in his duties to the environment but, as we see him rifling through the pages of the standing orders, he is flouting the Senate. He has 30 days in which to answer questions. The standing orders say that he should answer the questions within 30 days. These are mightily important questions which relate to the constituency in Australia who are concerned about the environment, and isn't that everybody? The minister says that himself.
The minister is not only flouting his responsibility on the environment and thumbing his nose at Australians who are concerned by the environment; he is flouting the Senate and the standing orders. There is no ostensible reason—and he says he cannot give one himself—as to why he cannot answer these questions and answer them now. He has, 
 through the provision of this motion, been given 24 hours in which to do so. He has got 24 hours to shape up and show some shred or indication of environmental responsibility.
One would have thought that, along with the Democrats, the Greens and the Labor Party, he would have been able to raise some form of celebration about the fact that yesterday was the anniversary of the saving of the Franklin in 1983. He could not even mention it. What did he do today to mark his recognition of that period of environmental gain in this country? He stumbled towards bringing in legislation which is going to do the country's environment out of a responsible voice and presence at a federal level.
For example, today, when Senator Hill was asked on radio what this new legislation would do to protect species threatened with extinction on private lands, he did not know. He ummed and ahed and fiddled and fumbled around, but he did not know. He does not know what is in his own legislation and he does not know how to answer simple questions about important and critical environmental issues. He cannot handle them.
The minister is not a new member of this place. He is the leader of the coalition government in the Senate. His conduct is not just unbecoming, it is derelict. It is unsatisfactory. The minister is a disgrace to his portfolio. It is a disgrace for him to be ostensibly representing, according to his title, the environment of the Australian nation, a nation which holds the environment in great regard. Senator Hill is contemptuous of it, but Australians are not.
Senator Hill is contemptuous of the spirit in Australia which says that we have to do a lot better by the environment. As he has his back turned to you now, Madam President, he turns his back on the Australian people, and he has done so in everything he has done in the period of his failed ministry. I recommend this motion to the Senate. I ask for Senate support to do get this minister to do something responsible. He has failed to meet the standing orders. It is about time he was brought into line. I hope the Senate will help me bring him into line on this matter.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title>,"<title>Question Nos 1192, 1193 and 1203</title>",Miscellaneous,25,1,speech
"Ray, Sen Robert",ALP,1998-07-02,"—Speaking on the motion on Senator Hill's failure to answer a question on notice, we expected Senator Hill to address some of the issues raised by Senator Brown in order for the opposition to make an evaluation as to which way to vote on the motion. We have heard Senator Brown's case. We have heard certain matters raised by Senator Brown, but there has been no response whatsoever from Senator Hill.
—Still open-minded are you, Robert?
—We were open-minded on it because, when Senator Brown first raised the issue, Senator Hill indicated across the chamber that he did not know about it. The normal practice is that, when a senator rises in this place under this particular provision of the standing orders, the senator would give the minister a tip-off a couple of hours beforehand. You do not do that to benefit the minister; you do it to benefit yourself, because it usually sparks in the minister's mind the idea of speeding up the process. Senator Brown, when that process is followed, it is amazing how often an answer will come back very quickly.
Senator Hill indicated that he personally had not known that this had been raised. Senator Brown then came in—and I have no reason to disbelieve him—and indicated that he had contacted Senator Hill's office the day before yesterday about these matters. There could have been a breakdown in communication in Senator Hill's office that led to no reason being prepared to give after question time today.
It is this frustration that has caused Senator Brown to move this motion. Although I must say that I am still puzzling over his reference to Senator Faulkner as a `paradigm'. That has me confused, because I understand that a paradigm is an example of a pattern, especially of the inflexions of a noun or a verb. We do not know whether you have insulted our leader—and if you have, we are going to vote this motion down—or whether you have praised our leader—in which case you are in like Flynn with our 28 votes! But we do not know, and we probably will never know.
A long response is not required from Senator Hill to indicate what his position on this has been. I understand from Senator Brown's speech that it has been a considerable period of time since he asked this question, probably much longer than 30 days. Senator Brown has indicated that it was mid to late May, so it is on the edge. In these instances, the complexity of the question that has been asked must be taken into account. It is quite proper for a minister to get up and say that a particular question on notice was extremely complex and extremely difficult to answer. That has been done before. When it is done, I think senators around the chamber should accept that as a relevant excuse.
I should just tell Senator Brown that the 30-day rule was introduced by this side of the chamber against a Labor government. We were not enthusiastic about it at the time, I must say.
—We are now!
—Yes, a small change in geography has enthused us much more on this particular matter, but we are very disappointed that those on the other side are no longer consistent on this issue. They were passionate believers in the 30-day rule—as they were on the cut-off motion and everything else—until it applied to them, and now they are not so passionate. The 30-day rule has been introduced, essentially, to try to pressure ministers to give answers to questions on notice in a reasonable period of time. It does not exist in the other House. There, matters have to be taken up with the Speaker, the Speaker has to agree to write to the relevant minister, and then a response comes. In the Senate, we have a more economic and automatic provision.
In certain cases there are genuine excuses for ministers not being able to respond within 30 days, especially if they have to go into the archival material and if it involves complex and interrelated matters. However, at the very least, what is required when notice is given to a minister's office is that some reasonable explanation be given to the senator concerned as to why questions have not been answered.
Some questions on the Notice Paper have gone beyond the 100 days and have yet to be 
 answered, but senators take into account the complexity of those questions and are very patient. What is required now, other than Senator Hill's contribution before Senator Brown moved the motion, is some sort of explanation as to, for instance, firstly, why the question has not been answered or, secondly, an assurance from Senator Hill that he will chase this matter up and get an answer to Senator Brown by the end of the week. That would mean that Senator Brown could then withdraw his motion.
The Senate has to grapple with the situation where Senator Brown's motion is carried yet physically the answer cannot be got across. If we make an order of the Senate and it is simply impossible for the minister's department, given their stage of work on this question, to answer it properly tomorrow, it might be a matter that we will have to discuss tomorrow. However, one would hope that this series of questions that he put to Senator Hill can be answered by tomorrow and that Senator Brown can benefit from those answers. We should at least give Senator Hill a chance to try to swing the jury on this side by putting up some explanation. We will keep an open mind. I am certain that Senator Faulkner will keep an open mind before he instructs us which way to vote.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title>,"<title>Question Nos 1192, 1193 and 1203</title>",Miscellaneous,25,1,speech
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,1998-07-02,"—I thank Senator Ray for giving me the opportunity to get some further and better information on this matter. I can now table an answer to question 1193, which was the question on the ban clause. It was delayed because of a difference of view between my office and the draftsman in the department on one small aspect. It will be a puzzle for Senator Brown to work out at his leisure. The other matter concerned questions 1192 and 1203. I understand that it was addressed to me in my position as the Minister representing the Prime Minister. The answers are still within the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet. I am also chasing up that matter. I undertake to get the answer to Senator Brown as quickly as possible. I seek leave to incorporate the answer in Hansard .
Leave granted.
The answer read as follows—
MINISTER FOR THE ENVIRONMENT
(Senate Question No. 1193)
Senator Brown  asked the Minister for the Environment, upon notice, on 14 May 1998:
With reference to the Basel Convention and the Basel Ban:
(1)	 With reference to the answer to question on notice no. 896 (Senate Hansard, 30  October 1997, p.8542), in which it was stated that `The Australian Government will make a decision, after appropriate consultation, on whether or not to ratify the ban amendment when the technical aspects of the Basel lists are finalised': now that the new hazardous waste lists have been adopted at the Conference of Parties (4), together with a process for continued improvement of them, has Australia's concern been addressed.
(2)	 When will the Australian Government start ratification of the Basel Ban, Decision 111/1 of the Basel Convention, into domestic legislation.
(3)	 Will the Government ban the export of hazardous waste for recycling and recovery to non-annex VII (non-OECD) countries.
Senator Hill— The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:
(1)	 At the Fourth Meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Basel Convention, or COP 4, adoption of the lists (A and B) of wastes as new annexes (Annexes VIII and IX) to the Convention was a priority for the Australian Government. Decision IV/9's adoption of the lists of wastes provides much greater precision as to the Convention's scope.
Some wastes remain on list C, a list not included in the new Annexes because it contains wastes whose status is yet to be decided. However, because list C is no more than a list of wastes proposed to be considered by the new review mechanism, there will always be some wastes on list C.
However, COP4 also considered amendments to the list of countries in Annex VII. Decision IV/8 provided that no amendments to Annex VII would be made until the ban amendment, Decision III/1, enters into force. It also commissioned the Convention's technical and legal groups to report to the Parties on the issues relating to Annex VII. This means that the scope of Annex VII is not clear and consequently, the implications for implementation of Decision III/1 are not settled and will need to be clarified. This uncertainty remains a concern for the Australian Government which has not been addressed by Basel Convention Parties. 

(2)	 The Australian Government will consider both of these COP4 decisions, through the usual procedures of consultation with stakeholders. It would, of course, be necessary to prepare a National Interest Analysis before any decision was taken to ratify the Basel Ban amendment set out in Decision III/1.

"Parer, Sen Warwick",LP,1998-07-02,"—Yesterday Senator Brown asked me a question with regard to capital works spending on the Murray-Darling Basin. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Anderson, has provided a detailed response. I seek leave to incorporate it in Hansard .
Leave granted.
The answer read as follows—
RESPONSE
.	 The decision to fund capital works contributions to the Murray Darling Basin initiative is entirely consistent with the natural resource management objectives of the Natural Heritage Trust as described in Part 3, paragraphs 9 and 17 of the Natural Heritage Trust Act.
.	 In this light, an additional amount of around $12 million will be provided to the Murray Darling Basin Commission for capital works over the period 1998-99 to 2000-01.
.	 This funding is to ensure that water regulation structures operate effectively to achieve economic and environmental objectives along the river. Over this period of time it is expected that the water business will be established as a SEPA rate entity and operate in a er consistent with COAG water reform requirements.
.	 The government's capacity to deliver on the important objectives of the Natural Heritage 
 Trust or the Murray Darling Basin 2001 program is fully secures
.	 It is important to note that the current federal budget allocates close to $43 million to Murray Darling Basin natural resource management programs.
.	 This compares to just $13.8 million provided for similar activities in the last year of the Keating government.
.	 The Howard government's commitment to the environment, natural resource management, and the Murray Darling Basin is an enormous increase on teat provided or promised by the previous government, and confirms once again that the coalition has a track record on environmental matters which the opposition could never compete with.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Hume Dam </title>,Questions Without Notice,26,1,speech
"Murphy, Sen Shayne",ALP,1998-07-02,"—I move:
That, in the opinion of the Senate, the following is a matter of urgency:
The Government's failure to adhere to and implement the Wood and Paper Industry Strategy of 1995 and its lack of policies and interest in preventing the loss of jobs in the forest and paper industry, such as the 250 jobs to be lost at the Burnie Pulp Mill due to Government inaction; and the need for the Government to immediately:
(a)	 constitute the Wood and Paper Industry Council under its original terms of reference with appropriate funding necessary to enable it to achieve the outcomes contained in the Wood and Paper Industry Strategy;
(b)	 announce an implementation timetable for the Wood and Paper Industry Strategy with particular attention being paid to the actions that can be taken to further process and value add timber in Australia;
(c)	 enter into immediate discussions with AMCOR, the relevant trade unions, the Tasmanian Government and the Burnie City Council to determine what actions need to take place to retain the pulp mill in Burnie;
(d)	 encourage all governments in Australia to recommit to the definition of `ecologically sustainable development' contained in the National Forest Policy statement which was signed by all Australian governments in 1992;
(e)	 recognise that the Australian community will not tolerate the export of largely unprocessed forest products especially logs and woodchips while our own manufacturing sector is suffering a serious decline and increasing competition from imported products sourced from forests that are not, in any way, managed on an ecologically sustainable basis; and
(f)	 implement legally available measures to ensure that any wood, pulp or paper products imported into Australia comes from forests that meet applicable and internationally certifiable environmental standards of forest management.
This is a very important urgency motion because the industry which the motion is about is currently on its knees, and it is on its knees because this government, since winning office, has not followed through on the commitments it gave prior to the last election. The industry is on its knees because the government has not followed a strategy that we put in place in 1995, despite the fact that 
 the industry minister, Mr `Black Jack' Moore, said—
Senator Watson interjecting—
—Order, Senator Watson!
—and I quote from a letter dated 17 July 1996 in which the minister said:
The government has endorsed the Strategy—
this is the wood and paper industry strategy that Senator Watson is singing out about; it will be very interesting to see how you vote at the end of the day, Senator Watson—
which includes a $38 million package to promote development of internationally competitive wood and paper industries based on ecologically sustainable management practices.
The Strategy is complementary to the development of Regional Forest Agreements and the Forest Industry Structural Adjustment Package, which will create resource security for the industry and facilitate restructuring. It will help to create a stable policy environment, allowing industry to confidently plan and invest in value added activities.
The Government recognises the importance of effective communication between all stakeholders and to this end is currently reviewing the consultative arrangements covering the major forest issues.
Details are expected to be finalised in the near future and once the new arrangements are put in place I am sure that they will ensure the wood and paper industry makes a significant contribution to the future economic development of Australia.
In so far as the industry is concerned, the only thing this government has succeeded in achieving is a 40 per cent increase in export woodchips. How many jobs have we lost? Thousands. How many paper mills have we lost? Indeed, we are looking down the barrel of another pulp mill closing. How many new ones have we seen? Zip.
What did the minister do about the strategy—and the Wood and Paper Industry Council that was supposed to drive it? He scrapped it. He threw the strategy out the window on the one hand and cancelled the Wood and Paper Industry Council. It was not until a disallowance motion in the Senate with respect to woodchip regulations that we were able to get it reinstated. That is what happened; it took us to get it reinstated. Of course, it was never reinstated in its proper 
 form. It was never provided with any funding. Since it was reconstituted in a different form, it has met but twice and cancelled another meeting. It has served as a mechanism for driving absolutely nothing. The executive summary of the wood and paper industry strategy of 1995 says:
The Wood and Paper Industry Strategy is a four year Commonwealth initiative to encourage investment, value adding and jobs growth.
Investments of between $4 billion and $6 billion are at present under consideration. Industry and unions predict between 15,000 and 25,000 . . . jobs over the next decade.
How wrong they were.
Senator Calvert interjecting—
—I heard Senator Calvert, and obviously I will hear from Senator Abetz. I can recall the Prime Minister talking about the regional forest agreement and what it has done. We know what the Prime Minister and the Premier said when they signed the RFA in Tasmania: `One thousand to 1,500 new jobs.' How many do we have? Absolutely zip. The wood and paper industry strategy says in the executive summary:
In implementing the Wood and Paper Industry Strategy, the Government will provide a further $38 million to work with the industry and its workforce to take full advantage of emerging investment opportunities. The Strategy will provide a stable government policy environment in which the industry can plan and invest with minimum risk and maximum confidence. Seizing these investment opportunities will generate import replacement, increased export earnings—
The original terms of reference for the Wood and Paper Industry Council were:
. to advise the Government on the implementation and further development of the Wood and Paper Industry Strategy;
. to promote job creation, industry development, value adding opportunities and investment initiatives; including at the enterprise level; and
. to act as an agent of change in the industry until Regional Forest Agreements are finalised and implemented.
What has this government done? We rightly call upon the government. When this last occurred, when we forced this government to take one little step—albeit a failing step— 
towards doing something for the industry, when they set up a wood and paper industry forum of no use, Senator Harradine said that he would keep an eye on it. You only got Senator Harradine's vote at that time because you made a promise to do something, which you have not done. On this occasion, I hope that Senator Harradine will vote in the interests of the workers and in the long-term interests of this industry.
What happened when the Burnie mill closed? Who did the government send down? They did not send `Black Jack' Moore down there.
—Would you please refer to the minister by his correct title, Senator Murphy.
—Mr `Black Jack' Moore.
—His correct title.
—The Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism, Mr `Black Jack' Moore.
—Senator Murphy!
—The Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism, Mr Moore, who is known as `Black Jack', he did not go down. Who did they send? They sent the Minister for Social Security. They offered a few hundred thousand dollars and said, `Workers, we're sorry about your plight, but you'll just have to go.' Mr Fahey, who was all aghast at the fact that there was so much resilience in the community, said, `Oh dear, we'll go back, we'll make the company open their books and we'll speak to them real strong. That's what we'll do.'
—Sternly.
—Yes, sternly. Has he done it? No. What else has the government done? The Prime Minister, in a meeting with the workers representatives, the Burnie delegation which came up here last week, said, `We'll make a big announcement.' Well, not too many announcements have come out of the Prime Minister's office.
Prior to the last election, in giving a commitment to Alec Marr and a few greenies in the bush, this Prime Minister said that he would reduce export woodchips. You have failed again, Prime Minister. It was obviously not a core promise. He has not reduced export woodchips. Indeed, he has increased them by 40 per cent.
I go again to the last point of this urgency motion, which calls on the government to implement legally available measures to ensure that any wood or paper products imported into this country come from forests which are managed on an ecologically sustainable and certifiable basis.
Of course, I am going to hear from government senators opposite that that cannot be done. They are very silent about that. But I will listen with interest to what they have to say—because I note that they are all Tasmanians—to see whether or not they are prepared to stand up for the workers in Tasmania, let alone the rest of Australia. I hope that they have some determination—I could say something else but I will not—to take some steps that will ensure that this country has, in future, a downstream processing industry in forest based industries, and that we set out on a course of a huge import replacement program, because imports in this country have doubled since 1992. I say to Senator Watson, through you, Madam Deputy President, that they have doubled in the last two years because of the inaction of this government and its failure to do anything in the interests of an industry that does require intervention from a government.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Wood and Paper Industry</title>,Matters of Urgency,27,1,speech
"Gibson, Sen Brian",LP,1998-07-02,"—Isn't it ironic that the Labor Party should be attempting to blame the coalition government for the shutdown of a pulp mill and for the lack of major investment in a pulpmill? It is as if by implication it believes that, if it were in government, it would be investing billions of taxpayers' dollars itself in that industry. What nonsense. All that governments can do is to remove the impediments to people investing. We are talking about an international commodity industry.
—Leave it to the market.
—I would like to know how else you are going to do it.
—We got more exports from woodchips and logs than you lot.
—Isn't it ironic that the Labor Party is endeavouring to criticise this government for inaction? It is this government that has removed one of the major impediments to investment in this industry in this nation—and, in particular, in Tasmania—by removing uncertainty over the future of the forests. The Labor Party deliberately played green politics with it over a period of 13 years and, as a consequence, frightened investment away from the industry and lost the only genuine opportunity that Australia had for a world-class Kraft eucalypt pulp mill—it was blown—and we will have to wait for that opportunity to arise again.
In north-west Tasmania those pulp and paper mills have basically been in trouble. Why? Because, going back a long period of time, previous owners did not take the trouble to upgrade their facilities to meet international competition and to become internationally competitive. They did not do that. But when they did make their first major attempt to do so with the Wesley Vale pulp mill proposal in the late 1980s, what happened? We had the ALP federal government playing green politics with suburban Melbourne and Sydney, against the forest industry throughout the nation, and it killed that project dead. Who killed that project dead? Former minister Graham Richardson killed that project dead. That is basically what happened. It was the only opportunity for a major investment in that industry at that time.
It is important for those listening and for the Senate to understand that the pulp and paper industry is a commodity industry. It requires huge investments. For a greenfield mill we are talking about a minimum of $500 million up to $1 billion or $1½ billion. Investment in the industry is a cyclical business. It tends to have a rush all round the world over a few years and there is a great oversupply in that industry—and then it usually takes five, eight or 10 years for that extra capacity to be used up around the world before another opportunity arises for people 
 to invest. That is the cycle in this industry. That is what happens in this industry.
Australia had an opportunity back in the late 1980s, when there was a gap, a shortage of fine paper pulp, eucalypt Kraft pulp. APPM and others—a consortium—put up a $1.2 billion  project, which was going to turn chips, which are currently exported and were being exported then, into pulp and then eventually into paper. And what happened? The federal Labor government of the day killed the project dead, and then continued to play green politics by trying to influence suburban voters in Melbourne and Sydney against the forestry and forest industry.
I believe the opportunity will come again for another Kraft pulp mill in Australia—and particularly in Tasmania, because we have an excellent resource there. But the opportunity was lost in the late 1980s, and it will be some years before the world market opportunity will arise where people can invest. It is not for governments to make that decision. All governments can do is remove impediments. Governments can help and they can hinder. The Howard government is helping this industry to remove impediments. We have done that. The ALP government of the past hindered the development and stopped the investment.
This shows that the opposition does not understand the investment process. It has no idea what drives the Australian economy. The two drivers are, first, productivity within existing firms—lifting productivity; and, second, investment in existing plants and investment in new plants and service. The ALP government killed off the one opportunity for this industry in Tasmania some years ago. Because capital is today a worldwide commodity—it is not tied to national boundaries; people do not have to invest in Australia or Tasmania or anywhere—we have to provide encouragement for people to invest in particular places by removing impediments to investors' confidence.
The key thing in the forest industry was resource availability. The Labor government of the past sacrificed resource availability in order to curry green votes in Sydney and Melbourne suburbia. That is what happened. 
 They tried to play both sides of that conflict, between the environmentalism on the one hand and development on the other hand, but ended up killing a large slice of the forest industry.
Since we have been in government, what has happened?  We have finalised the regional forest agreement, RFA, process. I am sure my colleagues will say something about that later.
—It was Labor policy; it was a Labor initiative.
—After a long time, after many years of arguing. I was involved in negotiations for many years as an industry representative. The Labor government of the day would not take any initiative until, in the end, they were forced to do so. That is what happened. When we got into power, what happened?  Action immediately. Things are now falling into place. Legislation to lock in those agreements was introduced in the other place yesterday. This resource availability does not guarantee investment, but it is necessary. It is necessary but not sufficient. We then have to persuade people who are in that industry to invest in that industry when the time is right.
 The Howard government has been supportive of the Burnie community. As Senator Abetz said earlier, what happened in Burnie when the Burnie pulp and paper mill reduced its work force by 600 in 1992-93? The Labor government of the day took no action. What happened in 1995 when the titanium plant was closed costing 225 jobs—any action? No action at all from the federal Labor government.
By contrast, when Amcor announced it was closing down its pulp mill just recently, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) immediately sent down a cabinet representative to meet with the company and the local community, and then followed up with a grant of $600,000 for that community for industry training and for local business action. Since then, Minister Parer has been down there and has given a grant of $300,000—again for north-west Tasmania—to encourage a study of infrastructure requirements for that region, because there are mineral prospects that can be devel 
 oped in that region. We hope that getting gas onshore and development out of those mineral deposits will go ahead.
—Now that's a sound industry policy.
—It is a real sound industry policy. Senator Murphy suggested that we should be banning imports of pulp. The government has made a commitment to look at that proposal. But I should remind the Senate and listeners that there are great difficulties in banning anything coming into Australia. Australia is committed to its WTO obligations. We have to be very careful that we do not infringe those obligations.
The other thing I should say to the Senate is that most pulp that is manufactured and traded around the world does come from sustainable forests. They are well managed, sustainable forests.
—Indonesia's?
—Senator Sherry mentions Indonesia. There may be some doubts about some of the sites in Indonesia, but that is a tiny proportion of the world pulp market. The world pulp market is largely dominated by the industry in north Europe and in North America, and those forests are run on sustainable bases. There is no problem there.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1998-07-02,"—The first thing I need to say is that the forest products that are coming into the country from the so-called `well managed' resources in North America, let alone Indonesia, are not coming from sustainable forest practices—for Senator Gibson to say that is to exhibit extraordinary ignorance. Anybody who has been to British Columbia, for example, would have seen the stripping bare of vast areas of the mountainsides there, and anybody who has gone further south into Washington and Oregon states of the United States would have seen a massive environmental tragedy afoot.
—Are there any sustainable forests in the world?
—Senator Abetz, you will get your time a little further down the line. If you want to draw on my information and 
 overcome some of your own ignorance afterwards, I will be happy to avail you of that knowledge.
 The key point of parts (e) and (f) in this motion, which I would support but with some reservations, is to find some way of banning the imports of forest products coming from unsustainable logging. I have for a long time, both in the state parliament of Tasmania and here, sought to get ministerial intervention from successive Labor governments to prevent the import of rainforest timbers from Malaysia, for example, where the Penan people are having the rainforests cut down around their heads, their universe destroyed. We have had representatives of the Penan people in Sarawak come to Hobart. They did not visit the Labor party and they did not visit the Liberals. What they did see was the extraordinary devastation of Tasmania's forests under successive Labor and Liberal governments in the state.
I give the following warning. The Indonesians are marauding and unsustainably logging their forests and allowing Malaysian logging companies in to do the same, and of course they are across the border in Papua New Guinea. The Malaysian government, which is corrupt in this area, has loggers in Sarawak and Sabah and on continental Malaysia cutting down forests with unsustainable practices. Unlike the Tasmanian forestry authority, Forestry Tasmania, and corporations like North and Amcor which make prodigious profits out of logging native forests in Tasmania, those countries do not descend to firebombing areas of pristine rainforests and world heritage value tall eucalypt forests, with all their wildlife, at the end of the logging process, and then moving in with 1080 and putting that on the—
—Firebombing?
—Yes, firebombing. Senator Sherry questions the word `firebombing'. The forestry authority that he supports—and remember, the Malaysian and Indonesians as far as we know do not do this—fly over areas like the Tarkine and the great southern eucalypt forests of Tasmania after they have been destroyed by Forestry Tasmania at the behest of the woodchip corp 
 orations, and drop thousands of ping-pong balls full of incendiaries which ignite when they hit the ground—
—Why do they do that?
—They do that to make profit, Senator Sherry.
—They do that to regenerate the forest.
—You see, it is a different attitude in here, Mr Acting Deputy President, when I draw your Labor colleagues out on this matter. They then get themselves into strife. Senator Sherry says, `Why do they do that?' They do that, not to regenerate the forest at all but to destroy the cotyledons and the root systems of the rainforest, for example, which are treated as weeds. They do not want them competing with the artificial eucalypt component brought in—the monoculture or two or three cultures of eucalypts which replace those pure rainforests, for example, in the Tarkine.
It is a scorched earth policy and its deliberate intent, by Forestry Tasmania, backed by the Labor Party in Tasmania and the Liberal Party, is to destroy the ecosystem so that it cannot compete with the industrial forestry which replaces it. So we have got dills in the Labor Party and the Liberal Party in Tasmania then calling for some sort of certification for the import of timbers coming from practices elsewhere in the world which are no worse and, abominable as they might be, arguably better than the practices which the Labor Party and the Liberal Party endorse in Tasmania.
What a shocking indictment of those clods. What a shocking indictment, indeed, of the deputy leader, Mr Lennon and leader of the Labor Party, Mr Bacon, in Tasmania. As you will know, Mr Acting Deputy President, it was Mr Bacon, the current leader of the Labor Party in Tasmania who moved in in 1991 when the Greens opposed Labor putting legislation through the parliament for so-called resource security, which gave the big corporations the forests on a platter—there was not a dollar for it—and stitched up a deal between the weak-kneed then Labor Premier of Tasmania, Michael Field, and the avari 
 cious then leader of the Opposition in Tasmania, Robin Gray. So we had the then union leader, now Labor leader, stitching up the deal to give the forest to North and Amcor, who came in after that, with no strings attached.
Had they insisted that part of the bargain of giving the Tasmanian public forest to these big out of state companies was downstream processing, we would not see 300 people being put out the factory gate. And we would not have seen the 600 people that the government has just been referring to put out the gate straight after that abominable legislation went through the parliament. Labor and Liberal are responsible for the fix in which the Amcor employees find themselves in Tasmania. You cannot help but feel sorry for those employees, because they have been duped. Wouldn't it be good to see the size of the cheques that are for coming from North and from Amcor into the big party's coffers? And might I remind people taking part in this debate that there is a standing order requirement that anyone who holds shares in any of the corporations which might be advantaged or otherwise affected by this debate should declare it. I hope that standing order has been observed in this debate.
Whichever way you look at it, Tasmania is in a fix. But it is not because of the Greens in Tasmania who, for years, have been fighting to have a better organised forest industry. It is not because of the Greens who recognise there are 18,000 jobs in tourism in Tasmania, some 3,000 of which are directly dependent upon keeping our wilderness and forests intact. Yet, after October, there will be only 2,200 jobs in the whole of the logging industry which marauds those forests for woodchipping. And those jobs are being shared even as the increased woodchipping occurs in the forest, if your submission to this Senate is correct, Mr Acting Deputy President.
We have got a woeful record from the two major parties in Tasmania, with only the Greens offering an alternative which says, `Let us look to the service industries and let us get behind the home based businesses in Tasmania which put their profits back into 
 Tasmania and which are committed to Tasmania.' Let us have a pulp mill which is state-of-the-art, and non-polluting, depending on the plantation resource in Tasmania and sited where Tasmanians will accept it. Not a Wesley Vale pulp mill sited in the middle of one of the richest vegetable growing areas of the state—
—Where would you put it?
—The Labor Party senator interjects. But Bob Hawke himself said, `How could we get behind something that was putting 13 tonnes of organochlorines into Bass Strait each day', not to count the amount that was coming out the chimney onto those vegetable fields. A pretty abhorrent policy and one that Labor should hang its head in shame about.

"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,1998-07-02,"—I have a couple of comments about some of the contributions made today. Senator Brown accuses past Tasmanian governments—Labor and Liberal—of firebombing forests. Senator Brown knows, and it should be pointed out to the Senate, that to regenerate eucalypt forests that have been logged you have to burn them afterwards or you do not get regrowth of adequate quality. Also, most of the areas that are currently logged in Tasmania and are intended to be logged in Tasmania have been logged before and burnt before, if not by deliberate human action, by forest fires started by lighting. An essential part of the eucalypt forest cycle is fire.
Senator Gibson raised a couple of matters. I want to place on record that the RFA process was Labor-initiated policy. Secondly, he talks about removing the impediments. But we need to do a lot more than removing impediments. We need to have an active, urgent industry policy to assist the industry in downstream processing.
Senator Gibson says things are falling into place. The RFA process is now in place, I accept that, but the jobs are falling out of place. There is not going to be much of Burnie left at the current rate, if this is the way things are falling into place.
Another point I would mention is that Senator Gibson talks about sustainable forests 
 in Europe. I would accept that many of them are managed in a sustainable way, but a number of European countries have put in place policies to ensure that the importation of forestry products from countries that do not have sustainable environmental practices is forbidden.
Forest industries are of major importance to Tasmania's regional economy. They cover a wide range of activities in the logging of both native and plantation forests. The resource is utilised for sawlog production for sectors as diverse as housing, furniture and craft products and chips for export—unfortunately, export—and also, importantly and relevantly in this debate, conversion to pulp and paper production.
This value adding to pulp and paper is done at Burnie, Wesley Vale on Tasmania's north-west coast and New Norfolk in southern Tasmania. Our forest industries constitute between 15 and 20 per cent of the Tasmanian economy. They employ more than 5,000 people. Senator Brown, of course, says, `Let's get rid of it all and totally depend on service industries.' To add to the perspective of their importance, Tasmania has almost one-half of Australia's sustainable forestry resource. A large portion of that is state owned and state managed. A large part of the value adding and the local jobs are now under threat.
The recent announcement by Amcor, owners of pulp and paper operations in Wesley Vale and Burnie, that pulp operations, employing 250 people directly, are to close in October and that pulp is to be imported from overseas, primarily from Indonesia, is a highly undesirable exclusion of value adding from the forestry process industries in Tasmania. It also puts a further question mark over the remaining 500 jobs in paper operations on the north-west coast.
Forestry has always been a controversial activity. Many past practices have been both economically and environmentally unsustainable. Labor's approach in government had two fundamental themes. The first was to ensure a sustainable economic and environmental forest industry by a process known as regional forest agreements, RFAs. It is a scientific environmental assessment of each 
 region. The areas that are not to be logged for sound environmental reasons are put aside. Where areas are to be logged, sustainable practices are put in place. Effectively, it is resource security.
The second part of Labor's approach was a wood and paper strategy to lay a blueprint for downstream processing and value adding, maximising jobs. It is this second element that is incomplete. Indeed, it has been wilfully neglected, and I think deliberately ignored by the current Liberal-National Party hardline economic rationalists, and that includes the current Liberal member for Braddon, Mr Miles.
We need a strong dose of government intervention in the forest industries, a strong industry and regional policy pursued with vigour—the carrot and stick approach needs to be adopted. Tasmania has a number of significant natural advantages. I have referred to our well-managed forestry resource but, secondly, it also has a highly skilled, educated, trained and responsible work force.
In referring to the work force, the recent crass, ignorant, ill-informed comments by the National Party Minister for Customs and Consumer Affairs, Mr Truss, with the nodding agreement of Mr Miles, I might add, that the past work practices made wharfies look like a work gang—in other words, blame the workers—must be rejected. The weak Prime Minister, Mr Howard, failed to pull him into line for what was clearly a misleading statement. The comments are untrue.
As a Burnie resident, I know many of the former and current Amcor employees at Wesley Vale and Burnie. They are dedicated, committed and always have worked, and currently work, a decent day's work for a decent day's pay. Not even the management blame the workers for the current problems. Mr Truss and Mr Miles must stop blaming workers.
The responsible and positive approach taken by the work force is well illustrated by the set of proposals put to Amcor yesterday by unions to identify $30 million in savings over the next five years, but a further element must be the rejection of pulp imports into Australia. Why? Indonesia and, for that matter, most 
 Asian countries are grossly irresponsible in the management of their forest industries. Their approach is little short of economic and environmental rape. This is reflected in their pricing policies.
Tasmania now has world's best forest management practices. We should reject imports from countries such as Indonesia that do not do the same. The playing field must be level. Firm legal action can and should be taken by the federal government to ensure forest products imported into Australia come from forests that meet certified environmental standards, but we should go further.
The implementation of such an approach must be coupled with incentives to encourage investment in downstream processing and value adding. A package must be developed and implemented by Amcor or, for that matter, any other proposed pulp and paper operator to upgrade technology, to invest and to ensure value adding and jobs result. Such financial incentives, even in the quantum of $5 million to $10 million a year, will not be as expensive as the significant economic and social costs of the unemployment that we are to see.
Tasmania is a region of significant long-term unemployment. There are few alternative job opportunities. The unemployment payments for the 250 lost jobs, if that goes ahead in October, will be at least $2 million per annum. You can double that, if the flow-on of job losses are included, to $4 million. You can triple that, if the paper operations are shut down in future years, to $12 million a year minimum.
It is also in the national economic interest, particularly given our soaring trade deficit in forest products, for that to be reduced in some way. Value adding provides part of the solution to that forest products trade deficit. I would also like to take this opportunity to publicly thank the unions, the local councils, the businesses and the media, particularly the Advocate, for the very strong and, I think, responsible and positive campaign they have been running not just in respect of Burnie, which is the immediate issue at hand, but the long-term development of forest resources not just in Tasmania but in Australia in general.
To sum up, resource security is now guaranteed to the private sector. Value adding of pulp and paper must be guaranteed by the private sector. Government has a strong role to play. It owns a significant part of the resource; it is not as though this is a resource that is owned primarily or totally by the private sector. It is not.
Labor will act. It will act to ensure imports must come from well-managed, economically and environmentally sustained forests. Labor will act to provide incentives for a strong industry and regional policy to ensure downstream processing and value adding. Most importantly, it is in the interests of hundreds of pulp and paper industry workers to secure their future.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Wood and Paper Industry</title>,Matters of Urgency,27,1,speech
"Watson, Sen John",LP,1998-07-02,"—It is well known in financial and manufacturing circles, and particularly in Amcor itself, that had it not been for the strong action of the Liberal government, Tasmania would have lost two paper mills and the associated jobs. Today we have one of the most hypocritical and inaccurate urgency motions that has ever been presented to this Senate.
We have Senator Murphy portrayed as the great white knight of the wood and paper industry. However, Senator Murphy, I submit to you, apart from a small core within the Amcor group, is a bit of a joke—the man who promises a lot and delivers little, the man who has been responsible for more loss of jobs at those factories than anybody else in Australia, and everybody knows it. The sad joke is the loss of jobs. The other joke is his lack of knowledge about the industry. His continual references to shiny paper, rather than coated paper, are a source of amusement amongst the blue-collar workers at the paper mill.
I suggest in kindness, Senator Murphy, that this urgency motion is not of your own writing. It is my suggestion that the motion came from Mike O'Connor of the CFMEU, who is leading the charge against Amcor and the government. Your comments regrettably come too late.
The CFMEU have at last come out of the woodwork. They did not put a great deal of 
 effort into saving jobs before today. Where were they on the anti-dumping issue? The paper industry lobby group TasPEAC were here in Canberra, but the CFMEU were absent and calm on the issue and it was at the time of mill workers greatest need.
The AMWU fought for its workers; so has TasPEAC. These unionists want to protect their industry. They do not want any regulation that will close the industry down. They are fearful for their jobs. They are fearful of the consequences of action that is being taken today. The workers are fearful of the ultimate ramifications of the CFMEU action because, if we stop that paper pulp coming in, Amcor will walk away as they proposed to do and close their mills. It was the Liberal government that retained those factories—unfortunately, in not the same employment numbers as we would have hoped.
No, Senator Murphy, you are not the spokesman for the electorate at large. You are the spokesman for the CFMEU and sections of the labour movement only. You have created a great amount of havoc through strike action around the country. Who cares if Amcor uses the blocking of imported pulp as an excuse to shut down the remaining Amcor investments at Burnie and Wesley Vale so long as the CFMEU wins? Is this your aim? Is  the wellbeing of the people of Burnie and Wesley Vale and their jobs and the welfare of those in the 250 jobs that have been lost at the Burnie pulp mill your aim, or is it is the CFMEU winning at any cost?
When in government in 1992-93, when the pulp mill reduced its work force by 600, Labor took no action at all. Again, in 1995, when the titanium plant closed costing 225 jobs, the Labor Party took absolutely no action. Where was this man who is the originator of this motion? He was at the barricades himself, inciting action, and what was the result? APPM walked away from its investment, and what followed was a substantial downsizing—
—Six hundred jobs lost.
—There were 600 jobs lost in a fragile part of Tasmania. And who was responsible? Here we see a man initiating action that could result in the complete 
 closure of that mill, despite the positive actions of the Liberal Party. The Liberal government is committed to working closely with the wood and paper industries. The government wants to encourage investment and create real, long-term jobs, particularly in regional areas.
The wood and paper industry make a substantial contribution to the Australian economy and the Tasmanian economy. The annual turnover exceeds $10 billion, which is about seven per cent of the manufacturing industry, and there are currently 60,000 people employed in this industry. And yet you, Senator Murphy, want to take action that is going to destroy many more of those jobs. The dumping of paper products in Australia has impacted particularly hard on the Tasmanian paper operations. The government's reform of the anti-dumping laws will provide welcome assistance in responding to future dumping cases.
The Liberal government came to office with a commitment to reform the anti-dumping system, a system criticised by the industry on many counts. Our government has delivered on that commitment and the industry now has the toughest anti-dumping legislation deliverable in the world. Prior to that, in supporting anti-dumping action, we arranged for up to 80 per cent of customs officers to be directed to work urgently on assisting Amcor to defeat dumping practices.
The Senate may be interested to know that Senator Murphy and I had a bet about the success of our anti-dumping legislation. Senator Murphy was so dubious about us getting such a bill through parliament by 30 June that he and I had a friendly bet. He did not believe that the Liberal Party could deliver on a successful anti-dumping bill. Now I say to Senator Murphy, put your hand in your pocket and pay up that $5 that you owe me. We got the legislation through. We delivered on our election promise, but yet again Senator Murphy fails to deliver.
In stark contrast with Labor's abysmal record at Burnie, within 48 hours of Amcor announcing the closure of the pulping section, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) had acted. A cabinet delegation consisting of the Minister 
 for Finance and Administration (Mr Fahey) and the Minister for Social Security (Senator Newman) visited the city to hear the concerns of the workers and the communities. Where were your shadow ministers in similar situations? A package of $600,000 to generate new employment and business opportunities in Burnie has been announced and there will be more initiatives to come. This government is committed to ensuring that the Burnie region has a long and sustainable future. People within the community are working to provide medium- to long-term solutions, and the community welcomes this sort of action. (Time expired)
—On a point of order, Mr Acting Deputy President, is it against standing orders to have a wager with a presiding officer on a subject before the chamber, and do you have a conflict of interest in making this ruling?
—There is no point of order, but I will take advice on that matter later.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Wood and Paper Industry</title>,Matters of Urgency,27,1,speech
"Denman, Sen Kay",ALP,1998-07-02,"—I was actually going to comment on exactly that issue. In September last year, in regard to the forest industry in Tasmania, the federal member for Braddon and Parliamentary Secretary [Cabinet] to the Prime Minister, Mr Miles, said:
In regard to Tasmania and the Regional Forest Agreement, there is no doubt there will be a good solution come out of it for Tasmania and for the Australian people. It has listened to the Australian people and to the Tasmanian people. It is not complacent. There is stability coming into the forest industries and this debate, and there will be security for 20 years.
At the signing of the regional forestry agreement, the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, and the Premier, Mr Rundle, said that the agreement would provide more jobs, greater certainty for the industry, development and better conservation for Tasmanian forests.
They were heartening statements on the face of it, but they were flawed from the outset. Those statements were not flawed because of the signing of the RFA. The RFA is crucial to providing certainty. With certain 
 ty comes the opportunity to address our trade imbalance. It is ludicrous that last year Australia imported forest products to the value of $2.6 billion, while we exported only $1.3 billion worth. Unfortunately, the coalition, which is only too happy to adopt the line of least resistance in policy development, believed that the signing of the Tasmanian RFA would be a panacea for the struggling local industry. How simplistic.
As Senator Murphy has said many times in this place before, the jobs that the member for Braddon promised would flow from the signing of the RFA have not materialised. The coalition wanted to continue travelling down easy street. It wanted to continue allowing major companies to export boatloads of woodchips for a couple of hundred dollars per cubic metre. The coalition has never been prepared to put its shoulder to the wheel in the quest for industry, investment and value added exports.
To what extent the Asian crisis will have an impact on Tasmania's woodchip industry is difficult to gauge. As we know, many economists disagree on the extent to which the economic crisis in Asia will have an impact. However, there is consensus among economists that, in the forestry sector, there will be an increasing downturn in the demand for Tasmanian woodchip exports and more competition from Indonesian hardwoods.
The difficulty is that the Tasmanian economy is currently so fragile that, with the expected rebound in Asia still some way off, the damage to the economy of my home state could be devastating. The impact of the crisis in Asia should be taken in tandem with events like the recent loss of 250 jobs at the Burnie pulp mill. There is also the prospect of massive job losses if hundreds of Tasmanian forest workers are stood down within the next few months, while private owners of timber reserves are compelled to ensure the legality of their operations. Further, as my Senate colleague Senator Murphy pointed out last night, there are some deeply rooted problems associated with the Forestry Corporation and the industry as a whole. Taking into account the sorts of difficulties being experienced, one 
 can understand the reason for this matter of urgency.
In particular, Australians and Tasmanians are becoming increasingly intolerant of Australia losing employment generated investments by exporting woodchips. With these types of events occurring, you can understand why people like the AMWU organiser Brian Green, who has worked tirelessly for the workers since Amcor's announcement at the Burnie mill, are frustrated. Mr Green was quoted in the Advocate yesterday as saying:
Workers are frustrated. They know how much it costs to produce pulp in Burnie, they know how much Amcor's proposal to bring imported pulp will cost, and they are frustrated—Burnie is a profitable operation.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Wood and Paper Industry</title>,Matters of Urgency,27,1,speech
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,1998-07-02,"—The motion we are discussing this afternoon is a typical ploy by the Australian Labor Party. Its ploy is quite transparent; its actions hollow. Its ploy is to distract the public's attention from the excellent record of this government, a government which has worked tirelessly and effectively to provide certainty to timber workers, their families and their communities.
During 13 years of Labor government we had mammoth job losses and ongoing uncertainty. Forest policy lurched from crisis to crisis. Labor Party ministers were engaged in mortal combat with each other—Senator Faulkner and Mr Beddall—and policy paralysis had set in. The forest workers blockaded federal parliament. If ever there was an indictment of the forest policy of a national government in this country, it was highlighted by that blockade. Throughout that period, Labor senators who have taken part in today's debate kept a guilty silence. In so doing, they betrayed regional Australia.
Since March 1996, when the Liberal-National parties were elected, there has been a growing confidence amongst the timber workers and their families and communities, especially in my home state of Tasmania and Victoria. New South Wales, unfortunately, is still suffering from the Carr Labor government's decimation of the forest industry. As soon as we came to government, we dealt with the vexed issue of woodchip regulations. 
 Despite Labor's 10-point $5 billion Beazley black hole, we found the necessary funds in the very first budget to expedite the regional forest agreement process. We now have three signed up: one in my home state of Tasmania and two in the state of Victoria. Others are progressing. We have introduced the  Regional Forest Agreements Bill 1998 . We have moved and been pro-active. We have examined the issues and given security to both reserves and the need for productive forests.
We have also introduced and passed vital anti-dumping legislation, to which Senator Watson has referred, to protect Australia from the economic evil of dumped paper. For 13 years, Labor did not move. Within two and a bit years of this government coming to power, we had a full and proper inquiry. We liaised with industry and passed the legislation. What we could do in two years and four months of office Labor failed to do in 13 years, yet its members come in here parading as the champions of the forest industry. The record speaks for itself. The blockade around this building spoke for itself. I can tell you that, if the workers in the forest communities were to revisit this parliament, it would be to congratulate this government on its effectiveness and responsible management of a very difficult issue. They would not be here to blockade.
We have delivered to the industry not 100 per cent of what they wanted but 110 per cent, and we did it in two years and four months of government. The reason I say that we delivered 110 per cent is that in the Regional Forest Agreements Bill we have gone further on behalf of the workers and the industry in which they work than they had actually asked for at the very beginning of the process. We have delivered, in less than one-fifth of Labor's time in office, everything that the timber workers and their communities have requested. In so doing, we have ensured that there are comprehensive, adequate reserves of forest types right around Australia.
In my home state of Tasmania, 40 per cent of the landmass is now locked up. It will never again see a chainsaw or an axe. Most people would say that that sort of reserve system covering 40 per cent of the landmass 
 is appropriate and adequate. It looks after the conservation needs of the country and it also allows for good, productive and sustainable forestry to provide jobs and economic growth, especially in depressed regional areas.
It is when one considers this background I have just given to the Senate that it becomes so apparent that the motion moved by the Labor Party today is just so breathtaking in its audacity. Its record was abysmal, a complete and utter failure, yet it comes in here asserting that somehow it will now champion the forest industry. The introduction to the motion is absolutely overflowing with duplicity. It expresses concern about the 250 jobs to be lost at the Burnie pulp mill. I share the concern of the potential loss of those jobs. I simply ask why they are endangered. Senator Gibson dealt with that very effectively when he recounted the situation with Wesley Vale.
If the Labor Party was genuinely concerned about jobs, I simply ask where it was when this same company shed 600 jobs in Burnie from the same plant. Where was it? There was not a word. Did it send down cabinet ministers to discuss with Amcor the saving of jobs? No action was taken. When Tioxide closed, with the same loss of jobs in Burnie, did Labor send down a cabinet subcommittee to have a look? Did it move motions of urgency in this place? No, it did not. It did absolutely nothing.
But within 48 hours of the announcement of the Burnie pulp mill possibly losing 250 jobs, what did the Liberal government do? Within 48 hours, there were two senior cabinet ministers in Burnie discussing the very issues and aspirations of the workers and the community. We then delivered $600,000. There is more to come, because the ministers said, `After having listened to your concerns and aspirations, we will now go away and seek to develop a package for you.'
That is the sort of industry policy that we need. It is not the Labor party do-nothing policy, where over 1,000 jobs went. Indeed, there was an attack on my friend the federal member for Braddon (Mr Miles) in relation to jobs. The Labor Party presided over the loss of over 5,200 jobs in the electorate of Braddon between 1989 and 1996. There has now 
 been a growth of over 2,000 jobs in Braddon since the Liberal government came into power. Within two short years, we have increased the employment numbers in Braddon whilst under Labor they were in free fall. The Liberal Party has an excellent record in relation to the forests and forest industries of this country and, in particular, in my home state of Tasmania.

"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1998-07-02,"—I table a statement by the Attorney-General on the Constitutional Convention, and I seek leave to incorporate the document in Hansard .
Leave granted.
The statement read as follows—
Mr Speaker, it gives me great pleasure today to table the Report of the Constitutional Convention held in February this year.
The Convention was a unique moment in Australian history. Over the two weeks of the Convention, 152 Australians came together to discuss the future of our country. All had Australia's best interests at heart. All were concerned to progress the debate on whether or not we should become a republic.
The report includes comments by the Chairman of the Convention, the Rt Hon Ian Sinclair, and the Deputy Chairman, the Hon Barry Jones, who both take an opportunity in the report to reflect on the contribution of those who participated, and on the emotion of the occasion. Both comment that the Convention demonstrated our inherent national unity, despite the wide range of views expressed. This is a view with which I wholeheartedly agree.
The experience of the Convention gave me a great deal of confidence in the capacity of the Australian people to play an active part in the evolution of our democratic institutions. The debate was spirited, but for the most part conducted with respect and goodwill. I have great confidence that the forthcoming referendum will be held in an environment of healthy and constructive debate.
This full record of the events of the fortnight of the Convention will provide an invaluable resource for anyone interested in debate about our system of government.
The report is available on the Convention website. Copies will be sent to municipal and university libraries and will be available for purchase at 
 government bookshops. All the Convention delegates will receive a copy.
At the time of the Convention, people all over the country gave more than a passing thought to our Constitution and what change might mean. And while the debates were widely reported in the media at the time, it is well worth casting an eye back over the transcripts in volumes 3 and 4 of the report. The words on paper can still evoke the passion and commitment delegates brought to their arguments for and against change.
Clearly the next steps are important. In line with a resolution of the Constitutional Convention, the Prime Minister has written to the State Premiers, the Territory Chief Ministers and the Leader of the Opposition to seek their assistance in developing the referendum proposal.
The referendum will be our opportunity to make a choice between the model supported at the Convention and the system we currently have. I am sure there will be further robust public debate as the time to cast a vote draws nearer.",SENATE,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Constitutional Convention</title>,Ministerial Statements,28,1,speech
"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,1998-07-02,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the statement.
The Constitutional Convention was an event that will certainly stick in my mind as a delegate to that Convention. I think it is an appropriate time at the tabling of this statement to revisit the outcomes of the Constitutional Convention.
In reminding the Senate of the events that took place, I think the major impact was the bringing together of both elected representatives and members of the public in a way that fostered lively debate about an issue pertaining to the future of this country. There were many frustrations aired. There were many views presented, but the debate was constructive and positive in most instances and focused on what was positive about the republic and the way forward for this country.
One of the interesting outcomes of this Convention was the question of what happens next. The communique that was circulated and signed by all delegates after the Constitutional Convention included a statement related to ongoing constitutional review and attached a process to that. The timing and circumstances of any change that emerged from the Constitutional Convention were that a referendum for a change to a republic or for the maintenance of the status quo would be held 
 in 1999 and that if the referendum returned a result for a republic then that would come into effect on 1 January 2001. Part of that decision was that, prior to the referendum being put to the people, the government would undertake a public education program directed to constitutional and other issues relevant.
Turning to the ongoing constitutional review process, the terms of reference were quite narrow at the Convention. It was to the great disappointment of many of the delegates who prepared their submissions and comments on the basis that they would have the opportunity to traverse far beyond just the issue of the actual construct of an Australian republic. Indeed, I would like to turn my comments to those issues which I believe map some of the way as to the ongoing process of constitutional reform that I believe is desirable.
The Convention resolved that if a republican system of government should be introduced at the referendum at a date being no less than three years or more than five years thereafter, the Commonwealth government should indeed convene a further Constitutional Convention and that two-thirds of such a convention should be directly elected by the people. This was done on the basis of, in the first instance, a very positive and general reflection upon the event that took place in February at Old Parliament House.
For the first time in my memory we saw a formally convened public debate. The debate that occurred did a lot more than canvass the issues. It gave an opportunity for all Australians to take out a stake in our future. I say that not just on the basis of having involved both elected representatives and members of the public but on the basis that the momentum, the support and the media involvement in presenting that Convention to Australians allowed it into people's homes and allowed people to have an active stake in what was occurring.
In current times when there is so much disillusionment about political processes and political parties, I believe that we can all take stock and learn much from the Constitutional Convention. Conducting a debate of that nature, not in this place amongst the estab 
 lished political parties but in Old Parliament House involving the wider group of people, was something that I think contributed greatly to bringing such a positive interest. In saying that, it forces me to reflect upon people's attitudes towards this place and the gulf between the response that we get from the public as opposed to the response that was attained by the Constitutional Convention.
I think every political party, indeed every politician who has spent some time in this place, would understand how critical it is to involve the public in our democratic processes. The ongoing constitutional review process therefore presents a unique opportunity to do exactly that. It links an open forum and, therefore, hopefully the involvement and engagement of the Australian public in a political issue that will assist us in determining our future path.
The broad nature of the agenda that has been flagged for that ongoing constitutional review, I think, sends a very powerful message as to what the concerns of people are with respect to their involvement in our democracy. The list goes as follows: the role of the three tiers of government; the rights and responsibilities of citizenship; whether the Commonwealth should have the environment power; the system of governance and proportional representation; whether the mechanism for constitutional change should be altered; constitutional aspects of indigenous reconciliation; equal representation of women and men in parliament; and ways to better involve people in the political process.
In the time critical lives of citizens these days, it is a difficult task to actively engage them in considerations of this type. To seek their views and ensure that that input comes into this place is something that is beholden on all of us as representatives. I am hopeful that an ongoing constitutional review process will facilitate this in the most positive way. It will provide a focus on which people can be involved, not in a negative sense. I suppose the traditional way that people become politically active is through fighting against child care or nursing home cuts and against losing their job or their job security. That is usually what inspires people's political activism. It is 
 a negative thing and it is born out of being hurt in some way.
This process is the first example I have seen of a positive way to involve people in our democratic processes and systems, particularly for young people. It has provided an opportunity for them to feel like they did have a stake, a say and a grip on their future. It is incredibly important for us as a parliament to ensure that such positive opportunities for encouraging political activism occur. It is not good enough to deny particularly young people but all Australians the opportunity to participate in an active and positive way.
I believe that the ongoing constitutional review process is important. I believe that the statement by the Attorney-General (Mr Williams), whilst canvassing the issues—quite dryly, I might add—about the convention, provides a statistical analysis. It does not take the time to draw upon the reflections of the convention about ongoing constitutional reform and the broad expression of view of those at the convention that this was but the first step in widening the discussion and scope of considerations about our constitutional future.

—I call Senator Schacht.",SENATE,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Constitutional Convention</title>,Ministerial Statements,28,1,speech
"Schacht, Sen Chris",ALP,1998-07-02,"—Mr Acting Deputy President—
—What?
—Senator Schacht was the first one that caught my attention. You will get a chance.
—I know that.
—Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. I just jumped to my feet. I am not in any way trying to cut other people out of the debate, but I do want to speak to the motion to note the ministerial statement on the Constitutional Convention. I was not a delegate to the convention, but I have had an interest in the issue for a long time. I had the honour, of which I feel very proud, at the 1991 national conference of the Labor Party, to move a motion committing the Labor Party to the policy of having Australia become a republic by 1 January 
 2001. I have spoken in this place on a number of occasions, in various debates, about the need for Australia to become a republic, so I welcome this opportunity to speak to the report of the Constitutional Convention.
During the period of the convention, especially the last week, I was laid up in bed at home with a very bad dose of the flu. I found myself inexorably drawn to the television set to watch the direct telecast by the ABC, particularly during the last three days of the debate. Like many other Australians, especially those who are not members of parliament, I felt there was a certain excitement towards the end of the conference when the motions were adopted in favour of Australia becoming a republic. I would have to say that many of the speeches made by delegates, from all sides of the debate, were excellent speeches and did credit to themselves, to the conference—the convention—and, above all, to Australia.
—You were very critical before it started.
—I will come to that, Senator Ferguson. I do not withdraw my criticism which the Labor Party had that the convention should have been all elected rather than appointed. Having half of it appointed really affected the result and the style of it. Had it been a fully elected convention and the vote taken at the end, whichever way it had gone there could have been no argument about the credibility—that this was a proper expression of the will of the people. We were also critical of the postal ballot arrangements. We wanted a full election under Commonwealth law of people attending a polling booth to vote.
We know that this convention was drawn up in a fit of panic, in a hurry, by Alexander Downer when he was leader of the Liberal Party. But despite all those inhibitions and the structural weaknesses of the convention, the delegates to the conference certainly performed in a way that brought credit to themselves and Australia. As I said, I spent three days, I think, watching the convention on television. I congratulate all of those delegates who participated—from all sides—on the contributions they made.
One of the things that came out of the convention was that, in the end, even the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) was overcome to an extent by the success of the convention and accepted that there was now a strong view that there ought to be a direct referendum of the people to decide, in the next term of the Australian government, whether Australia should become a republic. There were two models to be put: the status quo; and the model proposed by the convention, which is that of a president appointed by a consensus majority of the Australian parliament. There was much debate at the convention about the merits of directly electing the president or appointing the president, and that is all contained in these reports. Those are issues that I think the convention addressed very eloquently.
For most of us, the fundamental issue is that, if you elect the president, you change the very nature of representative government in Australia. If you appoint the president as a ceremonial head of state, you maintain the present system of government in Australia, where the Prime Minister, elected by the people, is the political head of the country so long as he or she maintains the confidence of the House of Representatives, along with the other arrangements within our federal constitution.
One of the things that came out of the convention was that, while we certainly should have the referendum as soon as possible after the next election, we need to determine whether we will have a president as the head of Australia. I believe that the first function of the new president should be to declare open the Sydney Olympic Games in September 2000.
The Prime Minister has tried to suggest that the Prime Minister should open the Olympic Games, because if you stick to the head of state, under the present Olympic rules, the Queen of Australia—the Queen of Great Britain—would have to open the games. I think most Australians overwhelmingly want an Australian head of state to declare open the games, not the Prime Minister. But the Prime Minister has tried to get out of that, and I think that shows weak leadership.
With the success of the referendum to have Australia become a republic, the subsequent debate that will clearly follow will be on the issue of having a unique Australian flag that reflects Australia, without having 25 per cent of it reflecting another country. I note that some people in the chamber at the moment are wearing ties that suggest that 25 per cent of their support may be for another country. I think we need a unique Australian flag that—
—Even South Africa has a Union Jack on their flag—the Republic of South Africa.
—Senator Ferguson, I am trying to wind up. I point out that the new South Africa has adopted a unique flag which is now recognised automatically around the world. We should also move, after we become a republic, to have a uniquely Australian flag that reflects Australian values, and not have 25 per cent of it representing another country. I look forward to the referendum and to Australia becoming a republic by the time of the Sydney Olympic Games.",SENATE,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Constitutional Convention</title>,Ministerial Statements,28,1,speech
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,1998-07-02,"—I thank Senator Schacht for closing his remarks, and I thank Senator Ferguson for his patience. I will explain the reason for the exclamation by Senator Margetts and me earlier. It related to the convention that the chair gives due consideration—I know it does theoretically—to both sides of the House. I assume that means all parties, and we were very keen to get the call. I will be brief so that Senator Ferguson has an opportunity also to address this report of the Constitutional Convention.
It is quite exciting to see these volumes tabled in the parliament today. It is testimony to a wonderful and very moving event—emotionally, intellectually, politically and, I suppose, democratically—that took place for two weeks in February this year. As I remarked on that occasion, it was a great convention which reflected—more so, I believe, than any meeting in our nation's history—the richness of the nation that we have become.
I say that for a number of reasons, having looked at the diversity and the difference that was reflected and represented at that convention. There were young people, older people, indigenous Australians, non-indigenous Australians and people from different ethnic and cultural backgrounds. I make special note of distinguished Australians, ranging from Dame Roma Mitchell to Don Chipp, the founder of my party. There were the younger delegates to whom Senator Lundy referred, who are renowned for their talent and abilities—people like Mia Handshin, Misha Schubert and Jason Li. There was a range of talent and experience. That, alone, was a wonderful expression and symbol of the nation that we have become.
Notwithstanding the fact that we had very different views on occasions, I think we managed to reach a point, not of unanimous agreement on determining the model that we would take to a referendum, but certainly of an overwhelming desire to see an Australian head of state. That high figure that voted for the move towards an Australian head of state was not necessarily reflected in the final model.
A number of models were discussed at the convention. Firstly, there was the McGarvie model—perhaps the one with which I had the most difficulty as a republican. Secondly, there was the so-called bipartisan model—the Australian Republican Movement's model. Again, I would like to think of that as more of a cross-party model; nevertheless, it still emphasises the role of the two major parties in our parliament. Thirdly, there were direct election models. I put on record that that would be my personal preference—an ambit claim, if you like—but not without very substantial constitutional changes as well.
I have remarked in this place before about my concerns with some of the elements of that final model, not least of which is the unappreciation of the role of the Senate. I think the Senate was undervalued in a number of the models discussed at the convention. I place on record yet again my concern that the Senate does not necessarily play the same role as that of the House of Representatives, certainly in the appointment of a head of state 
 under the final bipartisan model. I think there is a disproportionate advantage given to the House of Representatives; understandably, in a joint sitting of parliament, it is very clear where the majority of numbers lie in that circumstance.
Also, I have a concern about the lack of a role for the Senate in the dismissal of the Australian head of state under the particular model, because I think there is an element of natural justice involved. Some of you may recall that the preferred model came up with a process for dismissal that would allow the Prime Minister essentially to sack the Australian head of state, albeit with ratification of the House of Representatives, after he or she made that decision—within 30 days, I believe, was the figure given. But even if the House of Representatives did not ratify the Prime Minister's decision to sack the head of state, that person would still lose their job. They would remain eligible to stand again for that position, but there is still an outstanding element of natural justice there. I am also concerned that the Senate does not have a role in that dismissal process. So there are still outstanding concerns.
I would like to place on record how happy I was that an overwhelming number—I think almost a unanimous number—at the convention voted to remain part of the Commonwealth, and why wouldn't we? Why not aspire to be and remain part of something more than a single nation, being a member of a family of nations as diverse as our own cultural make-up and hopefully all dedicated to the wellbeing and peace of this planet? There was also interest in changing the preamble of the constitution.
I conclude by saying that this is a wonderful opportunity—and this was recognised by some at the convention—to address other structural problems with our constitution. As a Democrat, I believe in more substantial constitutional change, but I recognise it is going to happen in bits and pieces, not all in one go. Again, I urge the Australian people to take this opportunity, perhaps in the near future more than later, to address issues such as electorate reform, the role of the states, the powers of the Governor-General or head of 
 state, perhaps the need for parliamentary ratification of troop deployments or of treaties, and how we can enshrine in the preamble or in our constitution our uniquely multicultural society and give recognition to traditional owners of this land. There are many other areas that I could happily mention, but I will end off with one other, that is, perhaps recognising the environment in our constitution.",SENATE,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Constitutional Convention</title>,Ministerial Statements,28,1,speech
"Ferguson, Sen Alan",LP,1998-07-02,"—I was very fortunate to be an appointed delegate to the Constitutional Convention as a Liberal Party representative. I heartily concur with the sentiments expressed by Senator Stott Despoja about the success of the Constitutional Convention. Unfortunately, I was not able to attend the first week of the convention owing to the death of my brother, but I did follow it with keen interest. During the second week, I was able to be part of the ongoing functions of the Constitutional Convention.
It was amazing to hear Senator Schacht speak the way he did, when I remember how bitterly opposed the Labor Party were to the holding of the Constitutional Convention and the manner in which delegates were half elected and half appointed to that convention. When members of the Labor Party spoke on the legislation when it came before the Senate they said it could not possibly be a success because the convention would be stacked with people—because 76 were appointed—in order to contrive a result that the Prime Minister would want. How wrong those people proved to be. Even at the end of the convention, when the Leader of the Opposition spoke he acknowledged the fact that they had made a mistake in suggesting that the Constitutional Convention would be anything other than the success that it was.
If we had elected all of the delegates to that convention, many of the fine young people who Senator Stott Despoja spoke about would not have been there. We made sure that there were groups of people from ethnic origins, a certain percentage of young people and a certain number of Aboriginal people who all had the opportunity to be there to contribute and represent those sections of the community 
 which would have found it very difficult to get there under a system of election.
—That is what Idi Amin used to say. That is how he ran Uganda.
—Senator Quirke, you obviously were not at this Constitutional Convention and you do not quite understand. Had Senator Lundy and Senator Stott Despoja been here, they would have acknowledged, as was acknowledged by those people who were at the convention, that they would not have been there unless they had been appointed and special consideration had been given to the groups of people who would have found it very difficult to be elected. Some were elected, but the majority of people mentioned by Senator Stott Despoja were actually appointed as delegates to the Constitutional Convention.
We heard Senator Schacht speak at length about the decision that was made in relation to the proposal that will be put to the people after the next election—and that commitment was made prior to the Constitutional Convention—that a referendum of the people would be held after the next election. I do not share his view about the importance of the Olympic Games when you are talking about constitutional change. The Olympic Games is a very important sporting event, but there are far greater considerations, when talking about altering a constitution which has served us well for 100 years and we hope will serve us well for many more hundreds of years into the future, than fitting in with a sporting event that is going to happen in Australia. There will, of course, need to be change as time goes by. There always has been over the past 100 years. However, we are now talking about a major change and the timing of a sporting event is not something that I think should determine when a change should take place.
It is also interesting to note that at the start of the convention the Prime Minister urged people to give an indication. He said, if clear support for a particular republican model emerged from the convention, that that model would be put to the Australian people in a referendum before the end of 1999, and he committed his government to that referendum. 
 It is interesting to note that the proposed model that came out of that convention did not have the support of 50 per cent of the people at the convention. I am not suggesting that there were not 50 per cent of the people there who were in favour of Australia becoming a republic, but 75 out of 152 convention delegates—which is just less than 50 per cent—in the end supported the model that was put forward as the most popular model.
That gives an indication that, as far as any possible change of Australia to a republic is concerned, there is still a lot of uncertainty within the Australian community as to how that should take place. That is why I think that if change is to be made we should be making haste slowly. I think it would be wrong for a change to take place that less than 50 per cent of the Australian population were happy with. It means that all those people at the Convention still could not come up with more than 50 per cent support for the model that was proposed.
I did consider it an honour and a privilege to attend that Constitutional Convention. I think it was a marvellous event for Australia. The interest that was shown by Australians through the direct telecast by the ABC indicated that people were very keen to see a debate taking place without the acrimony or the antics that are sometimes staged in this place and in the House of Representatives. People debating in a very sensible way the issues at hand and the large viewing audience indicate just how important this Convention was. I congratulate the Prime Minister on the initiative in making sure the Convention was set up and the manner in which the Convention was held. I also particularly commend the way it was conducted by the Rt. Hon. Ian Sinclair and Mr Barry Jones as Chairman and Deputy Chairman of the Convention.
—Senator Margetts.",SENATE,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Constitutional Convention</title>,Ministerial Statements,28,1,speech
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-07-02,"—Thank you—
—I raise a point of order, Mr Acting Deputy Chairman. I have been in this chamber since this debate started. I consistently stood up when the call was 
 given, and my colleague who has just been called has not been here.
—There is no point of order. I have called Senator Margetts.
—Yes, I did have to duck out of the chamber momentarily, but I was actually standing when the first—
—I did too, and each time since.
—Yes. One of the issues that was brought up by Senator Stott Despoja at the initial stage was that we thought this was a 30-minute limited debate, and of course, that was of great concern—
—It is a limited debate, Senator Margetts. You have very limited time.
—Well, I would like to make the point then that the problem for this debate was that there were two Labor people chosen in a row—
—Senator Margetts, I suggest you use the time you have rather than debate that issue.
—I think I am allowed to use my time in the way that I choose to.
—Order! The time for the debate has expired. I might point out, Senator McKiernan, that, as Senator Margetts said, there had been two Labor speakers, and that is why she was called.
—That was no reason to overlook me, Mr Acting Deputy President, no reason at all. If you are incompetent in the chair, you want to give the job away.
—Order! I take that as a reflection on the chair. Will you apologise.
—You can take it any way you like, Mr Acting Deputy President.
—Senator McKiernan, I ask you to retract that comment. I ask you to remove that reflection on the chair, by retraction. Senator 
 McKiernan, are you going to respond? I name you, Senator McKiernan.
—I think that Senator McKiernan, on refection, would agree that it was a reflection on the chair. It hardly warrants a major confrontation over a matter of this significance. I was present at the time Senator Margetts was overlooked, I thought. She was on her feet. I hardly think it warrants a major confrontation. I would ask Senator McKiernan in the interests of order that he withdraw the reflection on the chair.
—On a point of order, Mr Acting Deputy President. I was watching on the television, and I do not pretend to be across all the detail of what occurred. Perhaps the wisest course of events now would be to go to the next item of business, and allow you, Mr Acting Deputy President, and Senator McKiernan to review the Hansard . Then perhaps Senator Calvert and I could use our good offices to ensure that the matter is resolved, rather than waste the time of the Senate in an unfortunate and potentially ugly dispute. That process would at least allow us to get on with business. I offer that as a suggestion of goodwill for solving the problem.
—Yes, I think that might be a sensible suggestion. The point I was making prior to Senator McKiernan's reflection on the chair was that I had called two Labor senators earlier in the debate and Senator Margetts had therefore missed the opportunity to speak on that occasion. I then called a government senator, as is normal practice. Then it was appropriate to move back to the opposition side and appropriate to call Senator Margetts from that side, given that two Labor senators had already spoken in the debate. Notwithstanding the fact, Senator McKiernan, that you had stood, it was still appropriate to choose an alternative opposition senator from that side.",SENATE,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Constitutional Convention</title>,Ministerial Statements,28,1,speech

Off the record—shield laws for journalists' confidential sources
In October 1994 the then Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs released its first report entitled ""Off the Record"". The report was part of the Committee's wide ranging inquiry into the rights and obligations of the media generally. The report addressed only one aspect of the terms of reference given to the Committee, that is whether journalists should be allowed to protect the identity of their sources on information.
The ""Off the Record"" report raised issues that were related to other aspects of the Committee's work which it is planning to examine as part of the inquiry.

"Herron, Sen John",LP,1998-07-02,"—I present the following government response to a committee report: Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee—Report on the Sun Fund Bill 1997 .
I seek leave to incorporate the response in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The document read as follows—
Preamble
The Government has considered the report of the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee into the Sun Fund Bill 1997  and is pleased to provide the following response. The Government would like to acknowledge the Committee for preparing a concise and clear report which seeks to address the range of issues relating to the Sun Fund Bill . The Committee's recommendations are addressed in turn below. 

Recommendation 1
1)	 The Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee recommends that the Bill in its current form not be supported because of the linking of the Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme (DFRS) to the conservation objectives of the Bill. It would make the Bill more controversial without achieving the funding objective intended. In addition the Bill does not address the fact that any scheme would require the development of hybrid systems based on today's technology.

The Government agrees with this recommendation.
The Sun Fund Bill 1997  proposed the creation of the Sun Fund using money that would otherwise be paid as diesel fuel rebate on fuel used for electricity generation. Farmers and others eligible for the diesel fuel rebate can opt instead for a grant to subsidise the capital cost of installing renewable energy systems to replace diesel electricity generation.
The Committee concluded that the scheme, as proposed by the Bill, for payment of capital contribution to assist acquisition of renewable energy generating plant has two weaknesses.
The first weakness is that the diesel fuel rebate is not disbursed from a specifically appropriated fund, but is a rebate scheme under which Government foregoes revenue already collected as excise in accord with a statutory scheme.
In their submissions to the Committee, the Minister for Resources and Energy and the Department of Industry, Science and Tourism pointed out that the scheme is not revenue neutral in that, if the Sun Fund were to be introduced, the diesel fuel would not be sold and the excise would not be paid to revenue and would not offset grant payments. The Committee was of the view that ""the operation of the Sun Fund will not be revenue neutral to the Commonwealth Government if flow-on effects of the Fund are not considered. Even if offsetting revenue considerations of `externalities' resulting from the operation of the Fund are considered it is far from clear that the Sun Fund would be revenue neutral or positive. The significance of `externalities' in this debate cannot be clarified without an in depth and complex economic analysis of the flow-on effects of the Fund on both Commonwealth Government finances, private industry and the community.""
The second weakness identified by the Committee is that the Bill does not take into consideration that primary producers and others who wish to switch to the use of renewable energy systems would, on evidence to the Committee, need to continue consumption of diesel fuel in backup generators. These producers, using hybrid systems, would still be eligible for payment of the rebate for the diesel fuel used. 

Recommendation 2
2)	 The Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee recommends that the Government investigate the implementation of a scheme to also encourage the increased use of renewable energy systems in regional and remote areas of Australia. The Committee considers that it could have the following beneficial effects:
.	 eligible beneficiaries of the scheme would have the capacity to jointly use diesel and renewable energy generation;
.	 provision of up front financial assistance overcomes one of the most significant impediments to the expansion of renewable energy, namely the comparatively high capital cost;
.	 jobs would be generated in rural and regional Australia in manufacturing, sales, installation and service; and
.	 Australia's greenhouse gas emissions would be reduced directly through the conversion from fossil fuel electricity generation to renewables; more significantly the competitiveness of the expanded renewables industry should be improved compared with conventional generation with increased savings in greenhouse gas emissions into the future.
The Government notes this recommendation by the Committee, and has in place a range of measures to support the greater uptake of renewable energy, including in regional and remote areas.
These include support for R&D of renewables through a range of government initiatives, for example, the Cooperative Research Centre for Renewable Energy which supports the development of efficient and cost-effective renewable systems, and the R&D Start program aimed at assisting Australian industry to undertake R&D with high commercial potential. The Renewable Energy Industry Program assists in the development of a viable renewable energy industry through technology commercialisation and market development.
The Australian renewable energy industry has also been a major beneficiary of overseas aid projects being provided through Australia's international aid agency, AusAID.
The Commonwealth Government's climate change package announced in November 1997 will provide a major stimulus to the use of renewable energy in Australia.
The package provides $5.6 million to accelerate market reforms of the energy industry, including rapid progress to full cost-reflectivity in energy pricing which will remove current distortions which can disadvantage renewables.
The package also includes a target for electricity retailers and wholesale purchasers of electricity to source an additional 2% of their electricity from 
 renewable energy sources by 2010. Although this measure refers to on-grid applications, it will significantly enlarge the domestic market for renewables generally, including off-grid applications in regional and remote areas of Australia where renewables are most likely to be competitive. This is because the economies of scale gained by producers selling into the on-grid market will bring down unit prices for renewables appropriate for regional markets, both on- and off-grid.
The climate change package also has a major focus on commercialisation in the renewable energy area.
The first of the new initiatives is the establishment of a Renewable Energy Innovation Investment Fund to provide equity for the commercialisation of renewable energy technology. With private sector financing on a 2:1 basis, a fund of at least $20 million will provide venture capital funds managed by an independent funds manager.
The second initiative is a $30 million package of concessional loans and grants for strategically important renewable energy projects that have strong commercial potential. This will be integrated with the existing Renewable Energy Industry Program. Expert advice will be sought from the renewable energy industry on the implementation of this initiative.
A $10 million showcase fund will also be set up to support leading edge renewable energy projects. Here priority will be given to projects which have significant industry support; which are close to becoming commercial; and which have great potential to be replicated.
Lastly, a renewable energy technology Internet web site will be established to provide information on renewable energy technologies, which will be accessible to even the remotest regional community.
The overall package of renewable energy measures provides effective market stimulation for technology commercialisation. The Government believes that the range of measures put in place will provide effective support for the application of renewable energy technologies where they are most cost-effective, and prepare Australia for greater uptake of renewable energy in the medium and long term.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report: Government Response</title>,Committees,29,2,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1998-07-02,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
I wish to speak briefly on the government response to the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee report on the Sun Fund Bill 1997 . The government response to the Sun Fund Bill report and, indeed, to the bill itself is totally inadequate. The outcome of the committee's 
 report was effectively that the committee said it did not support the bill in its current form. However, the committee pointed out in recommendation 2 that there was a lot going for the thrust of the bill and that the government would do well to investigate ways of implementing the idea behind the bill; namely, that people in rural areas and in freestanding situations—that is, disconnected from main energy grids—should be given help to get up alternative energy options such as solar power, wind power and so on.
But the government has done none of that. In this report it window-dresses and tries to cover the fact that, since it came to government, money spent on research and development of energy renewables has been going backwards. This is an extraordinary business with Australia, the country in the sun, actually spending less on research and development into solar and wind power than countries like Switzerland.
It is an extraordinary failure of the government to come to grips with the fact that, in the energy field, we are in an age of energy renewables coming to the fore. This is shown in the fact that the minister representing the coal industry in this place—the Minister for Resources and Energy, Senator Parer—has ensured that more research and development goes into dirty, polluting coal power with a view to fixing it up and giving it a green face, with the hopeless objective that, somehow or other, magically it will not be a major polluter and greenhouse gas producer and therefore not a threat to the whole planet in the future because of its contribution to global warming. The very sparse amount of money that was spent by the previous Labor government on research and development into solar power and wind power has been cut to ribbons.
I reject this response. It is totally inadequate. It shows a government that has got its head stuck in the sand; it shows a government that is turning its back on innovative small business in this country; it shows a government that is turning its back on some of the world's best research and development into energy renewables, as other countries forge ahead into producing the energy renewable know-how that will give them the lead in a 
 multi-billion export business in the years to come; and, I guess worst of all, it shows it is a government with its head in the sand as far as regional and rural Australia are concerned.
The idea of the Sun Fund Bill is that it would have created 1,000 jobs in our rural and regional areas. Yet it is being dismissed by a wave of the hand in this totally inadequate response from the government. What happened in the end was that the government got stuck on the fact that the Sun Fund Bill, which was an attempt to divert money out of the diesel fuel rebate into energy renewables, could not be shown to be neutral in terms of spending. But the government is prepared to pour millions into research and development for the coal industry, which is already making millions and billions by extracting coal from the planet but at the same time putting greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.
The government response has totally missed the point of the Sun Fund Bill. I think it has also totally missed the report of the committee, which was that Australia would benefit from taking up energy renewables that would steer us away from our pretty poor record globally in terms of polluters and greenhouse gas producers. This response is a failure. It just corroborates the idea abroad amongst the energy renewable community in this country that the government not only does not understand but also has applied a studied ignorance to an area in which Australia should be leading the field—not being dragged back by a government which does not understand.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report: Government Response</title>,Committees,29,2,speech
"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,1998-07-02,"—I wish to speak on this government response, having been a member of the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee which produced the report on the Sun Fund Bill 1997 . Firstly, it is important to note, as mentioned by Senator Brown, that the committee was not prepared to support the Sun Fund Bill in the way it was proposed. Recommendation 1 of the committee's report stated that to accept the bill:
. . . would make the Bill more controversial without achieving the funding objective intended. 

That is the point Senator Brown made about the proposal being cost neutral. But then the committee said:
In addition the Bill does not address the fact that any scheme would require the development of hybrid systems based on today's technology.
In other words, that any scheme would require back-up diesel powered schemes. So what was needed to be developed was something which took into account those factors in any scheme which was to be funded.
In recommendation 2 the committee highlighted one of the significant issues that arose from the inquiry, that it was necessary for there to be provision of up-front financial assistance to overcome one of the most significant impediments to the expansion of renewable energy; namely, the comparatively high capital cost. Unfortunately, the government response does not address that point. That is one of the key points in the implementation of alternative energy strategies, particularly in rural and remote Australia.
It seems to me that the government response has ignored what is essentially a key finding of the committee. If the government is serious about having renewable energy sources taken up in the bush—where in many areas there is not access to electricity grids and where we are talking about small power usage units such as farms, stations and the like, rather than mining camps, for example, that have a significant need for power and which might in some respects be catered for by the government's response—and if the rural producers operating in regional and remote Australia are going to take up this option then they need to be provided with up-front financial assistance to overcome the impediment—the comparatively high capital cost—to the implementation of these sorts of schemes.
It is true that, if the schemes are taken up and assistance is given, jobs will be created in rural and regional Australia, potentially in the manufacturing of these systems as well as in their installation and maintenance. There is potential for the generation of jobs in rural and regional Australia by the promotion of the use of renewable energy systems. But the view of the committee is that this is not going 
 to happen unless there is some up-front financial assistance provided to primary producers in rural and regional Australia, in particular, so that they have the wherewithal to take up this option which delivers an outcome for the government in its greenhouse gas reduction strategy.
I believe it would be important for this Senate to further consider this matter. Obviously it is a matter for Senator Brown whether he seeks to introduce further legislation and whether he deals with it in the same fashion. The reality, frankly, is that unless this issue is picked up by the major parties, as is suggested by the report endorsed by both sides of this committee, we will simply be talking about this issue and not doing anything about it. That is the problem with the government's response. It does not look like it is willing to pick up this issue. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

Paragraph (1), omit ""Friday 10 July 1998"", substitute ""Thursday, 9 July 1998"".
Omit paragraphs (2) to (6), substitute:
(2)	 The hours of sitting and routine of business shall be in accordance with standing orders 55(1) and 57.

	 (i)	 the government business order of the day relating to the Native Title Amendment Bill 1997; and
	 (ii)	 other business as listed on the Notice Paper .
The government is asking the Senate to sit for an extra week because of its desire to get through a wish list of legislation in the current sittings. This is legislation that the government has been unable to schedule in such a way as to facilitate the orderly and expeditious debate of its legislative program.
The government's request, amazingly enough, is being made after two weeks of extra sittings, with late nights, early starts and sittings on Fridays, and the opposition even agreed—and in fact offered—to give up general business today. I must make the important point that the opposition agreed to all these additional sittings, with more time for the government's legislative program, on one basis: to avoid the need for additional sittings next week.
We are not of a mind to simply set aside all the earlier understandings—although I know that in the modus operandi of the government understandings mean nothing—and agree to sit an extra five days to suit the government's convenience. However, we do accept that Senator Harradine, having finally consummated a deal with the government on the issue of native title, and the government having determined to bring the  Native Title Amendment Bill 1997 [No. 2]  back to the parliament, has created an exceptional circumstance.
I have to say that, while we do not consider the deal itself to be in the national interest, we do accept that this is an issue of national importance. We are prepared to make the time available for the purpose of debating the Native Title Amendment Bill. We are not prepared to make the time available just for the purpose of taking the pressure off poor old Senator Ian Campbell. This is not for the purpose of allowing Senator Ian Campbell to get the ministers in the Howard government off his back because he has failed to manage the government's legislation program properly and to get the legislation through. Accordingly, I am moving on behalf of the opposition, 
 firstly, that the Senate follow its usual routine of business next week and, secondly, that the 
	 Native Title Amendment Bill
be listed first on the order of government business on Monday of the extra sitting week.
Should this amendment find favour with the Senate, the opposition will continue to cooperate in moving through the remainder of the government's legislative program expeditiously in what remains of the sittings for this week, as we have so far. We anticipate that next week will be taken up with the debate on the native title bill. At the end of a sitting period or session, there are inevitably bills on the program that are held over until the next sittings. It has always been the case. Certainly we have seen during the life of this parliament for the first time in well over a decade an opposition that is willing to work constructively with the government. We do not come with the negativist, carping attitude that the coalition had to our then Labor government's legislation program. We have always taken the view on these sorts of issues that we are not just an opposition. We approach these sorts of matters from the perspective of an alternative government. The next sittings are scheduled to commence on 10 August.
—Estimates a week before.
—And estimates, as Senator Ray properly says, are a week before. That would delay any legislation that is held over only four weeks, which is one of the shortest times I can ever recall between the sessions of any parliament. Given that the native title bill will have passed the Senate and that the so-called need for an early federal election will have evaporated, we do not believe this should cause the government or the parliament any major inconvenience.
We now have before us the list of legislation that the government wishes to see dealt with before the Senate rises for the winter recess. This list has been circulated by the Manager of Government Business in the Senate. I assume that it has the authority of the government as a whole. What does this circulated list say about the government's priorities for the remainder of this sitting? It is apparently the case that the government 
 sees country of origin labelling, gas pipeline access, intellectual property and aviation legislation to be of greater priority than the native title bill. They are important bills, but I fail to comprehend how anyone could suggest they have more importance or political currency than does the Native Title Amendment Bill.
—Do you think we should deal with it before the piece of legislation comes across?
—What is the House of Representatives going to do tomorrow?
—They are going to deal with it.
—Exactly. That is what I said, Senator Campbell. You have to catch up with what is happening.
—But you are saying— 
—Order! Senator Campbell, your turn to respond will come in a minute.
—What I am saying is that you will deal tomorrow with those bills in the legislation program that you can. You will then deal with the Native Title Amendment Bill from Monday next week. You have to listen. Take some advice from someone who knows a great deal more about this than you.
Even more telling in considering the proposed order of business next week, an additional week for these sittings, is that we find the Manager of Government Business in the Senate indicating that the Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill should be dealt with before the native title bill. That is what Senator Campbell is saying. We want to know on what basis he says the parliament should do that.
—No I don't.
—That is what your forward legislation program shows—
—No it doesn't; that's not a priority.
—That pathetic document that you have produced for us.
—It never has and it never will.
—The Labor Party—
—You are a liar.
—Order! Senator—
—The Labor Party has always believed that native title is a fundamentally important issue for the nation.
—Order! Senator Faulkner—
—We have always acted on this basis during all parliamentary debates on the issue while in government or opposition.
—Senator Faulkner, might I just interrupt. Senator Campbell, you will withdraw that remark. 
—That he is a dope, a liar or a paradigm?
—You will withdraw all of the remarks that you have made. You know that it is a breach of the standing orders. It is unparliamentary. I ask you to stand in your place and withdraw.
—I withdraw.
—I also say that you should not continue your interjections because they are also unparliamentary, and you will have your chance to respond. I call Senator Faulkner.
—It is because of the significance that we attach to this issue—as everyone would know—that we have engaged in serious and detailed consideration of native title amendments in the past, and we will do so when the bill is before us again. I would remind the Senate that the bill has been passed in this place not once but twice in recent times, contrary to the Liberals' assertion that we have been obstructionist. The opposition, of course, has always addressed the matter in a very constructive manner. We have always focused on issues regarding basic rights and workability for all parties involved. The Senate has never obstructed this bill.
We are keen to closely examine the new bill and the deal that the government has done with Senator Harradine, with the objective of doing our best to have a workable and equitable set of arrangements passed by the parliament and operational as soon as possible. I have to say that, in contrast to this, there is no urgency attached to the Telstra privatisation bill.
Of course we know that the Prime Minister's plans for an early election have mostly been derailed by the disaster that the coalition parties suffered in the Queensland election. As Kim Beazley said, the Prime Minister has lost his alibi for an early election. But 10 August is only five weeks away. The Prime Minister does not need to take the country to an election until next year, and the logical thing would be to set the Telstra sale bill aside.
I would remind the Senate of the commitment the government made in relation to Telstra. It was the Prime Minister who in fact said that he would not be proposing the full privatisation of Telstra during this parliament. That was yet another one of the Prime Minister's non-core promises because here we have it before him, even though there is a very significant amount of disputation in the government parties about this issue. We all understand that he has a device before the people now to say that he will not submit the bill for royal assent until after the next election.
—Never, ever, ever?
—That is right, never, ever. That is a device to enable the Prime Minister to claim that he is trying to honour one of his election commitments to privatise only one-third of Telstra in this term. We know that the Prime Minister believes, whatever the outcome of the general election, that the Senate will be far more difficult for him on the full privatisation of Telstra after a new Senate is sworn in. So he can take advantage of the current numbers. The thing is the current numbers: the current Senate, if there is a half-Senate election, will be in place of course until 30 June next year.
This is a gimmick; this is misleading the Australian public. It really exposes the claims 
 of the government that this is an urgent matter and that particularly it is a more urgent matter than native title. That is what this government is saying. If there is truly no intention to submit this bill for royal assent before the next election, given that there is now no need for an early election surely there can be no legitimate reason that anyone in the government can offer for the listing of the Telstra sale bill before the debate on native title next week.
We are well aware of the fact that the government actually needs to have this bill listed for other reasons—political reasons. We know that they need to do it sooner rather than later. But the longer the Telstra bill lies on the Notice Paper the more problems there are for the coalition, the more problems there are for the National Party. It will fester and corrode within the coalition parties.
Of course, Senator McGauran would know that. He knows that this is just dynamite for the coalition. We had Ms De-Anne Kelly, the member for Dawson, come out today and bag the Prime Minister. Let us make it absolutely clear: she is the first Nat to rat on this. She is not going to support the full privatisation of Telstra; she wants to hold her seat. We will see whether the Senate Nationals will take the same action as Ms Kelly has in Dawson.
Senator Sandy Macdonald made one of his few public statements since he has been in the parliament. He has not been a very prominent member of the coalition, as you know, but he did sort of start to get out of the starting blocks on this one. He has taken on that very weak and miserable leader of the National Party, Mr Fischer, on the issue of privatisation. We know that some members of the National Party are opposed to the full privatisation of Telstra, not out of any ideological commitment and not because they actually care about services to people in rural Australia, but because they are scared beyond belief of what the electorate might do to them in the next election if they are seen to cave in on this issue. That is why we have Telstra listed on the government's program for next week.
We do not think that these are valid reasons for the government to propose that you deal with the Telstra bill and then the native title 
 bill. They are not valid reasons for the Senate to help the government get out of a problem of its own making. We want to deal constructively with this issue.
—It's a better draft than your native title legislation was in `93.
—Where are your amendments from `93? Show us them.
—Let us talk about 1993. I am glad you raised that, Senator Ray. This is what John Howard said on the John Laws program on 23 January 1996.
Debate interrupted.
Sitting suspended from 6.30 p.m. to 7.30 p.m.
As I was saying before the break, we now know that the National Party had another crisis meeting today. They are in continual crisis meeting mode. Tim Fischer was summoned into the National Party room, kicked around a bit. Imagine being shirt fronted by, of all people, Senator Sandy Macdonald! How do you think Mr McEwen, Mr Sinclair or Mr Anthony would have dealt with Sandy Macdonald? They would have brushed him aside in the most derisory way, but not Mr Fischer, who is under threat because of Telstra. There is a rebellion in the bush. There is a rebellion in the National Party. There is now even a rebellion in the ranks of the National's coalition partners, the Liberal Party. That is what we are debating here at the moment.
This government will not even have Wik, the Native Title Amendment Bill, dealt with before Telstra. They have to get Telstra out of the road before the whole shows falls apart. We know that divisions are rife in the National Party. We know they are falling apart. We know they cannot sustain this level of internal dispute and disruption. The only way to deal with it is to try to get it off the agenda. Hang what Mr Howard has said is the most important national issue, that of native title—put that aside and get on with Telstra. We are not going to be part of this mechanism to try to control the leadership and internal political tensions within the coalition parties and between the coalition partners.
The government stands exposed on this issue. The Labor Party is putting forward a 
 sensible amendment on this issue. I urge all senators to support the amendment that I have moved on behalf of the opposition.",SENATE,<title>ORDER OF BUSINESS</title>,<title>Days and Hours of Meeting and Routine of Business</title>,Business,34,1,speech

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,1998-07-02,"—We had presented to us yesterday a unilateral proposition put by the government to change the terms of the sitting arrangements for next week. This was after the opposition had agreed with the government to an extensive period of extended hours to allow for quite an extraordinary array of government business to be dealt with. This proposition was put to us with 24 hours notice.
It is interesting when we see Senator Ian Campbell—he likes to throw around epithets willingly and freely—behave in such a petulant and childlike manner and an amateurish and inexperienced way try to abuse members of the opposition when the opposition criticises the way in which the program is actually managed here or what passes for management here. It is important for Senator Campbell to be reminded of the history of some of these matters. Only recently an officer in my office drew my attention to statements made by Senator Hill when he was opposition leader. The parliamentary database is littered with Senator Hill's pearls of wisdom when it comes to the way in which the opposition should be treated by governments.
On one occasion on 8 November 1990, Senator Robert Ray, as manager of government business at the time, gave the opposition 18 days notice of an additional week's sitting, to which Senator Hill wanted to strongly protest. He said:
We plan our diaries and commitments according to the program that the Government sets down for us. That program that this particular week as a week in which the Senate would not be sitting. Yesterday we received notice that the Senate will sit which not only is of great inconvenience to honourable senators but, more importantly, is an inconvenience 
 to those with whom they had made appointments for that week. A number of my colleagues have important obligations that week covering all of Australia, and those commitments cannot now be met.
That was with 18 days notice. He goes on to say:
The important point is that, if the Government had planned its program with any degree of reasonable competence, it would known a long time ago whether that week had to be a sitting week.
Quite clearly, this government has not planned its program with any degree of reasonable competence. A proposition was put to us yesterday which clearly showed that the government had not planned a legislative program. We have heard from the manager of government business this evening that no bill had been drafted, yet there is an expectation that we sit next week. According to the letter he gave to me this morning, he said that the government had set aside an additional sitting week to deal with Telstra and Wik. That was the proposition put to us this morning. It is little wonder that Senator Faulkner took the view that it was clearly the government's preference to deal with legislation in terms of the forward program they had given us this morning, which lists clearly that for week six we will deal with Telstra and then the Native Title Amendment Bill.
But for this sitting week it was proposed that a whole string of legislation be dealt with including trade practices, gas pipelines, primary industries, intellectual property, wheat marketing, national transmission, copyright, aviation, child support—all of which are important measures but one would have thought no more important than Wik—in fact, considerably less important given the status that the Prime Minister has attached to the Wik legislation. Yet that is the proposition that was put to this chamber to consider. In fact, this government, in terms of the crisis that is emerging within the government, wants to talk about any other business before those measures are dealt with.
It is quite clear that the government's program is very badly managed. It is an appallingly managed program. We have seen a proposition advanced to this chamber without consultation, after we had given 
 considerable consideration to the government's program. During the life of this parliament we have seen a total of some 318 hours and 51 minutes—nearly 319 hours—of additional government business time facilitated by the opposition, which is the equivalent of almost 21 weeks of extra sitting time. In 1996, there was an additional 95 hours—almost six additional weeks; in August 1997, 43 hours and 52 minutes; in the budget sitting of 1997, 58 hours; in the spring sitting, 60 hours; in the autumn sittings, 27 hours; and in the budget sittings for this year, 28 hours. As of this week, an additional six hours and 15 minutes has been provided.
It is not as if the Senate has been sitting around doing very little. Last week some 22 bills were carried. This year close on 90-odd bills have been carried, which is far in excess of what would normally be expected in any sitting period. In this session of parliament well over 400 bills have been carried. A massive amount of time has been offered by the opposition. There have been extraordinary levels of cooperation. This stands in sharp contrast to the actions taken by the government when in opposition in its attempt to frustrate and to derail the Labor government's legislative program. We see a sharp contrast in the attitudes that we have taken.
I suggest to the Senate that the government is being hypocritical in its approach. You cannot rely upon the word of this government. You cannot assume that what this government tells you about its forward program will, in fact, be its program. When this government says that arrangements will be made, you cannot rely on its word and plan accordingly because time and again the government has not kept to its arrangements.
We saw attempts last week to try to frustrate the appropriation processes. When Senator Hill was away, Senator Alston tried to undermine the government's legislative program by insisting that digital TV be given consideration over and above the appropriation bills. Last week we pressed the issue and forced the government to acknowledge its responsibilities to meet its commitments to ensure that the budget was passed. This week we have considered Appropriation Bill (No. 
 1), Appropriation Bill (No. 2), the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill, the Health Care (Appropriation) Bill and the Electoral and Referendum Amendment Bill. We have considered a series of legislation on veterans' entitlements, national measurement, taxation laws, family law and aviation.
It is not as if the Senate has been sitting around doing nothing in this period. Yet the government is still unable to manage its program. This government simply does not know what it is doing. That is essentially the problem. The government does not have a clue as to where it is going, because it is seriously divided in its political priorities. There is division with Senator Alston and his telecommunication issues. The Prime Minister was desperate to build up the circumstances in which a double dissolution would be justified. He was desperate to construct an enormous explosive device to blow apart the Australian political system, which he thought would be in his favour, only to discover that he was desperately wrong because what actually occurred was that the bomb-maker himself was blown up, particularly by the actions of his Liberal branch in Queensland, which has obviously been mauled and now been reduced to less than party status in the Queensland parliament.
The Prime Minister had the opportunity and the option available to him to say to One Nation, `It's not on. Your sorts of policies are not acceptable in this country. We will ensure that you are put last. We will ensure that you are not part of the political dialogue in this country because the views that you represent are totally opposed to the country that we are trying to build.' What does this government do? It says, `No. We will seek—
—I raise a point of order under the standing order relating to relevance. You can have a fairly wide ranging debate, one would expect, on proposals to extend sitting hours. I think Senator Faulkner did range wide. He talked about the politics of Telstra and other matters. But to start talking about preference allocations, particularly from the mouth of someone who represents a party that put Australians against further immigration ahead of the Liberal Party 
 in the most recent federal by-election, is not only gross hypocrisy but also outside the standing orders. Mr Acting Deputy President, I ask you to call him to order.
—I counsel Senator Carr to make sure his comments are relevant to the matter under debate.
—I appreciate your advice, Mr Acting Deputy President. These are the tactics that Senator Campbell learnt when he was in the Democrats—the irrelevant points that he makes and the devices he seeks to introduce which are, quite clearly, inappropriate and totally off the mark. This government is in deep crisis. Yet what it seeks to do is to ask us to get it out of that crisis. It puts forward a motion which is, quite clearly, contrary to the understandings normally reached in this place. With our assistance, almost 21 weeks of additional sitting time have been provided and a massive number of bills have been carried. Unprecedented levels of support have been provided. But what does this government do? It breaks its word, it goes back on undertakings and then suggests to us, after making arrangements with other groups in the chamber, that it does not need to consult with other senators: it does not need to get the support of the senators around this chamber. What it needs to get is 50 per cent plus one.
I advise you, Senator Campbell, that another thing you should have learnt while you were with the Democrats was that that sort of politics does not work, and you will come unstuck with it. You will find out just how difficult it is to get on with business when you abuse people in the way in which you have, by undermining the arrangements that are made in this place by going back on your word and then seeking to stitch up sleazy arrangements in such a manner that you then seek to ignore the views of other senators in this place.
To come in here and move a motion that proposes to have government business only is to add insult to injury. You have proposed, under the routine of business that you are suggesting, that the opposition should stand aside from the normal routine of business; 
 that it should stand aside from the consideration of such matters as, on a Monday, petitions, notices of motion, the postponement and re-arrangement of business, the discovery of formal business, or any matters in regard to MPIs or urgency motions. You are suggesting we should just put that aside without noticing it, that we will not get annoyed about that sort of sleazy, underhanded, miserable attempt to try to hoodwink people.
On Tuesday, it is proposed that the same process applies. The government is suggesting that we can do without petitions, notices of motion, the normal discovery of formal business processes and that, once again, we can do without urgency motions and matters of public importance. We have not sought to abuse these rights, but we do not like sleazy attempts to strip them away from senators without consultation. You will come unstuck with that sort of miserable approach to running the affairs of this chamber.
On Wednesday, we see a similar pattern emerging. With matters of public interest, senators have an opportunity to express a view about matters of some substance which are important to them. They may not be important to ex-Democrats like Senator Campbell. They may not be important to people like Senator Campbell who have now understood the full truth of how to run a bankrupt regime. I note that Senator Faulkner looks puzzled. I do not suppose he realises what an illustrious career Senator Campbell had as a leading Democrat in Western Australia. He learnt some very bad habits. With this sort of action, he seeks to deprive the opposition of its opportunity to discuss matters of public importance on Wednesday. For that matter, he seeks, once again, to deprive the opposition of the opportunity to draw to the government's attention its failures in terms of various committee reports and government documents.
On Thursday, during the time normally set aside for opposition business, what do we see from this government? A miserable, weak attempt to slip away from its obligations, to try to silence the opposition and to prevent the opposition from giving adequate consideration to important matters of public policy. 
 We notice that, missing from this government, is any real decency in its dealings with other parties in this chamber. That, to me, will lead to serious problems for this government in terms of the management of its legislative program.
The opposition has bent over backwards to assist the government in terms of allowing its program to be considered. We make no pretence that we think it is a miserable program. We think that the policies you are proposing are going to do lasting damage to this country—
—And so do many of their own people.
—They all know it, because of the revolt that is occurring, even within the weak elements of the National Party. Jeff Kennett has had to point out some of the grave problems that are occurring in rural Australia and the failure of the Liberals to stand up to their critics within rural areas of Australia.
We understand how weak your policies are, but we have always thought you should have the opportunity to come here, to have these issues debated and to be exposed for the hypocrites and the frauds that you are. The public ought to have every opportunity to see what sort of positions you really take.
What we are seeing with this sort of proposition is an attempt to silence the opposition. It is an opposition that will not stand for that sort of behaviour. You will find that this is an extremely costly approach to take. A more reasonable approach to take, I suggest, is the one that Senator Ray took in the past when he was the manager. Senator Hill indicated that it was not good enough when he gave you 18 days notice of an extension of sittings. It was extraordinary generosity, clearly not repaid, clearly not understood and, clearly, the ingratitude of this miserable government is being seen by all here tonight.
Essentially, the government is in deep crisis. It has tried desperately to cobble together arrangements in regard to Wik, in terms of native land title. It has tried desperately to put together a legislative program, but cannot really manage it because it has to 
 chop and change, and duck and weave, depending on who is on top at any particular time within the coalition parties.
The real crisis is on the coalition benches. Costello is doing his very best to undermine the Prime Minister. Senator Hill thinks that his position is under some question in terms of his deputy. We understand the difficulties; we have seen it all before.
Senator Robert Ray interjecting—
—I think he is.
I think his real problem is that he steps out, Senator Ray, for one day, and the legislative program is overthrown; digital TV is more important than the appropriations. Senator Hill is not here to protect himself. Does he get any assistance from Senator Campbell? Of course not. Senator Campbell is very keen to look after himself.
The National Party are the really big losers in this proposition, because they are trying to stich you up, Senator Boswell, good and proper. Everyone should understand that the government's policies in terms of the privatisation of Telstra will see the end of the National Party in this country. Like so many other areas of government policy, what we are seeing is a government that is actually aiding and abetting One Nation. They are unable to cope with the crisis of their own creation in terms of building expectations for a double dissolution, on the cheap idea that they could somehow take limited, short-term advantage. They now find that the whole mechanism has blown up in their faces and is now consuming them. What we find is an attempt to cobble together this miserable compromise to seek to allow the Prime Minister more time, and some respite for an embattled Prime Minister who is unable to cope with the problems confronting us.
Quite frankly, it is just not good enough, Senator Hill, for you to try to stich us up with a proposition in the same way you are trying to stich up the National Party. We have got a bit more going for us than the National Party.
We will make sure that everybody understands that it is a miserable attempt which will fail. It will fail because, essentially, it is 
 predicated upon an assumption that you, and only you, have the right to be consulted about these matters. In this place, that is not the way it works. It is not the sort of thing that we expect; it is not the sort of thing that we will tolerate.
Finally, the opinion polls are going to cost you because you are so terrified of them. You are unable to lead, you are unable to actually work out where you want to go as a government. You should not come into the Senate and try to stitch up these arrangements to protect yourself.
—Bring back Joan Kirner.
—Here we go again; the Democrat voice, the man who has learnt nothing from his days in the Western Australian Democrats. Even the Greens in Western Australia understood how to sort you out. I am sure the National Party will help out. If they need any assistance, perhaps Senator Brown could provide some advice because he understands how to deal with ex-Democrats like Senator Ian Campbell.
I am afraid this motion is just not good enough. The Labor Party's amendment seeks to correct some of the excesses that you are proposing. It seeks to establish a legislative program which demonstrates the clear priority of Wik over Telstra. It seeks to demonstrate that you have made a terrible error in trying to trick us into a proposition which clearly will not work. The proposition which was put to us this morning clearly is not acceptable.

"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,1998-07-02,"—I will not take 20 minutes like all opposition speakers who have decided to run this filibuster to fill out the night and avoid government legislation. I have just been told that in the last 31¾ hours, apart from the non-controversial bills at lunchtime, we have had one hour of government legislation. Senator Carr and Senator Faulkner say that the opposition is so generous, that it provides the government with extra time, such as willingly forfeiting opposition members' time on Thursday afternoon. But what they do not say is that they decide to filibuster, to fill up the day with other 
 activities and thus not enable the government to debate its legislative program.
We know what this is all about: the Labor Party is sore that the government has been able to find a settlement to the longstanding Wik problem. That is in the national interest. The Labor Party left an awful mess in relation to native title. It misled the Australian people over pastoral leases. It left a native title act that was unworkable—I think two cases have been settled since that legislation was brought in. There are hundreds of claims out there which are unsettled, demonstrating that the legislation does not work.
This government has had to face up to that and it has reached a settled position which is fair and just to all parties and will give certainty to the Australian people. What the Australian people now want is for this parliament to legislate the settlement in order to get on with their lives, in order to give certainty to the indigenous people and to other stakeholders, including the pastoralists, the miners and those who have been disadvantaged by the mess that Labor left.
What this government wants—very reasonably, I would suggest—is adequate time to complete this legislative program. That should include the Wik settlement. I hope that we can complete this work in another week. We certainly can in all circumstances, except of course if the Labor Party decides to wreck the program and simply talk out the hours. Nobody disputes that it can be done. There are many opportunities for oppositions in this place to destroy a government's program, if that is their determination.
There are about 50 pieces of legislation on the Notice Paper for debate in this session. We are seeking to complete nine packages which have been on the table for a long period and then to debate the two larger bills, the  Native Title Amendment Bill 1997 [No. 2]  and the  Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill 1998 . With any reasonable degree of cooperation from the Labor Party—the opposition in this place—by the end of business tomorrow night, Friday, we would have been able to get through the nine smaller packages. Some of them have already been debated for hours. They include the  Televi 
 sion Broadcasting Services (Digital Conversion) Bill 1998 . We were told that that would take about an hour; it has now been debated for three or four hours. We do not know how long Labor is going to continue to talk on that. Senator Schacht, who has the conduct of the bill for the Labor Party, said it would take an hour and has spoken for 1½ hours himself.
We want the  Trade Practices Amendment (Country of Origin Representations) Bill 1998 , which has been around for too long. It is important for business, for trade and for industry. We want the Gas Pipelines Access (Commonwealth) Bill 1998 . It is not a big bill, but it is very important to delivering gas at competitive prices in Australia, to help greenhouse, and I would have thought even Senator Brown would be supportive of that. We want the  Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1997 , which includes a number of important provisions for primary industry; the  Intellectual Property Laws Amendment Bill 1998 ; the  Wheat Marketing Legislation Amendment Bill 1998 , which is critically important; the  National Transmission Network Sale Bill 1997 , which has also been debated for many hours; the copyright package; and the Child Support Legislation Amendment Bill 1998.
Nine pieces of legislation could easily have been dealt with in a thorough way by the close of business tomorrow, but what we have had is an opposition, the Labor Party, which has been determined that the government will not get its legislative program. So now what we are faced with is not only those nine pieces of legislation but also the extra two which I mentioned. It would still be the government's intention to seek to get through the nine pieces of legislation by the close of business tomorrow. With goodwill and a bit of cooperation, that can be achieved.
We would want to start the native title bill at the beginning of the sittings next Monday, complete that bill, and then debate and complete the Telstra bill 1998. It is not an unreasonable program, and it is not unreasonable for the people of Australia to expect this Senate to deliver at least that part of the government's program before it gets up for its break. 
What we have faced is an opposition that has taken an extraordinary length of time with practically every key reform bill that the government has had. And that is what has been the difference. It is true that it has been an opposition that has given the government extra time from time to time. I appreciate that and I have gone on record as appreciating that. But it has been balanced by the time that the opposition has then taken, which has been record or near record times, with so many pieces of legislation.
—Not us.
—Not always the Labor Party either. I concede that it is sometimes other parties in this place. The two native title bills we have had have totalled over 88 hours—
—It's the one bill—88 hours.
—That is right: one bill debated twice. The workplace relations bill took 48½ hours. The Telstra bill took just a fraction under 30 hours. The telecommunications package took 22 hours. The social security youth allowance took just under 19 hours. The Public Service bill—which did not get through in the end—took nearly 16 hours. The natural heritage trust bill, which all parties in this place said they supported, took over 15 hours. The retirement savings bill took nearly 13 hours. The Charter of Budget Honesty Bill took up nearly 13 hours. The Constitutional Convention (Election) Bill took 12 hours. The Productivity Commission Bill took just a fraction under 12 hours. The aged care bill took 11½ hours.
Take into account that in a normal sitting week there are about 15 hours for debate of government business, and one can see how impossible the program has been made by other parties in this place being determined to take an excess of time in debate. I am not arguing that this is not the place for thorough legislative consideration. Of course, it is, but it just seems to be extraordinary that during this parliament we are breaking so many records in relation to so many bills. One can only suspect that there is a determination to talk out these bills. The result of that is that 
 we do need some extra time to complete at least part of this legislative program.
We have suggested and have put on the table an extra sitting week next week. We are suggesting that there be question time and taking note of questions for the first four days of next week and that the Friday be without question time. We have not included the other various procedures on the first four days—
—Having always argued for it when you were leader. Always.
—I hear what you say. I always argued for it for opposition. And sometimes Labor gave it and sometimes they did not.
—Every time you got—
—Rubbish. What about 1993?
—I was just going to remind him of 1993 when, for five days, he and the other parties that made up the numbers in this place had this Senate sit to debate native title with—
—That was because the sittings were suspended.
—Correct, but it was a technique, Senator Ray, to avoid giving the opposition question time or any of the other rights that you now say are so precious to oppositions. So the circumstances change according to who might be on one side of the chamber. All I say is: just reflect on the totality of Labor's experience in government and you will find that when Labor has needed extra time for the job it has taken extra time, no matter which way is necessary to achieve its goal.
So we think that what we are putting is reasonable in relation to next week. It provides enough hours to enable this parliament to complete the bills that we have set down which, as I have said, are only about a quarter of those that are on the Notice Paper for this sitting. I have not included those that have already been adjourned until the next sittings of the parliament, which is about another 15 bills. What we are now seeking is support from this place to sit those extra hours in the 
 way we have suggested in order that this Senate might complete a reasonable legislative program for this session. As I said a moment ago, I think that is what the Australian people would expect of us. I think it is reasonable, and I would urge senators to support the motion moved by Senator Campbell.",SENATE,<title>ORDER OF BUSINESS</title>,<title>Days and Hours of Meeting and Routine of Business</title>,Business,34,1,speech
"Ray, Sen Robert",ALP,1998-07-02,"—I always take a slightly more sanguine view of sitting hours than some of my colleagues; I take a much more iconoclastic approach than they do. It has been a rather curious debate. We have had Senator Carr talk about throwing around epitaphs, so I would duck in future if a gravestone comes your way. I am sure he will correct the Hansard  record to that effect. We have also had Senator Carr accuse Senator Ian Campbell of being a member of the Democrats, which I know not to be true.
—It is true.
—It is not true, Senator Carr. He campaigned on their behalf but he was never a financial member. He was recruited into the Liberal Party by an ex-senator of the Liberal Party. The preselection of Senator Campbell depended on his largesse, and in his moment of despair Senator Campbell denied him thrice.
—It's not true either.
—But he was never ever a member of the Democrats. He knew to draw the line somewhere. And I really think that Senator Carr at some stage should be forced to withdraw that accusation.
Senator Hill, playing the good cop, comes in here tonight and in that reasonable, reasoned manner of his—in that sort of urbane, laid-back style—makes a plea for goodwill. I tell you where goodwill starts, Senator Hill: before you decide to have an extra sitting week with government business only, five days with three late sitting nights, you should trot around to visit or ring up the Leader of the Opposition and the manager of opposition business and have a little discussion with them. You at least test the waters.
Nothing we have said tonight indicates that we oppose sitting next week. We have not 
 said that we oppose sitting next week. We have said that there would have been at least two discussion points in those negotiations that should have occurred. The first point would have been whether it would be government business only for the week, and the second point would have been the order in which we deal with legislation.
But no—yesterday, in a burst of machoism, the Manager of Government Business barges into this chamber and gives notice of motion for an extra five sitting days of government business only with long sitting hours. What gave him the courage to do that? What motivated this Manager of Government Business, who quite often does consult and certainly is not beyond smarming up when he wants to get something through, to come into this chamber and do that? I will tell you what motivated him—38 votes. He got his courage up when he knew he could deliver 38 votes, or the equivalent after pairing, in this chamber. So there is no need to consult the riffraff. Senator Brown is irrelevant. The Democrats are irrelevant. As for the Labor Party, we do not mind that sort of treatment; we are pretty robust. But I can imagine the hurt that Senator Brown has suffered through not being consulted. I can imagine the hurt.
I have also heard many speeches in this place from one Senator Harradine who has not been consulted on occasions about sitting hours and times. We have heard him make complaints in this chamber that the major parties have ignored him. Where is he tonight? Why doesn't he come in and justify why we are having government business only for five days next week? Why doesn't he come in and say, `We weren't consulted,' when he has so often complained in the past that he has been either ignored or not properly consulted?
 Senator Hill refers to the fact that we had 88 hours on Wik in two major debates. That is absolutely right. But let me put on the record why we had 88 hours on Wik. The reason is that this opposition had the intellectual capability to draw up and move over 300 amendments—along with the Greens and the Democrats. When the equivalent circumstances occurred back in 1993, the coalition 
 did not have the wit, the wisdom or the intellectual capability to develop one amendment. Their approach to the bill was just to oppose it in its entirety—not try to modify it, not try to improve it, just oppose it. That was not a philosophical stance, Senator Boswell; that was because you were incapable of developing coherent and cogent amendments to that particular bill.
 Naturally, a bill as big as Mabo or a bill as big as Wik will take time to debate in this chamber. But we are not in a position at the moment even to start developing our amendments. Why not? Because we are told by Senator Ian Campbell that the Wik bill has not even been drafted yet. Yet we are supposed to give it mature consideration. We are supposed to develop all our amendments over the weekend—if we see a copy tomorrow—and be ready to go next week. The same applies to a lesser extent with the Telstra bill, which I will return to.
 One fact should be put on the record: as a former Manager of Government Business, I would have killed for the extra hours, the extra days and the extra weeks that we have granted you. As manager, I always used to get whinge after whinge from the coalition parties if we sat an extra hour, let alone an extra day and let alone an extra week. It was because of our experience in coming out of government that we knew that we had to cooperate more than the previous opposition and that we had to be acquiescent to demands for longer hours, for more days and for more weeks. I am not going to go through and repeat that marvellous piece of evidence put on the record by colleague Kim Carr, who detailed it greatly.
—Comrade.
—Yes, Comrade Kim Carr. You have had more cooperation on the program; you have had more cooperation on days. But you have not had such cooperation today. Why should we cooperate with you when you ambushed us yesterday and when we know that tomorrow and the next five days there will be no other business but government business transacted? So today we have had to take the time to deal with remaining issues.
—Explain our position.
—Explain our position, as the Leader of the Opposition says, on a variety of issues. And I think we are only putting—unless the coalition really annoys us—three speakers on this particular motion.
The most recent agreement that we entered into with the government was that we would sit late on the last two Tuesday nights, that we would sit late on the last two Thursday nights and that we would sit Friday last week and Friday this week. In addition—what was never really ever much granted to us when we were in government—we are giving you large slabs of government business at a time. All day on those two Fridays and those two late night sittings were government business only. We also gave up general business today. Until today, and until the insult and ambush yesterday, we had not been moving matters of public interest or urgency motions. Any of those that emerged were from other minor parties in this chamber. We were cooperating.
Senator Hill comes in here and talks about goodwill, but he has ripped up the goodwill. Goodwill according to him is when he needs the numbers and it is a bit difficult he will come and talk to the Labor Party. But, when he has the numbers, he gives us the finger salute. He just sends his manager in to propose this notice of motion and expects us to bow and scrape to the government—no way to that particular proposition.
 We have also seen too little regard being given to senators' rights over the next six days. Senator Hill said, `Oh well, back in 1993, the sittings of the Senate were suspended each time to deal with the Wik legislation,' because at that stage it was absolutely urgent that it get through. I do not know on how many occasions when we had to move for extra sitting weeks that we would draw up a relatively generous proposal only to have remits from the coalition saying, `Look, you have allowed notices of motion, you have allowed this, you have allowed that. But we would like to have the opportunity to have matters of public importance added to the list.' 
I cannot think of an occasion when I, as manager, did not tick that and insert that in the motions. But what is being proposed for next week is not only that we cannot have MPIs—and I have to say that basically we could live with that; we would like the opportunity but I do not think we would exercise it—but also we cannot even have notices of motion. You cannot have that urgent committee report that might come in debated at all. It is just the draconian regime of government business only.
—No petitions?
—No petitions.
—No adjournments?
—Yes, we are to have adjournments and I congratulate the government for leaving that in.
—No government documents.
—But we don't have petitions.
—No noting of questions?
—I am not so sure about that. I think we do have noting of questions. I think a little bauble has been thrown to us, Senator Carr. I think we have been allowed that little privilege in life to have noting of questions after question time. So I have got something to look forward to next week, haven't I—listening to all those speeches on the noting of questions; I am really thrilled about that.
Of course, we do have a provision for moving government notices of motions on Thursday, which Senator Campbell has not explained to this chamber. I am only presuming that that will give the government a capacity to move motions on Thursday to be executed on Friday as government business. I assume that is to do with giving senators leave and those normal mechanical things that this draconian imposition would in fact prevent otherwise. I assume that the government is not intending to misuse its ability alone to move government notices of motion on Thursday other than for the normal mechanical procedures that normally attend the last sitting week in the parliament.
I have to say that the opposition always argued, when we were in government, to have some rights when we sit an extra week—MPIs, notices of motion, petitions and those sorts of things. I think a decent manager of government business could have come to us and said, `Look, we will give a reasonable regime for next week. Can we have a commitment in terms of MPIs, notices of motion, contingent notices of motion to suspend standing orders and that sort of thing?' And Senator Carr, being a reasonable person, probably could have given some guarantees in that regard.
Over the years—15 or 16 years—I have seen all the grandstanding speeches attacking managers of government business in this place. I saw Don Grimes attacked and Senator Evans occasionally attacked. There was the odd mauling and hurtful thing said about my management technique, which was completely different from the previous two. I never hassled anyone. I used to just wait. I was always a very patient manager of government business. I was so patient that I was once able to wait to declare 62 bills urgent, simply because of mistakes made by the opposition.
And then we had Senator McMullan and Senator Faulkner. Time and time again we got grandstanding speeches from those opposite saying how badly they had managed the program. I do not make the same general speeches against Senator Campbell today because I have lived through all that and I know how hypocritical quite often those speeches are and how inaccurate they are, because managing the Senate is not an easy job. Getting the government program through is not an easy job.
It is especially difficult for Senator Campbell, who rarely understands procedural matters in this place and who, the moment he doesn't get his own way, shows all the petulance of Kim Carr's youngest child and absolutely throws—
—What a shot at Seamus!
—Well, I apologise to Seamus. I withdraw that particular allegation, Senator Carr, and hope you won't pass it on to Carole because I am more scared of her than I am of you. That is not the way. 
 Petulance does not get you anywhere in this chamber. Sitting there, throwing out the odd insult, whingeing, rolling your eyes, abusing us does not get the task done.
It would not happen to an old pro like Senator Brownhill, who is sitting there as duty minister at the moment. If he wanted an extra sitting week, he would come around with a bottle of red in his hand, wouldn't he, Senator Carr? He would have some reasonable propositions. He would say to us, `Look, a bit of turkey on our plate, a bit of turkey on your plate; let's all get the last plane home on 10 July at 4.50 p.m.' or, in the case of Acting Deputy President Chapman, the direct flight to Adelaide at 4.15 p.m. That is what Senator Brownhill would have done. And we would have succumbed to his charms and come to some agreements. But, of course, that does not happen with the petulance kid, the ex-supporter but not member, Senator Carr, of the Australian Democrats, the ex-protege of Senator Crichton-Browne who then turned on him. It would not have happened with the current Manager of Government Business.
Our attitude, in summary, is that we have put up an amendment that concedes five extra sitting days because, if that amendment is carried, we will then vote for the motion. And that amendment, which Senator Faulkner moved, is in two parts: part one is normal sitting procedures next week; part two dictates that Wik be debated first and the other legislation that is remaining second. That amendment is also capable of being split. If the government says, `Look, we really cannot concede on having them as normal sitting days; we insist on government business only' and if they then indicate to us, `We will knock that part off, but we will accept the second part of the amendment', again, we might be in a position to support the motion by the Manager of Government Business with that one amendment.
You see, we have this suspicion: having done their revolutionary deal on Wik, having drafted it and after pumping it through the House of Representatives tomorrow—even though we cannot see the legislation—why wouldn't they deal with that first? Why would they give priority to the privatisation of 
 Telstra? We would have to be suspicious on this particular matter. After all, it was on 23 January 1996 that Mr Howard said on the John Laws program:
During the first term of the Howard government, that's over the three years from whenever the election is called, we will privatise no more than one-third of Telstra and we will retain the remaining two-thirds fully in government ownership. If we decide at the end of our first term to privatise more of Telstra, then we will go to subsequent elections seeking an explicit mandate to do it.
—Non-core promise.
—A non-core promise by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard). But I will tell you why he is doing it now. He is doing it for two reasons. The first reason is the old agrarian socialists have threatened to jump the fence on the issue. You have only to look at the remarks in the press release of Miss De-Anne Kelly MP, the federal member for Dawson, who says she is going to cross the floor. On the 7.30 Report  tonight, she indicated that Uncle Ron might jump with her. We know that Senator Sandy Macdonald has made all sorts of threats on this issue. So the whole idea of the government is, `Wik is important. More importantly, we can use it as leverage on Telstra. So let's get the debate up, the legislation carried, before the momentum hits for them to jump the fence.'
There is, of course, another reason why Mr John Howard, the Prime Minister of Australia, wants this matter resolved. He knows that this Senate is a perverted Senate. He knows that the numbers do not accurately reflect what the voters voted for. He knows he has one person in this place who is an Independent now who was elected on a Labor ticket.
So there are two reasons the Prime Minister wants to get Telstra up first. What a cynical attitude. He says Wik is the issue of the decade, but he is willing to put it off. He is willing to put it off for petty, cynical reasons, for party reasons, so he can get the Telstra stuff through before everyone jumps out of the paddock, before they all disappear off into the horizon, cross the floor and vote against the legislation. That is what he wants. He is not concerned at all about cementing Wik in as the first major item in the debate next week. 
We have had the manager tell us that we cannot see the Wik bill because it has not been drafted. That shows you how much they think of the House of Representatives because they are going to whack it through that chamber tomorrow. That is the forward plan, isn't it? So no-one is going to get to see it until tomorrow morning, but I bet it will be through so they can get on the 4.50 p.m. flight out tomorrow. I bet it will be through that particular chamber.
Just to reiterate our attitude on this: we are saying that, yes, we will cop the extra sitting week, reluctantly because of the discourteous way it has been put. But it should be a normal sitting week. If the government refuses it to be a normal sitting week, at least it should give a commitment that it will begin the Wik debate on Monday as the first available piece of government legislation.",SENATE,<title>ORDER OF BUSINESS</title>,<title>Days and Hours of Meeting and Routine of Business</title>,Business,34,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1998-07-02,"—I thank the previous speakers, not least Senator Ray for that forceful, somewhat entertaining and historic coverage of reasons as to why we should not be accepting this government motion. I want to add that the Greens will not be supporting any move to sit next week. I am full of dread about the outcome of next week. We have seen the Wik legislation revived by the absent Senator Harradine, who has sold out comprehensively on his own principles, as stated in this chamber at the end of last year, in defence of, for example, the right of indigenous people to negotiate on mining.
I need to remind the Senate that the indigenous people had already been disempowered, deprived of their rights to have a say in what happens to their land on the whole range of prospective developments in the next century whether they were cotton crops, deep sea fisheries, dams, quarries or a whole range of other land use activities. All that was left was holes in the ground. Now, through this backsliding, despicable act by the domestic Neville Chamberlain that Australia has in its midst, we have Senator Harradine siding with this puny government and the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) in determining that the indigenous people will be robbed of even that right to have a say in holes in the ground.
The legislation—and I only wish the press gallery were listening; I know they are not—is going to disempower the indigenous people of this country. While sifting through the minutiae of this Wik pact that has been signed between Harradine and Howard, with Hanson looking on, the media is very liable to forget the overall picture. In this case, the devil is not in the detail; it is in the overall picture. This is a devil of legislation. This is the first real time the national parliament has determined that it will steal from the indigenous people of this country.
First we had the stealing of the lands from the indigenous people two centuries ago. In mid-century, we had the stealing of the children. Now we have the stealing of the rights of the indigenous people. The difference is this time it is the national parliament that is thieving from the indigenous people of this country. Who would have thought in 1998 we would be faced with that prospect?
As I said, it fills me with dread. I am not going to be an agent of setting up the timetable for this Howard government, which I believe will be remembered for this infamy long after whatever other actions it has taken are forgotten, to shove that piece of reprehensible legislation through this place. The government has the numbers in the House of Representatives, and it may be able to rush this horror Harradine-Howard pact, but it is a different matter when it comes to the Senate.
I do not think the Senate—at least those who are decent enough to say, `If this legislation has to be debated here, let there be time for it to be considered'—should be taking part in falling in line with a government that wants to ram the legislation through this place in the coming week. How can the people of Australia adequately look at this legislation and report back to their representatives how they feel about it when it has not yet been revealed? Above all, how can the indigenous people of this country—who have been cut out of the negotiations in the Prime Minister's office and Senator Harradine's office over recent weeks—have a hope of understanding the ramifications for them if the legislation is going to be snapped through the House of 
 Representatives this Friday and pushed through the Senate by next Friday?
I will tell you what is at stake here for the government; I will tell you what is driving the government here. It is their wish to have everything tidied up so that they can choose whether or not to have an election between now and August or September. The indigenous people's rights and livelihood for years to come do not matter a fig to this government compared with their own self-invested and petty need to be able to be free to set an election date if they so care.
I find the whole business reprehensible. While I will be supporting the amendments which ameliorate the program if we are forced to come back next week, unlike the opposition I will be opposing the move to have us come back next week at all. What is the rush about this? Should not Australia have a month to look at this piece of legislation coming out of the Howard-Harradine sell-out pact? Of course the people should. Why can't we be debating this in August? Let us remember that this term of parliament should not be finishing until May next year.
It is obscene that, because of the self-interest of the Prime Minister and his party—and to the very limited degree that they may or may not want to hold an election in coming months—the whole wide interests of the indigenous people of this country for decades to come have to be sacrificed, or at least the ability to properly debate them, based on information coming back from the indigenous people of this country, is going to be sacrificed. If we have a debate on this matter here next week, it will be with our blinkers on. It will be yet again, as Noel Pearson said, keeping the indigenous people at the woodheap while we discuss their future in this place without them being able to adequately feed into it. They cannot feed into it unless they have had adequate time to understand the ramifications of this slimy pact that has been made between Senator Harradine and the Prime Minister.
Let me look at the words in the first sentence of Senator Harradine's press release on this matter yesterday. Senator Harradine said that this deal he struck is `honourable and 
 just'. Yet he struck this deal without any real negotiations with the indigenous people. My father used to tell me that, if somebody proclaimed themselves as having greater honour or justice than somebody else, watch them. You do not have to watch Senator Harradine too clearly to see that those have become hollow words when they come from him. This is the man who has serially sold out on the Tasmanian environment from Lake Pedder through the Franklin River to the forests. Although he proclaims he goes out and enjoys—
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I have a point of order. As I said on an earlier point of order, this has been a wide-ranging debate, but now Senator Brown is getting into the personality of Senator Harradine and what he may or may not have done in relation to things. I would have thought Senator Brown would need to try to link his speech to the matter at hand—that is, the motion relating to the sitting hours of the Senate next week. I think Senator Brown has stretched a long way from that motion.
—On the point of order—
—Senator Brown, I was going to say that there is no point of order. I rule that there is no point of order and you can continue your remarks.
—Thank you. That is a good ruling. The point I am making is that we have in Senator Harradine a person who has serially changed positions. We are going to be asked to debate his latest change in position next week, without adequately being able to dissect why he has made that change and what the ramifications are for the indigenous people. I remember him last November—and you will too, Mr Acting Deputy President—in here angrily defending the welfare rights of immigrant people to this country. Yet I sat here in February this year when, between one Wednesday and one Thursday, he changed his mind and sold out on that sector of our community. That is what he is doing again: a different sector, same action.
—I have another point of order on relevance. Mr Acting Deputy President, I ask again how Senator 
 Harradine's voting on a migration bill could possibly bear any relevance whatsoever to a motion in relation to the sitting hours of next week.
—Senator Campbell, with regard to your point of order, as you said, it has been a wide-ranging debate. Therefore, there is no point of order. I call Senator Brown.
—Thank you for that ruling again. I think the best way to answer any debate I might have here is for Senator Harradine to come back into this chamber—he has been absent for I do not know how long—and try to defend himself. I would be interested to see even him trying to defend the indefensible, his own behaviour, in this matter. So far as I am concerned, if there is any good in coming back here next week—because it appears Senator Harradine will give the government the numbers to have us back here next week—it is that we will be able to take him on across this chamber with him present. He will not be able to duck responsibility for the behaviour he has been exhibiting and his so-called honour, trust, justice and goodwill.
—I thought we lived in a democracy.
—Yes, as Senator Calvert said, it is a democracy, and the democratically elected senator for Tasmania should be here to take part in this important debate. I have no doubt that if the government needs the numbers for this vote later tonight, Senator Harradine will suddenly appear in the chamber and give the government the numbers it needs to get this motion through.
In the meantime, let us look at the program the government has. Let us look at how the government shapes up in terms of its justification for urgency in getting through other pieces of legislation. I will look at two. The first is the Trade Practices Amendment (Country of Origin Representations) Bill 1998 . This deals with how we treat the label `Made in Australia'. The government wants to pull a swiftie on the people of Australia, on everybody who goes shopping in this country. The government is saying that it will allow `Made in Australia' to be put on goods which 
 are only half made in this country or for which only half the ingredients come from this country. The government wants to get this bill through swiftly because it does not want a public debate on how consumers feel about this piece of legislation.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, on a point of order: the standing orders clearly say that you cannot anticipate debate on a matter that is on the Notice Paper , and I ask you to bring Senator Brown to order.
—On the point of order: I am speaking on a matter that is on the Notice Paper , and that is the list of legislation that we are being asked to deal with in this motion.
—That is out of order, Senator Brown. I ask you to avoid speaking on bills that are on the Notice Paper  and to continue your remarks.
—Unfortunately, Senator Campbell made his point of order a little too late, as the government does not want me to warn consumers about what it has in this piece of legislation which it wants to deal with in the next 24 hours. In recent days, I have been lobbied by a very big corporation—and that is not normal for the Greens—which has been given the run-around by this government on another piece of legislation which is on the Notice Paper , the Intellectual Property Laws Amendment Bill 1998 .
If the government cannot deal fairly and squarely with a drug corporation in this country which has a right to fair dealing, then it ought not to be rushing legislation through which is going to do the wrong thing by that corporation. By pushing us into dealing with this string of legislation tomorrow, that is what it is doing. I suggest that the government talks to Astra Pharmaceuticals again and does the right thing by that corporation so that it is not treated unfairly and it is not made incapable of getting the benefits from an extended life on the patency of its drugs, the same as other corporations do. It is a very important matter.
If the government wants to expedite the debate in this place tomorrow—and I put this 
 to the government in a genuine spirit of constructive debate—it should deal with that company. It should open the door and fairly and squarely solve the small problem that has occurred in that legislation. Otherwise, I can assure the government that there will be a debate tomorrow because I, for one, am not going to glibly allow legislation through on a hurried timetable—legislation that treats one corporation differently from the rest and to its disadvantage.
The good senator from the opposition, Senator Ray, has drawn attention to the fact that, as this motion puts it, we will not be able to have private members time next week. Important motions come forward, very often from the Greens and Democrats, on a whole range of matters affecting the people of Australia and, indeed, as the opposition uncomfortably recognises, on international affairs. One of the highlights of debate in the Senate, and one of the most important things that happens in the Senate outside government business, is being wiped off the agenda because the government does not feel that time should be given to what other members of the Senate consider important. The government wants only its own timetable dealt with. I do not go along with that. I do not believe that is a proper way to run the business of this parliament. It does not belong to the 37—or if you include Senator Harradine, 38—members of the government opposite; it belongs to the whole of this chamber.
I do not concede that the government, which is run out of the caucus rooms of the Liberal Party and the National Party, should dictate to this parliament what it will and will not debate. I do not concede that the government should limit the ability of the whole of the Senate and every elected member here to bring forward matters of importance whenever we are sitting. I will not be supporting this motion. I will support the amendments, because if we have to sit next week they will make it a bit more tolerable, but I will not be supporting this motion. And I will not be supporting the prime piece of legislation—the Wik legislation—that this government intends to hurtle through here if it gets its way with this motion.",SENATE,<title>ORDER OF BUSINESS</title>,<title>Days and Hours of Meeting and Routine of Business</title>,Business,34,1,speech
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1998-07-02,"—I will just sum up by responding to a couple of points which I think need clarification. The government issued a list of legislation at the request of Senator Kim Carr yesterday. We gave notice of this motion because, quite clearly, it would not be dealt with by the Senate unless notice was given yesterday. Senator Carr, by leave, asked a couple of questions. I responded within a matter of hours by providing him with a list of the legislation we sought to deal with.
—That was at 8.30 this morning. It was not a matter of hours; it was a substantial number of hours.
—We provided at 8.30 this morning to Senator Carr at his request a list of the legislation that the government sought to deal with prior to the sittings. We indicated this on that list, as we do very regularly in this place. I can say without any fear of contradiction that we have done more consultation in relation to this program than any previous government in the history of the Australian Senate. (Quorum formed)  I thank my colleagues for coming to the chamber, because I am sure there will be a division within a couple of minutes. I was making the point that this government has consulted more than any other government in the history of Australia in relation to the program.
Senator Carr is quite right: the opposition has indeed offered to the government hundreds of extra hours. As Senator Hill pointed out, the opposition has then used those hours in spades. Three of the longest debates in Australian history have occurred in the last two years. There were 88 hours spent on the native title legislation, nearly 50 hours spent on industrial relations, and over 30 hours spent on the Telstra sale. They are the three longest debates. Four pieces of legislation over a two-year period took 190 hours to debate in this place.
Senator Faulkner and Senator Carr say that they like to give detailed consideration to legislation. I remind honourable senators that the Native Title Bill, as it was then, was introduced in the last hour on the last sched 
 uled sitting day in 1993. We proceeded to sit for about five days with no question time, no taking note of answers, no government documents, no petitions, no nothing. We sat for 50-plus hours and set a record. We were accused, and with some justification, of filibustering. Mr Acting Deputy President Murphy, I think you were here then. Senator Ian Macdonald was here, because he spoke in the debate. Senator Winston Crane was here.
—Senator Teague was here then.
—Senator Teague was here. We were accused of filibustering. We took 52 hours on that debate. Senator Brown was not here then.
—I was in the gallery.
—He was in the gallery. There were a lot of people in the gallery. The previous government used the guillotine and the gag, supported by the Australian Democrats, to close down that debate. They accused us of filibustering for 52 hours.
The Labor Party talks about a detailed consideration of legislation. A comparison of the consideration of the Native Title Bill in 1993 with the Australian Labor Party's detailed consideration of the Native Title Amendment Bill in 1997-98 shows that we have spent 88 hours this time. They accused us of filibustering for 52 hours in 1993. Senator Faulkner is saying that we need to give this detailed consideration. He has indicated that tonight with smoke signals. He has implied that we will have a big debate again.
Mr Acting Deputy President, in being a long-time stalwart of Labor Party national conventions, you would know that when Senator Carr, Senator Faulkner or Senator Ray say that we will have a long debate, it means that we will have a long debate. You can trust them on those things. If they say that it is going to be a long debate or a complicated bill, you know that you are in for a big sitting.
What have they done to assist the government in a cooperative way this week? Senator Hill, our leader, got it wrong tonight. I guess that we are all entitled to our mistakes. He 
 said that we had done, in the last 31 hours and 45 minutes, leaving aside the lunchtime bills—the non-controversial legislation where we have no divisions or quorums; it is legislation that is generally supported by the chamber—one hour of business. I have to correct the record. In the last 33 hours, Senator Alston has been sitting here waiting to deal with the digital television legislation. We were told that this would take an hour, but it has taken 3 hours. In the last 33 hours or thereabouts, we have not done one hour of government business other than what was dealt with at lunchtime today.
—That is not right.
—I will give Senator Carr the statistics. There are probably hundreds of Australian taxpayers listening tonight. Since 2 o'clock on Tuesday, how many hours of government business have we done, apart from lunchtime today?
—None.
—No, we have done some. This generous opposition gave us an extra six hours; that was very good and very helpful. Since 2 o'clock on Tuesday, what have we done by Thursday night at 9 o'clock? How many hours of government business has this place done? The Australian taxpayers should know this. Since 2 o'clock on Tuesday, Mr Acting Deputy President, just after you finished your sandwich and walked in here for question time, we have done seven hours and 40 minutes of government business, leaving aside lunchtime today. From 2 o'clock Tuesday to 9 o'clock Thursday night, we have done seven hours and 40 minutes—and that is cooperation. Thank you very much, I appreciate it.
One other item needs to be pinned down in summing up this debate—and I will be only another minute or two because we would like to get on at some stage this week with government legislation—and that is about the program provided to Senator Carr at 8.30 this morning at his request. He asked for two things. He said, `We want a commitment out of the government on supplementation' provided to him at 8.30 this morning, and he wanted to know the bills we are dealing with. We gave him a list of bills which, apart from 
 the bills that have actually been passed, was identical to the list—with one, I think, exception—he was provided with on 24 June. There are a couple of exceptions.
—A couple.
—I have said one of them was different. The order is almost identical, Senator Carr. There was one new item on it—confirmed to us late yesterday afternoon/early evening, obviously, at about 7 o'clock, was the need to put the Native Title Amendment Bill on the list again.
—So you stuck it on the end. Isn't that right? It becomes the least important matter.
—Senator Carr is provided, Mr Acting Deputy President—through his continual interjections—with these lists. Every time we have a leaders' meeting, we actually say, `Senator Carr, this is not the order we are doing them in. This is not the priority order, Senator Carr.' This is what we tell him, so I am not directing my comments to him, I am talking to you, Mr Acting Deputy President. We say, `This is not a priority order; don't attach any special significance to the order, but these are what we are doing.'
I am sure Senator Carr's son, Seamus, will not grow up like this, but with Senator Carr, you cannot tell him enough. You have to put it in very big black and white letters, with pictures if it helps, because he does not get the message. All of these bills were on the list on 24 June, and yesterday at about 7.30 p.m. the Prime Minister announced that we had reached an historic settlement on Wik and that we will seek to legislate it. So that is why it has been added to the list. That is the big change, Senator Carr: we have added a bill.
As Senator Hill said, the government intends to deal with that at 12.30. One of the reasons why Senator Faulkner and Senator Carr could not get this through their brains at least is that the government's program does not have the native title bill on it at the moment. They are saying we put Telstra ahead of it. I got into trouble with you, Mr Acting Deputy President, because I said that 
 was a lie, and I withdrew that remark. It is grossly misleading to say that we put Telstra ahead of the Native Title Amendment Bill on our program.
The Native Title Amendment Bill is not on the Notice Paper. The bill will be introduced into the House of Representatives tomorrow. How can you put a bill on the Notice Paper that has not even been introduced? Senator Carr and Senator Faulkner would have you believe that Senator Faulkner was the greatest Manager of Government Business this place has ever seen. But he has not quite learned the fact that you have actually got to have a bill introduced into the parliament before you put it on the Notice Paper—and this bill has not been.
I give this assurance to the Senate, to all honourable senators, that the government will be dealing with the Native Title Amendment Bill as the first item of business at 12.30 on Monday if it is passed through the House of Representatives tomorrow. But we also seek to deal with these pieces of legislation which have been on the list since 24 June. They are the important matters that needed to be responded to. The Notice Paper has not changed much.
—What's on tomorrow?
—Senator Schacht asks what is on tomorrow. The Notice Paper  has not actually changed at all since 2 o'clock on Tuesday. It is in the same order. We have not actually moved. We have done seven hours and 40 minutes of business since 2 o'clock on Tuesday.
—But you change the order every day.
—We do change it, and we generally change it to suit the whims of the shadow ministers. When Senator Schacht comes to me and says, `Look, I've got to go out to dinner tonight,' or someone says, `I've got to go and move house tomorrow,' or, `I've got to go to Adelaide to a function,' we say, `Okay, we'll take that bill off and put another one on.' We do change the order, generally to meet the social requirements of the shadow ministers, including Senator Schacht. On a number of occa 
 sions, you will have to admit, Senator Schacht, you have come to us and said, `I don't want to deal with that tonight because I have other important engagements,' and we say, `Okay, we'll put something else on.' And that is okay; that is part of the management, the consultation, that takes place.
Mr Acting Deputy President, we do need an extra sitting week to deal with these pieces of legislation, and there is no doubt that had we actually done some government business today, we would have made a good bite at most of those items on the program and been able to deal only with native title and Telstra next week. Quite clearly, unless the Senate can deal with these other items tomorrow, it will be a hectic program. But there is nothing that cannot be done on this program.
Senator Ray made the point that we have not even seen the bill yet. You have not seen the bill. That bill contains some amendments to a piece of legislation that have been debated for 88 hours. It is a total furphy to say that it is unreasonable for us to have to deal with this bill because we will only see it tomorrow morning. This bill has been debated for longer than any piece of legislation in Australian history. This comes from an opposition that landed 300 amendments on the Senate chamber within minutes of the debate starting last time and the time before. In 1993 we came in here—and we will never forget this—they introduced their legislation within the last hour of the last day and then sat us for five days non-stop, no question times, no taking notes, no petitions.
I will conclude on this point: Senator Carr says that he has been generous by agreeing to a few hundred extra sitting hours, most of which have been chewed up by an extraordinary debate on an extraordinary number of bills—three Australian records in two years. At the end of 1993 the Senate agreed to an extra 80 sitting hours in one short session.

Then I saw Mr Peter Reith out there asking where the Television Broadcasting Services (Digital Conversion) Bill 1998 is because the House of Representatives want to pass it tomorrow. How are we going at getting Senator Bourne, Senator Woodley?
—She's on her way.
—We should have addressed the Television Broadcasting Services (Digital Conversion) Bill 1998  at about half past ten this morning. I was very hurt when Senator Hill and Senator Ian Campbell suggested that the delay was due to our being a bit garrulous.
Honourable senators interjecting—
—Oh, he's in the House of Representatives; yes, he is. At last, we can get back to some serious business. I will make this one serious point though, while still awaiting Senator Bourne's arrival.
—Why do you now hate Gareth? You used to be a great fan of his.
—I still am a great fan of his, Senator Alston. We could actually have got to this, Senator Alston—if you have been suffering frustration—just through a bit of common courtesy from your manager. When he wants to bring in a whole new week of sitting, he should knock on the door, say what he is doing, we get done on the numbers and we take our medicine; but that did not occur.",SENATE,<title>TELEVISION BROADCASTING SERVICES (DIGITAL CONVERSION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,37,1,speech

If there is a motion in favour of the Senate committee, then I imagine that that is something the Senate should consider carefully. In the first instance, we would prefer that your amendment No. 1 simply be opposed, but if there is then a motion to establish a Senate committee, I would certainly think we would give that careful consideration.",SENATE,<title>TELEVISION BROADCASTING SERVICES (DIGITAL CONVERSION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,37,1,speech
"Schacht, Sen Chris",ALP,1998-07-02,"—As we get back into the swing of this debate, it seems like a day and half since Senator Bourne was speaking to the merits of her amendment on what euphemistically is called in the industry `the blue skies amendment', and she gave a very good reason why the Democrats are moving this amendment.
The opposition supports the Democrats in this amendment. We have made it clear to the industry that we believe the unsatisfactory outcome of the High Court ruling that the production of television programs in New Zealand can actually count as Australian content is an absurdity. Ask any ordinary Australian whether they think a television program produced in New Zealand, whether it be a mini-series, a drama, a game show, a kids show or children's television, using New Zealand actors, paid for by New Zealanders or investors from countries other than Australia, can be counted in Australia as Australian content, and ordinary Australians will say that is an absurd outcome. If it is absurd by the nature of the Broadcast Services Act, which is the one we are dealing with here, or as a result of the CER arrangement, they would demand the parliament amend it so that the Australian content rules would only apply to production in Australia, by Australians, clearly produced as part of our television and film industry to go on television.
In the debate some day and a half ago on another part of this bill, we made it very clear 
 that one of the justifications for providing the free-to-air commercial television stations with access to the seven megahertz to develop digital television free of charge was that we understand that, if you want high Australian content with high quality production, you have to ensure that the television networks have a revenue base which is big enough to pay for the quality production. That was one of the main justifications—not the only one—for the Labor Party's support for many years of having a limited number of television licences operating in this country. If there are too many operators in commercial television broadcasting and you spread the revenue base too thin, it means none of them will be able to afford to pay for quality Australian production. That will mean fewer jobs for Australians—whether it be actors, producers, technicians, film cameramen, scriptwriters, et cetera.
One of the great developments that all Australians have taken great pride in over the last 25 years since the early 1970s is the development of an indigenous Australian television and film industry. The reason that has developed is that we started insisting on local content rules for Australian television. That flowed through to help develop the Australian film industry as well. But the reason the commercial stations could afford the higher cost of making the productions in Australia is that their revenue base was big enough, guaranteed by a limited number of licences.
There is no doubt that you could issue a lot more television licences in Australia and have six or seven networks operating, but the revenue base would not be big enough to pay for quality Australian production, and you would end up with imported junk making up much of the programming. Therefore, we would not only lose the jobs in Australia but Australians would lose the right to see Australian made production on their televisions—seeing Australians, their own image, being reproduced on television. That flows through to the film industry.
So when, under the CER agreement, a group of New Zealand producers took the opportunity to challenge our content rules and say, `Under CER that can be counted as 
 Australian content', initially the Federal Court—I think it was—ruled against the New Zealand application. It was appealed to the High Court, which ruled that it could be counted as Australian content, but did it in such a way that it was left for the ABA—Australian Broadcasting Authority—to determine how it was to be done and whether, under the content rules as they exist, a different definition could be applied to ensure that Australian content as we know it could be preserved.
When the Australian Broadcasting Authority appeared before the recent ERCA estimates committee, I asked them a number of questions—and so did other senators. They indicated that, as a result of the High Court decision they are now holding an inquiry into whether they can interpret the High Court decision in such a way as to guarantee that the content rules—in commonsense terms as ordinary Australians would expect them to be interpreted—could so be interpreted. They indicated that the inquiry would take the next few months to maybe January of 1999, and then they would make their decision.
The ABA also indicated that they had received an undertaking from the New Zealand producers that they would not attempt to bring New Zealand content into Australia and claim it as Australian content during this period of review, until the ABA made its final decision. That information was most useful at the estimates hearing.
I ask the minister, whichever way the debate goes on this amendment, to provide the Senate with the undertaking given by the ABA that none of the New Zealand producers would attempt to import New Zealand content into Australia until the ABA completes its review. I do not expect you to produce a letter, Minister, in five seconds flat, but it would be useful if we could have a letter tabled in the Senate from those producers giving that commitment by the time this debate has concluded on all other matters.
We in the Labor Party feel strongly about this issue. We will vote for the Democrat amendment. We will support it. I hope the Senate votes for it. I know that there will be some arguments raised by the government 
 about issues of CER, free trade, WTO trade rules, et cetera—and they are legitimate issues to be raised—but, if there is a deficiency in the legislation that allows New Zealand content to be counted as Australian content, I am sure ordinary Australians would demand that that be fixed at the first opportunity.
It is just coincidental that the bill before us is amending the Broadcasting Services Act, which has the clause in it. It is clear from legal advice and comment that this amendment which deletes paragraph 160D—if we repeal that paragraph—achieves the outcome. It is a simple amendment. It is not pages in length. We are advised that deleting that paragraph would achieve the outcome that New Zealand could not be counted as Australian content.
I know some people have been lobbied by the New Zealand High Commission that this is a retrograde step under CER, but when the CER was going through the parliament over a decade ago now, if someone had suggested in the parliament that that CER bill would allow a definition to stand so that material produced in New Zealand could count as Australian content, I am sure we in the parliament would have raised our eyebrows, to say the least, and we would have sought an amendment to exclude that from being a part of the CER—closer economic relations—bill. I cannot speak for my previous colleagues but I am sure that would have been the outcome. Certainly, I imagine the Australian television and film production industry would have been demanding an amendment at that time to that legislation because, quite rightly, they could have said, `This is a nonsense to say that New Zealand content can count as Australian content.'
Senator Bourne has asked for the minister's view about a Senate committee. Minister, I do not know if you have considered whether that is a select committee, the ERCA legislative committee or whatever. Although that would be a useful process, I would point out that the ABA has already got a review under way. They will make their decision.
But I also have to say from the opposition's point of view, why wait for a review and a select committee? If there is going to be an 
 argument with New Zealand about this, let us have the argument now while the matter is before the parliament. The parliament then makes that decision. Although I would be interested to hear if the minister has any details about a possible committee, on this issue the opposition will be voting for the Democrats' amendment. If it is carried, we would hope the government would accept it and, when the bill goes back to the House of Representatives, not insist on the amendment being opposed.
 In conclusion, there has been a lot of debate in Australia in recent years about free trade, competition policy, globalisation, international competitiveness and so on. On many of those issues, all sides of the major parties in this parliament have made commitments that this is the way to go to ensure that we have an efficient economy. But we also know there are forces out in the community that are consistently attacking such concepts as free trade and open arrangements with other countries. In recent times, that has become even more spectacular as a result of the Queensland election.
We have to show a commonsense attitude on these sorts of issues before us. If you want to give succour to those who say that free trade is stupid and that openness in economic and trade matters is not in Australia's favour, you would leave an example like this of trying to tell people, `We're supporting this because the law says New Zealand content counts as Australian content.' Ordinary Australians will say, `That is rot. We do not accept that.' That is not the common meaning of what they would understand.
Therefore, if we want to defend the basic principles of free trade and openness—and many of us in this parliament do—we need to make sure that what we would see as an unintended consequence, which is before us today as a result of the High Court decision, is dealt with expeditiously by this parliament so that those arguments cannot be used against the broader economic arrangement. I would say that openly to our New Zealand colleagues. Therefore, the opposition will be supporting the Democrats' amendment. We 
 certainly urge the committee to carry the amendment.",SENATE,<title>TELEVISION BROADCASTING SERVICES (DIGITAL CONVERSION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,37,1,speech
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,1998-07-02,"—Just briefly, because I note that Senator Schacht has managed to take almost 15 minutes again on the first round of the resumption of consideration of this bill. If this amendment is defeated, then we would move a motion to refer the matter to the Senate Environment, Recreation, Communications and the Arts Legislation Committee. I do not want to debate the merits of this because I think we all understand what it is about. But let me make two points very quickly: first, Senator Schacht says that somehow there were some unintended consequences, the deficiencies of which have been exposed by the High Court decision. That is absolutely wrong and you know it.
—What?
—You may not know it. Let me explain: the relevant minister at the time was Senator Bob Collins. He was advised that, if he proceeded to insert section 160(d) in the legislation, it may well conflict with CER. He nonetheless chose to go ahead, and the High Court referred to his letter in their decision. Let there be no doubt at all about it:  the reason for the current situation is a direct result of Senator Collins's insistence on that subsection.
The second point is that, as far as we are concerned, the ABA is already addressing these issues. We view the outcome of the High Court decision with concern. We believe there are some matters that the ABA does need to take into account, particularly the extent to which there is a higher level of government subsidy for the film industry per capita in New Zealand than in Australia. The other major issue is the way in which what is really first-run material could be regarded as second-run material if it is shown first in New Zealand. We want those and any other relevant matters to be fully taken into account before a final review is undertaken.
To answer Senator Schacht's specific questions: my understanding is that the commercial networks in Australia have undertaken not to attempt to treat New Zealand 
 product as being within the Australian content standards. The New Zealand government and Project Blue Sky have also agreed not to pursue the matter pending the outcome of the ABA investigation.",SENATE,<title>TELEVISION BROADCASTING SERVICES (DIGITAL CONVERSION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,37,1,speech
"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,1998-07-02,"—The issue of content is one that is worthy of far greater emphasis than it has currently received in this debate. I say that because we do know that content is one of the greatest strengths remaining to Australia in its potential to develop export markets, export products and quality content generally in the area of new technologies, particularly digital technologies. I believe the ability of Australian companies, be they large corporations or small to medium enterprises, to be creators of innovative content underpins this particular amendment.
Again, I refer to the OECD report that I have been referring to throughout this debate on the basis that it is about content as a new growth industry. It cites the economics that underpin the content industry, including relationships between revenues returned through advertising and other sources and the ability of each particular section of the media to generate revenues to support and grow indigenous content. There is so much scope within this current debate that it enables one to look quite specifically at the economics behind it. Given that the government is providing the commercial free to airs and national broadcasters with a subsidy in many respects in the provision of spectrum, there is an argument that, in return, the emphasis on producing quality content—be it in the form of drama, documentaries and all those other areas that we know so well—is quite legitimate. In the very first instance this amendment tries to tip that balance back a little towards innovative Australian content which could actually be produced as an outcome of this whole exercise.
I mentioned the economics of the industry, and this is a critical point. Everyone must understand that this bill will change the economics of the broadcast industry. No longer will the free to airs or the national broadcasters in many respects be able to argue on the same basis that they have in the past 
 about their inability to fund content. We all know that the level of Australian content has to be mandated legislatively and enforced. The expense involved in producing such content is continually a burden on these organisations. In changing the economics of the broadcast industry, I believe that this amendment goes a small way towards tipping the balance back in creating the content in Australia that would ultimately be broadcast.
As to the proportion of Australian content that we currently view, I certainly endorse the comments made by Senator Schacht and Senator Bourne on New Zealand content. But it does raise a number of questions which I would like to explore with the minister: the type of content that is perhaps not being provided through the scope of this bill and, alternatively, the type of content that will be available through datacasting.
I would like to go back to a response the minister provided to a question yesterday, that is, datacast services not provided across the digital spectrum would not be embraced in the review that is pending. You mentioned that another review would be conducted on convergence. I seek your clarification on which review will relate specifically to convergence and at what point that will be conducted in the context of this bill.",SENATE,<title>TELEVISION BROADCASTING SERVICES (DIGITAL CONVERSION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,37,1,speech
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,1998-07-02,"—The relevance of datacasting is in order to ensure that broadcasters do not transgress into an area that they are not allowed to move into without having to pay normal commercial rates and, similarly, to ensure that any new entrants are confined to datacasting and do not cross the boundary into broadcasting. So the inquiry in the first instance is simply confined to the boundary lines within which terrestrial broadcasting ought to occur. If there are a range of other issues that arise as far as content is concerned in the separate and presumably later inquiry into convergence, then—
—When?
—We have not set a date on any of these things. We have simply said all these inquiries have to be completed by the beginning of 2000. That is an outer 
 boundary. Clearly we would want to see most of these inquiries conducted as quickly and as expeditiously as possible. The boundary arguments about multi-channelling and datacasting would clearly be of greater urgency than convergence. Convergence is an ongoing issue, but it is not critical to getting this regime off the ground. If you are asking me in terms of the priorities of the range of inquiries, then I would say convergence would rank behind those other two. But we have not set any date for any of them in the legislation.",SENATE,<title>TELEVISION BROADCASTING SERVICES (DIGITAL CONVERSION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,37,1,speech
"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,1998-07-02,"—I want to follow that question up. Minister, what you are describing is a situation that I find quite ludicrous. Given that at the moment the very broadcasters that you are seeking to—
—On a point of order, Mr Chairman: I think we have been very generous to date in this debate. As we all know, we were hopeful that the debate might go for somewhere between one and two hours; we are now beyond the fourth hour. What Senator Lundy is proposing to do is to regurgitate material that has already been gone over comprehensively.
—It's about Blue Sky.
—This has absolutely nothing at all to do with the matter before the chair, which is project Blue Sky. It has absolutely nothing at all to do with it. You have just asked about datacasting and convergence. I have answered those questions again today.
—Because you didn't answer them yesterday.
—I am sorry. That is the best we can do. That is the shorthand. I answered them yesterday; they are not relevant to today. Today's amendment before the chair is to do with project Blue Sky and the extent to which Australia's obligations under international treaties ought to be taken into account in setting Australian content standards. It has nothing at all—
—On a point of order—
—Just a minute, I am on a point of order. It has nothing at all to do with 
 boundary lines between datacasting, multi-channelling or anything else.
—On the point of order: if you take the minister's narrow definition about this debate, he may have a point. But, remember, Blue Sky is about Australian content rules. Content rules will be relevant to the issues of datacasting because that is a matter that will have to be resolved. It is not unreasonable for a senator to ask questions about content on datacasting and multi-channelling, as far as their structure is concerned, even though those issues have been dealt with in the bill. This amendment is about content rules and about whether New Zealand content can end up being used in datacasting or multi-channelling.
—Let me be quite clear, this section that we are dealing with is confined to free-to-air commercial television. There are no local content restrictions in relation to datacasting. Therefore, it cannot be relevant to this debate.
—My ruling on the point of order is that it is sustained; that this particular amendment does not relate to the issues that are being raised, even though there has been, to a degree, a wide ranging debate. It may be more appropriate to raise those issues later.
—I seek clarification from the chair. At what later opportunity will I be able to question the minister on issues relating to content on datacasting services?
—We have to deal with the Datacasting Charge (Imposition) Bill 1998 , and that would be an appropriate opportunity to raise those issues.
—Can I take the opportunity to say a number of things in relation to this matter. First of all, I asked the minister a series of questions yesterday relating to the way datacasting services were going to be treated. I thought I would save time by asking the minister succinct questions now as clarification so we could make sure of his responses. There are a number of questions that he did not respond to in that process yesterday.
I am more than happy to stand up and construct a 10-minute speech around each 
 question, but I thought I would assist the minister in his pressures for time and actually confine my questions. But, seeing he is being so pedantic about this, I would like now to turn to the issue of Australian content with respect to digital services.
—Senator Lundy, just before you proceed, the appropriate time to raise the questions which you are raising would be when the motion for the bill, as amended, to be passed is under discussion. That is when you can revert to those more general issues. But, in dealing with this particular amendment, you need to keep the issues that you are raising more narrow.
Senator Schacht interjecting—
—They are precisely the matters that were raised yesterday or the day before to which no objection was taken. I am simply complaining that Senator Lundy is repeating the precise subject matter.
—Shouldn't you be standing? Is this an interjection, Richard, or is it a speech?
—This is a strategy to ensure that we do not complete the bill tonight, as long as that is clear.
—Order!
—Mr Chairman, can you provide me with an assurance that I will have the opportunity outside the scope of this particular amendment to ask the minister questions pertaining to these bills?
—Senator Lundy, I have already explained to you that there will be an opportunity to do that.
—Thank you. I will make the most of it when it arises.",SENATE,<title>TELEVISION BROADCASTING SERVICES (DIGITAL CONVERSION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,37,1,speech
"Schacht, Sen Chris",ALP,1998-07-02,"—I have a simple question of the minister. He mentioned that, if this amendment is defeated, he will move a motion to refer the issue to the Senate ERCA committee. For the record, can you give us an indication of what the reporting date is and whether there will be the normal processes of a legislative committee where submissions can be 
 sought and hearings can be held on the matter and the terms of reference of the legislation?",SENATE,<title>TELEVISION BROADCASTING SERVICES (DIGITAL CONVERSION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,37,1,speech
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,1998-07-02,"—I confirm that it will be the normal procedures. In other words, you will have every opportunity to leak information at regular stages throughout the process. But the date, for the record, is 31 October. You will be able to, presumably, make submissions and do whatever the committee itself determines because it controls its own agenda. But, as far as we are concerned, that will enable the committee to take into account the report of the ABA and, therefore, to canvass all of the matters that the committee itself would need to canvass. I just indicate that I will move that at the end of the committee stage.

—So you do not want to move those.
—No, but I would like to ask the minister one question about what was going to be in those amendments, just so I could have his answer on the record and so I know what he thinks.

(8)	 Schedule 1, item 12, page 24 (after line 12), after subclause (3), insert:
(3A)	 The ABA must consult with national broadcasters about the implementation of the scheme.
Amendment No. 8 concerns consulting by the ABA and it relates to the independence of the national broadcasters. Consistent with both of their acts—that is, the ABC Act and the SBS Act—we believe it is appropriate that the minister, rather than the ABA, has the role of implementation of the national broadcasters conversion schemes. Amendment 8 says that, in developing the conversion schemes, the following should be objectives. That puts the ABA in a consultative capacity, which means that the ABA has to consult with the national broadcasters during the scheme's development, rather than the ABA doing it, and then it goes back to the minister.",SENATE,<title>TELEVISION BROADCASTING SERVICES (DIGITAL CONVERSION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,37,1,speech
"Schacht, Sen Chris",ALP,1998-07-02,"—We support Democrat amendment No. 8. We believe that the consultation process is the best way to go. As I understand it, Minister, it has always been accepted that ABA is about commercial broadcasting in Australia. The national broadcasters—ABC and SBS—have their own distinct act and are responsible to the parliament through you as minister. The opposition always holds that that is a necessary separation.
Because the ABA is carrying out a number of things and is involved in the planning of the introduction of digital television, it is clear that it should be in consultation with the national broadcasters. Those discussions should take place on the basis of goodwill on both sides. If they fall apart, then probably both sides should get a rap over the knuckles. We think that is the best way to go to maintain the longstanding wish of parliament that the national broadcasters be separate from the ABA under planning arrangements. We support that amendment.

(1)	 Schedule 1, item 12, page 26 (line 22) to page 28 (line 7), omit clause 20, substitute:
20  National broadcasters to give implementation plans to the Minister
(1)	 As soon as practicable after the formulation of the national television conversion scheme, a national broadcaster must give the Minister one or more implementation plans relating to the conversion, over time, of the transmission of the national television broadcasting service concerned from analog mode to digital mode.
(2)	 In preparing an implementation plan, a national broadcaster must have regard to the following matters:
	 (a)	 in the case of an implementation plan that relates to a coverage area that is not a remote coverage area—whether the implementation plan is directed towards ensuring the achievement of the following policy objectives:
		 (i)	 the objective that each national broadcaster should be required to commence transmitting the national broadcasting service concerned in digital mode in each metropolitan coverage area on 1 January 2001;
		 (ii)	 the objective that each national broadcaster should be required to commence transmitting the national television broadcasting service concerned in digital mode to regional coverage areas (other than remote coverage areas) on or after 1 January 2001 so that all regional coverage areas (other than remote coverage areas) have digital transmission of the service by 1 January 2004; 

	 (b)	 in the case of an implementation plan that relates to a coverage area that is not a remote coverage area—the objectives mentioned in subclause 19(3);
	 (c)	 in the case of an implementation plan that relates to a remote coverage area—the special circumstances that apply to the transmission of national television broadcasting services in that area;
	 (d)	 such other matters (if any) as the national broadcaster considers relevant.
(3)	 If an implementation plan is given to the Minister under this clause, the Minister must:
	 (a)	 approve the implementation plan; or
	 (b)	 refuse to approve the implementation plan.
(4)	 In deciding whether to approve an implementation plan under this clause, the Minister must have regard to the following matters:
	 (a)	 in the case of an implementation plan that relates to a coverage area that is not a remote coverage area—whether the implementation plan is directed towards ensuring the achievement of the following policy objectives:
		 (i)	 the objective that each national broadcaster should be required to commence transmitting the national broadcasting service concerned in digital mode in each metropolitan coverage area on 1 January 2001;
		 (ii)	 the objective that each national broadcaster should be required to commence transmitting the national television broadcasting service concerned in digital mode to regional coverage areas (other than remote coverage areas) on or after 1 January 2001 so that all regional coverage areas (other than remote coverage areas) have digital transmission of the service by 1 January 2004;
	 (b)	 in the case of an implementation plan that relates to a coverage area that is not a remote coverage area—the objectives mentioned in subclause 19(3);
	 (c)	 in the case of an implementation plan that relates to a remote coverage area—the special circumstances that apply to the transmission of national television broadcasting services in that area;
	 (d)	 such other matters (if any) as the Minister considers relevant. 

(5)	 Before deciding whether to approve an implementation plan under this clause, the Minister may direct the ABA to give the Minister a report about the matter.
(6)	 If the Minister approves an implementation plan under this clause, the implementation plan comes into force on approval.
(7)	 If the Minister refuses to approve an implementation plan under this clause, the Minister may, by written notice given to the national broadcaster concerned:
	 (a)	 require the national broadcaster to give a fresh implementation plan under subclause (1); and
	 (b)	 advise the national broadcaster that, if specified changes were incorporated in the fresh plan, the Minister would be disposed to approve the fresh plan.
The notice must also set out the reasons for the refusal.
(8)	 The Minister must cause copies of a notice under subclause (7) to be laid before each House of the Parliament within 15 sitting days of that House after the giving of the notice.
(9)	 A national broadcaster may give the Minister a variation of an approved implementation plan that relates to the national broadcaster. Subclauses (2) to (8) (inclusive) apply to the variation of an implementation plan in a corresponding way to the way in which they apply to an implementation plan.
We prefer this amendment to Democrat amendment No. 9. Our amendment No. 1 allows the national broadcasters to formulate their own plan in the first instance. They then submit the plan to the minister for approval or refusal. The minister must have regard to a number of matters in so considering. If the plan is approved, it comes into force. If it is refused, then the minister may, by written notice, require the national broadcaster to give a fresh implementation plan and advise that, if specific changes were incorporated, the minister would be disposed to approve. The notice must also set out the reasons for the refusal. Copies of the notice must be laid before each house of parliament within 15 sittings days.

"Schacht, Sen Chris",ALP,1998-07-02,"—The opposition supports the government's amendment to the Democrat 
 amendment. I think consultation between all parties on this has been quite useful. In the government amendment, as circulated on sheet B98BA581.WB, there are only two areas where I think there might still be some marginal differences. Firstly, I understand that after the word `other' in 4(d), the Democrats want to insert the word `related'. The opposition does not support that.
—I thought you did.
—I hope there has not been a misunderstanding, Senator Bourne. I know that there have been discussions. What we are dealing with here is a cultural difference between the Democrats, who are always in an opposition position vis-a-vis the Liberal Party and the Labor Party, one of which always hopes to be the government the next day, the next week, or after the next election. It is a matter of judging the balance between the power of ministerial direction and so on.
After careful consideration, we believe that, the way the government has worded it, without putting the word `related' in, it is clear enough. We believe it should be left that way because you never can tell when something out of left field may turn up to be dealt with, and we believe that if you put `related'—that is related to the rest of the—
—To the legislation.
—That is related to the rest of the legislation. As I say, I think this is a cultural difference. Those who have had some experience in government, where you actually get hung or hooked on a description like this in the way you have devised it, know that you are then left out on a limb. However, I agree with the Democrat position on transparency—the minister having to table things and so on. That is the protection: if the minister tries to rort the process, he or she has to lay on the table the reasons why they are in dispute. A public debate will then take place, and in matters of broadcasting there will always be a vigorous public debate no matter what the issue. It will not be avoided, no matter what the minister of the day may think. With understanding, that process will naturally come into play.
We support section 4(d) of government amendment No. 1. We also support the insertion, under section 8, of the Democrat amendment to delete `15' and put `seven' sitting days. I understand the reasons for that. I accept that 15 days can be rather a long time and things could roll on without being dealt with. We accept seven days. As a former minister, I would probably argue for 15, but while I am in opposition I will argue for seven, and I will live with it as seven days when we are back in government.",SENATE,<title>TELEVISION BROADCASTING SERVICES (DIGITAL CONVERSION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,37,1,speech

"Bourne, Sen Vicki",AD,1998-07-02,"—The Australian Democrats, as Senator Schacht has mentioned, would rather see the word `related', and not just in subsection (d) of part 4 but in subsection (d) of part 2. We do not see why either the ABC, the SBS or the minister should be able to put in anything that they feel they might like to put in. I can understand the minister and the shadow minister seeing this from the point of view of the minister. Obviously, they both consider that they may well be the minister when this comes down. I am looking at it from the point of view of the rest of the world, which is not the minister, including the ABC and the general public. Most people would rather that the minister confined his or her—one day it will be a `her'—remarks to whatever is related to this legislation. However, I accept that we have two ministerial aspirants for the next parliament here, and I can understand what they are talking about.
I thank both the minister and Senator Schacht for accepting seven sitting days. We all understand that 15 days could blow out to months and months, if you timed it correctly. Seven is much more likely to be within a couple of sitting weeks. I move:

"Bourne, Sen Vicki",AD,1998-07-02,"—The Democrats oppose the following item in schedule 1:
(10)	 Schedule 1, item 12, page 28 (lines 12 to 15), clause 22.
Considering that we have accepted the government's amendment and that there is more autonomy with the national broadcasters than with others, it is appropriate that the minister has the role in the national broadcasters' implementation plans rather than the ABA. It should be the respective boards of the national broadcasters rather than the minister who makes the final decision on implementation plans. In those government amendments, I accept that we have lost having the board make the final decision. We will come back to the minister doing it, putting on the table what should be put on the table. I still believe that the ABA should have a consultative role, and that is what this achieves.",SENATE,<title>TELEVISION BROADCASTING SERVICES (DIGITAL CONVERSION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,37,1,speech
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,1998-07-02,"—We are not accepting the Australian Democrats' position.
—We are neutral.
—I will read what I have here and try to make sense of it. The Democrats appear concerned that this clause is unnecessary as the ABA already has powers conferred under section 164 and that this new clause potentially confers wider powers on the ABA over national broadcasters than those currently available. They also appear to consider that the apparent ability of the ABA to create those powers through its own development of the conversion scheme is appropriate.
We say that it is legally necessary to ensure that the ABA is empowered to make decisions of an administrative character within the scope of the conversion schemes. An example of such a provision in the digital conversion scheme would be a power for the ABA to approve technical specifications for digital transmitters. Without the power to make administrative decisions, the ABA would need to formulate an extremely prescriptive legislative scheme which provided for all the outcomes of the digital conversion process and included no flexibility for the ABA to exercise any degree of statutory discretion.
Under this clause, the ABA could not confer powers on itself which were beyond its power to make decisions of an administrative character in relation to the conversion scheme. In other words, there are administrative constraints on the exercise of the ABA power. In our view, it is very important that it has a flexibility that is not fettered in the way that the Democrats' amendment would have it. The ABC's concerns in relation to this matter are therefore unfounded.",SENATE,<title>TELEVISION BROADCASTING SERVICES (DIGITAL CONVERSION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,37,1,speech
"Schacht, Sen Chris",ALP,1998-07-02,"—We will accept the government's view on this.

"Bourne, Sen Vicki",AD,1998-07-02,"—by leave—I move:
(11)	 Schedule 1, item 12, page 28 (line 30), omit ""exceptional circumstances"", substitute ""circumstances which could not reasonably have been foreseen"".
(12)	 Schedule 1, item 12, page 29 (line 20), omit ""exceptional circumstances"", substitute ""circumstances which could not reasonably have been foreseen"".
(13)	 Schedule 1, item 12, page 30 (line 18), omit ""exceptional circumstances"", substitute ""circumstances which could not reasonably have been foreseen"".
We are seeking to substitute for the term `exceptional circumstances' the term `circumstances which could not reasonably have been foreseen'. As I understand it, the problem that the national broadcasters have with the term `exceptional circumstances' is that there could be three circumstances that might occur together, none of which are exceptional but which, when taken together, will cause problems. The exceptional part of it would be that they all happen together. They believe that substituting `circumstances which could not reasonably have been foreseen' will cover everything and that it will be a real safety net for them.",SENATE,<title>TELEVISION BROADCASTING SERVICES (DIGITAL CONVERSION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,37,1,speech

 Bourne can give me a specific example that her amendment would overcome in definitional terms, I think I will stick with the government's position of exceptional circumstances.

I cannot give you a specific example because one was not given to me or, if it was, it has gone out of my head since I spoke to the national broadcasters. It did seem reasonable to me at the time. If it is six of one and half a dozen of the other, the national broadcasters believe that they would be better off with the other and it is not going to make any difference, I cannot see why we do not change it.

"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,1998-07-02,"—Can I perhaps explain why. The proposition that we are contending is: if you are committed to digital and you are moving, hopefully, towards full HDTV, what you do want to insist on is that the networks therefore gradually implement that scheme. What we say is: use it or lose it.
—I think that is the wrong one. We are doing 11, 12 and 13; that is 14.
—Is it?",SENATE,<title>TELEVISION BROADCASTING SERVICES (DIGITAL CONVERSION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,37,1,speech
"Schacht, Sen Chris",ALP,1998-07-02,"—As I understand it from my running sheet, or my note, use it or lose it is actually 14. In the document I have of Democrat amendments, 11, 12 and 13 are compliance issues and 14 has a subheading, `Digital television requirements.' Am I right or wrong? I am advised by my adviser that it could be both. Thank you, that has probably made it very confusing.
As I understand it from Senator Bourne, we were dealing only with the wording of 11, 12 and 13. In your explanation, minister, you have started to move into the `use it or lose it' concept, which is 14—as I am advised. Is there a connection between the two?",SENATE,<title>TELEVISION BROADCASTING SERVICES (DIGITAL CONVERSION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,37,1,speech
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,1998-07-02,"—As I understand it, we are generally concerned with the progressive introduction of digital and, ultimately, HDTV. The concept of `use it or lose it' says that you are required to move in that direction and it is only in exceptional circumstances that you would be excused. What the Democrats are suggesting is, no, you would be excused from compliance with that progressive rollout if there were circumstances which could not reasonably have been foreseen.
We simply say that that is a weaker test because there could well be unforseen circumstances that are quite trivial. On the Democrats approach, you would be let out on a technicality. We do not want to see that happen, and I would not have thought that they would either. We simply want to ensure that it is only in exceptional circumstances that you would be excused.",SENATE,<title>TELEVISION BROADCASTING SERVICES (DIGITAL CONVERSION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,37,1,speech
"Schacht, Sen Chris",ALP,1998-07-02,"—Senator Bourne may be able to clarify this for me. I thought 11, 12 and 13 were separate from 14. But now I am advised that Democrats amendment 14 is actually connected to 11, 12 and 13 and that they should be put together. I just wondered if that is correct and whether Senator Bourne can clarify that for me.",SENATE,<title>TELEVISION BROADCASTING SERVICES (DIGITAL CONVERSION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,37,1,speech
"Bourne, Sen Vicki",AD,1998-07-02,"—I think No. 14 is actually related to schedule 4. I think that one would be part of the standards reviews because it is the `use it or lose it' concept. I think it would be part of the standard reviews. In fact, when we go over to it, I have only one question to ask of the minister, and I intend to withdraw that one, too, if I can get an answer from him. But I did not see it as being a part of this item.
Can I also make one further point. The minister said that the three trivial circumstances could be a loophole. They could be three really significant circumstances but, because they may happen in one go, that might mean, perhaps—and if the minister agrees with this, I guess that would something—that that might constitute an extraordi 
 nary circumstance. But what I do not want is something being taken away from the national broadcaster because of a loophole.
I can see that the minister is saying that the other might be the case. I do not believe it would be. I believe it would go the way that I have been saying, and I also believe that if there is very little difference between the two, why don't we take the one that they believe would be more reasonable for them?",SENATE,<title>TELEVISION BROADCASTING SERVICES (DIGITAL CONVERSION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,37,1,speech
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,1998-07-02,"—I contend that it is not six of one and half a dozen of the other, that exceptional circumstances is a higher test. Yours is a weaker test. We do not see any reason to differentiate between the commercials and the national broadcasters. Neither of them should be able to skate out on a technicality. If you simply said, `Unforseen circumstances,' it is not hard to imagine something that is unforseen that is not all that significant, let alone exceptional.
The concept of exceptional circumstances is that you are bound to adhere to a programmed rollout, a progressive movement towards HD, unless there are exceptional circumstances. If it is merely unforseen, you might say, `We didn't realise that there would be a high level of inflation, so it's going to cost us a bit more money. That was totally unforseen, so we're allowed out of it.' Whereas we would say, `There is nothing exceptional about that. You should have been prepared to commit yourself to whatever it might cost. You should have built in inflation, et cetera.' So exceptional circumstances makes it tougher all round, and it ensures that none of the broadcasters are able to avoid their obligations to move progressively towards HD. We do not see why you would give the national broadcasters a lesser or weaker test.",SENATE,<title>TELEVISION BROADCASTING SERVICES (DIGITAL CONVERSION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,37,1,speech
"Bourne, Sen Vicki",AD,1998-07-02,"—I just love the minister's example. It just occurred to me out of nowhere that perhaps it might have been unforseen, and I am confident that this will not happen, to one of the national broadcasters, and indeed to all of us, that they receive only $20.8 million, for instance—picking a figure out of the air—for digitisation when in fact 
 they need, and have been proven to need, $180 million, and the government has accepted that the metropolitan networks may need $250 million each.
I am using that purely as an example, of course, but this may well be unforseen. I certainly would not foresee it, but I do not know whether you would call it exception. Therefore, if that were the case, if the national broadcasters were totally underfunded, I think it would be perfectly reasonable for that to be seen as being unforseen. But, perhaps, if they became funded in the future, they would be able to pick that up again. I do not know if that would be an exceptional circumstance or an unforseen one. But I think it is worth having a look at.",SENATE,<title>TELEVISION BROADCASTING SERVICES (DIGITAL CONVERSION) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,37,1,speech
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,1998-07-02,"—I will put it another way. I apologise for my mind not being able to conjure up any more exciting examples than this one, but let us stick with it for the moment. If they thought they were going to get $4 million and they only got $3½ million, you could say that would be unforeseen, but it would not be exceptional. Let us say that there was only $100,000 difference or even $10,000 difference, you could argue that that would be unforeseen; in other words, unforeseen would cover the range.

"Eggleston, Sen Alan",LP,1998-07-02,"—I would like to talk a little about regional Australia tonight and the way in which regional Australia has benefited from the policies of the Howard government.
—This will be a short speech.
—Senator Lundy, this will, of course, be of great interest to you. You will be quite stunned by the extent to which the Howard government has benefited regional Australia. These benefits range 
 from infrastructure funding commitments for roads and telecommunication services, to the provision of extra doctors for regional and remote areas and specific benefits under the youth allowance for young people in rural areas. It can be said from the record of the Howard government that the Howard government quite clearly understands the needs of regional and remote Australia and, in particular, of regional Western Australia.
In addressing issues relating to regional Australia, I would firstly like to comment on the announcement last night of the agreement on the Native Title Amendment Bill. Native title has been a great impediment to regional development in Western Australia, as it has all over Australia. I would like to personally put on record in the Senate my thanks to all the Western Australian senators and members who, since 1992, have fought for a fair and equitable mechanism for the determination of native title claims. I thank them on behalf of the people of Western Australia as a whole.
I would also like to thank Senator Harradine, who, as a Christian person with considerable political courage, could see the divisiveness in the community that the present Native Title Act was bringing and knew that a resolution to this problem was necessary. I think we should all recognise that Senator Harradine took a great step forward in terms of personal political courage in doing what he had to do for our nation.
Having said that, I would like to move on to what the Howard government has done for infrastructure. Enhanced infrastructure is vital to the future of regional Australia. The Howard government has delivered the framework for business development through enhanced access to telecommunications, programs for the expansion of export markets, and other items which I will mention during the course of this address, which will ultimately mean that there will be greater job creation in Western Australia and, in general, the people of regional Australia will benefit.
Telecommunications is a very important issue throughout regional Australia. Through the regional telecommunications development fund, the Howard government has sought to bring modern communications to the people 
 of regional Australia. In the 1998-99 federal budget, the Howard government committed $250 million over five years to the regional telecommunications development fund. These funds are contributing to communications infrastructure which will provide improved services to regional and rural Western Australia, including contributing to the provision of fast fax and access to data capability technology.
For example, the shires of Meekatharra, Sandstone, Menzies, Leonora, Wiluna and Laverton, and the town of Leinster will benefit from the allocation of $10,000 for project `mobile telephony'. A consultant will be engaged to identify the most appropriate mobile telephone facility, and other telecommunications needs of people in such remote areas will also be addressed.
Funding through the regional telecommunications development fund has also been allocated to the remote area broadcasting services. This involves funding of some $11.2 million for a Commonwealth contribution of $750 towards the conversion cost of a new digital decoder in each existing direct to home remote household for the reception of television, and $2,500 towards the replacement of each existing decoder in remote Aboriginal communities. I think this is going to be very useful to these communities because it will bring them not only entertainment, but also education, and it will do much to improve the knowledge of people in remote Aboriginal communities of the outside world.
One of the recent successes of the Howard government has been the provision of SBS television for regional Western Australia. People in regional Western Australia have been seeking to have SBS for some 10 years. Western Australia has the highest proportion of overseas born people of any state or territory in Australia and, in general terms, more than one-quarter of the population of Western Australia was born overseas and more than one half has one or both parents born overseas. In putting SBS television on the satellite over Western Australia last November, after a fairly short period in office, the Howard government delivered on a promise made to the people of regional Western Australia. The 
 Labor Party in their 13 years in office had done nothing, although they had promised SBS to the people of regional Western Australia.
I would like to mention analog telephone coverage. Many people in regional Australia are very concerned to see analog mobile phone services retained because analog phone services do have a wider range of area under which they can be used. As it happens, the Minister for Communications, the Information Economy and the Arts (Senator Alston) has commissioned a review to find a way around the agreement which the previous government made to phase out analog and only have digital services in Australia, which has had an adverse reception in most of regional Australia because it means that mobile services will be available in a more restricted area. The minister is coming to an agreement with the major carriers under which, in the absence of any other services, analog will be preserved.
Roads are another very important matter in regional Australia. The Howard government has devoted a total of $61.42 million for construction and ongoing maintenance work on the 4,640 kilometres of national highways in Western Australia to improve these roads. This also means that extra jobs will be created in regional Western Australia to the extent of something like 2,500 positions.
In the recent budget there was an important announcement for people involved in private aviation and air charter in Western Australia. As in all areas of regional Australia, aviation is very important. That announcement was that the price of avgas would be cut by some 13c per litre. The Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association of Australia has welcomed the reduction in this price and see it as a great boon to private charter companies in regional Western Australia.
The federal government has also addressed the need for improved health services in regional Australia. In the 1998-99 budget the government announced an additional boost to attract extra doctors into regional Australia. This will involve a one-off of 100 extra places in medical schools for suitably overseas trained doctors to bring themselves up to the standard required for the Australian 
 examination so enabling them to practise in this country. That means there will be an increased number of doctors in regional Australia.
The youth allowance has specific benefits for regional Australia and will mean that young people in regional Australia benefit directly from its introduction. The Howard government has a very strong and positive record of assistance to regional Australia which the Labor government could only have envied.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Regional Australia</title>,Adjournment,38,1,speech
