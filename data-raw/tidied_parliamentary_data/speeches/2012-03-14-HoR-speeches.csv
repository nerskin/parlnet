Ms ROXON
 (Gellibrand—Attorney-General and Minister for Emergency Management) (09:01):  I move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


I am pleased to introduce legislation to strengthen and enhance systems for managing complaints about the conduct of federal judicial officers.


The first bill, the Judicial Misbehaviour and Incapacity (Parliamentary Commissions) Bill, which I will speak to now, deals with the role of the parliament when considering removal of a judge under the Constitution.


The second bill, the Courts Legislation Amendment (Judicial Complaints) Bill, deals with the management of complaints within the courts.


This Labor government is determined to ensure that the Federal Court system delivers accessible, equitable and understandable justice—one which protects and serves individual complainants at the same standard as large corporate players enjoy. 


That is because an independent and impartial judiciary, in which the public has confidence that their rights will be protected and their complaints dealt with speedily and transparently, is one of the foundations of our democratic society.


In a mature, strong democracy such as Australia, it is easy to underestimate how critical these foundations are.


Judges form an integral part of the justice system in Australia and serve the community by declaring and upholding the law.


Australia continues to be very well served by its judiciary.


Consistent with the rule of law, our judiciary must always be accountable in relation to the exercise of judicial power.


An important mechanism for ensuring judicial accountability includes effective complaints handling processes, in a manner consistent with the independence of the judiciary.


The Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee stated in its 2009 report Australia's judicial system and the role of judges that:


Fair and effective complaints handling is a critical component of a judicial system that is both respected and just, and seen to be so.


That there have been few serious complaints about judges is testament to the high calibre of our judiciary and their commitment to the responsibility entrusted to them as holders of judicial office.


Instances of removal of judges from office in Australia have been extremely rare.


Since Federation, the size of Australia's Commonwealth judiciary has expanded to over 80 judges and 62 federal magistrates, and so we must ensure that we continue to support the independence and high quality of our judiciary into the future.


The Judicial Misbehaviour and Incapacity (Parliamentary Commissions) Bill provides a standard mechanism to assist the parliament in its consideration of removal from office of a judge or federal magistrate under the Constitution.


The Courts Legislation Amendment (Judicial Complaints) Bill, also to be introduced today as part of the government's package of reforms, provides legislative support for a process within the courts to assist the chief justices of the Federal Court and the Family Court, and the Chief Federal Magistrate to manage complaints about judicial officers that are referred to them.


Together these bills provide a clear, accountable and effective system for handling complaints about federal judicial officers. Importantly, they were developed in consultation with, and are supported by, the heads of federal court jurisdiction.




Constitutional removal of judges



Under Australia's Constitution, the power to remove a federal judicial officer lies with the Governor-General in Council on an address from both houses of the parliament in the same session, praying for removal on the ground of proved misbehaviour or incapacity.


This constitutional requirement goes to the very heart of the independence of the judiciary.


It upholds the separation of the limbs of government and strengthens public confidence in the Commonwealth judiciary by providing a mechanism that enables the parliament to seek removal of a judge who is found to be unfit to hold judicial office. 


By requiring the conduct of a judge to amount to 'proved misbehaviour or incapacity' in the estimation of both houses of the parliament, the Constitution ensures that only the most serious complaints against judges are considered.


In the event of a serious complaint about a judge, where the parliament is called upon to consider removal, there is currently no standard way to assist the parliament to discharge its constitutional responsibilities. 


While serious complaints about judges are extremely rare, previous cases have highlighted the uncertainty about how serious complaints about judges could be fairly and appropriately investigated by the parliament.


It is therefore important that a clear, understandable and fair framework is in place in the event that a serious complaint about judicial misbehaviour and incapacity were to arise.




Key features of the 
b
ill



This bill establishes an effective tool that the parliament can employ to inform itself about the factual basis of an allegation of serious misbehaviour or incapacity against a Commonwealth judicial officer.


The bill provides a fair and transparent process for the investigation of an allegation which can be used flexibly depending on the different circumstances which may arise. The bill enables the parliament to establish a parliamentary commission where a resolution is passed by each house of the parliament, in the same sittings, to investigate a specified allegation about a specified Commonwealth judicial officer. 


It is up to the parliament to decide whether and when a commission is needed.


A commission would provide for an independent investigation into the factual basis of the allegation, in order to provide parliament with appropriate evidence for its consideration. 


A commission would in no way usurp parliament's role in determining whether the conduct of a judicial officer amounted to proved misbehaviour or incapacity.


The bill reflects the non-partisan nature of a commission by requiring its members to be appointed through resolution of each house of the parliament, and with nominees to be put forward following consultation between the Prime Minister and Leader of the Opposition.


The bill establishes transparent processes for a commission's investigation and report to the parliament. 


In particular, the bill gives a commission the powers and protections it needs to operate effectively, while maintaining appropriate safeguards. 


It enables a commission to operate in an inquisitorial manner, similar to the way that parliamentary committees operate.


A commission will be required to act in accordance with the rules of natural justice, and the bill specifies procedures a commission must follow to ensure the Commonwealth judicial officer who is the subject of an investigation is treated fairly.


Chapter III of the Constitution establishes the independence of the Commonwealth judiciary from other limbs of government. 


Consistent with this independence, a commission would not have power to require the participation of current and former Commonwealth judicial officers in its investigation into an allegation. 


Commonwealth judicial officers could still participate and assist a commission's investigation should they choose to do so.




Consultation



The government has consulted across the executive, judiciary and the parliament in development of the bill. 


The government is grateful for the views and suggestions of those significant stakeholders who have assisted to refine the bill. 


I would particularly like to acknowledge the efforts of the former member for Denison, Hon. Duncan Kerr, in providing a valuable foundation for this bill.


Together with its companion bill, the Courts Legislation Amendment (Judicial Complaints) Bill, they will considerably improve the current ad hoc and somewhat opaque system of judicial complaints handling.




Conclusion



In Australia we must never take our constitutional strengths and system of governance for granted. Confidence in our democracy rests on continued improvement and vigilance. 


These bills are important steps on the path, taken by this reformist Labor government, to ensure our federal judicial system is responsive, impartial, and capable of resolving serious complaints. 


I commend the bill to the House.

Mr CHESTER
 (Gippsland) (09:24):  I move:


That the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment Regulations 2011 (No. 1), as contained in the Select Legislative Instrument 2011 No. 191, and made under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999, be disallowed.


I appreciate the opportunity to debate this motion today. The motion of disallowance I have moved and which will be seconded by the member for McMillan is all about respecting the mandate given to the Victorian coalition government at the last state election. It is about respecting the mountain cattlemen and their families for the more than 150 years of active management of the high country.



Mr Mitchell interjecting—




Mr CHESTER:
  Already the member for McEwen is interjecting. I ask the member for McEwen to listen for a few moments to what I am about to say and to show a little bit of respect for the mountain cattlemen.




The SPEAKER:
  The member for Gippsland will return to the motion and the honourable member opposite will desist.




Mr CHESTER:
  It is also about respecting the role the cattlemen can play in the future of sustainable environmental management through grazing and prescribed burns and about respecting the heritage of regional communities on both sides of the Great Dividing Range in Victoria. Given the huge deficit of trust that exists between this government and the Australian people, now would be a very good time to start showing some respect in this place for these people.


The Victorian government took a clear policy to the state election in 2010 that it would reintroduce cattle grazing to the Alpine National Park. The only thing the Victorian government has been guilty of is honouring that promise—the promise they made to the Victorian people that they would reintroduce cattle grazing to the Alpine National Park. There was strong support given to coalition candidates on both sides of the Great Dividing Range on this issue. It was a significant issue in the seat of Gippsland East, where I was involved in campaigning because it interacts with my own seat of Gippsland. I am not going to overstate the importance of the issue but it was a significant issue. It was certainly one that was raised in community debates and in various forums during the campaign process. The mountain cattlemen themselves invested heavily in that election campaign. I understand they made donations to the Liberal Party and to the Nationals in that election campaign in the order of $20,000. I could be corrected on that. So the mountain cattlemen themselves thought this was important enough to support candidates in that campaign and to support the issue.



Mr Mitchell interjecting—




Mr CHESTER:
  The member for McEwen cannot help himself on this issue. He is talking about cash for comment. What he does not understand is this has been a long-held belief in the coalition parties in Victoria. It is not about cash for comment, member for McEwen; it is all about making sure that people who want their voice heard in this place have the chance to have their voice heard, and that is why today is very important. It is a very good opportunity for the people of Gippsland East and other state seats to have their voice heard in this place.


You would think that the Australian Labor Party would learn some lessons from the past on the issue of cattle grazing in the Alpine National Park because this issue has a very dark and murky political background for the Australian Labor Party. It goes back to 2005 when the former Bracks government first banned the cattlemen from the high country. On that occasion we had the memorable scenes of mountain cattlemen and other supporters of their cause marching through the main streets of Melbourne. They were marching up Bourke Street on their horses, wearing their Driza-Bones, bringing the issue to the state parliament of Victoria. They brought attention on the steps of parliament in Spring Street to what they thought was a great injustice. That caused an immediate political backlash to the state Labor government at the 2006 state election. The Victorian Labor Party lost the seat of Morwell, which is in the Gippsland area, and lost the seat of Narracan, also in the Gippsland area. Again, I am not saying this was the only reason they lost those seats but it was a pivotal issue in the campaign. When you consider that the member for Narracan was the chairman of the committee which recommended that cattlemen get kicked out of the high country in the first place, you can understand the point that I am making.


The Australian Labor Party has already paid a political price for its attitude to the cattlemen in Victoria. I can tell you now, it will pay an even heavier political price in the future if it continues to go down this track of showing no respect for the mandate given to the Victorian government by the voters of Victoria. The people have spoken clearly on this issue and their voice needs to be heard in this place. I acknowledge it is not a unanimous view but there is a strong majority in the directly affected communities that have given the Victorian government a mandate for its policy, and I believe it should be respected.


I recognise that this is not an issue which is necessarily at the front of mind for all other members of parliament. There are 150 seats around Australia and there are probably only a handful of seats which are directly affected by this issue. But where this issue has been tested in the court of public opinion, where the contest of ideas has taken place on the ground, overwhelmingly the position adopted by the Australian Labor Party and the Greens has been rejected by the people in those communities. In those areas where people are most directly affected and have the most information about how this issue plays out in a community and a political sense, they have rejected the Australian Labor Party and the Greens. You only need to travel around regional Victoria on any given day to see vehicles with yellow and green stickers on the back of them that read 'Mountain cattlemen care for the high country'. That slogan has been around for more than 20 years. It is a strongly held view in the communities that are directly affected by this issue


The contention that I am putting to the House today is that the Victorian government has every right to commission a trial into the strategic use of cattle grazing to reduce the impact of bushfires. This is a region that has been devastated by bushfires in the past; there is no doubt it will be affected again in the future. We have an obligation as members of parliament, both in this place and in state jurisdictions, to do everything we can to reduce the impact of fires on lives, property and the natural environment. I consider this issue to be another example of the grand hypocrisy of the Greens on natural resource management issues. The Greens leader travels around Australia campaigning for territory rights because it might assist in his campaigns to install gay marriage and euthanasia, but he is happy to trample on state government rights on this natural resource management issue.


We should be used to that level of hypocrisy, because the Greens have proposed a bill previously in this place targeted squarely at removing the rights of the Victorian government to take action to assess the strategic use of cattle grazing as a tool to reduce bushfire risk in Victoria's high country. The thing that most offends the people who live in these communities and that most offends me is that when the Greens put out these motions from the leafy suburbs of Melbourne they do not talk about the thousands of brumbies, the introduced wild species like deer, the wild dogs or the noxious weeds that are in the Alpine National Park and that should be targeted by any bills or motions the Greens would like to propose to assist the environment in the Alpine region. The Greens do not even seem to understand that the scorching bushfires in areas which have not been grazed and which have not benefited from prescribed burning are more devastating to wildlife than anything the mountain cattlemen have ever done in more than 150 years in the alpine regions.


To put it very simply, regional Australians have had a gutful of city based Greens telling them how to live their lives. Now we have a Sydney based minister for the environment who simply joins in the chorus and sings the same songs as the Australian Greens. The Greens have never created a job in regional Australia and they are a direct threat to a host of our traditional industries, including the cattlemen, the broader agricultural sector, commercial fishing, mining and power generation and recreational angling. The action taken by this minister to override the Victorian government on this issue demonstrates this government's complete lack of respect for regional Australians. I am sure that we will hear today all the usual lines from the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities. He will say that a national park is not a farm and that only a select few graziers get to use the high country runs. We have heard all the lines before; I look forward to them being rolled out again today. To that I say in advance to the minister: a national park is not meant to be a weed infested wasteland either. It is not meant to be scorched every few years because we have failed to reduce the fuel load. A national park is not meant to be full of feral species in uncontrolled numbers. The minister failed to mention those issues when he first started attacking mountain cattlemen. I concede that in more recent times the minister has raised those issues. I think he has realised the folly of his ways from those early days when he first ran his campaign against the mountain cattlemen and now he does talk more about the weeds and other feral species. But I urge the minister to concentrate on those issues, because they are doing far more damage and are of much greater environmental significance to the alpine region than anything that mountain cattlemen have done in the past or will do in the future. If the minister wanted to do something that was actually important for the Alpine National Park, and the Victorian high country more generally, he could really focus his efforts in that area. I urge all members in this place not to vilify the mountain cattlemen and their families.


The minister and I get along quite well, and I do not mind if he attacks me. I do not mind if he criticises my party and me, if he gives me heaps. I just urge him to show a great deal of respect to the people that are represented in this debate today. I urge him to show some respect for the cattlemen, because every time a member in this place attacks the cattlemen it is very personal for these people and their families. When anyone in this place says to these people, 'You are wrong,' they are actually saying their fathers were wrong, their grandfathers were wrong and even, sometimes, their great-grandfathers were wrong. You are denying their whole cultural heritage. So by all means, Minister, give me your best shot, and I am sure you will—you need no encouragement; you have needed no encouragement in the past—but I urge you to respect the families and their culture and their heritage, because they are very proud of that heritage. They believe that they have done a great job in the alpine region, that they are part of the solution for the future and that they should not be thrown out like yesterday's newspaper.


We are talking about a state government trial of cattle grazing involving just 400 cattle in a 26,000-hectare national park. The point that must be remembered throughout this whole debate is that the cattlemen have run cattle in that region for more than 150 years. It was only after the cattle had been there for more than 150 years that it was deemed to be in such pristine condition that it was worthy of becoming a national park in the first place. In the mid-1980s the wise heads of the day decided that this region was so pristine and so magnificent that, even after 150 years of mountain cattlemen using the territory, it was so good they could make it a national park. That to me is the core of the issue. There was not a level of environmental damage that warranted any other action being taken by the governments of the day. They believed on merit that the alpine region was in such good condition that it should become a national park. I contend that the minister himself did more damage to the region when he rushed up the hill on a wet day in his four-wheel-drive to get his photo taken in front of a deer wallow. I contend that he did more damage then than the mountain cattlemen would do under this trial of 400 cattle spread across 26,000 hectares of national park.


There is generations of knowledge about practical environmental management in the hands of the mountain cattlemen and their families. This is knowledge that you cannot learn in a book; it is knowledge that has been passed down from one generation to the next. I believe it deserves to be respected and passed on to future generations. I believe that grazing can actually help to reduce the fuel load in the alpine region, particularly if it is used in a strategic manner in conjunction with other fuel mitigation efforts.


In the past, the mountain cattlemen have not just relied on grazing as their approach to reducing the impact of bushfires; they have also been heavily involved in prescribed burning. I think we have lost our way in relation to prescribed burning in Victoria and in many other parts of Australia over the last several decades. We have seen in more recent times a government in Victoria that is more committed to reducing the fuel load. Part of the reason for the devastation of the Black Saturday bushfires is that we did not do the prescribed burning that we needed to do in the decades leading up to it. We had a massive amount of fuel build up in many parts of Victoria, and that led to the devastation. We need three things for a fire. We need hot and windy conditions, and we are always going to get that in Victoria because it is a fire prone area. We need a point of ignition, and we are always going to have that—whether it is a lightning strike or some idiot with a match, that is going to happen. We need a fuel load, and there is always going to be fuel. The only part of that fire matrix we can actually affect is the fuel load. We are always going to have hot, windy days and we are always going to have a point of ignition. But we can reduce the fuel load and reduce the intensity of those bushfires when they occur—and they will occur again.


This is all about using cattle in a strategic way to reduce the impact of future bushfires. Those opposite will say it does not work. But, as I have told the House previously, even the ACT Labor government agrees to the approach of using cattle in a strategic way to reduce the impact of bushfires. This year the ACT government intends to graze more than 7,000 hectares across 76 sites to protect ACT residents from bushfires. Let me say that again. The ACT government believes cattle grazing does play a worthwhile role in reducing the fuel load in the ACT to protect property and lives around the ACT, so they are going to use cattle across 7,000 hectares at 76 different sites to protect ACT residents. But we are not allowed to use cattle to protect lives and property in the natural environment of the high country because this minister and this government are directly overriding the Victorian state government and they are directly overriding the clear mandate that government received from the Victorian people.


I do not expect those opposite us in the chamber today to change their mind. It is no surprise to me at all that they will vote against this disallowance motion and do the bidding of the Australian Greens—and they will pay an electoral price for that in the future. The reason I do not expect them to change their mind is that more than 40 of the members opposite actually rely on Greens preferences for their political survival. They need Greens preferences to win their seats, so they will do whatever is necessary to protect their political careers. But I appeal to the crossbenchers to think very seriously about this issue and give due respect to the mountain cattlemen and their cause. I repeat that, for more than 150 years, the mountain cattlemen have been allowed to run their cattle in the high country and they have actively worked to protect and enhance the environment. They are not the problem; they are part of the solution. The heritage, the culture and the knowledge of the mountain cattlemen, which has been built up over more than 150 years, is an asset to our community and they should be respected, not vilified, by the Labor Party and the Greens in this place. I thank the House for the opportunity to raise this important issue and I again urge the crossbenchers to think very seriously about what we are talking about today in relation to the future of the alpine region and the practical land management skills that have been applied for more than 150 years.

(

"Broadbent, Russell, MP",LP,2012-03-14,"



Mr BROADBENT
 (McMillan) (09:40):  I second the motion. On Sunday morning my radio is sometimes still on ABC. Macca was on, and they had a school from the high country reciting a poem. The poem was, 'There was movement at the station for the word had got around that the colt from old Regret had got away.' So the kids say, 'We all went around and rounded him up.' That was their poem. I found myself, fortuitously, filling in for my friend and colleague the member for Gippsland at the high country cattlemen's muster at Merrijig in January. It was a pleasure to be at Merrijig and I must admit I was consumed by the points they put to us that day. I have supported minority positions in this place on many occasions before, even against my own party's position when in government. At Merrijig I found myself surrounded by this minority of Australian people and I thought very carefully about why I would support this disallowance motion. It is not something I am here to support just because Darren Chester is my mate; I am here to support the feelings those people communicated to me that day. They gave me all the information about what the park has been like over its 150 years of heritage. 


For those who are listening to this address, I want to explain that I am trying to woo the minister to my point of view and I am trying to do it in a practical way. I hear the message that this is a political position taken by the government and the Greens, through the member for Melbourne, who is sitting in the chamber. I fully acknowledge that I too have done checks on the number of members of this parliament who are here on Greens preferences. Nearly half of the Labor Party members here are in marginal seats on Greens preferences. I have looked at all those figures too, and I understand where they are coming from.


So we bring forward an issue of practicality and relevance to a minority group of people in Australia that is part of our national heritage. We have not got a lot to hang our hat on in this country. It is mostly English heritage that we were taught at school; those were our early lessons. But what consumed me that day at Merrijig was that here was our own living history. Forget about the feral animals, the wild dogs, the blackberries that have gone berserk and the parts of the park that you can no longer get into—and that is across this nation. It is a disgrace the way we have nominated these places as national parks and then governments of all persuasions have not looked after them as they should have—and that is not just in Victoria but elsewhere too. Having said that, I recognise that we have something so precious in our living heritage as the rich history of these mountain cattlemen and their families and the amazing stories that surround them of battling against all odds as part of our nation's growth and history for 140 years. Can you imagine any country in the world turning their backs on the heritage such as we have, which is a gift? Can you imagine the Americans turning their back on this? No. But we as a nation are so consumed by the politics of the day, and we know politicians hate short-term pain that may lead to long-term gain. They hate it. They do not like any sort of political pain whatsoever.


But why can't somebody stand up in this place and say, 'This is a minority of people who have a grand heritage in this country and who we should all speak about with some pride and reverence'? At the same time, we are prepared to say no. Because of the green influence in our capital cities and the green influence of the members of parliament that sit in here, we are prepared to throw these people out of the high country. The message that I received was that parts that were pristine are no longer pristine. Parts that were of great value for our community to go and enjoy are no longer available for our community because they are a mess, inaccessible and covered in blackberries, and what was beautiful is no longer beautiful.


Have I been up there? No. Do I know about it from friends? Yes. Did I drive the wrong way home? Yes, and I would not recommend that trip to anybody, but I thought it was a good idea at the time. I have a view about this that I have thought about very carefully because I am in a marginal seat and I risk green support, even though there are not many in the House as green as we are in rural seats. Our land is particularly important to us. Our farmers and those who work the land are particularly important to us. There is not a day that goes by when we do not talk about them, think about them, work with them and, hopefully, bring their issues to this parliament. I am one who cannot walk away from the living heritage that is outlined in the story of the mountain cattlemen and their families, and especially their women. The stories over that 100 years of the valour of the women who were connected to these families are just amazing, as are the stories of the brilliant people who have come through the generations to make great contributions to this nation.


To those who say, 'You cannot put cattle into a national park,' I say that the Victorian state government went to the Victorian people and bravely said, 'If we are re-elected, we are going to do a trial in the national parks by putting very few cattle back into the high country.' To me, that was grabbing hold of that heritage and saying, 'It is important to us; it is important enough for us to continue it.'


I am taking a different tack in trying to convince the minister to support this motion. The different tack is that it is all about our living heritage. It is all about people we care about and it is about a minority group of people, being the mountain cattlemen, who have no effect on any seat whether they change from one way to another. There is nothing for the minister to lose in attacking the mountain cattlemen. But in attacking the mountain cattlemen he is attacking our living heritage and what is important in this nation—the values that the mountain cattlemen have and the way they protected the land.


There is a criterion we should all have, and that is what is of long-term benefit to the nation. I have heard a lot about what is to the long-term benefit of the nation on a whole lot of issues. I have heard members of parliament, particularly those on the crossbench, say: 'No. I am prepared to go down this track whether it is politically difficult for me or not because I believe in the long-term interests of the Australian people.' That phrase has been used and bandied about so many times recently it has just about become the default. But I still believe in it. I still believe that this parliament should be governing for the Australian people and what is in their best interests today, tomorrow, next week, next year and in 20 years time. To have a vision for who we are and what we are on about we must never forget where we came from. Who are we? What made us up? Why are we like the way we are? Why are we reactionary in so many ways? It is because of our heritage. It is because of who we are.


I am only fourth generation. My great-grandfather was kicked out of England by his family. I know why I have some of the reactions I have today to some of the leadership I deal with.



An opposition member:  The English knew what they were doing.




Mr BROADBENT:
  Yes! I am glad they threw him out. He did not want to join their business; he wanted to be a coach builder and the family did not think that coach building had a future at that stage.



An opposition member:  Is this relevant?




Mr BROADBENT:
  Actually, it is very relevant because it goes back to the point that I was making about our living heritage and how important it is. We go on about our Indigenous community. We go on about the people who came on tall ships. We go on about the waves of generations of people that came here. But we are discounting our living heritage in these mountain cattlemen and saying that they are a minority and do not count. That is my only point to you today, Minister. Whilst you may have your criteria for what you have to perform under the law, there should be a reasonable consideration for the value of our living heritage: what has gone on in the past, what these people mean to us and what they will mean to future generations when their stories are told—because the stories about our history in this small part of Australia will be told over and over again.


We are not asking for a lot. There are thousands and thousands of hectares there. The cattle go up for a short time each year and are then taken out again. It is not a big ask to put the cattle back into the high country. So I say to the minister: if I could have my way, I would have the cattle back in the high country again on behalf of the minority that care about the country. It is not a big ask that the nation preserve our heritage and give back to the mountain cattlemen a small area of our great nation.


I was at a diabetes breakfast this morning, and there was a map of the world there with Australia cast out in red. I looked at the nation this morning from a different perspective, not with regard to diabetes but in terms of how big it is and how big the oceans around it are. We are only asking that the mountain cattlemen be given back some of their land rights. When I was in local government they called it 'prior-use rights'. The guy next door to me in Pakenham, where I live, carts metal and clay out of his place. He had a complaint. He came to me and said, 'Russell, you have to sign this document to say that I actually enjoy prior-use rights.'


Today, I am arguing only that these people have had their prior-use rights taken from them, that this should be redressed and that they should be returned to the high country. It is not a big ask. This is a tiny bit of the nation. I have been to Western Australia. I have seen the feral goats over there, covering the nation. I have seen the camels that are making a terrible mess. I have seen the horses that are making a terrible mess. I have seen things going wrong right across my nation with regard to these issues.


So my plea and my care for the cattlemen are not political—they are not based on a political decision. I make my plea because I believe I am in the right. So I am standing here and pleading with this parliament to agree to this disallowance motion put forward by my friend and colleague the member for Gippsland. He also has put it forward in a genuine spirit of goodwill. I am not here just to ruffle feathers. I am here to ask and plead on behalf of a minority. That minority deserves a go, deserves an opportunity and deserves to see in the years to come that our living heritage is preserved. I ask all those in this place to consider very carefully how they vote on this motion because they are voting on the heart and soul of the nation.

"Burke, Tony, MP",ALP,2012-03-14,"



Mr BURKE
 (Watson—Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities) (09:55):  I will begin on a point that has been raised by the member for McMillan and the member for Gippsland, both of whom I get along well with and have a high regard for. They have both said a number of things I disagree with, but there is one thing I want to take head-on from the beginning. My gripe is not with the mountain cattlemen—they are not the people I believe deserve to be publicly denigrated—but with the Victorian government. It is the behaviour of the Victorian government on this matter that I believe is worthy of every single criticism we have levelled at it over this decision. Make no mistake—




Mr Forrest:
  It is the same thing.




Mr BURKE:
  Interjectors get thrown out before the vote—that would be terrific! Issues have been raised about who is behind this, what the reason is and what the real motivation is, as though somehow there are people pushing Labor to adopt this view. Getting the cattle out of Alpine National Park was a Labor reform led by a Labor deputy premier when he was Minister for Environment—John Thwaites. It was done by a Labor government and is a Labor reform of which we are proud. We do not need anyone to tell us—and I will let other parties speak for themselves—that national parks deserve to be treated differently.


Let us not allow this argument to get caught up in the pretence that no grazing occurs in the high country. In all the areas where there is state forest, alpine grazing continues to occur, and it occurs without any objection at all. But we draw a line and have a different view when a national park is involved. People then want to raise the non-environmental uses of national parks—the different tourism ventures and things like that. I have no problem with things happening inside national parks that are directly aimed at people enjoying a national park and enjoying nature. I just do not have the same view on that level of enjoyment being offered to cattle. I think national parks have a role as places people can go to enjoy nature and see things in the most natural environment possible. Families can go there for their picnics, people can go for walks there and people can enjoy and love one of the most special parts of our nation.


That is why you do not find the same objections being made to alpine grazing in state forests. It is also why I have no truck at all with the argument that somehow this is a states rights issue. If they are meant to be entirely of state interest, then why on earth call them national parks? We are the government of the nation here. This is a parliament of the nation. If states do not believe national parks are of national significance, then they should not call them national parks—call them state forests or call them something else. But the moment there is an acknowledgment from the states that this deserves to be treated and publicly acknowledged as of significance to the nation then the national parliament and the national government have a role in looking at whether the principles are being applied appropriately in the management of national parks.


The examples that were given by the member for Gippsland, within the Australian Capital Territory, were not examples of national parks. You will find examples within national parks, when they are first declared, of activities that I would not regard as ideal. And there are pre-existing uses that occur in national parks. It even happens with forestry sometimes, when a final rotation of different coups goes through and then the regrowth is allowed to remain there for conservation purposes. These sorts of non-ideal uses of national parks happen all the time, but the one principle that has always been there—until the Victorian government broke it—is that in a national park you do not take backward steps. Once you have achieved a better environmental outcome within a national park, you draw a line. You do not see it as a resource to be used. You do not see it as a resource to be dug up, shot down or grazed over the top of. You see it as a national park so that the citizens of this nation can have somewhere to go and enjoy nature. That is what it is for. It is so significant that, even though it has been done at the state level time and again, state jurisdictions want the federal parliament to put the word 'national' in the title because they believe, and they are right to believe, that it is of significance to the whole nation.


The Victorian government's implementation of this—the principle is wrong and the motivation is wrong—has been a bumbling farce. On the principle of no backward steps in national parks, there is a difference between access for people and access for cattle. There are some people and some environmentalists—maybe some people within this chamber—who have a different view to me and who would take a much tougher line on the enjoyment by people and the access to tourism facilities and things like that within national parks. I do not draw that line. I have always been positive about opportunities for people to enjoy these places. But I do not see national parks as opportunities for commercial ventures which have nothing whatsoever to do with the enjoyment of the national park for anyone other than the grazier or the owner of the business.


The member for McMillan, though, raised an important matter of principle: how do we weigh up the heritage issues? You would think that this parliament was being asked to make a decision as to whether grazing cattle will now have to leave the Alpine National Park. The truth is that alpine grazing finished some years ago. This is about a reintroduction; this is about a backward step. The heritage issues have already been consigned to the past. We happily celebrate the heritage of the First Fleet. It does not mean that if we want to travel back and forth to London we have to get on board a square rigger! When we celebrate and acknowledge heritage, it does not mean that how things were done in the past must be the way forward for ever. There is alpine grazing, but it is not within the national park, nor should it be. There is an important principle here about how we deal with our national parks. 


It is hard to find an issue where it is easier to criticise the motivation of the Victorian government than this one. I was actually weighing up whether I acknowledge this or not and whether it is taking the low road too much to talk about this stuff, but the member for Gippsland did it for me. Upfront he said, 'This issue is so important that people involved have made donations to the National Party,' as though they have somehow bought into the outcome by making a political donation and therefore their views become more important. There is no way in the world that this government will have a moment of sympathy for anyone who wants to argue that, because you make a donation to a political party, you increase your rights as a citizen to access and use national parks for commercial purposes. You have had the media at different points referring to whether or not this might be the motivation. You have had different members of my own political party asserting that it probably is the motivation. Ten points, the card ought to go up, for the honesty of the member for New England and 10 points for the honesty of this admission from the National Party. If we ever wanted to see an example of a donation and a policy outcome being inextricably linked, we have had not just a speech about it but a confession about it on the floor of the House of Representatives today. This was a cheap deal to provide free agistment for a number of farmers.


Let us not forget that these same individuals, when they left the Alpine National Park, were paid compensation for leaving. They were actually paid compensation for leaving. Did the Victorian government say that that compensation money, if the graziers wanted to come back in, would be returned? Not for a moment. The idea of the Victorian government was: you leave for a few years, you get the compensation for leaving and you make your donation to the National Party, but that is the only money you will lose—paying back to the National Party is enough; you will never have to pay back the taxpayers' funds. That is what has happened here.


That also explains why we have ended up with the bogus fire management argument as the reason. The Victorian government have wanted to claim this is about fire management for one reason only: they needed to circumvent the compensation issue. They needed to design contracts that said, 'This is not for the benefit of the farmer; this is for the benefit of the National Park.' That is why they landed at the fire management issue—for no other reason. They went to the fire management issue as a way of making sure that people who had made their donations to the National Party got to keep their compensation funds and got the benefit anyway. That is what the Victorian government have done. This one is as grubby as it gets.


The scientific argument was shown to be a fraud from the moment the implementation began. If you are going to conduct a scientific study on the impact of alpine grazing, the first thing you would do is let the scientists have a look at the site before the cattle arrive. How are you meant to know what the impact of alpine grazing is unless you do your baseline survey, unless you let the scientists in? The Victorian government was in such a rush to make sure that it could say to the mounted cattlemen that it had delivered it did not even let the scientist who was allegedly in charge of the study know that the cattle were on their way in. As far as science was concerned, no survey could be done. The scientists did not even get half a chance to have a look at the Alpine National Park before the cattle were rushed in so that the donors to the National Party could be made happy. That is the precise order of events. We ended up with members of the Victorian parliament trying to come up with ways of saying why the science was true. We ended up with a member of the Victorian parliament, who I must say has become my favourite member of that parliament, Donna Petrovich, saying:


In many respects we are quite lucky that there are still a few remaining lead cows in those herds that know the areas that are being trialled. If we did not have that, we would have an environmental problem. Those cattle stick to the areas and the tracks, and they teach the other cattle the appropriate way to move through that country.


The best defence the Victorian government can come up with is a mutual workshopping education plan amongst small groups of cattle, where they teach each other and explain which wetlands are safe to trample all over and which wetlands are listed under the EPBC Act as vulnerable! The lead cow gets to show the smaller cows where it is safe to go and where there might be an endangered species! And this is meant to be a scientific trial. This is the best that the Victorian government has been able to come up with.


Up until now, members of the federal coalition have avoided making a public stand on this issue. They have allowed the issue to go through quietly. They have allowed the member for Gippsland to fly the flag and make his own comments. They have just wanted the issue to go away. But, in a classic own goal, in a classic favour that the member for Gippsland has decided to do for his coalition colleagues, today he gets to put every single one of them on the record.


On this side of the House, we are very proud to be on the record defending a Labor reform from the previous Victorian Labor government. We are very proud of our relationship with the cattle farmers—whom I met during the time that I was Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry—who actually pay for land to feed their own cattle, who do not have this special bonus, who do not use this side way of trying to get free agistment through donations to the National Party.


In this own goal, members opposite who have national parks in their electorates—whether it is the Blue Mountains, Mount Buffalo, Diamantina or Ku-ring-gai Chase—draw a line today when they sit in this chamber and put themselves on the record. They decide today, for the first time, whether the view of this parliament is that it is okay to take backward steps inside a national park, whether it is okay within a national park—even though it has been declared, even though it has been determined to be of national significance—to continue to see that area as a resource to be chopped down, dug up or grazed over the top of. No member of parliament gets to avoid that today. On the Labor side, we are really proud to be able to get our names on the record, but there is no shortage of members of the coalition who will not be thanking the member for Gippsland for what he is making them do today.


I made an offer to the three governments that are responsible for the alpine areas—the ACT government, the New South Wales government and the Victorian government—to work together on how to deal with bushfire mitigation and how to deal with other ferals and invasives. Guess which of the three governments has still not responded to me. The Victorian government, because they are not interested in the reasons for weeds and bushfires. There have only been excuses to get around a compensation issue, to look after some donors, in a grubby deal that should end today. (Time expired)

"Schultz, Alby, MP",LP,2012-03-14,"



Mr SCHULTZ
 (Hume) (10:10):  I have a lot of respect for the minister at the table, the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities, and I am disappointed to hear what he has been saying about national parks. Why am I disappointed? Because his attitude is like the attitude of ministers of the Crown in the Greiner government in 1992, when I warned them that a fire of a magnitude that they would never have seen before was going to occur in the Kosciuszko National Park. I warned my volunteer firefighters, when I was representing that area, not to go into the park under any circumstances, because there was that much fuel in there that, if a lightning strike hit it, it would create a massive problem, not only for their safety but also for biodiversity.


In 2003, as a result of incompetence within the New South Wales Rural Fire Service, that fire happened. It created a massive problem for the park and had a massive impact on its ecology, to the extent that, in some sections of the Kosciuszko, particularly on the Victorian side, the ground is sterilised 15 to 16 feet below the surface, and the soil, if you pick it up in your hands, is like talcum powder. There was more biodiversity destroyed in that fire than has ever been destroyed or threatened by mankind before.


History has shown that, when the cattle were grazing in the high country, the fires were lesser than they are today. It is okay to have an ideological view that might be friendly to and appreciative of the Greens—that you and your government are holding very desperately onto government with, Minister—but the reality is that the sort of dogma and nonsense that you are espousing in this chamber today will have a massive impact on the Kosciuszko. You talk about future generations and protecting the biodiversity of places like the Kosciuszko by keeping cattle out. Minister, I say to you what I said to the Greiner government in 1992: you are going in the wrong direction. If you want to save the Kosciuszko for future generations, stop this nonsense about locking people out and letting the weeds and feral animals within proliferate. 


I have been up in the Kosciuszko many, many times. In fact, I made a short film about the Kosciuszko and the history of mankind in the Kosciuszko. You go up into the Kosciuszko today and, because of the feral cats and wild dogs there, you cannot hear a bird. There are no birds up there in some sections of the Kosciuszko, because of the incompetence of successive governments, at both the state and federal levels, who do not seem to understand that man can live in harmony with the environment. It has been done for over a century in the Kosciuszko National Park. I can tell you, Minister, it breaks my heart to hear you in this chamber today blame people like the cattlemen of this country, who not only have created history but with their cattle grazing have also done more to protect the national parks than anybody else. The Aborigines used to burn the parks in the past. Why did they burn them? They burnt them to get the sweet grass growing so that the kangaroos would come down and make it easier for them to take the kangaroos for food. 


I am passionate about this; I probably sound passionate about it. Let me say to you, Minister: please rethink your direction because, if you do not, not only are you going to threaten the maintenance of biodiversity in the Kosciuszko National Park; you are going to place in danger volunteer firefighters, who are the people who will go in there and fight the fires. It will not be the Greens, or you as a minister, or a politician—it will be volunteers, who give their time freely, who because of the nonsense that you have espoused here today will go in and try to put out what is inevitably going to be another wildfire in the Kosciusko National Park. I say that with a heavy heart, Minister, because I do respect you. I think you are a highly intelligent individual and I am surprised that you have brought this sort of debate into this chamber.

"Neville, Paul, MP",Nats,2012-03-14,"



Mr NEVILLE
 (Hinkler—The Nationals Deputy Whip) (10:15):  I would like to support my colleagues the members for Gippsland, McMillan and Hume. It grieves me to disagree with the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities, because I must say that this minister has been very good to me in my electorate. He has come up and looked at the problems I have had, even environmental problems like the bats. When we had trouble with the bats he promised me that he would try to influence the state ministers to be a bit more amenable to the problems that people had regarding the bats. I might tell you, Minister, it is still a dreadful problem. But that is not what we are talking about today; we are talking about the alpine regions of New South Wales and Victoria.


I think it is perfectly reasonable for the state government of Victoria to ask for a trial and to have a controlled trial. Why should we be worried about doing a trial in a controlled area with a controlled number of cattle? What reasonable person could object to that? I will tell you why people object to it: the risk might be that if the trial proved successful there would be pressure for other parts of the park to be opened up to grazing. So, if you do not want to do anything like that, you knock it on the head. Although the minister crafted a very interesting story about the words 'national parks', the word national was used way back, well before we developed a sense of nationalism in this country. It was a term that was used overseas, in America, and we adopted it here when the states started to put aside special parts of the country for the preservation of the ecology of those areas. I do not think it ever had the context of the federal government imposing its will of protection over it. That might be the case with Heritage areas, but it was not the case with national parks.


Who controls the national parks, when it really gets down to the practicality of it? It is the state governments. It is their environmental departments or their agriculture or primary industry departments. It is their police and emergency workers who have to go into the parks in times of fire and flood. All those sorts of workers, down to SES volunteers, rural firemen and firewomen, are godchildren of the state governments. They are the people who have to effectively carry out the work. It is all well and good for the federal government to use an international convention to bludgeon a state government. That has happened time and time again in this country—total overkill, using a sledgehammer to crack a nut. The number of times that international conventions have been used to suppress the intentions of a state government is totally disproportionate. 


What do we see across Australia in all states? We get governments from time to time of both political persuasions—but I suspect probably more Labor ones than not—that have the idea to name a national park. Everyone feels all warm and fuzzy and everyone says, 'Oh, good! Isn't that marvellous!' But what do you see a year or two later? You see feral animals running all over them and there are no fuel reduction measures going on. I can remember one in my own area. It cries out to heaven, in much the same way as the member for Hume described parts of the alpine region. There are some beautiful wallum and some other plants—the name escapes me for the minute. There is a magnificent national park which has huge dead craggy trees with huge eagles nests on them. Before I got into parliament I was in charge of tourism in the area. I remember the ranger came to see me in desperation. He asked, 'Is there anything you can do with the Parks and Wildlife people or with the local council?' The ranger, John Byrne—I remember his name well—said, 'We're going to lose that whole park.' All he wanted to do was put some firebreaks through it—a simple thing. No. Even though he was their ranger, Parks and Wildlife would not let him do it, nor would the local council and, as sure as night follows day, we had a bushfire—and what a bobby-dazzler it was! It burnt out 70 per cent of the national park, and those magnificent eagles and all that went with it. Why do we have to demonise all the time grazing that has been going on for 150 years? As two of the speakers before me pointed out, people have got into the park through the activities of the cattlemen and have been able to appreciate that high country. I think it is reasonable for the state government of Victoria to conduct a trial and make its findings publicly known. The minister I think was a bit florid in his description of National Party members before, and I take some offence at that because I pride myself on being a practical conservationist. I do not go around thumping my breast and saying, 'Oh, isn't this dreadful?' or, 'Isn't that dreadful?' I like to do things like getting weed machines into salvinia and water hyacinth, ripping them out of our streams and making them pristine again. Previous ministers of the Howard government helped me do that. In fact, it overflowed into areas outside my electorate. The machines went on to clear lots of streams and dams.


I have spoken to the minister at the table, the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities, when he has come to Bundaberg. I want to reopen the mouth of the Elliott River because the mangroves and things are dying. I probably had more Green Corps projects in my electorate under the Howard government than anyone else because I fostered them and I felt they did good work. I had a $2 million or $3 million study into some of the birds that come from Russia down to Queensland during the season. I have done a lot of work on the restoration of beaches through various government programs. I do not see myself standing in front of a tree, in front of a bulldozer. That is not my form of green power. My form of green power is doing practical things for the environment, not only so that people can enjoy it but also so that you remove feral influences from the environment and make it better.


I think a lot of the national parks in this country are very poorly run, and the state governments in many instances do not pull their weight. But when the Victorian government want to run a trial in a controlled area of land with a controlled number of cattle I think it is wrong to demonise them. I support the members for Gippsland, McMillan and Hume in their comments today and I ask the minister to think carefully on this subject.

"Bandt, Adam, MP",AG,2012-03-14,"



Mr BANDT
 (Melbourne) (10:24):  The Greens' position on this is well known. I have introduced a private member's bill into this place that would have the effect of removing cattle from the park, which is now subject, of course, to the result of this vote. Because the minister has acted, we do not need to proceed with that, because we are giving effect to the fundamental principle that this is a park, not a paddock. Our views on this are well known and I am not going to repeat them all, but I do want to spend some time on the issue that—aside from the contribution by the member for McMillan—has been the underlying principle of almost every contribution here in this chamber and of the Victorian government, which is the idea that grazing in a national park with internationally recognised sensitive and endangered areas is somehow going to reduce the fire risk and that somehow a trial is needed to prove that.


After the fires in 2003 in the Bogong High Plains, there was the opportunity to conduct exactly that assessment. After those fires, scientists went in and conducted one of the most comprehensive studies of fire behaviour and its connection with grazing. They looked at over 419 points. They took over 4,000 twig measurements. They did a very comprehensive survey of the impact of those fires in the areas where there had been grazing in the park and those where there had not been. And what did they find? They found that there was no statistically significant difference between the areas where there was grazing and the areas where there was not.




Mr Schultz:
  Because the fire was so hot, you goose!




Mr BANDT:
  One would have thought that the conducting of a scientific trial—




Mr Mitchell:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, it is unparliamentary—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Hon. BC Scott
):  And the member for Hume is interjecting outside of his place in this chamber, which is very disorderly. The member for Melbourne has the call.




Mr BANDT:
  For those who come in here and say that the basis for this is fire risk and science and we need a trial: if you are going to base your argument on the science, let us look at the science, and the science is in. We have evidence, and I have not heard one member from the opposition talk about the study that was done after 2003, because it does not help their argument but it is what the science says.


We had a thing in Victoria in 2009—which again I have not heard any member from either Victoria or the coalition talk about—called the 2009 Victorian Bushfires Royal Commission. It had a $40 million budget. It sat for over 155 days. It came up with many recommendations. Not one of them was that we should reintroduce grazing into the park because it would reduce fire risk, despite the fact that the royal commission looked at these areas and looked at all of these issues and despite the fact that I suspect that some people probably made submissions to it to that effect.


But let us take this argument even further. Let us assume that you are prepared to ignore the fact that there has been a case study of this after 2003 and ample scientific evidence. Let us ignore the fact that we have had a royal commission looking at fires in Victoria. Let us just take the argument on face value that you want to have a controlled trial. If that is right, why did the scientist who is supposedly conducting this trial first find out about it after the Baillieu government introduced the cattle into the park? He found out about it when he read it in the paper. If you really wanted to conduct a trial, wouldn't you appoint the scientist and then go and get them to investigate the area, work out their methodology, conduct their initial research, establish the baseline situation and then set out how you would conduct a trial?


No, that is not what happened here. What happened here was that the Baillieu government, within five minutes of being elected, put the cattle back into the park and then thought: 'Well, we need a bit of a fig leaf for this. Let's go and talk to a scientist. Let's go and arrange a scientist to get involved.' And the scientist did not even know that the cattle had been introduced. It is a fig leaf of a justification. It has been pulled away, and the sight behind it is not pretty. The Victorian government is misusing science to deliver on a very blatant political deal. The minister's actions are to be commended and the regulation should stand.

"Windsor, Tony, MP",Ind.,2012-03-14,"



Mr WINDSOR
 (New England) (10:29):  Initially I was not going to speak on the motion moved by the member for Gippsland to disallow the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment Regulations 2011 (No. 1), but I have been quite interested to hear what a number of speakers have actually said and, in particular, what the member for Hume has said because I was in that parliament in 1992 when a number of those issues were raised. Enough time has passed to show that on some of the issues that were raised back then—and I would like to think I was one of those that raised those issues at that time—mistakes were made in land management. Even though this debate is about whether or not a cow should be allowed in a national park and whether or not the cow can actually have some impact on fires and biodiversity, I think the broader debate that does need to be had is the one about land use since Aboriginals—and the member for Hume touched on this. We have a landscape that has been based largely on interference by humans—those humans being, of course, Aboriginals. I think most of us would be aware of the Aboriginals' checker plate type of burning arrangements—which is what I think the member for Hume was talking about—to attract kangaroo and other animal activity for hunting purposes and also to preserve their own lives so that massive bushfires would not take place. As to whether the cow actually replaces the Aboriginal in these areas that we are talking about, I am not qualified to say, but I think we should have a very close look at it in considering our broader land management issues.


The member for Hume would remember all that. And we still have a time bomb ticking in the Blue Mountains, given the warning signals that have gone out. The groundcover and debris loads in parts of the Blue Mountains will eventually lead to absolute destruction of some of those areas, including the communities that live in them. All of us who sit in this place have heard, 'Let it return to nature; let nature take its course.' The nature that we are talking about has been created by humans—the Aboriginal people. Even though we neglect them in many ways, perhaps, before it is too late, we should consult with these people on how to manage some of these systems, because the very biodiversity that we are talking about has essentially been created by them. I have got such areas in my electorate, the Oxley Wild Rivers National Park. There have been debates, just as we had in the nineties in the New South Wales parliament—and I am sure they were carried out in other states as well—and arguments about lantana and blackberry control, as have been mentioned by various members today, and about what occurs as to the biodiversity and the weed and feral animal issues when you remove humans from that environment. Some suggest that if you leave it long enough it will all return to the way it was. It was a managed system in some sense and we are doing our best to take Aboriginals out of the landscape rather than putting them back into it. We cannot return it to the way it was, so in some sense this city based view that you do nothing—that is, let nature take its course—has a misguided objective.


The other instance that I would raise—and I know this might be a little bit outside the debate but I think it is pertinent to the wider land management debate—is the absolute desecration that is taking place in Central Australia as I speak. Because the majority of people do not go there—although I do; that is where I go on holidays, and it is magnificent country—they do not see the impact of feral camels and the climate change issues that are happening in some areas where in recent decades there has been more rain than in the past. That situation will not last forever. But there has been a massive explosion in camel numbers with massive destruction. I have had the pleasure of going up and down the Canning Stock Route a number of times and along many of the old desert tracks and whatever that are out there, and the destruction of natural waterholes and natural vegetation is just appalling. So I, here and now, make the plea that something has to be done. I know there are issues before the current government in terms of carbon farming initiatives and methane, so it could be by that or by direct bounty or vermin control. 


There has been a lot of preoccupation with this particular issue before us as to whether a cow is going to create the future or desecrate the future, but I think there are other issues out there that should be looked at much more closely. I think the city should start to pay some attention, because a lot of this is about politics. Whether it be National Party donations or the green vote, it is about politics rather than land management. From time to time the landowners who are park neighbours and whose land is plagued by a whole range of other things—the feral animals and weeds that come out of some of these areas—get a little bit burnt up about the way that politicians respond to some of the national park management issues.


Last night I happened to run into a great Australian. I refer to Keith Payne, whom I had met before and I think most people would know by name, so I do not have to describe who he is. He had flown into Canberra yesterday from Western Australia via Alice Springs, and I met him last night. I had not realised that he has been very involved with Aboriginal communities in feral animal control, particularly camels, and they had been out yesterday and had shot 457 camels. Keith made the plea, and I agree wholeheartedly with him, that we have to do something about this issue. Although people on this side of the chamber will probably disagree, I think carbon farming initiatives are probably the vehicle that should be used. But whether it is the carbon farming initiatives or something else we have to inject some funds into solving this problem. When that country dries up again, that is when the politics will kick in. If you have been in Docker River when it is dry and seen a mob of camels go through town, you will know that it is not a pleasant sight, because they take the toilet bowls with them. That is when the politics and the expense of repairing some of these desecrations will occur. 


I will be supporting the member for Gippsland's motion, not that I am a scientist in terms of this issue but because there are two broader issues that are crying out to be addressed here. The member for Melbourne is quite right: the Victorians spent a lot of money recently on a royal commission looking into fires. Fire management post Aboriginal occupation has to be examined. Some  people think that everything is just going to return to nature. It cannot. It would take thousands of years to get back to something that, possibly, looked like what was there before the fire-stick technology brought in by the Aboriginal people. They did not do that just to preserve the biodiversity; they did that to preserve themselves. 


We have all got some pristine and magnificent areas in our electorates. We have to make sure there is some degree of management in those systems to prevent the loss of life and the loss of that very diversity that we are all talking about saving.

Mr MITCHELL
 (McEwen) (10:39):  I rise today to support the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities against the motion moved by the member for Gippsland to disallow the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment Regulations 2011 (No. 1). I do so because, from what we have heard today, the facts seem to be far from the romantic view that those opposite are trying to put forward about cattle grazing. I was involved in the Victorian task force that ended the licences for cattle in the Alpine national parks. I actually spent time up there—days and weeks—with the cattlemen, with people whom I really admire, with people like Simon Turner and Harry Ryder, cattle producers, who are really good blokes. This is the thing that seems to be getting lost in the mystic romance put across by those on the other side. 




Mr McCormack:
  It's called heritage.




Mr MITCHELL:
  The member for Riverina yaps in and says, 'It's called heritage.' Mate, when was the last time you had a bushranger in Wagga Wagga, apart from you? We do not have that anymore. We have got to be serious about this. This is purely about cattle farmers. They are beef producers; they are not some romantic, mystic people that sit around the camp fire and sing. I have been through this before because I have sat in the chamber with some people who have been directly related to mountain cattlemen. 




Mr Schultz:
  You don't think history is relevant in this country?




Mr MITCHELL:
  History is very relevant—you are still sitting there; I consider you relevant. 




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr KJ Thomson
):  Order! Members on my left will cease interjecting. 




Mr MITCHELL:
  We went through this whole thing. At the end of the day we are talking about cattle farmers. That is what they are and that is what they do, and they do it pretty well. 


What this is about for the Nationals is protecting eight family farms. Now, thanks to the member for Gippsland admitting it, we find out that these are people who have contributed to National Party campaigns. The Nationals sit there and say, 'We've got to protect farmers.' Why would you protect eight farmers at the cost of everyone else? During the 12 years of drought in Victoria, where people were paying an absolute fortune—hundreds of dollars a week—to get agistment to keep their cattle farms going, to keep themselves in business and to keep themselves going, eight families, including those directly related to the Victorian Premier, were allowed to agist their cattle on public land for $5 a season, for 16 to 20 weeks. While everyone else was going out the back door, going broke in the middle of a drought, a select handful of people on hereditary licences were virtually given a taxpayer funded agistment, and it was wrong. It was wrong then and it is wrong now. 


The Victorian task force I was on travelled everywhere, from Wonnangatta Station right up through the Bogong High Plains, right through Victoria's high country. We went and had a look at things. I am sure the minister will agree: I am probably not the greenest person in this place; I am probably the brownest one on our side. When I first became a member of that task force, I said, 'What are we doing this for?' By the end of the four or five weeks we spent up there, it was clear as day that some of the issues caused by cattle in the high country were such that we could not morally stand by and let them happen. 


We spent days walking through the high country. There were places up there with sphagnum moss in the bogs. We came across two bogs that were not affected by cattle. Cattle are pretty heavy. They have got small feet and they punch a hole straight through the moss. This moss is used to filter the water that goes into our rivers—the water that we use to drink and to live off. When the snow melts and it rushes, the moss that is punctured gets pushed away. It takes many, many years for it to grow. It acts like a sponge to filter the water. The name of the grass in the bogs escapes me, but every person we met—the environmentalists, the cattlemen—all said the same thing: this particular grass that grows in the bog is like chocolate to cattle. They love it. They cannot get enough of it. So they are prepared to go through the bog to get to this grass. In doing so, they wreck the bog, which then wrecks the filter system for the waters that flow into our rivers. As I said, we saw only two that were not affected by cattle. I actually kept the photos because I had never seen a pristine one before. It is something that I still keep, because it is an amazing sight. They are beautiful places that should be enjoyed by more people, not locked up for access by a small number of people. 


We also looked at environmental issues. We looked at the native grasses, the introduced grasses, the weeds and pests. Guess how the weeds got up there? 


Most of the weeds in the cattle grazing area have got up there because they are driven up there and dropped off. We are not talking about the men from Snowy River who herd their cattle up there on horseback over five days; the grasses that are eaten elsewhere are taken up the mountains when the cattle do their droppings. By the way, this is how the Victorian government does scientific experiments to know what the impact is—they are out there counting cattle dung. That is their scientific experiment. It is just an absolute joke. So all those weeds that come in, they are in the cattle droppings and they spread through these areas and include things like blackberries and couch grass. They are up there and they are not native to high country ecosystems.


I also want to talk about the fires because this has been an interesting one. We get this romantic view of 'cattle grazing reduces blazing'. But not one cow would eat bark, twigs or leaves, which is what causes the fuel load, which is what causes the intensity. I know this because—it is a pity the member for Hume is not here—I sat through the hearings on the 2003 alpine fires where parts of the cattle-grazed area were burnt and parts were not, and parts in the areas that were untouched were burnt and other parts were not. Things like weather conditions, including the wind conditions, caused the changes in the fire. Not one person, including the people from the CFA or environmentalists, agreed that cattle grazing reduces blazing. Cattle eat grass. Grass does burn with the same intensity as twigs, bark, fallen trees and all those things. So the theory that cattle grazing reduces blazing is just quite simply rubbish because it does not. It was proven it does not and you cannot run that argument seriously and say, 'Look, I'm being honest, hand on heart, this is what it is about'.


This is about the protection of eight families. That is all it is about. If you want to be fair to farmers and give them all a fair go, you would not allow eight farmers to go through drought conditions and fatten up their cows and get top prices while every other farmer on the low plains and on the low ground is getting nothing for their animals and going out the back door and relying on drought support. You cannot do that. Rather than having a hereditary license in which you have to marry in to get one, we looked at whether it is an option to the auction them off. This was quickly dismissed both by the mountain cattlemen and by us because people would go up there and do as much as they could to get as much as they could out of the grass.


In the end it was a decision that was made looking at things such as ecology, fire, cattle and heritage. We looked at a whole range of things and came to the conclusion that cattle grazing was not compatible with a national park. We concluded that it was not compatible with the native flora and fauna that is up there or with other users of the national park. The state government then offered the cattlemen more state forest land, extra amounts of land to use for grazing. But they said no. It was either all or nothing, so they got nothing. We went out of our way to help them; we tried to keep things going. It is not ending the tradition. It is not ending the heritage. There are still high plains up there in state forests that get grazed all the time and there is no problem with that. But this is about the use of the national park, which is not compatible with cattle grazing.


The other thing that seems to have been overlooked is that the cattlemen received $5 million in compensation from the Victorian taxpayers. That is a more than generous amount of money, but now, because of direct relatives of the Premier and friends of the National Party, they are back in there. Where is the money? Did they give the money back? No. According to the member for Gippsland, they financed National Party campaigns with it. That is absolutely wrong. You cannot stand there and say, 'We're doing the right thing'.



Mr Chester interjecting—




Mr MITCHELL:
  You basically have said that they paid for their opinion to be heard.




Mr Chester:
  On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker: I ask the member to withdraw.




Mr MITCHELL:
  For what?




Mr Chester:
  The suggestion that a member's vote can be bought by political donations.




Mr MITCHELL:
  I will withdraw if it makes you happy, but I would just ask you to read your own Hansard later and tell me if I am wrong.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member for McEwen might assist the House by simply withdrawing.




Mr MITCHELL:
  I will withdraw again. When we look at this issue before us today, quite clearly it is about mates and not about national parks or about ecology. We know that cattle damage moss beds, which are very fragile. Cattle pollute waterways and create tracks. We saw an example of this during the time we spent up there with the cattlemen and the environmentalists—and this is going to be a good slap at environmentalists. A cow had died in a bog and it was decomposing. It affected the bog. The environmentalists were very quick to say: 'Look, the cow's died in a bog. It's bad.' But at no time did any of them think: 'You know what? We should remove that and protect the environment'. No, they slapped the cattlemen. I brought it to their attention and said: ""Well, this is rubbish. If this is so important, why wouldn't you just remove the carcass?' That was the right thing to do, to remove it and to ensure that it did not impact any further on the moss beds. But what if we take away all the arguments that have been put forward by those opposite and sit down and ask: 'What's important? What do we want from the national park?' We want it to be open for a lot of users, for a lot of people to use it and to use it freely.


A fellow that the member for Gippsland and I both know, Mr Devers, will tell you about the time he was chased by cattle through the park when he was bushwalking. Mr Devers is a very good bushwalker and also does alpine rescues. You cannot go to the areas that are okay to camp in because of the cowpats that are everywhere. We have to use it for as many purposes as possible. This includes Wonnangatta Station. I went there and I remember hearing, 'Have a look at it, it's a mess'. If you looked at it as a paddock to put your cows in to graze then it probably did look a mess. But if you looked at the native grasses that were growing there, the kangaroo paw et cetera, in their native environment it was looked pristine. We do not lock people out of there. There is a place there called the widow-maker where the four-wheel drivers go up and down. That is part of it. There are bush tracks for people to walk through and huts for people to stay in when they go fishing and camping.




Mr Christensen:
  Four-wheel drives but not cows.




Mr MITCHELL:
  The honourable member says 'Four-wheel drives, not cows' but there are four-wheel drive tracks in the national parks and there have been for a long time. I am sure someone like yourself has probably never been in one and would not understand that. It is about ensuring that you get a balance for all users and not lock up lots and lots of areas just for eight families to protect their interests. I know the member for Gippsland is on the charge for his buddies down there but the reality is that he is wrong. This motion is wrong and the minister is right that we do not take steps backwards and turn a national park into a private farm for a handful of graziers.

Mr CHRISTENSEN
 (Dawson) (10:53):  What a disgraceful performance we have just heard from the member for McEwen, repeating the allegations made by the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities and also by his Greens mate, the member for Melbourne, disparaging graziers in Victoria, claiming that these guys had bribed the National Party to give them—



Mr Mitchell interjecting—




Mr CHRISTENSEN:
  No, that is what you said, mate. You stand by those comments, and the minister can too. You made the claim that graziers had bribed the National Party to get this outcome, to get this trial.




Mr Mitchell:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, I have a point of order. The member for Dawson has just made an outrageous allegation and I ask him to withdraw.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr KJ Thomson
):  It would assist the House if the member for Dawson would withdraw.




Mr CHRISTENSEN:
  I withdraw, Mr Deputy Speaker, but what has been said here, particularly by the minister and by the member for McEwen, flies in the face of not only the reality of natural resource management but also what the minister's department is approving elsewhere. I will tell a little of what is going on in my electorate at Wongaloo Station. Wongaloo Station has been bought and now is being looked after by a private foundation called the Wetlands and Grasslands Foundation because, basically, it is North Queensland's Kakadu. We have an area there which is second to none for its wetlands—the Cromarty wetlands, the bird life and the wildlife that all comes to that area. The bloke who is pushing for Cromarty wetlands to be established as Wongaloo conservation park is a former state Nationals MP, Mark Stoneman, who is a great practical environmentalist. He is the chairman of the natural resource management group up there, NQ Dry Tropics. As the member for Riverina says, most National Party people are great environmentalists and, again, most farmers are also great practical environmentalists. Mark Stoneman is no different. He has been pushing the establishment of the Wongaloo conservation park for some time. The end result will be management of that property by the Wetlands and Grasslands Foundation as a conservation park. There is currently a lot of research going into this. It has been done with the minister's support when the member for Kingsford-Smith was the Minister for Environment, Heritage and the Arts. Some time ago he went to Townsville, in that region, and gave $1.79 million in federal funding to help purchase the wetlands for the Wetlands and Grasslands Foundation to set this place up as a conservation park. There have been ongoing discussions between the Wetlands and Grasslands Foundation and the federal Department of Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities on this. One of the key principles that they are looking into up there, with the department's support, is the retention of cattle grazing as a control against the intrusion of exotic weeds—in an area aimed at being set up as a conservation park.


Now we have the minister arguing in here against what they want to do in one state—to have cattle grazing to stop noxious weeds and to see what other outcomes that that might achieve—and has been done in that part of the world for many a year, longer than the Labor Party has been in existence, longer than the Greens have been bleating. The people there have a definite heritage in that area. Yet, up in North Queensland, the federal department is facilitating the same outcome to get environmental results.


As I said, a lot of research has gone into the benefits of continuing grazing. The Wetlands and Grasslands Foundation, with the cooperation of the federal environment department, is getting that research and monitoring so that it can be used by other people who want to set up conservation parks around Australia. It is just unbelievable that the minister is here advocating that something should not happen in Victoria while his department is facilitating it in North Queensland. I have been down there to Wongaloo and the Cromarty wetlands and I have seen that the cattle that are grazing in certain areas there have nearly eradicated the noxious weeks, and there are plenty of them—182 different species of weeds in that area which cause real damage to the native flora.


Then I go to the areas inside that wetlands, inside the proposed conservation park, where there is no cattle grazing permitted. Do you know what I see? Feral pigs, everywhere, chewing on the weeds and running rampant. That damages not only native flora but also native fauna. If we look across Queensland's national parks—there are plenty in my area; for instance, Eungella National Park—the management of those national parks is so poor that farmers have to invest in stopping feral pigs, wild dogs and other feral animals from coming into their properties from the national parks. Again, I am just astounded that the minister's department is supporting an approach in North Queensland while in this chamber the minister says that approach is no go in Victoria. Even more disgraceful are these repeated comments, without any proof, that graziers have funded a political party in order to get a specific outcome—that being this trial of cattle grazing in Victorian national parks. 


Surely the cattlemen in this country have copped enough from this Gillard Labor government. We went through the live export debacle, which they stuffed up in every way possible—almost bringing the entire North Queensland cattle industry to its knees. Now we have a carbon tax which will increase input costs for farmers everywhere around Australia, including for the Victorian graziers. On top of that, the carbon tax will drive costs for abattoirs higher, so the abattoirs will seek to reduce the number of cattle which go through in order to get their carbon emissions down. That is going to have an impact on graziers as well. Now here is another hit. 


What is it all about? I can tell you what it is about: it is about the Greens. It is about the fact that this government has a written alliance with the Greens. They are dancing to the tune of the Greens once again. We have seen it up in North Queensland. Pressure was put on the state government to introduce reef regulations which impact on cane farmers. They have to complete a bunch of paperwork, test which way the wind is blowing and obtain information that even the Bureau of Meteorology would probably not have before they are able to use fertiliser and herbicide on their farms. The federal government is now pushing to lock up fishing waters in North Queensland. Commercial and recreational fishing will both suffer. This Labor government is again dancing to the tune of the Greens.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr KJ Thomson
):  The member for Dawson is a long way from the motion. It would assist the House if he were to return to the motion.




Mr CHRISTENSEN:
  I will return to the motion. But we are seeing a consistent approach to policy around the nation—the government dancing to the tune of the Greens. Whether it is locking up sections of the Coral Sea, whether it is requiring farmers to fill in heaps and heaps of paperwork just to undertake normal farming practices or whether it is knocking Abbot Point on the head for another six, seven or eight months—bringing it to two years—all of this stuff is just dancing to the tune of the Greens, and this regulation is as well. The minister should be ashamed of the comments he has made in this place.

"Sidebottom, Sid, MP",ALP,2012-03-14,"



Mr SIDEBOTTOM
 (Braddon—Parliamentary Secretary for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry) (11:02):  It gives me great pleasure to support those on this side by rising to speak on the motion proposed by the member for Gippsland to disallow regulations under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. Grazing of domestic stock within the Australian Alps national parks and reserves, which are on the National Heritage List, has a significant impact on the listed values of those places. The Australian alps are one of Australia's unique landscapes, as has been eloquently agreed by all members who have spoken on this disallowance motion this morning. The alps are listed under the national environment law, the EPBC Act, to protect this area of great national significance. 


Over the summer of 2010-11, the new Liberal-National Party government in Victoria quietly reintroduced cattle to the Alpine National Park in Victoria under the guise of a so-called scientific research trial. That has been very clearly covered by the minister, by members on this side and by some of the Independents and the Greens. The Victorian government took that action without first submitting their proposal to the federal government for assessment under the national environmental law to determine if any ecological areas would be impacted by their actions. The minister made it very clear, very early, that the Baillieu government were wrong to reintroduce cattle to the Alpine National Park and that, in doing so, they had set a dangerous precedent for the management of national parks across Australia. That is why this government last year made regulatory changes which formally recognised the significant impact of livestock grazing on the National Heritage values, listed under the EPBC Act, of the Australian alps national parks and reserves. 


The regulation specifies that grazing of domestic stock, including cattle, could have a significant impact on the heritage values of the Australian alps National Heritage area and that any future new grazing activities proposed in the Australian alps National Heritage area, including the Alpine National Park, needed to be assessed under the EPBC Act. The minister made that statement last year in introducing the regulation. He has again today eloquently and forcefully given the rationale and reasoning behind that regulation, as have others on this side and others in this place. That is why I was quite prepared to support the minister in opposing this disallowance motion. I think that all in this House should now say where they stand on this important principle of whether you protect your national parks or you do not. We on this side do.

"McCormack, Michael, MP",Nats,2012-03-14,"



Mr McCORMACK
 (Riverina) (11:06):  I was most impressed to see the passion shown by the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities on this issue of cattle grazing in the Australian alps. I look forward to him showing exactly the same passion and commitment when he brings about a triple-bottom-line approach in the Murray-Darling Basin plan and ensures that we have social, economic and environmental outcomes considered in any water policy in this nation. He showed a lot of passion today. I look forward to him showing the same passion on that issue.


This disallowance motion comes about because, as is evident, the Greens are running the show. Labor might be in power but the Greens are running the show. The cattle will not be tearing up the bush as Labor and the Greens would have people believe. The Greens would like to see the national parks locked up. They are anti everything Australians cherish about the great outdoors. If the Greens get away with this and our national parks are locked up they will be left for feral animals to rule and noxious weeds to take over. With all the litter left lying around it would take just one spark for Black Saturday—those terrible, dreadful, horrific Victorian bushfires—to be repeated, and no-one wants to see that. The Greens, and others, are opposed to grazing but grazing reduces the litter load. Grazing reduces the risk of terrible bushfires. This disallowance motion is necessary because the Greens are running the show. Stockmen have grazed cattle in the Victorian alpine country for decades—more than 150 years. They have managed the high country ecosystems over this period. Only recently has it been decided that grazing should not continue—and why? Because we have a green agenda running this country. This alpine country was open up by stout-hearted stockmen, the mighty men of the Snowy River, on their horses. Now the brumbies run free, and I have no doubt the Greens want to get rid of them too. 


This issue has been very much in the news since 2005 when the Bracks Labor government banned cattle grazing in Victoria's Alpine National Park in response to ongoing lobbying from environmental groups. The ban was overturned in January 2011 when the Baillieu coalition government, newly elected by the people—and this was very much an issue at the forefront of that election—reintroduced cattle to the estate for a short-term grazing trial, the first annual stage of a planned five-year project designed to ascertain whether grazing lowers bushfire risk by reducing fuel loads. The move attracted the ire of the minister at the table, Minister Burke, who pushed a special regulation through federal parliament to prevent the Victorian government from allowing cattle to re-enter for the second year of the trial. At the same time, the minister wrote to his state counterparts advising that the federal government was seeking greater control of Australia's 500 national parks, which are currently controlled by state governments. Citing the devastating nature of bushfires, the Victorian government asked the federal government to reconsider the importance of the trial as a bushfire mitigation tool. The federal minister responded by saying the move would have a 'clearly unacceptable' impact on the National Heritage values of the park estate. The minister's actions are based on a green desire to lock up vast tracts of country and to return them to complete wilderness. Mark Coleman, a third generation mountain cattleman and president of the Mountain Cattlemens Association of Victoria, said:


The concept may work in a rain forest in the Amazon or somewhere, where nature will take its course, but not here where I am standing in Victoria which is one of the most bushfire prone areas of the world.


Aboriginal people have managed the alpine landscape with firestick farming for tens of thousands of years and mountain cattlemen have continued similar management practices by burning patches of country every autumn. Cattlemen took a $100 million hit last year from Labor's live cattle export fiasco. They do not need to keep taking green hits from this government. Particularly in this, the Australian Year of the Farmer, farmers do not need to continue to be deterred by this government.


The member for McEwen speaks of bushrangers. Had a certain MP on that side of the House said 'Bail up! There will be a carbon tax under the government I lead', maybe—just maybe—we would not be having this discussion this morning.

"Chester, Darren, MP",Nats,2012-03-14,"



Mr CHESTER
 (Gippsland) (11:11):  In concluding this debate, may I say this has been an excellent debate and I congratulate all members who have spoken, including the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities and the Parliamentary Secretary for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, and the members for Hume, Hinkler, Melbourne, McEwen, New England, Dawson and the Riverina. What we have seen this morning is proof of the passion that issues of natural resource management still generate in this place and, in particular, the passion that the issue of the mountain cattlemen generates. I thank all members for their contributions, even those I do not necessarily agree with, and for the way they took on this debate and raised their points of view.


I want particularly to comment on the member for McMillan's contribution. The member for McMillan spoke very eloquently about the cultural heritage of the mountain cattlemen that we are talking about today. He made a very important contribution regarding what direction we are going to take in natural resource management in this country in the future—whether we are going to recognise that active land management involving people on the ground is the way forward for natural resource management, rather than the 'lock it up and leave it' approach which has been dictated by governments in various jurisdictions in recent times.


At the outset I pleaded with the minister to show respect. He tried hard but he did, in the end, whip himself into an indignant frenzy about whether or not it was appropriate for the mountain cattlemen to make a donation to a political party. I encouraged him to give it his best shot and he certainly did. Unfortunately, in the minister's attack he suggested quite strongly—and I hope this was not his intention—that there was some kind of ulterior motive involved behind the mountain cattlemen making a donation to a political party in an open and transparent manner. I hope that is not what he was intending to say, but that is what it sounded like when he was speaking. He was imputing improper motives to members of the National Party and in doing so he was showing enormous disrespect to the cattlemen. As I said in my comments to the House, quite clearly and in a very open and transparent manner—and the minister congratulated me for my honesty—the Liberal Party and the National Party had pre-existing policies relating to the mountain cattlemen well before the 2010 election. It is spurious and it is a red herring to try to link the two and suggest there is some level of cash for comment, as the minister himself did, and as the member for McEwen did later on. I do not think that either member covered themselves in glory by trying to suggest there is some sort of ulterior motive on the part of either the members involved or the cattlemen themselves. 


For the record, in answer to the member for McEwen's comment that I am 'on the charge for my buddies', I just want to say that I have no financial interest whatsoever in this issue and it is wrong to suggest that my opinion on this issue has been influenced in any way by friendships or financial donations to me or my party. I think you are wrong to make that suggestion. It was inappropriate and I took exception to the comment. Hence, I raised a point of order when the opportunity presented itself to me.


The minister said that the Labor Party is proud of its record on this issue. The fact is that the state Labor government kicked the cattlemen out of the high country on the back of a dodgy inquiry with preordained recommendations. When the high country burns next time and lives are lost, property is destroyed and native animals are scorched, I wonder whether members opposite are still going to be proud of their approach to the issue and the issue of natural resource management more generally.


Natural resource management in this nation is heading in the wrong direction. The member for Hume spoke about this. The member for New England also spoke very eloquently about this issue. We are going down the wrong path when it comes to natural resource management. 'Lock it up and leave it' is not an environmental policy; it is a recipe for disaster. This is the path we are heading down. If we follow the Greens down this ideological path, we will destroy this great environment that we have all stood here today and said we cherish. 'Lock it up and leave it' is not an environmental policy.


I welcome the vote today, just as the minister himself said he will welcome the vote, because we will put on the record where we all stand on this very important issue. The minister is nodding his head. I think it is important that members get to vote today on where they stand on this very important issue of natural resource management and whether they believe in practical and active land management. On this side when we vote today we will be demonstrating our respect for the Victorian coalition government and the mandate it received in 2010. We will also be respecting the mountain cattlemen and their families and their more than 150 years of active management of the high country. We will also be respecting the role mountain cattlemen can play in reducing the fuel load and in sustainable environmental management through grazing and prescribed burns. We will also be respecting the heritage of regional communities on both sides of the Great Dividing Range in Victoria.


The member for McEwen asked the question: who is Doug Treasure? Doug was a former President of the Mountain Cattlemen's Association of Victoria. Doug died this year. Doug campaigned for many years on behalf of his constituents in the Mountain Cattlemen's Association. Doug was a great man. He lived in Stratford and made an enormous contribution to active land management through his role with the Mountain Cattlemen's Association of Victoria. I assume that the member for McEwen just wanted to know who Doug Treasure was. That is who Doug Treasure was. Doug was a tremendous man who made a great contribution. He passed away earlier this year, and we in this place send our love to his family.


Today, in voting for this motion, we will demonstrate our respect for regional Australians and how they choose to live their lives. I thank the House.

That the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment Regulations 2011 (No. 1), as contained in the Select Legislative Instrument 2011 No. 191, and made under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999, be disallowed.


I appreciate the opportunity to debate this motion today. The motion of disallowance I have moved and which will be seconded by the member for McMillan is all about respecting the mandate given to the Victorian coalition government at the last state election. It is about respecting the mountain cattlemen and their families for the more than 150 years of active management of the high country.



Mr Mitchell interjecting—




Mr CHESTER:
  Already the member for McEwen is interjecting. I ask the member for McEwen to listen for a few moments to what I am about to say and to show a little bit of respect for the mountain cattlemen.




The SPEAKER:
  The member for Gippsland will return to the motion and the honourable member opposite will desist.




Mr CHESTER:
  It is also about respecting the role the cattlemen can play in the future of sustainable environmental management through grazing and prescribed burns and about respecting the heritage of regional communities on both sides of the Great Dividing Range in Victoria. Given the huge deficit of trust that exists between this government and the Australian people, now would be a very good time to start showing some respect in this place for these people.


The Victorian government took a clear policy to the state election in 2010 that it would reintroduce cattle grazing to the Alpine National Park. The only thing the Victorian government has been guilty of is honouring that promise—the promise they made to the Victorian people that they would reintroduce cattle grazing to the Alpine National Park. There was strong support given to coalition candidates on both sides of the Great Dividing Range on this issue. It was a significant issue in the seat of Gippsland East, where I was involved in campaigning because it interacts with my own seat of Gippsland. I am not going to overstate the importance of the issue but it was a significant issue. It was certainly one that was raised in community debates and in various forums during the campaign process. The mountain cattlemen themselves invested heavily in that election campaign. I understand they made donations to the Liberal Party and to the Nationals in that election campaign in the order of $20,000. I could be corrected on that. So the mountain cattlemen themselves thought this was important enough to support candidates in that campaign and to support the issue.



Mr Mitchell interjecting—




Mr CHESTER:
  The member for McEwen cannot help himself on this issue. He is talking about cash for comment. What he does not understand is this has been a long-held belief in the coalition parties in Victoria. It is not about cash for comment, member for McEwen; it is all about making sure that people who want their voice heard in this place have the chance to have their voice heard, and that is why today is very important. It is a very good opportunity for the people of Gippsland East and other state seats to have their voice heard in this place.


You would think that the Australian Labor Party would learn some lessons from the past on the issue of cattle grazing in the Alpine National Park because this issue has a very dark and murky political background for the Australian Labor Party. It goes back to 2005 when the former Bracks government first banned the cattlemen from the high country. On that occasion we had the memorable scenes of mountain cattlemen and other supporters of their cause marching through the main streets of Melbourne. They were marching up Bourke Street on their horses, wearing their Driza-Bones, bringing the issue to the state parliament of Victoria. They brought attention on the steps of parliament in Spring Street to what they thought was a great injustice. That caused an immediate political backlash to the state Labor government at the 2006 state election. The Victorian Labor Party lost the seat of Morwell, which is in the Gippsland area, and lost the seat of Narracan, also in the Gippsland area. Again, I am not saying this was the only reason they lost those seats but it was a pivotal issue in the campaign. When you consider that the member for Narracan was the chairman of the committee which recommended that cattlemen get kicked out of the high country in the first place, you can understand the point that I am making.


The Australian Labor Party has already paid a political price for its attitude to the cattlemen in Victoria. I can tell you now, it will pay an even heavier political price in the future if it continues to go down this track of showing no respect for the mandate given to the Victorian government by the voters of Victoria. The people have spoken clearly on this issue and their voice needs to be heard in this place. I acknowledge it is not a unanimous view but there is a strong majority in the directly affected communities that have given the Victorian government a mandate for its policy, and I believe it should be respected.


I recognise that this is not an issue which is necessarily at the front of mind for all other members of parliament. There are 150 seats around Australia and there are probably only a handful of seats which are directly affected by this issue. But where this issue has been tested in the court of public opinion, where the contest of ideas has taken place on the ground, overwhelmingly the position adopted by the Australian Labor Party and the Greens has been rejected by the people in those communities. In those areas where people are most directly affected and have the most information about how this issue plays out in a community and a political sense, they have rejected the Australian Labor Party and the Greens. You only need to travel around regional Victoria on any given day to see vehicles with yellow and green stickers on the back of them that read 'Mountain cattlemen care for the high country'. That slogan has been around for more than 20 years. It is a strongly held view in the communities that are directly affected by this issue


The contention that I am putting to the House today is that the Victorian government has every right to commission a trial into the strategic use of cattle grazing to reduce the impact of bushfires. This is a region that has been devastated by bushfires in the past; there is no doubt it will be affected again in the future. We have an obligation as members of parliament, both in this place and in state jurisdictions, to do everything we can to reduce the impact of fires on lives, property and the natural environment. I consider this issue to be another example of the grand hypocrisy of the Greens on natural resource management issues. The Greens leader travels around Australia campaigning for territory rights because it might assist in his campaigns to install gay marriage and euthanasia, but he is happy to trample on state government rights on this natural resource management issue.


We should be used to that level of hypocrisy, because the Greens have proposed a bill previously in this place targeted squarely at removing the rights of the Victorian government to take action to assess the strategic use of cattle grazing as a tool to reduce bushfire risk in Victoria's high country. The thing that most offends the people who live in these communities and that most offends me is that when the Greens put out these motions from the leafy suburbs of Melbourne they do not talk about the thousands of brumbies, the introduced wild species like deer, the wild dogs or the noxious weeds that are in the Alpine National Park and that should be targeted by any bills or motions the Greens would like to propose to assist the environment in the Alpine region. The Greens do not even seem to understand that the scorching bushfires in areas which have not been grazed and which have not benefited from prescribed burning are more devastating to wildlife than anything the mountain cattlemen have ever done in more than 150 years in the alpine regions.


To put it very simply, regional Australians have had a gutful of city based Greens telling them how to live their lives. Now we have a Sydney based minister for the environment who simply joins in the chorus and sings the same songs as the Australian Greens. The Greens have never created a job in regional Australia and they are a direct threat to a host of our traditional industries, including the cattlemen, the broader agricultural sector, commercial fishing, mining and power generation and recreational angling. The action taken by this minister to override the Victorian government on this issue demonstrates this government's complete lack of respect for regional Australians. I am sure that we will hear today all the usual lines from the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities. He will say that a national park is not a farm and that only a select few graziers get to use the high country runs. We have heard all the lines before; I look forward to them being rolled out again today. To that I say in advance to the minister: a national park is not meant to be a weed infested wasteland either. It is not meant to be scorched every few years because we have failed to reduce the fuel load. A national park is not meant to be full of feral species in uncontrolled numbers. The minister failed to mention those issues when he first started attacking mountain cattlemen. I concede that in more recent times the minister has raised those issues. I think he has realised the folly of his ways from those early days when he first ran his campaign against the mountain cattlemen and now he does talk more about the weeds and other feral species. But I urge the minister to concentrate on those issues, because they are doing far more damage and are of much greater environmental significance to the alpine region than anything that mountain cattlemen have done in the past or will do in the future. If the minister wanted to do something that was actually important for the Alpine National Park, and the Victorian high country more generally, he could really focus his efforts in that area. I urge all members in this place not to vilify the mountain cattlemen and their families.


The minister and I get along quite well, and I do not mind if he attacks me. I do not mind if he criticises my party and me, if he gives me heaps. I just urge him to show a great deal of respect to the people that are represented in this debate today. I urge him to show some respect for the cattlemen, because every time a member in this place attacks the cattlemen it is very personal for these people and their families. When anyone in this place says to these people, 'You are wrong,' they are actually saying their fathers were wrong, their grandfathers were wrong and even, sometimes, their great-grandfathers were wrong. You are denying their whole cultural heritage. So by all means, Minister, give me your best shot, and I am sure you will—you need no encouragement; you have needed no encouragement in the past—but I urge you to respect the families and their culture and their heritage, because they are very proud of that heritage. They believe that they have done a great job in the alpine region, that they are part of the solution for the future and that they should not be thrown out like yesterday's newspaper.


We are talking about a state government trial of cattle grazing involving just 400 cattle in a 26,000-hectare national park. The point that must be remembered throughout this whole debate is that the cattlemen have run cattle in that region for more than 150 years. It was only after the cattle had been there for more than 150 years that it was deemed to be in such pristine condition that it was worthy of becoming a national park in the first place. In the mid-1980s the wise heads of the day decided that this region was so pristine and so magnificent that, even after 150 years of mountain cattlemen using the territory, it was so good they could make it a national park. That to me is the core of the issue. There was not a level of environmental damage that warranted any other action being taken by the governments of the day. They believed on merit that the alpine region was in such good condition that it should become a national park. I contend that the minister himself did more damage to the region when he rushed up the hill on a wet day in his four-wheel-drive to get his photo taken in front of a deer wallow. I contend that he did more damage then than the mountain cattlemen would do under this trial of 400 cattle spread across 26,000 hectares of national park.


There is generations of knowledge about practical environmental management in the hands of the mountain cattlemen and their families. This is knowledge that you cannot learn in a book; it is knowledge that has been passed down from one generation to the next. I believe it deserves to be respected and passed on to future generations. I believe that grazing can actually help to reduce the fuel load in the alpine region, particularly if it is used in a strategic manner in conjunction with other fuel mitigation efforts.


In the past, the mountain cattlemen have not just relied on grazing as their approach to reducing the impact of bushfires; they have also been heavily involved in prescribed burning. I think we have lost our way in relation to prescribed burning in Victoria and in many other parts of Australia over the last several decades. We have seen in more recent times a government in Victoria that is more committed to reducing the fuel load. Part of the reason for the devastation of the Black Saturday bushfires is that we did not do the prescribed burning that we needed to do in the decades leading up to it. We had a massive amount of fuel build up in many parts of Victoria, and that led to the devastation. We need three things for a fire. We need hot and windy conditions, and we are always going to get that in Victoria because it is a fire prone area. We need a point of ignition, and we are always going to have that—whether it is a lightning strike or some idiot with a match, that is going to happen. We need a fuel load, and there is always going to be fuel. The only part of that fire matrix we can actually affect is the fuel load. We are always going to have hot, windy days and we are always going to have a point of ignition. But we can reduce the fuel load and reduce the intensity of those bushfires when they occur—and they will occur again.


This is all about using cattle in a strategic way to reduce the impact of future bushfires. Those opposite will say it does not work. But, as I have told the House previously, even the ACT Labor government agrees to the approach of using cattle in a strategic way to reduce the impact of bushfires. This year the ACT government intends to graze more than 7,000 hectares across 76 sites to protect ACT residents from bushfires. Let me say that again. The ACT government believes cattle grazing does play a worthwhile role in reducing the fuel load in the ACT to protect property and lives around the ACT, so they are going to use cattle across 7,000 hectares at 76 different sites to protect ACT residents. But we are not allowed to use cattle to protect lives and property in the natural environment of the high country because this minister and this government are directly overriding the Victorian state government and they are directly overriding the clear mandate that government received from the Victorian people.


I do not expect those opposite us in the chamber today to change their mind. It is no surprise to me at all that they will vote against this disallowance motion and do the bidding of the Australian Greens—and they will pay an electoral price for that in the future. The reason I do not expect them to change their mind is that more than 40 of the members opposite actually rely on Greens preferences for their political survival. They need Greens preferences to win their seats, so they will do whatever is necessary to protect their political careers. But I appeal to the crossbenchers to think very seriously about this issue and give due respect to the mountain cattlemen and their cause. I repeat that, for more than 150 years, the mountain cattlemen have been allowed to run their cattle in the high country and they have actively worked to protect and enhance the environment. They are not the problem; they are part of the solution. The heritage, the culture and the knowledge of the mountain cattlemen, which has been built up over more than 150 years, is an asset to our community and they should be respected, not vilified, by the Labor Party and the Greens in this place. I thank the House for the opportunity to raise this important issue and I again urge the crossbenchers to think very seriously about what we are talking about today in relation to the future of the alpine region and the practical land management skills that have been applied for more than 150 years.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Hon. BC Scott
):  Is the motion seconded?

",HoR,<title>MOTIONS</title>,<title>Disallowance</title>,MOTIONS,3,2
"Broadbent, Russell, MP",LP,2012-03-14,"



Mr BROADBENT
 (McMillan) (09:40):  I second the motion. On Sunday morning my radio is sometimes still on ABC. Macca was on, and they had a school from the high country reciting a poem. The poem was, 'There was movement at the station for the word had got around that the colt from old Regret had got away.' So the kids say, 'We all went around and rounded him up.' That was their poem. I found myself, fortuitously, filling in for my friend and colleague the member for Gippsland at the high country cattlemen's muster at Merrijig in January. It was a pleasure to be at Merrijig and I must admit I was consumed by the points they put to us that day. I have supported minority positions in this place on many occasions before, even against my own party's position when in government. At Merrijig I found myself surrounded by this minority of Australian people and I thought very carefully about why I would support this disallowance motion. It is not something I am here to support just because Darren Chester is my mate; I am here to support the feelings those people communicated to me that day. They gave me all the information about what the park has been like over its 150 years of heritage. 


For those who are listening to this address, I want to explain that I am trying to woo the minister to my point of view and I am trying to do it in a practical way. I hear the message that this is a political position taken by the government and the Greens, through the member for Melbourne, who is sitting in the chamber. I fully acknowledge that I too have done checks on the number of members of this parliament who are here on Greens preferences. Nearly half of the Labor Party members here are in marginal seats on Greens preferences. I have looked at all those figures too, and I understand where they are coming from.


So we bring forward an issue of practicality and relevance to a minority group of people in Australia that is part of our national heritage. We have not got a lot to hang our hat on in this country. It is mostly English heritage that we were taught at school; those were our early lessons. But what consumed me that day at Merrijig was that here was our own living history. Forget about the feral animals, the wild dogs, the blackberries that have gone berserk and the parts of the park that you can no longer get into—and that is across this nation. It is a disgrace the way we have nominated these places as national parks and then governments of all persuasions have not looked after them as they should have—and that is not just in Victoria but elsewhere too. Having said that, I recognise that we have something so precious in our living heritage as the rich history of these mountain cattlemen and their families and the amazing stories that surround them of battling against all odds as part of our nation's growth and history for 140 years. Can you imagine any country in the world turning their backs on the heritage such as we have, which is a gift? Can you imagine the Americans turning their back on this? No. But we as a nation are so consumed by the politics of the day, and we know politicians hate short-term pain that may lead to long-term gain. They hate it. They do not like any sort of political pain whatsoever.


But why can't somebody stand up in this place and say, 'This is a minority of people who have a grand heritage in this country and who we should all speak about with some pride and reverence'? At the same time, we are prepared to say no. Because of the green influence in our capital cities and the green influence of the members of parliament that sit in here, we are prepared to throw these people out of the high country. The message that I received was that parts that were pristine are no longer pristine. Parts that were of great value for our community to go and enjoy are no longer available for our community because they are a mess, inaccessible and covered in blackberries, and what was beautiful is no longer beautiful.


Have I been up there? No. Do I know about it from friends? Yes. Did I drive the wrong way home? Yes, and I would not recommend that trip to anybody, but I thought it was a good idea at the time. I have a view about this that I have thought about very carefully because I am in a marginal seat and I risk green support, even though there are not many in the House as green as we are in rural seats. Our land is particularly important to us. Our farmers and those who work the land are particularly important to us. There is not a day that goes by when we do not talk about them, think about them, work with them and, hopefully, bring their issues to this parliament. I am one who cannot walk away from the living heritage that is outlined in the story of the mountain cattlemen and their families, and especially their women. The stories over that 100 years of the valour of the women who were connected to these families are just amazing, as are the stories of the brilliant people who have come through the generations to make great contributions to this nation.


To those who say, 'You cannot put cattle into a national park,' I say that the Victorian state government went to the Victorian people and bravely said, 'If we are re-elected, we are going to do a trial in the national parks by putting very few cattle back into the high country.' To me, that was grabbing hold of that heritage and saying, 'It is important to us; it is important enough for us to continue it.'


I am taking a different tack in trying to convince the minister to support this motion. The different tack is that it is all about our living heritage. It is all about people we care about and it is about a minority group of people, being the mountain cattlemen, who have no effect on any seat whether they change from one way to another. There is nothing for the minister to lose in attacking the mountain cattlemen. But in attacking the mountain cattlemen he is attacking our living heritage and what is important in this nation—the values that the mountain cattlemen have and the way they protected the land.


There is a criterion we should all have, and that is what is of long-term benefit to the nation. I have heard a lot about what is to the long-term benefit of the nation on a whole lot of issues. I have heard members of parliament, particularly those on the crossbench, say: 'No. I am prepared to go down this track whether it is politically difficult for me or not because I believe in the long-term interests of the Australian people.' That phrase has been used and bandied about so many times recently it has just about become the default. But I still believe in it. I still believe that this parliament should be governing for the Australian people and what is in their best interests today, tomorrow, next week, next year and in 20 years time. To have a vision for who we are and what we are on about we must never forget where we came from. Who are we? What made us up? Why are we like the way we are? Why are we reactionary in so many ways? It is because of our heritage. It is because of who we are.


I am only fourth generation. My great-grandfather was kicked out of England by his family. I know why I have some of the reactions I have today to some of the leadership I deal with.



An opposition member:  The English knew what they were doing.




Mr BROADBENT:
  Yes! I am glad they threw him out. He did not want to join their business; he wanted to be a coach builder and the family did not think that coach building had a future at that stage.



An opposition member:  Is this relevant?




Mr BROADBENT:
  Actually, it is very relevant because it goes back to the point that I was making about our living heritage and how important it is. We go on about our Indigenous community. We go on about the people who came on tall ships. We go on about the waves of generations of people that came here. But we are discounting our living heritage in these mountain cattlemen and saying that they are a minority and do not count. That is my only point to you today, Minister. Whilst you may have your criteria for what you have to perform under the law, there should be a reasonable consideration for the value of our living heritage: what has gone on in the past, what these people mean to us and what they will mean to future generations when their stories are told—because the stories about our history in this small part of Australia will be told over and over again.


We are not asking for a lot. There are thousands and thousands of hectares there. The cattle go up for a short time each year and are then taken out again. It is not a big ask to put the cattle back into the high country. So I say to the minister: if I could have my way, I would have the cattle back in the high country again on behalf of the minority that care about the country. It is not a big ask that the nation preserve our heritage and give back to the mountain cattlemen a small area of our great nation.


I was at a diabetes breakfast this morning, and there was a map of the world there with Australia cast out in red. I looked at the nation this morning from a different perspective, not with regard to diabetes but in terms of how big it is and how big the oceans around it are. We are only asking that the mountain cattlemen be given back some of their land rights. When I was in local government they called it 'prior-use rights'. The guy next door to me in Pakenham, where I live, carts metal and clay out of his place. He had a complaint. He came to me and said, 'Russell, you have to sign this document to say that I actually enjoy prior-use rights.'


Today, I am arguing only that these people have had their prior-use rights taken from them, that this should be redressed and that they should be returned to the high country. It is not a big ask. This is a tiny bit of the nation. I have been to Western Australia. I have seen the feral goats over there, covering the nation. I have seen the camels that are making a terrible mess. I have seen the horses that are making a terrible mess. I have seen things going wrong right across my nation with regard to these issues.


So my plea and my care for the cattlemen are not political—they are not based on a political decision. I make my plea because I believe I am in the right. So I am standing here and pleading with this parliament to agree to this disallowance motion put forward by my friend and colleague the member for Gippsland. He also has put it forward in a genuine spirit of goodwill. I am not here just to ruffle feathers. I am here to ask and plead on behalf of a minority. That minority deserves a go, deserves an opportunity and deserves to see in the years to come that our living heritage is preserved. I ask all those in this place to consider very carefully how they vote on this motion because they are voting on the heart and soul of the nation.

"Burke, Tony, MP",ALP,2012-03-14,"



Mr BURKE
 (Watson—Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities) (09:55):  I will begin on a point that has been raised by the member for McMillan and the member for Gippsland, both of whom I get along well with and have a high regard for. They have both said a number of things I disagree with, but there is one thing I want to take head-on from the beginning. My gripe is not with the mountain cattlemen—they are not the people I believe deserve to be publicly denigrated—but with the Victorian government. It is the behaviour of the Victorian government on this matter that I believe is worthy of every single criticism we have levelled at it over this decision. Make no mistake—




Mr Forrest:
  It is the same thing.




Mr BURKE:
  Interjectors get thrown out before the vote—that would be terrific! Issues have been raised about who is behind this, what the reason is and what the real motivation is, as though somehow there are people pushing Labor to adopt this view. Getting the cattle out of Alpine National Park was a Labor reform led by a Labor deputy premier when he was Minister for Environment—John Thwaites. It was done by a Labor government and is a Labor reform of which we are proud. We do not need anyone to tell us—and I will let other parties speak for themselves—that national parks deserve to be treated differently.


Let us not allow this argument to get caught up in the pretence that no grazing occurs in the high country. In all the areas where there is state forest, alpine grazing continues to occur, and it occurs without any objection at all. But we draw a line and have a different view when a national park is involved. People then want to raise the non-environmental uses of national parks—the different tourism ventures and things like that. I have no problem with things happening inside national parks that are directly aimed at people enjoying a national park and enjoying nature. I just do not have the same view on that level of enjoyment being offered to cattle. I think national parks have a role as places people can go to enjoy nature and see things in the most natural environment possible. Families can go there for their picnics, people can go for walks there and people can enjoy and love one of the most special parts of our nation.


That is why you do not find the same objections being made to alpine grazing in state forests. It is also why I have no truck at all with the argument that somehow this is a states rights issue. If they are meant to be entirely of state interest, then why on earth call them national parks? We are the government of the nation here. This is a parliament of the nation. If states do not believe national parks are of national significance, then they should not call them national parks—call them state forests or call them something else. But the moment there is an acknowledgment from the states that this deserves to be treated and publicly acknowledged as of significance to the nation then the national parliament and the national government have a role in looking at whether the principles are being applied appropriately in the management of national parks.


The examples that were given by the member for Gippsland, within the Australian Capital Territory, were not examples of national parks. You will find examples within national parks, when they are first declared, of activities that I would not regard as ideal. And there are pre-existing uses that occur in national parks. It even happens with forestry sometimes, when a final rotation of different coups goes through and then the regrowth is allowed to remain there for conservation purposes. These sorts of non-ideal uses of national parks happen all the time, but the one principle that has always been there—until the Victorian government broke it—is that in a national park you do not take backward steps. Once you have achieved a better environmental outcome within a national park, you draw a line. You do not see it as a resource to be used. You do not see it as a resource to be dug up, shot down or grazed over the top of. You see it as a national park so that the citizens of this nation can have somewhere to go and enjoy nature. That is what it is for. It is so significant that, even though it has been done at the state level time and again, state jurisdictions want the federal parliament to put the word 'national' in the title because they believe, and they are right to believe, that it is of significance to the whole nation.


The Victorian government's implementation of this—the principle is wrong and the motivation is wrong—has been a bumbling farce. On the principle of no backward steps in national parks, there is a difference between access for people and access for cattle. There are some people and some environmentalists—maybe some people within this chamber—who have a different view to me and who would take a much tougher line on the enjoyment by people and the access to tourism facilities and things like that within national parks. I do not draw that line. I have always been positive about opportunities for people to enjoy these places. But I do not see national parks as opportunities for commercial ventures which have nothing whatsoever to do with the enjoyment of the national park for anyone other than the grazier or the owner of the business.


The member for McMillan, though, raised an important matter of principle: how do we weigh up the heritage issues? You would think that this parliament was being asked to make a decision as to whether grazing cattle will now have to leave the Alpine National Park. The truth is that alpine grazing finished some years ago. This is about a reintroduction; this is about a backward step. The heritage issues have already been consigned to the past. We happily celebrate the heritage of the First Fleet. It does not mean that if we want to travel back and forth to London we have to get on board a square rigger! When we celebrate and acknowledge heritage, it does not mean that how things were done in the past must be the way forward for ever. There is alpine grazing, but it is not within the national park, nor should it be. There is an important principle here about how we deal with our national parks. 


It is hard to find an issue where it is easier to criticise the motivation of the Victorian government than this one. I was actually weighing up whether I acknowledge this or not and whether it is taking the low road too much to talk about this stuff, but the member for Gippsland did it for me. Upfront he said, 'This issue is so important that people involved have made donations to the National Party,' as though they have somehow bought into the outcome by making a political donation and therefore their views become more important. There is no way in the world that this government will have a moment of sympathy for anyone who wants to argue that, because you make a donation to a political party, you increase your rights as a citizen to access and use national parks for commercial purposes. You have had the media at different points referring to whether or not this might be the motivation. You have had different members of my own political party asserting that it probably is the motivation. Ten points, the card ought to go up, for the honesty of the member for New England and 10 points for the honesty of this admission from the National Party. If we ever wanted to see an example of a donation and a policy outcome being inextricably linked, we have had not just a speech about it but a confession about it on the floor of the House of Representatives today. This was a cheap deal to provide free agistment for a number of farmers.


Let us not forget that these same individuals, when they left the Alpine National Park, were paid compensation for leaving. They were actually paid compensation for leaving. Did the Victorian government say that that compensation money, if the graziers wanted to come back in, would be returned? Not for a moment. The idea of the Victorian government was: you leave for a few years, you get the compensation for leaving and you make your donation to the National Party, but that is the only money you will lose—paying back to the National Party is enough; you will never have to pay back the taxpayers' funds. That is what has happened here.


That also explains why we have ended up with the bogus fire management argument as the reason. The Victorian government have wanted to claim this is about fire management for one reason only: they needed to circumvent the compensation issue. They needed to design contracts that said, 'This is not for the benefit of the farmer; this is for the benefit of the National Park.' That is why they landed at the fire management issue—for no other reason. They went to the fire management issue as a way of making sure that people who had made their donations to the National Party got to keep their compensation funds and got the benefit anyway. That is what the Victorian government have done. This one is as grubby as it gets.


The scientific argument was shown to be a fraud from the moment the implementation began. If you are going to conduct a scientific study on the impact of alpine grazing, the first thing you would do is let the scientists have a look at the site before the cattle arrive. How are you meant to know what the impact of alpine grazing is unless you do your baseline survey, unless you let the scientists in? The Victorian government was in such a rush to make sure that it could say to the mounted cattlemen that it had delivered it did not even let the scientist who was allegedly in charge of the study know that the cattle were on their way in. As far as science was concerned, no survey could be done. The scientists did not even get half a chance to have a look at the Alpine National Park before the cattle were rushed in so that the donors to the National Party could be made happy. That is the precise order of events. We ended up with members of the Victorian parliament trying to come up with ways of saying why the science was true. We ended up with a member of the Victorian parliament, who I must say has become my favourite member of that parliament, Donna Petrovich, saying:


In many respects we are quite lucky that there are still a few remaining lead cows in those herds that know the areas that are being trialled. If we did not have that, we would have an environmental problem. Those cattle stick to the areas and the tracks, and they teach the other cattle the appropriate way to move through that country.


The best defence the Victorian government can come up with is a mutual workshopping education plan amongst small groups of cattle, where they teach each other and explain which wetlands are safe to trample all over and which wetlands are listed under the EPBC Act as vulnerable! The lead cow gets to show the smaller cows where it is safe to go and where there might be an endangered species! And this is meant to be a scientific trial. This is the best that the Victorian government has been able to come up with.


Up until now, members of the federal coalition have avoided making a public stand on this issue. They have allowed the issue to go through quietly. They have allowed the member for Gippsland to fly the flag and make his own comments. They have just wanted the issue to go away. But, in a classic own goal, in a classic favour that the member for Gippsland has decided to do for his coalition colleagues, today he gets to put every single one of them on the record.


On this side of the House, we are very proud to be on the record defending a Labor reform from the previous Victorian Labor government. We are very proud of our relationship with the cattle farmers—whom I met during the time that I was Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry—who actually pay for land to feed their own cattle, who do not have this special bonus, who do not use this side way of trying to get free agistment through donations to the National Party.


In this own goal, members opposite who have national parks in their electorates—whether it is the Blue Mountains, Mount Buffalo, Diamantina or Ku-ring-gai Chase—draw a line today when they sit in this chamber and put themselves on the record. They decide today, for the first time, whether the view of this parliament is that it is okay to take backward steps inside a national park, whether it is okay within a national park—even though it has been declared, even though it has been determined to be of national significance—to continue to see that area as a resource to be chopped down, dug up or grazed over the top of. No member of parliament gets to avoid that today. On the Labor side, we are really proud to be able to get our names on the record, but there is no shortage of members of the coalition who will not be thanking the member for Gippsland for what he is making them do today.


I made an offer to the three governments that are responsible for the alpine areas—the ACT government, the New South Wales government and the Victorian government—to work together on how to deal with bushfire mitigation and how to deal with other ferals and invasives. Guess which of the three governments has still not responded to me. The Victorian government, because they are not interested in the reasons for weeds and bushfires. There have only been excuses to get around a compensation issue, to look after some donors, in a grubby deal that should end today. (Time expired)

"Schultz, Alby, MP",LP,2012-03-14,"



Mr SCHULTZ
 (Hume) (10:10):  I have a lot of respect for the minister at the table, the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities, and I am disappointed to hear what he has been saying about national parks. Why am I disappointed? Because his attitude is like the attitude of ministers of the Crown in the Greiner government in 1992, when I warned them that a fire of a magnitude that they would never have seen before was going to occur in the Kosciuszko National Park. I warned my volunteer firefighters, when I was representing that area, not to go into the park under any circumstances, because there was that much fuel in there that, if a lightning strike hit it, it would create a massive problem, not only for their safety but also for biodiversity.


In 2003, as a result of incompetence within the New South Wales Rural Fire Service, that fire happened. It created a massive problem for the park and had a massive impact on its ecology, to the extent that, in some sections of the Kosciuszko, particularly on the Victorian side, the ground is sterilised 15 to 16 feet below the surface, and the soil, if you pick it up in your hands, is like talcum powder. There was more biodiversity destroyed in that fire than has ever been destroyed or threatened by mankind before.


History has shown that, when the cattle were grazing in the high country, the fires were lesser than they are today. It is okay to have an ideological view that might be friendly to and appreciative of the Greens—that you and your government are holding very desperately onto government with, Minister—but the reality is that the sort of dogma and nonsense that you are espousing in this chamber today will have a massive impact on the Kosciuszko. You talk about future generations and protecting the biodiversity of places like the Kosciuszko by keeping cattle out. Minister, I say to you what I said to the Greiner government in 1992: you are going in the wrong direction. If you want to save the Kosciuszko for future generations, stop this nonsense about locking people out and letting the weeds and feral animals within proliferate. 


I have been up in the Kosciuszko many, many times. In fact, I made a short film about the Kosciuszko and the history of mankind in the Kosciuszko. You go up into the Kosciuszko today and, because of the feral cats and wild dogs there, you cannot hear a bird. There are no birds up there in some sections of the Kosciuszko, because of the incompetence of successive governments, at both the state and federal levels, who do not seem to understand that man can live in harmony with the environment. It has been done for over a century in the Kosciuszko National Park. I can tell you, Minister, it breaks my heart to hear you in this chamber today blame people like the cattlemen of this country, who not only have created history but with their cattle grazing have also done more to protect the national parks than anybody else. The Aborigines used to burn the parks in the past. Why did they burn them? They burnt them to get the sweet grass growing so that the kangaroos would come down and make it easier for them to take the kangaroos for food. 


I am passionate about this; I probably sound passionate about it. Let me say to you, Minister: please rethink your direction because, if you do not, not only are you going to threaten the maintenance of biodiversity in the Kosciuszko National Park; you are going to place in danger volunteer firefighters, who are the people who will go in there and fight the fires. It will not be the Greens, or you as a minister, or a politician—it will be volunteers, who give their time freely, who because of the nonsense that you have espoused here today will go in and try to put out what is inevitably going to be another wildfire in the Kosciusko National Park. I say that with a heavy heart, Minister, because I do respect you. I think you are a highly intelligent individual and I am surprised that you have brought this sort of debate into this chamber.

"Neville, Paul, MP",Nats,2012-03-14,"



Mr NEVILLE
 (Hinkler—The Nationals Deputy Whip) (10:15):  I would like to support my colleagues the members for Gippsland, McMillan and Hume. It grieves me to disagree with the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities, because I must say that this minister has been very good to me in my electorate. He has come up and looked at the problems I have had, even environmental problems like the bats. When we had trouble with the bats he promised me that he would try to influence the state ministers to be a bit more amenable to the problems that people had regarding the bats. I might tell you, Minister, it is still a dreadful problem. But that is not what we are talking about today; we are talking about the alpine regions of New South Wales and Victoria.


I think it is perfectly reasonable for the state government of Victoria to ask for a trial and to have a controlled trial. Why should we be worried about doing a trial in a controlled area with a controlled number of cattle? What reasonable person could object to that? I will tell you why people object to it: the risk might be that if the trial proved successful there would be pressure for other parts of the park to be opened up to grazing. So, if you do not want to do anything like that, you knock it on the head. Although the minister crafted a very interesting story about the words 'national parks', the word national was used way back, well before we developed a sense of nationalism in this country. It was a term that was used overseas, in America, and we adopted it here when the states started to put aside special parts of the country for the preservation of the ecology of those areas. I do not think it ever had the context of the federal government imposing its will of protection over it. That might be the case with Heritage areas, but it was not the case with national parks.


Who controls the national parks, when it really gets down to the practicality of it? It is the state governments. It is their environmental departments or their agriculture or primary industry departments. It is their police and emergency workers who have to go into the parks in times of fire and flood. All those sorts of workers, down to SES volunteers, rural firemen and firewomen, are godchildren of the state governments. They are the people who have to effectively carry out the work. It is all well and good for the federal government to use an international convention to bludgeon a state government. That has happened time and time again in this country—total overkill, using a sledgehammer to crack a nut. The number of times that international conventions have been used to suppress the intentions of a state government is totally disproportionate. 


What do we see across Australia in all states? We get governments from time to time of both political persuasions—but I suspect probably more Labor ones than not—that have the idea to name a national park. Everyone feels all warm and fuzzy and everyone says, 'Oh, good! Isn't that marvellous!' But what do you see a year or two later? You see feral animals running all over them and there are no fuel reduction measures going on. I can remember one in my own area. It cries out to heaven, in much the same way as the member for Hume described parts of the alpine region. There are some beautiful wallum and some other plants—the name escapes me for the minute. There is a magnificent national park which has huge dead craggy trees with huge eagles nests on them. Before I got into parliament I was in charge of tourism in the area. I remember the ranger came to see me in desperation. He asked, 'Is there anything you can do with the Parks and Wildlife people or with the local council?' The ranger, John Byrne—I remember his name well—said, 'We're going to lose that whole park.' All he wanted to do was put some firebreaks through it—a simple thing. No. Even though he was their ranger, Parks and Wildlife would not let him do it, nor would the local council and, as sure as night follows day, we had a bushfire—and what a bobby-dazzler it was! It burnt out 70 per cent of the national park, and those magnificent eagles and all that went with it. Why do we have to demonise all the time grazing that has been going on for 150 years? As two of the speakers before me pointed out, people have got into the park through the activities of the cattlemen and have been able to appreciate that high country. I think it is reasonable for the state government of Victoria to conduct a trial and make its findings publicly known. The minister I think was a bit florid in his description of National Party members before, and I take some offence at that because I pride myself on being a practical conservationist. I do not go around thumping my breast and saying, 'Oh, isn't this dreadful?' or, 'Isn't that dreadful?' I like to do things like getting weed machines into salvinia and water hyacinth, ripping them out of our streams and making them pristine again. Previous ministers of the Howard government helped me do that. In fact, it overflowed into areas outside my electorate. The machines went on to clear lots of streams and dams.


I have spoken to the minister at the table, the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities, when he has come to Bundaberg. I want to reopen the mouth of the Elliott River because the mangroves and things are dying. I probably had more Green Corps projects in my electorate under the Howard government than anyone else because I fostered them and I felt they did good work. I had a $2 million or $3 million study into some of the birds that come from Russia down to Queensland during the season. I have done a lot of work on the restoration of beaches through various government programs. I do not see myself standing in front of a tree, in front of a bulldozer. That is not my form of green power. My form of green power is doing practical things for the environment, not only so that people can enjoy it but also so that you remove feral influences from the environment and make it better.


I think a lot of the national parks in this country are very poorly run, and the state governments in many instances do not pull their weight. But when the Victorian government want to run a trial in a controlled area of land with a controlled number of cattle I think it is wrong to demonise them. I support the members for Gippsland, McMillan and Hume in their comments today and I ask the minister to think carefully on this subject.

"Bandt, Adam, MP",AG,2012-03-14,"



Mr BANDT
 (Melbourne) (10:24):  The Greens' position on this is well known. I have introduced a private member's bill into this place that would have the effect of removing cattle from the park, which is now subject, of course, to the result of this vote. Because the minister has acted, we do not need to proceed with that, because we are giving effect to the fundamental principle that this is a park, not a paddock. Our views on this are well known and I am not going to repeat them all, but I do want to spend some time on the issue that—aside from the contribution by the member for McMillan—has been the underlying principle of almost every contribution here in this chamber and of the Victorian government, which is the idea that grazing in a national park with internationally recognised sensitive and endangered areas is somehow going to reduce the fire risk and that somehow a trial is needed to prove that.


After the fires in 2003 in the Bogong High Plains, there was the opportunity to conduct exactly that assessment. After those fires, scientists went in and conducted one of the most comprehensive studies of fire behaviour and its connection with grazing. They looked at over 419 points. They took over 4,000 twig measurements. They did a very comprehensive survey of the impact of those fires in the areas where there had been grazing in the park and those where there had not been. And what did they find? They found that there was no statistically significant difference between the areas where there was grazing and the areas where there was not.




Mr Schultz:
  Because the fire was so hot, you goose!




Mr BANDT:
  One would have thought that the conducting of a scientific trial—




Mr Mitchell:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, it is unparliamentary—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Hon. BC Scott
):  And the member for Hume is interjecting outside of his place in this chamber, which is very disorderly. The member for Melbourne has the call.




Mr BANDT:
  For those who come in here and say that the basis for this is fire risk and science and we need a trial: if you are going to base your argument on the science, let us look at the science, and the science is in. We have evidence, and I have not heard one member from the opposition talk about the study that was done after 2003, because it does not help their argument but it is what the science says.


We had a thing in Victoria in 2009—which again I have not heard any member from either Victoria or the coalition talk about—called the 2009 Victorian Bushfires Royal Commission. It had a $40 million budget. It sat for over 155 days. It came up with many recommendations. Not one of them was that we should reintroduce grazing into the park because it would reduce fire risk, despite the fact that the royal commission looked at these areas and looked at all of these issues and despite the fact that I suspect that some people probably made submissions to it to that effect.


But let us take this argument even further. Let us assume that you are prepared to ignore the fact that there has been a case study of this after 2003 and ample scientific evidence. Let us ignore the fact that we have had a royal commission looking at fires in Victoria. Let us just take the argument on face value that you want to have a controlled trial. If that is right, why did the scientist who is supposedly conducting this trial first find out about it after the Baillieu government introduced the cattle into the park? He found out about it when he read it in the paper. If you really wanted to conduct a trial, wouldn't you appoint the scientist and then go and get them to investigate the area, work out their methodology, conduct their initial research, establish the baseline situation and then set out how you would conduct a trial?


No, that is not what happened here. What happened here was that the Baillieu government, within five minutes of being elected, put the cattle back into the park and then thought: 'Well, we need a bit of a fig leaf for this. Let's go and talk to a scientist. Let's go and arrange a scientist to get involved.' And the scientist did not even know that the cattle had been introduced. It is a fig leaf of a justification. It has been pulled away, and the sight behind it is not pretty. The Victorian government is misusing science to deliver on a very blatant political deal. The minister's actions are to be commended and the regulation should stand.

"Windsor, Tony, MP",Ind.,2012-03-14,"



Mr WINDSOR
 (New England) (10:29):  Initially I was not going to speak on the motion moved by the member for Gippsland to disallow the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment Regulations 2011 (No. 1), but I have been quite interested to hear what a number of speakers have actually said and, in particular, what the member for Hume has said because I was in that parliament in 1992 when a number of those issues were raised. Enough time has passed to show that on some of the issues that were raised back then—and I would like to think I was one of those that raised those issues at that time—mistakes were made in land management. Even though this debate is about whether or not a cow should be allowed in a national park and whether or not the cow can actually have some impact on fires and biodiversity, I think the broader debate that does need to be had is the one about land use since Aboriginals—and the member for Hume touched on this. We have a landscape that has been based largely on interference by humans—those humans being, of course, Aboriginals. I think most of us would be aware of the Aboriginals' checker plate type of burning arrangements—which is what I think the member for Hume was talking about—to attract kangaroo and other animal activity for hunting purposes and also to preserve their own lives so that massive bushfires would not take place. As to whether the cow actually replaces the Aboriginal in these areas that we are talking about, I am not qualified to say, but I think we should have a very close look at it in considering our broader land management issues.


The member for Hume would remember all that. And we still have a time bomb ticking in the Blue Mountains, given the warning signals that have gone out. The groundcover and debris loads in parts of the Blue Mountains will eventually lead to absolute destruction of some of those areas, including the communities that live in them. All of us who sit in this place have heard, 'Let it return to nature; let nature take its course.' The nature that we are talking about has been created by humans—the Aboriginal people. Even though we neglect them in many ways, perhaps, before it is too late, we should consult with these people on how to manage some of these systems, because the very biodiversity that we are talking about has essentially been created by them. I have got such areas in my electorate, the Oxley Wild Rivers National Park. There have been debates, just as we had in the nineties in the New South Wales parliament—and I am sure they were carried out in other states as well—and arguments about lantana and blackberry control, as have been mentioned by various members today, and about what occurs as to the biodiversity and the weed and feral animal issues when you remove humans from that environment. Some suggest that if you leave it long enough it will all return to the way it was. It was a managed system in some sense and we are doing our best to take Aboriginals out of the landscape rather than putting them back into it. We cannot return it to the way it was, so in some sense this city based view that you do nothing—that is, let nature take its course—has a misguided objective.


The other instance that I would raise—and I know this might be a little bit outside the debate but I think it is pertinent to the wider land management debate—is the absolute desecration that is taking place in Central Australia as I speak. Because the majority of people do not go there—although I do; that is where I go on holidays, and it is magnificent country—they do not see the impact of feral camels and the climate change issues that are happening in some areas where in recent decades there has been more rain than in the past. That situation will not last forever. But there has been a massive explosion in camel numbers with massive destruction. I have had the pleasure of going up and down the Canning Stock Route a number of times and along many of the old desert tracks and whatever that are out there, and the destruction of natural waterholes and natural vegetation is just appalling. So I, here and now, make the plea that something has to be done. I know there are issues before the current government in terms of carbon farming initiatives and methane, so it could be by that or by direct bounty or vermin control. 


There has been a lot of preoccupation with this particular issue before us as to whether a cow is going to create the future or desecrate the future, but I think there are other issues out there that should be looked at much more closely. I think the city should start to pay some attention, because a lot of this is about politics. Whether it be National Party donations or the green vote, it is about politics rather than land management. From time to time the landowners who are park neighbours and whose land is plagued by a whole range of other things—the feral animals and weeds that come out of some of these areas—get a little bit burnt up about the way that politicians respond to some of the national park management issues.


Last night I happened to run into a great Australian. I refer to Keith Payne, whom I had met before and I think most people would know by name, so I do not have to describe who he is. He had flown into Canberra yesterday from Western Australia via Alice Springs, and I met him last night. I had not realised that he has been very involved with Aboriginal communities in feral animal control, particularly camels, and they had been out yesterday and had shot 457 camels. Keith made the plea, and I agree wholeheartedly with him, that we have to do something about this issue. Although people on this side of the chamber will probably disagree, I think carbon farming initiatives are probably the vehicle that should be used. But whether it is the carbon farming initiatives or something else we have to inject some funds into solving this problem. When that country dries up again, that is when the politics will kick in. If you have been in Docker River when it is dry and seen a mob of camels go through town, you will know that it is not a pleasant sight, because they take the toilet bowls with them. That is when the politics and the expense of repairing some of these desecrations will occur. 


I will be supporting the member for Gippsland's motion, not that I am a scientist in terms of this issue but because there are two broader issues that are crying out to be addressed here. The member for Melbourne is quite right: the Victorians spent a lot of money recently on a royal commission looking into fires. Fire management post Aboriginal occupation has to be examined. Some  people think that everything is just going to return to nature. It cannot. It would take thousands of years to get back to something that, possibly, looked like what was there before the fire-stick technology brought in by the Aboriginal people. They did not do that just to preserve the biodiversity; they did that to preserve themselves. 


We have all got some pristine and magnificent areas in our electorates. We have to make sure there is some degree of management in those systems to prevent the loss of life and the loss of that very diversity that we are all talking about saving.

"Mitchell, Rob, MP",ALP,2012-03-14,"



Mr MITCHELL
 (McEwen) (10:39):  I rise today to support the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities against the motion moved by the member for Gippsland to disallow the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment Regulations 2011 (No. 1). I do so because, from what we have heard today, the facts seem to be far from the romantic view that those opposite are trying to put forward about cattle grazing. I was involved in the Victorian task force that ended the licences for cattle in the Alpine national parks. I actually spent time up there—days and weeks—with the cattlemen, with people whom I really admire, with people like Simon Turner and Harry Ryder, cattle producers, who are really good blokes. This is the thing that seems to be getting lost in the mystic romance put across by those on the other side. 




Mr McCormack:
  It's called heritage.




Mr MITCHELL:
  The member for Riverina yaps in and says, 'It's called heritage.' Mate, when was the last time you had a bushranger in Wagga Wagga, apart from you? We do not have that anymore. We have got to be serious about this. This is purely about cattle farmers. They are beef producers; they are not some romantic, mystic people that sit around the camp fire and sing. I have been through this before because I have sat in the chamber with some people who have been directly related to mountain cattlemen. 




Mr Schultz:
  You don't think history is relevant in this country?




Mr MITCHELL:
  History is very relevant—you are still sitting there; I consider you relevant. 




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr KJ Thomson
):  Order! Members on my left will cease interjecting. 




Mr MITCHELL:
  We went through this whole thing. At the end of the day we are talking about cattle farmers. That is what they are and that is what they do, and they do it pretty well. 


What this is about for the Nationals is protecting eight family farms. Now, thanks to the member for Gippsland admitting it, we find out that these are people who have contributed to National Party campaigns. The Nationals sit there and say, 'We've got to protect farmers.' Why would you protect eight farmers at the cost of everyone else? During the 12 years of drought in Victoria, where people were paying an absolute fortune—hundreds of dollars a week—to get agistment to keep their cattle farms going, to keep themselves in business and to keep themselves going, eight families, including those directly related to the Victorian Premier, were allowed to agist their cattle on public land for $5 a season, for 16 to 20 weeks. While everyone else was going out the back door, going broke in the middle of a drought, a select handful of people on hereditary licences were virtually given a taxpayer funded agistment, and it was wrong. It was wrong then and it is wrong now. 


The Victorian task force I was on travelled everywhere, from Wonnangatta Station right up through the Bogong High Plains, right through Victoria's high country. We went and had a look at things. I am sure the minister will agree: I am probably not the greenest person in this place; I am probably the brownest one on our side. When I first became a member of that task force, I said, 'What are we doing this for?' By the end of the four or five weeks we spent up there, it was clear as day that some of the issues caused by cattle in the high country were such that we could not morally stand by and let them happen. 


We spent days walking through the high country. There were places up there with sphagnum moss in the bogs. We came across two bogs that were not affected by cattle. Cattle are pretty heavy. They have got small feet and they punch a hole straight through the moss. This moss is used to filter the water that goes into our rivers—the water that we use to drink and to live off. When the snow melts and it rushes, the moss that is punctured gets pushed away. It takes many, many years for it to grow. It acts like a sponge to filter the water. The name of the grass in the bogs escapes me, but every person we met—the environmentalists, the cattlemen—all said the same thing: this particular grass that grows in the bog is like chocolate to cattle. They love it. They cannot get enough of it. So they are prepared to go through the bog to get to this grass. In doing so, they wreck the bog, which then wrecks the filter system for the waters that flow into our rivers. As I said, we saw only two that were not affected by cattle. I actually kept the photos because I had never seen a pristine one before. It is something that I still keep, because it is an amazing sight. They are beautiful places that should be enjoyed by more people, not locked up for access by a small number of people. 


We also looked at environmental issues. We looked at the native grasses, the introduced grasses, the weeds and pests. Guess how the weeds got up there? 


Most of the weeds in the cattle grazing area have got up there because they are driven up there and dropped off. We are not talking about the men from Snowy River who herd their cattle up there on horseback over five days; the grasses that are eaten elsewhere are taken up the mountains when the cattle do their droppings. By the way, this is how the Victorian government does scientific experiments to know what the impact is—they are out there counting cattle dung. That is their scientific experiment. It is just an absolute joke. So all those weeds that come in, they are in the cattle droppings and they spread through these areas and include things like blackberries and couch grass. They are up there and they are not native to high country ecosystems.


I also want to talk about the fires because this has been an interesting one. We get this romantic view of 'cattle grazing reduces blazing'. But not one cow would eat bark, twigs or leaves, which is what causes the fuel load, which is what causes the intensity. I know this because—it is a pity the member for Hume is not here—I sat through the hearings on the 2003 alpine fires where parts of the cattle-grazed area were burnt and parts were not, and parts in the areas that were untouched were burnt and other parts were not. Things like weather conditions, including the wind conditions, caused the changes in the fire. Not one person, including the people from the CFA or environmentalists, agreed that cattle grazing reduces blazing. Cattle eat grass. Grass does burn with the same intensity as twigs, bark, fallen trees and all those things. So the theory that cattle grazing reduces blazing is just quite simply rubbish because it does not. It was proven it does not and you cannot run that argument seriously and say, 'Look, I'm being honest, hand on heart, this is what it is about'.


This is about the protection of eight families. That is all it is about. If you want to be fair to farmers and give them all a fair go, you would not allow eight farmers to go through drought conditions and fatten up their cows and get top prices while every other farmer on the low plains and on the low ground is getting nothing for their animals and going out the back door and relying on drought support. You cannot do that. Rather than having a hereditary license in which you have to marry in to get one, we looked at whether it is an option to the auction them off. This was quickly dismissed both by the mountain cattlemen and by us because people would go up there and do as much as they could to get as much as they could out of the grass.


In the end it was a decision that was made looking at things such as ecology, fire, cattle and heritage. We looked at a whole range of things and came to the conclusion that cattle grazing was not compatible with a national park. We concluded that it was not compatible with the native flora and fauna that is up there or with other users of the national park. The state government then offered the cattlemen more state forest land, extra amounts of land to use for grazing. But they said no. It was either all or nothing, so they got nothing. We went out of our way to help them; we tried to keep things going. It is not ending the tradition. It is not ending the heritage. There are still high plains up there in state forests that get grazed all the time and there is no problem with that. But this is about the use of the national park, which is not compatible with cattle grazing.


The other thing that seems to have been overlooked is that the cattlemen received $5 million in compensation from the Victorian taxpayers. That is a more than generous amount of money, but now, because of direct relatives of the Premier and friends of the National Party, they are back in there. Where is the money? Did they give the money back? No. According to the member for Gippsland, they financed National Party campaigns with it. That is absolutely wrong. You cannot stand there and say, 'We're doing the right thing'.

  The suggestion that a member's vote can be bought by political donations.




Mr MITCHELL:
  I will withdraw if it makes you happy, but I would just ask you to read your own Hansard later and tell me if I am wrong.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member for McEwen might assist the House by simply withdrawing.




Mr MITCHELL:
  I will withdraw again. When we look at this issue before us today, quite clearly it is about mates and not about national parks or about ecology. We know that cattle damage moss beds, which are very fragile. Cattle pollute waterways and create tracks. We saw an example of this during the time we spent up there with the cattlemen and the environmentalists—and this is going to be a good slap at environmentalists. A cow had died in a bog and it was decomposing. It affected the bog. The environmentalists were very quick to say: 'Look, the cow's died in a bog. It's bad.' But at no time did any of them think: 'You know what? We should remove that and protect the environment'. No, they slapped the cattlemen. I brought it to their attention and said: ""Well, this is rubbish. If this is so important, why wouldn't you just remove the carcass?' That was the right thing to do, to remove it and to ensure that it did not impact any further on the moss beds. But what if we take away all the arguments that have been put forward by those opposite and sit down and ask: 'What's important? What do we want from the national park?' We want it to be open for a lot of users, for a lot of people to use it and to use it freely.


A fellow that the member for Gippsland and I both know, Mr Devers, will tell you about the time he was chased by cattle through the park when he was bushwalking. Mr Devers is a very good bushwalker and also does alpine rescues. You cannot go to the areas that are okay to camp in because of the cowpats that are everywhere. We have to use it for as many purposes as possible. This includes Wonnangatta Station. I went there and I remember hearing, 'Have a look at it, it's a mess'. If you looked at it as a paddock to put your cows in to graze then it probably did look a mess. But if you looked at the native grasses that were growing there, the kangaroo paw et cetera, in their native environment it was looked pristine. We do not lock people out of there. There is a place there called the widow-maker where the four-wheel drivers go up and down. That is part of it. There are bush tracks for people to walk through and huts for people to stay in when they go fishing and camping.




Mr Christensen:
  Four-wheel drives but not cows.




Mr MITCHELL:
  The honourable member says 'Four-wheel drives, not cows' but there are four-wheel drive tracks in the national parks and there have been for a long time. I am sure someone like yourself has probably never been in one and would not understand that. It is about ensuring that you get a balance for all users and not lock up lots and lots of areas just for eight families to protect their interests. I know the member for Gippsland is on the charge for his buddies down there but the reality is that he is wrong. This motion is wrong and the minister is right that we do not take steps backwards and turn a national park into a private farm for a handful of graziers.

Mr CHRISTENSEN
 (Dawson) (10:53):  What a disgraceful performance we have just heard from the member for McEwen, repeating the allegations made by the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities and also by his Greens mate, the member for Melbourne, disparaging graziers in Victoria, claiming that these guys had bribed the National Party to give them—



Mr Mitchell interjecting—




Mr CHRISTENSEN:
  No, that is what you said, mate. You stand by those comments, and the minister can too. You made the claim that graziers had bribed the National Party to get this outcome, to get this trial.




Mr Mitchell:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, I have a point of order. The member for Dawson has just made an outrageous allegation and I ask him to withdraw.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr KJ Thomson
):  It would assist the House if the member for Dawson would withdraw.




Mr CHRISTENSEN:
  I withdraw, Mr Deputy Speaker, but what has been said here, particularly by the minister and by the member for McEwen, flies in the face of not only the reality of natural resource management but also what the minister's department is approving elsewhere. I will tell a little of what is going on in my electorate at Wongaloo Station. Wongaloo Station has been bought and now is being looked after by a private foundation called the Wetlands and Grasslands Foundation because, basically, it is North Queensland's Kakadu. We have an area there which is second to none for its wetlands—the Cromarty wetlands, the bird life and the wildlife that all comes to that area. The bloke who is pushing for Cromarty wetlands to be established as Wongaloo conservation park is a former state Nationals MP, Mark Stoneman, who is a great practical environmentalist. He is the chairman of the natural resource management group up there, NQ Dry Tropics. As the member for Riverina says, most National Party people are great environmentalists and, again, most farmers are also great practical environmentalists. Mark Stoneman is no different. He has been pushing the establishment of the Wongaloo conservation park for some time. The end result will be management of that property by the Wetlands and Grasslands Foundation as a conservation park. There is currently a lot of research going into this. It has been done with the minister's support when the member for Kingsford-Smith was the Minister for Environment, Heritage and the Arts. Some time ago he went to Townsville, in that region, and gave $1.79 million in federal funding to help purchase the wetlands for the Wetlands and Grasslands Foundation to set this place up as a conservation park. There have been ongoing discussions between the Wetlands and Grasslands Foundation and the federal Department of Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities on this. One of the key principles that they are looking into up there, with the department's support, is the retention of cattle grazing as a control against the intrusion of exotic weeds—in an area aimed at being set up as a conservation park.


Now we have the minister arguing in here against what they want to do in one state—to have cattle grazing to stop noxious weeds and to see what other outcomes that that might achieve—and has been done in that part of the world for many a year, longer than the Labor Party has been in existence, longer than the Greens have been bleating. The people there have a definite heritage in that area. Yet, up in North Queensland, the federal department is facilitating the same outcome to get environmental results.


As I said, a lot of research has gone into the benefits of continuing grazing. The Wetlands and Grasslands Foundation, with the cooperation of the federal environment department, is getting that research and monitoring so that it can be used by other people who want to set up conservation parks around Australia. It is just unbelievable that the minister is here advocating that something should not happen in Victoria while his department is facilitating it in North Queensland. I have been down there to Wongaloo and the Cromarty wetlands and I have seen that the cattle that are grazing in certain areas there have nearly eradicated the noxious weeks, and there are plenty of them—182 different species of weeds in that area which cause real damage to the native flora.


Then I go to the areas inside that wetlands, inside the proposed conservation park, where there is no cattle grazing permitted. Do you know what I see? Feral pigs, everywhere, chewing on the weeds and running rampant. That damages not only native flora but also native fauna. If we look across Queensland's national parks—there are plenty in my area; for instance, Eungella National Park—the management of those national parks is so poor that farmers have to invest in stopping feral pigs, wild dogs and other feral animals from coming into their properties from the national parks. Again, I am just astounded that the minister's department is supporting an approach in North Queensland while in this chamber the minister says that approach is no go in Victoria. Even more disgraceful are these repeated comments, without any proof, that graziers have funded a political party in order to get a specific outcome—that being this trial of cattle grazing in Victorian national parks. 


Surely the cattlemen in this country have copped enough from this Gillard Labor government. We went through the live export debacle, which they stuffed up in every way possible—almost bringing the entire North Queensland cattle industry to its knees. Now we have a carbon tax which will increase input costs for farmers everywhere around Australia, including for the Victorian graziers. On top of that, the carbon tax will drive costs for abattoirs higher, so the abattoirs will seek to reduce the number of cattle which go through in order to get their carbon emissions down. That is going to have an impact on graziers as well. Now here is another hit. 


What is it all about? I can tell you what it is about: it is about the Greens. It is about the fact that this government has a written alliance with the Greens. They are dancing to the tune of the Greens once again. We have seen it up in North Queensland. Pressure was put on the state government to introduce reef regulations which impact on cane farmers. They have to complete a bunch of paperwork, test which way the wind is blowing and obtain information that even the Bureau of Meteorology would probably not have before they are able to use fertiliser and herbicide on their farms. The federal government is now pushing to lock up fishing waters in North Queensland. Commercial and recreational fishing will both suffer. This Labor government is again dancing to the tune of the Greens.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr KJ Thomson
):  The member for Dawson is a long way from the motion. It would assist the House if he were to return to the motion.




Mr CHRISTENSEN:
  I will return to the motion. But we are seeing a consistent approach to policy around the nation—the government dancing to the tune of the Greens. Whether it is locking up sections of the Coral Sea, whether it is requiring farmers to fill in heaps and heaps of paperwork just to undertake normal farming practices or whether it is knocking Abbot Point on the head for another six, seven or eight months—bringing it to two years—all of this stuff is just dancing to the tune of the Greens, and this regulation is as well. The minister should be ashamed of the comments he has made in this place.

"Sidebottom, Sid, MP",ALP,2012-03-14,"



Mr SIDEBOTTOM
 (Braddon—Parliamentary Secretary for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry) (11:02):  It gives me great pleasure to support those on this side by rising to speak on the motion proposed by the member for Gippsland to disallow regulations under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. Grazing of domestic stock within the Australian Alps national parks and reserves, which are on the National Heritage List, has a significant impact on the listed values of those places. The Australian alps are one of Australia's unique landscapes, as has been eloquently agreed by all members who have spoken on this disallowance motion this morning. The alps are listed under the national environment law, the EPBC Act, to protect this area of great national significance. 


Over the summer of 2010-11, the new Liberal-National Party government in Victoria quietly reintroduced cattle to the Alpine National Park in Victoria under the guise of a so-called scientific research trial. That has been very clearly covered by the minister, by members on this side and by some of the Independents and the Greens. The Victorian government took that action without first submitting their proposal to the federal government for assessment under the national environmental law to determine if any ecological areas would be impacted by their actions. The minister made it very clear, very early, that the Baillieu government were wrong to reintroduce cattle to the Alpine National Park and that, in doing so, they had set a dangerous precedent for the management of national parks across Australia. That is why this government last year made regulatory changes which formally recognised the significant impact of livestock grazing on the National Heritage values, listed under the EPBC Act, of the Australian alps national parks and reserves. 


The regulation specifies that grazing of domestic stock, including cattle, could have a significant impact on the heritage values of the Australian alps National Heritage area and that any future new grazing activities proposed in the Australian alps National Heritage area, including the Alpine National Park, needed to be assessed under the EPBC Act. The minister made that statement last year in introducing the regulation. He has again today eloquently and forcefully given the rationale and reasoning behind that regulation, as have others on this side and others in this place. That is why I was quite prepared to support the minister in opposing this disallowance motion. I think that all in this House should now say where they stand on this important principle of whether you protect your national parks or you do not. We on this side do.

"McCormack, Michael, MP",Nats,2012-03-14,"



Mr McCORMACK
 (Riverina) (11:06):  I was most impressed to see the passion shown by the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities on this issue of cattle grazing in the Australian alps. I look forward to him showing exactly the same passion and commitment when he brings about a triple-bottom-line approach in the Murray-Darling Basin plan and ensures that we have social, economic and environmental outcomes considered in any water policy in this nation. He showed a lot of passion today. I look forward to him showing the same passion on that issue.


This disallowance motion comes about because, as is evident, the Greens are running the show. Labor might be in power but the Greens are running the show. The cattle will not be tearing up the bush as Labor and the Greens would have people believe. The Greens would like to see the national parks locked up. They are anti everything Australians cherish about the great outdoors. If the Greens get away with this and our national parks are locked up they will be left for feral animals to rule and noxious weeds to take over. With all the litter left lying around it would take just one spark for Black Saturday—those terrible, dreadful, horrific Victorian bushfires—to be repeated, and no-one wants to see that. The Greens, and others, are opposed to grazing but grazing reduces the litter load. Grazing reduces the risk of terrible bushfires. This disallowance motion is necessary because the Greens are running the show. Stockmen have grazed cattle in the Victorian alpine country for decades—more than 150 years. They have managed the high country ecosystems over this period. Only recently has it been decided that grazing should not continue—and why? Because we have a green agenda running this country. This alpine country was open up by stout-hearted stockmen, the mighty men of the Snowy River, on their horses. Now the brumbies run free, and I have no doubt the Greens want to get rid of them too. 


This issue has been very much in the news since 2005 when the Bracks Labor government banned cattle grazing in Victoria's Alpine National Park in response to ongoing lobbying from environmental groups. The ban was overturned in January 2011 when the Baillieu coalition government, newly elected by the people—and this was very much an issue at the forefront of that election—reintroduced cattle to the estate for a short-term grazing trial, the first annual stage of a planned five-year project designed to ascertain whether grazing lowers bushfire risk by reducing fuel loads. The move attracted the ire of the minister at the table, Minister Burke, who pushed a special regulation through federal parliament to prevent the Victorian government from allowing cattle to re-enter for the second year of the trial. At the same time, the minister wrote to his state counterparts advising that the federal government was seeking greater control of Australia's 500 national parks, which are currently controlled by state governments. Citing the devastating nature of bushfires, the Victorian government asked the federal government to reconsider the importance of the trial as a bushfire mitigation tool. The federal minister responded by saying the move would have a 'clearly unacceptable' impact on the National Heritage values of the park estate. The minister's actions are based on a green desire to lock up vast tracts of country and to return them to complete wilderness. Mark Coleman, a third generation mountain cattleman and president of the Mountain Cattlemens Association of Victoria, said:


The concept may work in a rain forest in the Amazon or somewhere, where nature will take its course, but not here where I am standing in Victoria which is one of the most bushfire prone areas of the world.


Aboriginal people have managed the alpine landscape with firestick farming for tens of thousands of years and mountain cattlemen have continued similar management practices by burning patches of country every autumn. Cattlemen took a $100 million hit last year from Labor's live cattle export fiasco. They do not need to keep taking green hits from this government. Particularly in this, the Australian Year of the Farmer, farmers do not need to continue to be deterred by this government.


The member for McEwen speaks of bushrangers. Had a certain MP on that side of the House said 'Bail up! There will be a carbon tax under the government I lead', maybe—just maybe—we would not be having this discussion this morning.

"Chester, Darren, MP",Nats,2012-03-14,"



Mr CHESTER
 (Gippsland) (11:11):  In concluding this debate, may I say this has been an excellent debate and I congratulate all members who have spoken, including the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities and the Parliamentary Secretary for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, and the members for Hume, Hinkler, Melbourne, McEwen, New England, Dawson and the Riverina. What we have seen this morning is proof of the passion that issues of natural resource management still generate in this place and, in particular, the passion that the issue of the mountain cattlemen generates. I thank all members for their contributions, even those I do not necessarily agree with, and for the way they took on this debate and raised their points of view.


I want particularly to comment on the member for McMillan's contribution. The member for McMillan spoke very eloquently about the cultural heritage of the mountain cattlemen that we are talking about today. He made a very important contribution regarding what direction we are going to take in natural resource management in this country in the future—whether we are going to recognise that active land management involving people on the ground is the way forward for natural resource management, rather than the 'lock it up and leave it' approach which has been dictated by governments in various jurisdictions in recent times.


At the outset I pleaded with the minister to show respect. He tried hard but he did, in the end, whip himself into an indignant frenzy about whether or not it was appropriate for the mountain cattlemen to make a donation to a political party. I encouraged him to give it his best shot and he certainly did. Unfortunately, in the minister's attack he suggested quite strongly—and I hope this was not his intention—that there was some kind of ulterior motive involved behind the mountain cattlemen making a donation to a political party in an open and transparent manner. I hope that is not what he was intending to say, but that is what it sounded like when he was speaking. He was imputing improper motives to members of the National Party and in doing so he was showing enormous disrespect to the cattlemen. As I said in my comments to the House, quite clearly and in a very open and transparent manner—and the minister congratulated me for my honesty—the Liberal Party and the National Party had pre-existing policies relating to the mountain cattlemen well before the 2010 election. It is spurious and it is a red herring to try to link the two and suggest there is some level of cash for comment, as the minister himself did, and as the member for McEwen did later on. I do not think that either member covered themselves in glory by trying to suggest there is some sort of ulterior motive on the part of either the members involved or the cattlemen themselves. 


For the record, in answer to the member for McEwen's comment that I am 'on the charge for my buddies', I just want to say that I have no financial interest whatsoever in this issue and it is wrong to suggest that my opinion on this issue has been influenced in any way by friendships or financial donations to me or my party. I think you are wrong to make that suggestion. It was inappropriate and I took exception to the comment. Hence, I raised a point of order when the opportunity presented itself to me.


The minister said that the Labor Party is proud of its record on this issue. The fact is that the state Labor government kicked the cattlemen out of the high country on the back of a dodgy inquiry with preordained recommendations. When the high country burns next time and lives are lost, property is destroyed and native animals are scorched, I wonder whether members opposite are still going to be proud of their approach to the issue and the issue of natural resource management more generally.


Natural resource management in this nation is heading in the wrong direction. The member for Hume spoke about this. The member for New England also spoke very eloquently about this issue. We are going down the wrong path when it comes to natural resource management. 'Lock it up and leave it' is not an environmental policy; it is a recipe for disaster. This is the path we are heading down. If we follow the Greens down this ideological path, we will destroy this great environment that we have all stood here today and said we cherish. 'Lock it up and leave it' is not an environmental policy.


I welcome the vote today, just as the minister himself said he will welcome the vote, because we will put on the record where we all stand on this very important issue. The minister is nodding his head. I think it is important that members get to vote today on where they stand on this very important issue of natural resource management and whether they believe in practical and active land management. On this side when we vote today we will be demonstrating our respect for the Victorian coalition government and the mandate it received in 2010. We will also be respecting the mountain cattlemen and their families and their more than 150 years of active management of the high country. We will also be respecting the role mountain cattlemen can play in reducing the fuel load and in sustainable environmental management through grazing and prescribed burns. We will also be respecting the heritage of regional communities on both sides of the Great Dividing Range in Victoria.


The member for McEwen asked the question: who is Doug Treasure? Doug was a former President of the Mountain Cattlemen's Association of Victoria. Doug died this year. Doug campaigned for many years on behalf of his constituents in the Mountain Cattlemen's Association. Doug was a great man. He lived in Stratford and made an enormous contribution to active land management through his role with the Mountain Cattlemen's Association of Victoria. I assume that the member for McEwen just wanted to know who Doug Treasure was. That is who Doug Treasure was. Doug was a tremendous man who made a great contribution. He passed away earlier this year, and we in this place send our love to his family.


Today, in voting for this motion, we will demonstrate our respect for regional Australians and how they choose to live their lives. I thank the House.



The SPEAKER:  The question before the chair is that the motion moved by the honourable member for Gippsland be agreed to.

 (North Sydney) (13:45):  Every Australia Day local councils in my electorate acknowledge the good work and achievements of individuals who give their time for the benefit of others. This year my cousin, William Anschau, was awarded the Hunters Hill Council's Young Citizen of the Year Award.


William was educated at Hunters Hill Public School and St Joseph's College. His impressive list of achievements and his long record of volunteering make him an example of someone who has used his own talents to make a difference in our community. William was an active volunteer whilst at St Joseph's College, spending five years helping disabled children at the annual Marist children's holiday camp. Since leaving school, he has continued his voluntary work, including as a bus assistant for the Ryde-Hunters Hill Community Transport Service, and helping out with the Hunters Hill Community Centre and the Meals on Wheels organisation. He is also an active member of the Hunters Hill SES and is well known for his volunteer work at local events, including the Moocooboola Festival.


William has said that everyone should look to help others. He is right. Although he has had some of his own health challenges, these have never stopped him from making a difference in society. He is an optimistic and positive young man who is an excellent example to all young people on the benefits of service. It is his actions that make the Hunters Hill community a better place for all, and he is well deserving of this award.

Mr ABBOTT
 (Warringah—Leader of the Opposition) (14:52):  I move:


That so much of standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the Leader of the Opposition from moving forthwith the following motion:


That the Prime Minister be called to explain how the Australian people can trust her Government to control our borders and protect the Australian people from threats including the illegal importation of weapons used in gun crimes when the Government's failed border protection policies have overwhelmed the Budget and undermined the ability of agencies that manage our borders to do their job.


This is urgent. It should take priority over all other matters before this House, and the Prime Minister should stay and listen. There is no more important duty of government than to protect our borders. This Prime Minister cannot stop the boats, she cannot stop the guns and she cannot stop leaving the parliament because she will not face the truth about the incompetence and dishonesty of this government. This is an incompetent and untrustworthy Prime Minister who lacks the courage to stay in the parliament and listen to the truth about this government. That is why standing orders must be suspended. This is the most important business before this House.


We all know that blow-outs in border protection have cost $1 billion a year—




Mr Albanese:
  Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order on relevance. Is the suspension of standing orders the same as the matter of public importance which is the next item?



The SPEAKER:  There is no point of order. The Leader of the Opposition has the call.




Mr ABBOTT:
  There has been a blow-out of $1 billion because of this government's failure to protect our borders from illegal boats and, as a result of this, there have now been cuts that have resulted in this government's failure to protect our borders from the penetration of illegal guns. This is why standing orders must be suspended. The blow-out in costs on boat people has led to a cut in spending on the screening of imported cargoes. Border protection failures on boats are now leading to border protection failures on guns. There could be no more important issue for this House to consider right now.


There have been enormous cuts to screening as a result of the blow-out in border-protection costs because this government cannot stop the boats. Since 2010—and this is why standing orders must be suspended—340 staff have been axed from the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service. The budget of Customs for cargo screening has been decreased. It has been cut by almost $60 million. This has resulted in a 75 per cent cut to air cargo screenings and a 25 per cent cut to sea cargo screenings. This is why standing orders must be suspended. Less than five per cent of sea cargo is X-ray screened and less than one per cent of sea cargo is physically examined. The situation is much worse for air cargo. Is it any wonder that illegal guns are coming into our country?



The SPEAKER:  The Leader of the Opposition will address the motion.




Mr ABBOTT:
  This is why standing orders must be suspended. This government's incompetence on border protection is not just about boats, it is about guns as well. This is the most important business that the parliament could possibly discuss right now.


We know, from a press conference in Sydney today, that 140 Glock firearm magazines have been imported into this country. They are all imported. Every single illegal handgun in this country has been imported. There are far more—and this is why standing orders must be suspended—because of this government's cuts to border screening. There are, according to the New South Wales police, 160 to 220 illegal firearms in this country because border protection screening was unable to stop this particular operation from bringing illegal handguns into our country, and this is why standing orders must be suspended. Those 160 to 220 guns are enough to fight a street battle. They are enough to sustain a gangland war. They are enough to terrorise our streets. It is happening because of this government's incompetence in maintaining proper border protection: not just border protection against illegal boats, but border protection against illegal guns. This is why standing orders must be suspended. This is why this motion should take priority.


There have been 88 drive-by shootings in Sydney over the last 12 months. There is a reign of terror on the streets of Sydney and as those shots ring out, the people of Sydney think of the crime gangs. They think of the police trying to protect them from those crime gangs. And now they should also think of this Prime Minister, whose incompetence and failures on border protection have materially contributed to this particular social disaster. Is there no end to this government's, and this Prime Minister's, incompetence? We have the pink batts disaster, the school halls disaster, the live cattle export disaster and now we have gun crime in Sydney aided and abetted by the incompetence of this government in maintaining a proper border protection regime. It is not just an inadequate regime against illegal boats but a totally inadequate regime against illegal guns as well.


Today, the head of Customs, Mr Michael Carmody, said, 'It is absolutely impossible for every one of those air containers and cargo containers to be searched.' That is what he said and, I tell you what, it is so much harder as a result of the cuts to screening by this government. A 75 per cent cut to air cargo screening and a 25 per cent cut to sea cargo screening just makes their job so much harder. That is a result of the incompetence of this government. Their incompetence in stopping the boats flows directly into their incompetence in stopping the guns. They cannot stop the boats, and now we know, because of what has happened in New South Wales today, they cannot stop the guns either. That means that the safety of the people of Sydney has been put at risk.


But there is some good news, and this is why standing orders should be suspended. Mike Carmody said today that, 'It's important for those out there to understand that you have agencies at both a Commonwealth and a state level who now work together to address issues.' At least Mike Carmody understands that; I wish Fair Work Australia understood that. Mike Carmody understands that; I wish Minister Shorten understood that. That is why standing orders should be suspended. The only federal agency that does not believe in cooperating with other law enforcement agencies to investigate and prevent crime is Fair Work Australia.


We have a very serious situation on the streets of Sydney. Gun crime—in particular, drive-by shootings—are becoming rampant. Many parts of Western Sydney have been terrorised by drive-by shootings. There is almost nothing that could be more contrived to damage people's enjoyment of their neighbourhoods than drive-by shootings. Every single one of these drive-by shootings has involved an illegally imported gun. Every single one of those illegally imported guns has got past Customs, and they are getting past Customs because this government has savagely cut Customs funding because it cannot stop the boats.



This is an utterly incompetent and utterly untrustworthy government. It is a government which frankly should have died of shame and should be gone. (Time expired)

Mr MORRISON
 (Cook) (15:02):  I second the motion. There is a falsehood that is being perpetrated by this government today and that is why standing orders must be suspended. The Prime Minister must explain to this House how the government can make bold-faced claims today about their credentials on border protection when the very issue they cite—the importation of illegal weapons, as exposed by the New South Wales Police Force—has exposed their own failures on our borders.


The revelation that gun components were smuggled into my own electorate at the Sylvania Waters post office is bad enough. There must now be a full audit of all transactions conducted by that post office, ordered by the Minister for Home Affairs, who is at the table, and the minister for communications if necessary. The fact that the guns have been allegedly used in the drive-by shootings that have plagued Sydney is even worse. Whether components of the weapons smuggled through the Sylvania Waters post office were used in a drive-by shooting weeks later the Prime Minister was unable to confirm today. But I am reliably informed—



The SPEAKER:  The honourable member will return to the motion being debated.




Mr MORRISON:
  This is why standing orders must be suspended—because the Prime Minister must explain why the Australian people can have confidence in her when these things are occurring. There have been 60 shootings. This is a matter of urgent importance. There were 60 shootings in Sydney in the year to the end of February. Fortunately, there were no fatalities. The incident that sparked the post office investigation occurred in December of last year. That investigation went all through January. It was not until February that Customs became part of this investigation. They were late to the operation because they did not know that our borders had been breached. That is why standing orders must be suspended—for the Prime Minister to explain.


The fact that our border agency did not prevent this breach or know about it without the good work of the New South Wales Police Force is a cause for major concern. That is why the Prime Minister must explain. If you can bring in components of Glocks then what other components are being brought in across our borders for even more serious weaponry that threaten our national security? If it takes the New South Wales police to find out when our borders have been breached because the Customs and Border Protection Service does not know, then what is happening in the other states and territories? That is why the Prime Minister must come into this place today and explain herself. What assurance can this Prime Minister give to Sydney families and those across the country that her failed border protection regime is up to the job when this is her record?


We do not make weapons in this country for non-military purposes. This was a fact confirmed today by the New South Wales police. New guns are on our streets in Sydney because they are getting across our borders. They crossed our borders on this government's watch and found their way all the way to Sylvania Waters. That is why standing orders must be suspended. Commissioner Scipione recently stated in reference to the guns imported from overseas that this is an urgent issue and a toxic problem. 'It is happening,' he said. 'That is the elephant in the room,' he said. This elephant in the room must be debated. That is why standing orders must be suspended. Commissioner Scipione tells us clearly that this is a serious problem.


There will be many reasons why the Prime Minister cannot give this assurance and why those on that side of the House today will prevent this matter being urgently debated in this place. They will do that because they know that the key reason is what the Leader of the Opposition has plainly set out: this government has lost control of our borders. In losing control of our borders, they have undermined the capacity of their agencies to control those borders for even more serious purposes. When you cannot stop the boats, you cannot stop the guns—and you undermine the capacity of the government agencies to do their jobs.



The SPEAKER:  The member will return to the substance of the question.




Mr MORRISON:
  Standing orders must be suspended because this is an urgent issue that is facing the citizens of New South Wales. It is an urgent issue that has been highlighted by the best policeman in this country, Commissioner Scipione, and he is saying that it needs attention. Those on that side of the House say this should not be debated. Those on that side of the House are saying this is a matter we should just scurry away from. But I know that the Customs and Border Protection Service was not involved in that investigation until February. It is good that they finally caught up, but what the people of Sydney want—and they want it debated in this House—is for these matters to get full attention from this House. (Time expired)

"Clare, Jason, MP",ALP,2012-03-14,"



Mr CLARE
 (Blaxland—Minister for Home Affairs, Minister for Justice and Minister for Defence Materiel) (15:07):  I should start by saying that what is happening in Sydney is extremely serious. There is a risk, where there are drive-by shootings—people shooting at homes across Western Sydney—that someone will get hurt. There is a risk that families enjoying their normal lives in the middle of the day or the middle of the night could be shot and killed. I treat this very, very seriously. That is why one of the first things I did as the Minister for Home Affairs and the Minister for Justice—



The SPEAKER:  The minister will address the reasons why standing and sessional orders, in his view, ought not be suspended, not the substance of what would be the subsequent motion.




Mr CLARE:
  My argument to you, Mr Speaker, is that standing orders should not be suspended, for a number of reasons. Firstly, they should not be suspended because this debate will occur in this House at the end of question time. The member for Stirling has placed this on the parliament's record as a matter of public importance, and that debate will occur this afternoon. That is the appropriate opportunity to have that debate.


Secondly, standing orders should not be suspended now because of the evidence to the contrary. Today is a very important day for Customs. It is a very important day for law enforcement. The New South Wales police, working with Customs and Border Protection as well as the Federal Police and the Australian Crime Commission, have worked together to dismantle a major illegal firearms syndicate. The work they did yesterday shows the terrific job our law enforcement agencies do, working together. That stands in stark contrast to what the Leader of the Opposition said in his argument about why standing orders should be suspended.


This all came to pass because of a number of things. A Glock firearm was seized by New South Wales police in Wiley Park. The Australian Crime Commission, working with the New South Wales police, did a trace analysis of that firearm. That analysis helped to trace the gun back to the company that makes it in Austria and, in turn, to a gun distributor in Germany, which in turn led to the arrests in Sylvania Waters yesterday. Since I have been in this job I have made a point of making this my top priority, speaking with the New South Wales minister for police and speaking with the Australian Crime Commission to make sure that whatever resources the New South Wales police need they get. The Australian Crime Commission told me, in my first briefing, that they have made that very clear to the New South Wales police and that, as a result of that, they have provided tracing analysis services as well as their Fusion Centre to identify criminals involved in this market. That is why standing orders should not be suspended—because of this evidence to the contrary. I have done the same thing with the Australian Federal Police, and they have made it clear that they stand ready to help the New South Wales police wherever they are needed. And it has been the same with Customs.


What is the result of all that? Working with the Liberal police minister in New South Wales, Mike Gallacher, we directed the Australian Crime Commission to conduct a national intelligence audit of the illegal firearms market in Australia. This is why standing orders should not be suspended—because of the evidence presented here to the country. Finding one gun in Western Sydney and then tracing that and identifying who was responsible for importing it led to the arrest of four people and the shutting down, or dismantling, of a criminal syndicate. The work I have done is to direct the Australian Crime Commission to do that work for every single firearm that has been seized by police over the last 12 months and to do the same sort of analysis for all the shootings, all the bullets and all the casings that have been found, whether they are in Western Sydney or in South Australia or anywhere across the country. That work, that intelligence, will assist police right across the country, and this is why standing orders should not be suspended, because of this evidence of the work that we are doing as a government, hand in glove with the New South Wales government, with the South Australian government and with all governments across the country. That will lead to a presentation of this criminal intelligence information to a meeting of attorneys-general next month and will lead to recommendations to police ministers when they meet in July this year.


The Leader of the Opposition and the shadow minister, the member for Stirling, talk about cuts to Customs. It is a bit rich, the Liberal Party talking about cuts, when they have a $70 billion black hole.



Opposition members interjecting—



The SPEAKER:  The minister will be directly relevant.




Mr CLARE:
  It is a bit rich, when they want to sack 12,000 government workers.



The SPEAKER:  The minister will address the motion before the chair.




Mr CLARE:
  This is why standing orders should not be suspended—because these are the things we could have discussed in question time, and these are the things we will have the opportunity to discuss when the matter of public importance comes up after this debate. The Liberal Party lecturing anyone about cuts is a bit like Ralph Malph lecturing the Fonz about cool. These guys are experts when it comes to cuts. And this is why standing orders should not be suspended. A couple of weeks ago the shadow minister said that the decision of the CEO of Customs to reduce the size of the SES by 11 people could be described as 'drastic action'. I would ask the shadow minister: how does he compare that with the 12,000 people that he wants to sack from the Australian Public Service? The Leader of the Opposition has made it clear that that will happen in education, in health and in defence.



The SPEAKER:  The minister will address the question before the chair, otherwise he will resume his seat.




Mr CLARE:
  The other reason not to suspend standing orders is the obvious nature of this debate. The policy of the Leader of the Opposition on border protection—his idea of turning back the boats—is unravelling, day after day. Trying to suspend standing orders is an attempt to distract from that policy. If truth be told, you have the UN saying that the coalition's border protection policy of turning back the boats will not work, you also have the Indonesian ambassador saying that it will not work, but most importantly you have got senior officers in the Australian Navy saying that it would put Australian lives at risk.



The SPEAKER:  The minister will resume his seat. The question before the chair is that the motion for suspension of standing and sessional orders be agreed to. I call the—




Mr Albanese:
  I am seeking the call on this motion.

The SPEAKER:  Order! The time for this debate has expired.

"Keenan, Michael, MP",LP,2012-03-14,"



Mr KEENAN
 (Stirling) (15:33):  We have just heard the Prime Minister say in this chamber that this government is going to do everything it can to help the New South Wales police and the federal agencies responsible for law and order to do something to stop drive-by shootings in Sydney and to address law and order issues and gun crime issues in particular. She then went on to say that we are doing just that. We had her minister for the portfolio stand up and laud the efforts of the Australian Federal Police, the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service and the Australian Crime Commission for what they have done in helping the New South Wales police to solve these terrible crimes or to find illegally imported firearms.


Let us contrast those platitudes—and in this place we all know that platitudes come very cheap—with the commitment that they have actually shown to these agencies since they took office in 2007. We all know that if you want to find out where people's real priorities are in parliament follow the money and look at where they prioritise scarce resources. It is where they have allocated these resources that betrays and shows what Labor really think about law and order issues and where they place these issues in their hierarchy of importance. Labor's actions when dealing with Customs and Border Protection and with all our front-line security agencies tell the Australian people everything they need to know about this government when it comes to law and order. In every Labor budget—every single one—Labor has savaged Customs and Border Protection both in its funding and its personnel. Cuts to Customs are now so dire that criminals have been given an unfair advantage by this government's failure to do one of the most fundamental tasks we ask of a federal government—that is, to protect our borders.


When we talk of Labor's border protection crisis, it is more than their inability to control who comes to Australia. They cannot control what comes into Australia, and funding and personnel cuts to our front-line customs agencies are feeding directly into the ability of criminals to breach our borders. Whether it be the 16,000 people who have been smuggled here illegally by people smugglers or whether it be the ability of bikie gangs to bring in illegal firearms or of other criminal enterprises to bring in illegal drugs and other contraband, Labor's cuts are aiding them in their criminal enterprises. It is always instructive to go back to 2007, the last time this country had a good government, and to see what the government did in contrast to the actions of its predecessor. The Howard government increased funding to Customs when it came to office from 1996 in real terms by 238 per cent. The budget was increased from $357 million to $1 billion. It also increased funding to help the AFP with smuggling and to boost our quarantine controls. Other front-line crime prevention agencies such as the Australian Federal Police received similar increases. When Labor came to office they looked at those enormous real funding increases that the Howard government had made to our law enforcement and border protection agencies and said, 'That's an overallocation of resources that we're going to do something about.' How else could you possibly explain the savageness with which they have gone about slashing our front-line law-and-order and border protection agencies?


These agencies have already been placed under enormous pressure because of Labor's border protection failures, and the cuts that have been implemented in every budget have substantially increased that pressure. I just want to go through those cuts, because they are extraordinarily savage and they are dealing a blow to these agencies' ability to do their jobs effectively.


I will start with Customs. Customs was savaged right from the first Labor budget: $58.1 million was taken from Customs' cargo-screening budget. This cut meant a reduction of 25 per cent in the number of potential sea cargo inspections and an astonishing reduction of 75 per cent in air cargo inspections. Customs' annual report revealed that only 4.3 per cent of sea cargo was X-rayed and less than one per cent of sea cargo is physically examined when it comes into Australia. With the volumes of cargo increasing in coming years, these cuts will be even more savage.


But this is not the extent of Labor's cuts to Customs. They have cut their personnel. Last budget, another 90 staff were axed from the Customs and Border Protection Service on top of the 250 that were axed in the 2010-11 budget. Customs CEO Michael Carmody has been recently forced to cut 20 per cent of his senior executive service to cope with budget cuts. That is one in five people in Customs' senior executive service that has been cut.


Labor plan to cut $4.3 million in so-called low-risk activities from the agency. Astonishingly, they have cut funding for aerial surveillance in our northern waters—the planes that detect illegal boat arrivals and protect us from illegal fishers. They have cut the budget for the agency to conduct those patrols by $20.8 million. That is a net reduction of 2,215 aerial surveillance hours, or more than 90 days of aerial surveillance. They have cut $34 million over four years for passenger facilitation at Australia's eight international airports. They have cut $17.3 million over five years for the management of illegal foreign fishers.


These cuts have meant that this agency is unable to do the job that it is tasked with, which is to protect Australia's borders. Yet we have had the Minister for Home Affairs—this minister who just stood up and was not even able to fill his 10-minute slot in defending the government's record on these areas—lauding today in a press release what the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service, with the assistance of the Australian Crime Commission and the Australian Federal Police, has been able to do. He was not able to say one word about the savage cuts that have occurred under the Labor Party to the agencies that he now controls. We all know that the minister before him was grossly incompetent, and of course he received the ultimate sanction by the Gillard government: when you display gross incompetence, you are promoted to cabinet! But this minister now has the ability to reverse those cuts. He cannot be an effective minister unless he is able to reverse the savage cuts that have been made to the agencies that he is apparently tasked with overseeing for the federal government.


I know that he will get up and talk about our policies, which is the only defence that he has to the incompetence that has been shown by the Labor Party since they came to office. So let me assure him—and I can give him this very firm commitment today—that not only will we not cut front-line service personnel in Customs; we will restore the funding cuts that the Labor Party has made to cargo screening. This will make sure that Customs actually has a fighting chance of stopping illegal guns before they cross our borders, helping police forces like the New South Wales Police Force and every police force around the country. We will restore that funding cut. If he were going to be an effective minister, he would stand up in his contribution in the next five minutes and say exactly the same thing. If he cannot give that guarantee, if he cannot guarantee the funding and personnel of his own agencies, then he may as well give up because he will not be an effective Minister for Home Affairs.


I have talked about the cuts to Customs, which have been savage. This is an agency which, whilst it has had its funding and personnel cut, has been asked to do so much more because of Labor's inability to stop people smuggling. But all of our national security agencies have been savaged by this government. The Australian Federal Police have been lauded by the Prime Minister and the minister in parliament today, yet they have also been savaged by Labor's budget cuts. Seventy-two staff have been cut from the Australian Federal Police in the last budget alone. The so-called efficiency dividend has been increased from 1½ per cent to four per cent, which means a $91.3 million cut from the Australian Federal Police.


They have cut the air marshals program that keeps us safe when we fly. AFP numbers in Darwin and Canberra have been cut. I wonder if the member for Canberra will have anything to say about that, if she is making a contribution today. Darwin International Airport—I know the member for Solomon is very concerned about this—will lose air marshals on all of its flights.


The Australian Crime Commission has been lauded today again for its results in the operation to deal with illegal firearms in New South Wales, yet again you have to follow the money to see what the government really thinks about this agency and really thinks about its importance. Overall, the budget for the ACC has been cut in the last budget by $7.3 million, and 23 staff were taken from that agency, one of Australia's premier crime-fighting agencies, which actually exists to deal with the sorts of threats that the opposition has been raising and highlighting in the parliament today.


It is not just the Australian Federal Police, the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service and the Australian Crime Commission which have felt the Labor Party's razor. All of our front-line law-and-order agencies have been savaged by this government. Eight point eight million dollars has been cut from ASIO's ability to do training and liaison, and $6.9 million was cut from the ability of ASIO to do visa checks on visa applicants, which means that, when people arrive here illegally, the chances of ASIO being able to conduct a thorough assessment are extremely limited, because of the cuts that the government has made.


AUSTRAC, the body that tracks funds coming in and out of the country to make sure that organised crime cannot move money around, has had 21 staff members cut in the previous budget. It has had $12.1 million cut over four years for so-called operational efficiencies, which will clearly impact on the ability of that agency to do its job. If you are going to cut all our front-line border protection agencies—if you are going to savage the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service, the Australian Federal Police, the Australian Crime Commission and ASIO—then you have to understand that that is going to reduce their ability to do their job. You cannot subsequently march into this parliament and laud—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Ms AE Burke
):  The member for Stirling knows that his use of the word 'you' is inappropriate. He has been here long enough to know he cannot use it in that way.




Mr KEENAN:
  Madam Deputy Speaker, I apologise. Thank you for your guidance. 


It is clearly going to affect the ability of those agencies to do the job they are tasked with by this parliament. You cannot reduce funding and resources and expect to get the same result. This is the problem with this government. Never listen to what they say, because platitudes come easily. You need to look at what they have done; they have undermined the ability of all of our front-line border protection agencies to do their jobs. You certainly cannot march in here and start lauding the efforts of those agencies. 


These cuts are felt on the streets of every electorate. When you are dealing with street crime, you are usually dealing with drug crime. When you have a border protection agency that does not have the resources necessary to protect our borders, then you are increasing the ability of criminals to bring drugs to our streets.


Every time police forces in our states go out there to do their jobs, they can be sure that they are not receiving the support they deserve from the federal government, and that the federal government's actions—cutting the front-line agencies that are supposed to be helping them—are directly making their jobs harder. All of the state police forces are aware of the extent of these cuts and of the effects they are having on their ability to fight crime.


I understand from the media that this new minister is well regarded in the New South Wales Right of the Labor Party. 




Mr Burke:
  Hear, hear!




Mr KEENAN:
  That has just been confirmed by the minister at the table. We also know that the New South Wales Right of the Labor Party is not what it used to be. When you are talking about a promising minister, it is relative to his ministerial colleagues. 



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  We also know that the MPI is not on this issue.




Mr KEENAN:
  I am directly talking about whether he is going to be a satisfactory minister for these portfolios or not. 



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  I don't see what that has to do with the MPI.




Mr KEENAN:
  The test that we need to put before the new minister is: can he reverse the cuts that have been made to the agencies that are now in his charge? We know that, if he cannot achieve that, then he cannot march in here and laud the effectiveness of the AFP, the ACC or Australian Customs and Border Protection Service when they do have a success, because the cuts made by the Labor Party are undermining the ability of those agencies to have the success that he has been lauding.


I am happy to make that commitment on behalf of the opposition. We will ensure that front-line border protection agencies and front-line law enforcement agencies will not be subject to the sorts of cuts we have seen under the Labor Party. If this minister is going to be effective, he needs to get up now and give that same commitment. 


I also give the commitment that we will reverse the savage cuts the Labor Party made to the ability of Customs to screen cargo when it comes into Australia. We will reverse that $58.1 million cut and make sure that they can screen cargo when it comes into the country and help the state police forces fight crime. He should give the same commitment.

"Clare, Jason, MP",ALP,2012-03-14,"



Mr CLARE
 (Blaxland—Minister for Home Affairs, Minister for Justice and Minister for Defence Materiel) (15:48):  Today has been a very important day for Customs and Border Protection. The arrests that occurred in Sydney yesterday and the announcements by Customs and Border Protection Service CEO, Michael Carmody, and by New South Wales Police Commissioner, Andrew Scipione, demonstrate how effective Customs and Border Protection is. I would have hoped that today both sides would congratulate the Customs and Border Protection Service, the New South Wales Police, the Australian Federal Police and the Australian Crime Commission for the work they have done together. The result of all of that work is that police have seized seven firearms, ammunition, a parcel containing 140 Glock magazines, small quantities of steroids and prohibited drugs. It is a very important seizure. On top of that, some four people were arrested. It is important because it stops guns getting onto the streets of Sydney. It has happened because of the continued close cooperation of New South Wales agencies and federal agencies. 


The Australian Crime Commission—as I said in the debate before the MPI—played a very important role in this. The Australian Crime Commission did trace analysis of a Glock weapon, linking it to weapons that were being distributed by a German firearms dealership. The Australian Federal Police played a very important role as well. Their international network, which is in the Hague, worked closely with the German federal police, the BKA. They also provided resources and investigation to support the warrants that were issued yesterday. Customs—which has been the subject of so much comment in parliament today—assisted the New South Wales Police by alerting them to the packages arriving from certain individuals from Germany during the package clearance process. They also provided officers, including detector dog teams, to assist with the execution of warrants. 


The 20-person Customs team that was involved in this investigation included 10 investigators and search officers, two operations commanders to support the combined efforts of the agencies that were in the field, four dog handlers, three computer forensic officers and an intelligence support officer. Customs, New South Wales Police, the Australian Federal Police and the Australian Crime Commission working together dismantled a criminal syndicate and stopped a number of firearms and firearms parts making their way into Australia. It is a great example of what our law enforcement agencies do and what they do best. 


Today should have been a day when we came in and congratulated them for their work. Mike Gallacher, the New South Wales Minister for Police and Emergency Services, and I have worked together on this issue to make it even more difficult for criminals to sell guns on the black market in Sydney or Adelaide or Perth—where the member for Stirling comes from. We have all been working to provide better intelligence to police so they can do their work 


Unfortunately, it has been politicised. I think that speaks volumes for this shadow minister but also speaks volumes for the police minister in New South Wales who has taken a different approach and decided that he wants to work with the federal government, and I commend him for it. It speaks volumes about the measure of that man.


Today's announcement by Commissioner Scipione and the CEO of Customs, Michael Carmody, also demonstrates the importance of firearms tracing. The tracing analysis that the Crime Commission did of this one weapon led to all of these arrests, all of these seizures and the dismantling of a criminal network.


The member for Stirling in his contribution talked about platitudes and tests. I would put to him that the real action I have taken here is to make sure that police right across the country have the information they need to do things like they did yesterday every day. I have done that by instructing the Australian Crime Commission to conduct the same sort of analysis they did for this firearm for all firearms that have been seized across the country over the past 12 months, as well as doing analysis of all of the shootings that have occurred across the country over the last 12 months. 


This is part of a national intelligence assessment that I have asked the Crime Commission to conduct. I announced that with the New South Wales government last month. It is an analysis they will do into the illegal firearms market and its links to drive-by shootings as well as to other shootings across the country over the course of the last year.


This work will provide police across the country with additional intelligence on how illicit firearms are sourced, where they have been used in different states and how better to target the people who operate this black market. The intelligence the Australian Crime Commission collected as part of the strike force that arrested four people yesterday will be now implemented and injected into this important work the Crime Commission is doing.


The preliminary results of this work, as I mentioned in the previous debate, will be presented to state attorneys-general next month, and the final report and its recommendations will be presented to state and territory police ministers in July.


To the issue of cuts—and the shadow minister made much of cuts in Customs. I can only imagine the sorts of cuts that would be needed if you had to fill a $70 billion black hole. If you are not going to cut in Customs, where would you cut? It goes to hypocrisy of the Liberal Party when it comes to this debate. Two weeks ago, as I said earlier, the shadow minister said that cutting 11 people from the senior executive service in Customs was, to use your words, 'drastic.' If 11 is drastic, then what is 12,000? Because that is what you have promised to do: sack 12,000 people.


On Q&A, the shadow Treasurer said:


For a start, 12,000 public servants in Canberra will be made redundant over a two-year period immediately upon us being elected.


That is the starting point.


The Leader of the Opposition last week said how he would do this. He said that he would set up a commission of audit. Remember what happened with the last commission of audit: it did not sack 12,000 government workers; it led to 30,000 government workers being sacked. The Leader of the Opposition went further: he said where he would make these cuts. He said one of those areas was education. He said one of those areas was health and he said one of those areas was defence, which is another part of my responsibilities here as the minister. He said the audit commission would consider:


… whether we really need 7,000 officials in the Defence Materiel Organisation, when the United Kingdom, with armed forces at least four times our size, gets by with 4,000 in the equivalent body.


To start with that claim is just plain wrong. The UK body, Defence Equipment and Support, which equips the UK's armed forces for current and future operations, does not employ 4,000 people; it employs 20,000 people. Like the men and women working in the DMO, they do very important work. These people working in Defence make sure that our troops—



Mr Keenan interjecting—




Mr CLARE:
  You are talking front-line people and affecting front-line workers. There are no front-line workers in the Australian government more important than our troops. These people in the Defence Materiel Organisation make sure that our troops in Afghanistan, East Timor and Solomon Islands have the equipment they need to do their job.


Over the last 18 months, I have seen that happen, whether it is lighter combat armour, better uniforms for our troops, upgraded safer Bushmasters—




Mr Tehan:
  You are cutting the Bushmasters.




Mr CLARE:
  That statement is just plain wrong. Whether it is the counter-rocket system that we have employed at Tarin Kowt to make sure that our troops have early warning of any rocket attack or the ground-penetrating radar system that we are providing for our troops in Afghanistan to give early warning of improvised devices on the roads—




Mr Keenan:
  On a point of order, Madam Deputy Speaker: this MPI is specifically about Labor budget cuts to Customs and Border Protection. The minister is now talking about things in relation to Afghanistan. I ask you to return him to the substance of the MPI.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Ms AE Burke
):  The minister was making relevant remarks about budget cuts. 




Mr CLARE:
  It is an MPI about cuts, but they do not like it when you ask the question: where will they cut? They have said they will cut from the Defence Materiel Organisation. Where do these people work? They do not all work in Canberra. There are 58 that work in Gippsland. There are 37 that work in west Victoria. There are 340 that work in Newcastle and 193 that work in Nowra. There are 39 that work in Cairns in the electorate of Leichhardt and 143 that work at the helicopter base at Oakey. The member for Groom would know the good work that the Defence Materiel Organisation does in his electorate. There are 161 in Edinburgh in the member for Wakefield's electorate. There are 11 in Exmouth. In Stirling and in Rockingham there are 213 DMO workers—workers that provide the equipment that our troops need to do their job. These are the sorts of workers that this opposition are planning to cut if they come to government. So whilst this shadow minister puts his hand on his heart and says that he will not make any cuts from Customs, he knows full well that there will be cuts in defence. There will be cuts to the people who provide the equipment to keep our troops safe and there will be cuts to people who work even in his own electorate. It is hypocrisy that you see evident in the work of the opposition here. 



Mr Keenan interjecting—




Mr CLARE:
  The member for Stirling says he is concerned about Customs. He should be listening to what Customs say. This is what Customs and Border Protection Command have said about your policy to turn back the boats, released in an FOI last month—he does not like it but he should sit down and take it.




Mr Keenan:
  Madam Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: the minister has been given enormously wide latitude to range over all sorts of things, except the substance of the MPI about Labor's budget cuts to Customs.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The MPI relevance rule is one that is very elastic. I did not stop him when he was straying but the minister will return to the topic before us.




Mr CLARE:
  It is a debate that includes the words 'border protection' in its title, so it is worth asking the question: what is their border protection policy? Their policy is to turn back the boats. They are concerned about Customs. What do Customs say about their policy? In an FOI released last month they said that it would lead to asylum seekers exhibiting non-compliant behaviour and that Australian Defence Force personnel tasked to implement this policy proposal would be exposed to additional hazards. That is what Customs and Border Protection Command—whom you are so concerned about supporting—say about your policy. They say that turning back the boats, the policy you stand for, would put Australian sailors in harm's way. 


Everybody has attacked this policy, from former Chief of the Defence Force, Chris Barrie, to the Indonesian ambassador. Perhaps the most important people who have criticised this policy are the Australian men and women who would have to do the job. Why? It is because it would put their lives at risk. This is what a senior naval officer said in the Australian newspaper on 25 January: 'They will disable their boats when they see us coming.'



Mr Keenan interjecting—




Mr CLARE:
  Are you not concerned about this? Are you not concerned about people dying on our seas? This is what a naval officer says about your policy: 'They will burn their boats. The policy will encourage them to do so—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  It is certainly not my policy. The minister will not use the term 'you'. 




Mr CLARE:
  This is what a senior naval officer has said about the opposition's policy: 'The policy would encourage them to do so and it would place Navy lives and refugee lives at risk.' We know this is true because it happened before—whether it was on 7 September 2001, when naval personnel boarded a vessel and were threatened and forced to withdraw; on 9 September; on 11 September; a month later with SIEV5; on 31 October; or 16 December—more sabotage, more fires, more threats of self-harm and boats not able to be turned around because it would have put the lives of Australian sailors at risk. That is what the opposition's policy would threaten to do. 


We have the chance here to do something good on Customs and Border Protection by implementing a policy that would reduce the risk of people losing their lives at sea—by implementing the Malaysia solution. The opposition just says no.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member's time has expired.




Mr Tehan:
  Thank God for that!



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member for Wannon may want to think seriously about such calls across the chamber.

"Morrison, Scott, MP",LP,2012-03-14,"



Mr MORRISON
 (Cook) (16:03):  I am pleased to speak on this matter of public importance on border protection because it is critically important. I have listened to the contribution by the minister at the table and I have some sympathy for him. I understand Mr Clare is new to the portfolio and I understand that he has been delivered an absolute hospital pass by his predecessor. I am sure one of the first things he did when he became minister was to send a little note: 'Dear colleague, thank you for the hospital pass you sent me through your maladministration of the portfolio previously.' Maybe he saved himself time by using the proforma that the current Minister for Immigration and Citizenship used when he sent a little note to Senator Evans: 'Dear Senator Evans, thank you for the hospital pass you have given me through your maladministration of the portfolio.' I will not go too heavily on the minister at the table today because I am sure his failures are ahead of him. There will be plenty of time to deal with those in the future.


This debate is about the cuts that have been made to the Customs and Border Protection Service, which are a result of the fact that this government has lost control of our borders. It has had a budget blowout on immigration alone of $3.9 billion over the last three years. When you blow that much money, because you blow your borders so badly, these are the sorts of decisions a government is forced to take.


The minister at the table made reference to what the view of the New South Wales government was. He may not be aware of what the New South Wales Premier said in question time today. He said: 'It is time the federal government stopped burying its head in the sand about the porous nature of our borders and our customs service. It's time they stopped focusing on themselves and their factional and leadership issues and it's time they started to provide this city, this state and this nation with the effective control of our borders that people have a right to expect.' 


They have a right to expect it because they got used to it under the previous Howard government. They got used to it. They were used to having a government that understood the importance of domestic national security matters and having strong borders—and having a commitment to strong borders—and having the resources in place and the policies in place to provide strong borders. There is a delusion on that side of the chamber about who is trusted to protect Australia's borders and ensure our domestic national security. It is the coalition that is trusted. It is not a theory; it is a fact. Our record is a fact. The government likes to talk about its theories and its failed policies. The coalition can simply refer to the fact. The fact is, the Australian people know that we got the job done, the policies we had worked, we will restore them and we will get the job done again if given the opportunity to do so in government. We need to understand why and how the failures on our borders caused by this government that have produced $3.9 billion in blowouts over the last few years have led to cuts being made in other areas that are putting other people at risk, as we mentioned in the House today. There were the government's decisions to abolish the Pacific solution and to abolish the processing centre at Nauru. There was the decision to reverse even the then Prime Minister's commitment to border protection before the election. Do you remember him—Prime Minister Rudd? At least 31 members on that side of the chamber remember him. They will remember that it was his commitment to turn back boats before the 2007 election. He walked away from that in a hurry.


Those in this House, and particularly those outside this House, will remember the asylum freeze that was announced by Senator Evans. That was a particularly good present that was left for the new minister for immigration after the election. It was something that led to an additional 1,200 Afghans being put into the system for six months to just sit there, which fuelled and fanned the dissension within the detention network. The Hawke-Williams review found that that played a key role in the build-up of pressures that led to the Christmas Island riots that happened a year ago this week, where the Christmas Island detention centre went up in flames. There was also the East Timor farce and there was the Malaysian failure. I refer to it as a failure because it did not work. Madam Deputy Speaker, I know you were not a great fan of the Malaysia policy of this government. There were many on that side of the chamber who were not fans of that policy.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Ms AE Burke
):  The member for Cook should not push it.




Mr MORRISON:
  Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. That policy was described as not working by none other than the member for Griffith, the former Minister for Foreign Affairs. The Minister for Foreign Affairs thought he was so convincing in his demolition of the Malaysian people swap that he should become Prime Minister again. That is what we know about this government and that minister's commitment to that policy. Then of course it was crowned with the let-them-in, let-them-out policy of the Greens, which the government introduced in late November of 2011 and which was followed by the biggest summer of boat arrivals on record—2,100 people turned up on boats in the most dangerous period of the year following the government's decision to go to mainstream community release.


I received an email not that long ago from one of my constituents who was reflecting on the government's performance in border protection. She wrote that 'this government is run by muppets'. I think that is the frustration and concern that is out there in the community about the government's handling of border protection issues. They remind me, whether it is the Minister for Immigration or his predecessor or the Prime Minister herself, of the Great Gonzo, who would get up and blow his trumpet at the end of the Muppet Show theme. It would blow up in his face every single time he did it. That has been the history of border protection policy under Labor. Their immigration policy and their border protection policy would make the Great Gonzo proud. They are muppets for many other reasons. We know muppets are controlled by faceless men. That is something the government is pretty well aware of and the Prime Minister certainly knows that. There were also the two muppets who used to sit up there in the bleachers, not unlike the two older members in the chamber sitting up there in the bleachers—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member for Cook has strayed considerably and will return to the MPI or I will invoke standing order 90 and sit him down.




Mr MORRISON:
  I will return to the topic in saying this: when they said—



Mr Tehan interjecting—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member for Wannon has got one last chance.




Mr MORRISON:
  As the show would end, one would turn to the other and say, 'Just when you think things could not get any worse'—just like the government's border protection policy—'something wonderful happens.' The other one would say 'What is that?', and he would get the reply, 'It ends.' That is what the Australian people want to see from this government; they want to see this farce end.


The budget blow-outs of $3.9 billion on this waste, mismanagement and incompetence on our borders have been catastrophic. There was a $208 million blow-out in the additional estimates of 2009-10; a $798 million blow-out in the budget estimates of 2010-11; a $472 million blow-out in the additional estimates of 2010-11; and a $1.528 billion blow-out in the budget estimates in 2011-12. In the most recent additional estimates, there was a blow-out of $866 million. That is how you get to $3.9 billion in blow-outs—by failed border protection policies; by being completely in denial.


Since the riots I referred to, a couple of things have happened. Those riots were a year ago this week. The heart of the problem we have with this government is they are in denial. Who is really running the show? Dr Hawke confirmed the view in evidence to the detention inquiry recently that the asylum seekers got a 'no' and they rioted. There was a build-up in the population within those centres in the detention network. There was a failure of the government to expand that network prior to the election and that led to considerable pressures in the system. At the end of the day, it was sparked off by the fact that a whole bunch of people got a 'no' and they rioted. What has happened since then? The rate of primary acceptance for refugee claims for IMAs has doubled; the number of protection visas given to people has tripled; and the number of 'no' decisions turned to 'yes' on appeal is four out of five. It would seem to me that the rioters got what they wanted. 


The people smugglers have certainly had what they wanted for the last four years. They have had a government with failed border protection policies. As those policies have continued to fail, as the government has continued to ramp up the costs, it has undermined the capacity, more broadly, of our border agencies—whether it is Immigration, whether it is AQIS or whether it is Customs and Border Protection—to do the job that we trust them to do. That has resulted in guns turning up in post offices in my electorate. It has resulted in guns getting into this country, and Australians are very concerned about that. That has been exposed today and the government should be ashamed of itself. (Time expired)

"Brodtmann, Gai, MP",ALP,2012-03-14,"



Ms BRODTMANN
 (Canberra) (16:14):  I cannot believe the audacity and gall of the member for Stirling putting up this matter of public importance today, particularly after the comments that were made by the shadow Treasurer and by the opposition leader in the last week and in fact over the last six months. It is absolutely outrageous. I cannot believe his gall. He has no understanding of the public service. He has no appreciation of what public servants do. He has complete disdain for the public service. He has complete disdain for public servants and he is constantly maligning them. I cannot believe it. This MPI's title should read: 'The threat posed to Australia by the opposition's planned decimation of Canberra and services to the Australian public.' That would be more accurate, because that is what the member for Stirling, particularly his leader and the shadow Treasurer, have been saying over the last week. I remind the member for Stirling of what he has been saying, which underscores their disdain for the Public Service and for public servants in this town and throughout Australia. Their crocodile tears are extraordinary; their audacity is breathtaking. Last Monday, the member for North Sydney said on 7.30:


… a lot of people in Canberra are spending a lot of time duplicating the work of the states. For example, there's a Department of Health in Canberra with over 6,000 employees. Not one of them is a doctor or not one of them is a nurse treating a patient - not one.


That is extraordinary. What could these people be doing? They are implementing government policies. They are providing support services to the doctors and nurses on the frontline of health services. They are implementing the Gillard government's $2.2 billion mental health program. That is what they are doing. He went on to say:


Well of course; if you wanna reduce the size of the government, if you wanna get rid of the waste—


that is how the member for North Sydney views public servants; that is what he thinks of the Public Service in Canberra—


if you want to keep your commitments on track, you're gonna have to make hard decisions.


So public servants throughout the country, not just here in Canberra, are thought of as duplicative and as waste. That is the view of those opposite towards public servants and the Public Service. So for them to come in here today and cry crocodile tears about the impact of supposed budget cuts on these agencies is absolutely outrageous and incredibly audacious.


On PM last Friday night, the Leader of the Opposition was speaking about his commission of audit, which is going to be absolutely wonderful. He pondered whether the federal health department really needs all of those 6,000 current staff. Then he focused on the federal education department and asked whether it needed its 5,000 current staff when the Commonwealth does not run a single school. I go back to my original point: those opposite have no understanding of what the Public Service does. They have no appreciation of the Public Service and no appreciation of public servants.


When I hear such comments, particularly those of the last week, from those opposite, I am reminded of 1996. In 1996 the Howard government got rid of 30,000 public servants. That is probably three-fifths of the population of Wagga—I think the population of Wagga is about 50,000. That is quite an extraordinary chunk of humanity that was taken out of the Public Service. The member for Cook talked about facts. The facts are that those opposite have already talked about cutting 12,000 Public Service jobs. In the last week they have talked about cutting 6,000 jobs from the department of health and another 5,000 from the education department. Just today I heard that they are looking at getting rid of the Defence Materiel Organisation. From memory, that would be about 6,500 jobs. So we are already up to 29,000 Public Service jobs that would go. That is fast approaching the 30,000 that were lost during the late nineties under the Howard government. I remind all those present today what that meant for Canberra. Canberra lost between about 15,000 and 20,000 jobs. That meant that house prices plummeted, small businesses closed down and local shops closed down. It gutted local shopping centres, which have not returned to what they were before then. It meant that Canberra went into a recession when the rest of Australia was growing. It took us years and years to recover. But the impact of those cuts was felt not just in Canberra, but in the region. If you still had a job and you could afford a holiday you might go down to the coast, where you would see that two-thirds of the houses were on the market. It had a huge ripple effect in the capital region, on Queanbeyan, Yass, Wagga, Griffith, Leeton—the whole region around here.



Mr Keenan interjecting—




Ms BRODTMANN:
  You are talking about budget cuts and the impact on jobs. This is what that means. The truth hurts. This is the future that you have for Canberra. I am putting a mirror up to you about the future of Canberra if you do what you have planned for it and the Public Service.


I remind those opposite of the reality of what is happening. We are introducing a new one-off increase in the efficiency dividend. A number of small agencies are exempt from this one-off increase. Our expectation is that agencies will cut spending in non-staff areas—for example, for consultants, contractors, travel, hospitality and entertainment, media and advertising, printing and publications—and will implement more efficient and consistent delivery of training. We have also set up a working group, comprising the CPSU and senior people from government departments, which has already met. That is looking at the impact of the efficiency dividend. We already have a strong track record on identifying efficiency reforms and making responsible savings. Since coming to government we have delivered efficiency reforms of over $10 billion. Our decision to reduce agencies' departmental capital budgets is estimated to save about $710 million over three years. This measure has had no impact on public sector jobs. Our agenda is not designed to slash Public Service jobs; that is the target of those opposite. Our policy is to make the Public Service more efficient; their policy is to make the Public Service non-existent.


I also remind those opposite, and Canberrans as well, of what happened in 1996. I was one of the people who lost their job. I was posted overseas with Foreign Affairs and my position was abolished. I came back here and had to reapply for jobs. There had been 50 jobs in the area where I was working, and that was reduced to eight jobs. At the same time, Chris had resigned from his job. He came back to an economy that was in recession and he worked part time for many years as a result of what happened to us in 1996. So I speak from experience. You throw these figures around as if they are meaningless. But these are people, these are families, these are men, women and children and a community that you want to decimate as a result of your blithe disdain for the Public Service.


I want to speak about the future plans of those opposite for the Public Service. They are going to decimate and take out all the skill sets that already exist in the Public Service. What does that mean for the services we provide for the community? There will be no services—but I suppose those opposite do not actually have any policies. So far I have counted three policies. There is paid parental leave, and there is a bit of dispute about that. There is asylum seekers, and there is a bit of a dispute about that. There has also been the announcement today on Customs, and it is good to hear that they have got a policy. We have also got the $70 billion black hole that they have got to service, and that is essentially three times the budget of Defence or two or three years of community services. It means decimation for Canberra. (Time expired)

"Kelly, Craig, MP",LP,2012-03-14,"



Mr CRAIG KELLY
 (Hughes) (16:24):  I rise to speak on today's matter of public importance: the threat to Australia posed by the government's budget cuts to Customs and Border Protection. To start with, this is a government that has been able to find money for almost every dubious cause under the sun—from Grocery Watch, to set-top boxes, to carbon tax propaganda, to the failed green loan schemes and even something called the Flannery Centre. But when it comes to something that is really important, our front-line border security, they have made cuts.


The member for Canberra gave an outstanding stand-up display on the importance of public servants. Maybe she would like to go through some of the cuts that her government has made to the Public Service. To start with, there has been a $20.8 million cut to aerial surveillance, reducing it by 2,215 hours. I thought you might like to stay and listen to these cuts that your government has imposed. Further, in 2010-11, there were 250 jobs axed from Customs, and a further 90 jobs were axed this year, for a total of 340 jobs. On top of that, we have a $9.3 million reduction in capital funding for Customs. On top of that, we have further cuts of $17.3 million over the next five years for the management of our vessels which monitor illegal fishing. Further still, in the 2009-10 budget we saw $58.1 million cut from cargo screening. Because of these cuts, we have seen an unprecedented 25 per cent cut in the number of sea cargo inspections and, remarkably, a 75 per cent cut in air cargo inspections.


But it does not stop there. There are further cuts still. We have seen funding to our National Counter-Terrorism Committee cut by $12 million, we have seen a further cut of $8.8 million from ASIO training and we have seen a further $6.9 million cut from ASIO security checks for visa applicants. We have seen all these cuts while we have had unmitigated waste in area after area.


These cuts have, of course, been great news for drug dealers, smugglers of illegal weapons, criminal gangs and terrorists. These cuts have led to the Labor government failing to protect our nation from the illegal importation of guns. In south-western Sydney, an area under siege, in the last 12 months we have had 88 drive-by shootings, including in the suburb of Panania in the electorate I represent. Just today a man appeared in the Sutherland court, a stone's throw from my electorate office, on a charge of importing 150 Glock pistols at Sylvania between August last year and yesterday, when he was charged and arrested. The comments of New South Wales Police Commissioner Scipione are quite pertinent. He said today:


I'm concerned that anyone's involved in these organised criminal groups that are in the business of trafficking guns from the other side of the world. This is a serious problem. This isn't just a border security issue, this is a national security issue. It's something that we need to understand is a major concern not only to law enforcement, it should be to every person that lives in this nation.


New South Wales Police Commissioner Scipione said it correctly: 'This is something that we need to understand is a major concern to every person that lives in our nation.' It should be a concern to every person that lives in this nation. Unfortunately, it does not appear to be a concern to members who sit on the other side of the chamber. How can any responsible government faced with this problem we have in Sydney continue to agree to slash funding to our Customs agency which results in a cut of 75 per cent to air cargo screening? The residents of south-western Sydney are currently under siege. They need something to be done by this Labor government, not cuts to border security and protection.


This recent case at Sylvania illustrates how porous our borders have been and how easy it has been for criminals to import illegal firearms into Australia without being detected by Customs screening. We heard the Minister for Home Affairs and Minister for Justice saying at the dispatch box a few minutes ago how closely he has worked with New South Wales Police Minister Mike Gallacher. Obviously the minister has not heard what the New South Wales Police Minister said today:


Police will detail ... in the coming days the full magnitude of what they have identified … and quite simply had the federal government acted earlier what could have been stopped.


Those are the comments of the New South Wales Police Minister earlier today. In the last few hours we have also had New South Wales Police confirm that one Glock pistol was seized in January and that it was only one of the 220 Glock pistols they believe were imported into Sydney and were not detected by Customs in the last three months.  So let us be clear on this. According to New South Wales Police, from this one source there have been 219 Glock pistols imported into Sydney that have not been detected by Customs and are currently on the streets of Sydney. What a concern it is for every resident to know that 219 additional Glock pistols are on their streets. Despite this we have the Labor government reducing inspections of air cargo by 75 per cent.


But the cuts do not go just to illegal importation of weapons. There are also cuts to ASIO and antiterrorist funding. It is worthwhile remembering that only in December last year we had three Islamic extremists convicted of conspiring to plan a terrorist attack on Holsworthy Barracks and they were sentenced to 18 years jail. This terrorist cell had actually planned to enter the barracks armed with military style weapons and shoot 500 people before they killed themselves. This is the reality on the streets of south-western Sydney today. Only last week an ABC News article—and I think it is worth the government of the day reading and remembering this—said:


Sydney police have seized an AK-47 assault rifle from a house in the city's south-west.


A 46-year-old man was arrested at the home on Brennan Road at Yagoona during the raid by the Middle Eastern Organised Crime Squad yesterday afternoon.


Police say they found the rifle along with a 30-round magazine and a combat helmet.


The man has been charged with possessing a prohibited firearm and not storing a firearm safely.


The gun is to undergo ballistic examination.


That was one week ago on the streets of Sydney. This is the reality of what we face in Sydney, yet despite this we have the government slashing the resources going to Customs and frontline border security. Shame, absolute shame! The member for Stirling has made it crystal clear today that the coalition will reverse these cuts that have allowed hundreds of guns onto the streets of Sydney. We will ensure that the people of Sydney are kept safe by making sure we have adequate border protection and Customs protection.


Today the minister was given the opportunity to admit that Labor had made a terrible mistake, to admit that Labor's misguided actions and cuts had imperilled the lives of every Sydneysider. They had the opportunity here today to spell out very clearly that they would immediately reverse these cuts and give Customs the resources they need. They failed to take that opportunity. The residents of Sydney need to be very clear that there are two choices: the coalition, which supports reversing these cuts and giving our Customs officials the resources that they need to make sure this 75 per cent cut to airport screening is reversed, or the government, which plans to do nothing and stand by and watch as illegal weapons are imported into Sydney in record numbers.


I will quickly turn to a short issue. This government is also cutting $34 million from passenger processing at our airports with these cuts. This simply means there will be longer and longer queues for international passengers coming into Sydney. Every Australian who is going overseas in the next 12 months needs to know that when they come back into Sydney they are going to face queues hundreds of yards long and they will be queuing for over an hour to get through Customs—all because of this government's cuts. I would suggest that this government put up a sign at the international terminal to advise everyone standing in these queues for hours that they are simply being forced to stand in them for hours because of the reckless and wasteful spending of this government. We also need to consider what effect this will have on our tourism industry. We have overseas tourists coming in after long 20-hour flights, from New York or London, who will now be forced to stand for hours in queues—so that will be further damaging our tourism industry.

Mr LAURIE FERGUSON
 (Werriwa) (16:34):  I have heard today contributions on this MPI from the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Cook, whose life experience and domicile are far distant from where these problems are happening. As a person who has represented for almost a quarter of a century the region where many of these events are occurring; as a person who has a staff member whose close relative moved out of their house, traumatised by a person being shot in the head in front of their house; as a person whose maiden speech in New South Wales politics was on gun laws; as a person who often congratulated a previous Prime Minister, John Howard, for his historic work on this effort; and as a person who has watched in recent years as New South Wales politics has degenerated into deals with the gun lobby because of their control of the upper house in that state, I very much resent today's contributions. They are contributions of histrionics, political opportunism of the worst order and rank hypocrisy.


We have all these 'experts' here today. Why do they know so much about this? They know so much about this because there has been effective policing in the last few days, with cooperation between state and federal police having uncovered this conspiracy. They were not here weeks ago saying to us that we had a massive national crisis, being the importation of illegal arms. I cannot recall them coming in here and asking this House to debate an MPI about these issues. When the opposition spokesman talked about the disappearance of 11 jobs in Customs, I did not hear him raise this as a serious matter. But back then I heard an ABC program talking about a very significant problem in this country, the theft of guns internally, and saying that many guns are disappearing from various rifle range clubs et cetera. So here today we have all this 'expertise' that the problems of western Sydney's gun homicides and shootings are about the importation of illegal arms—after we have watched the New South Wales opposition deliberately not politicise this matter. For months on end, people in the area where I live have watched and waited for some action by the New South Wales Police Force, but the opposition leader in our state has not been out there criticising the police minister over a task force raid last week by 101 police personnel that picked up, I think, four people. We have been patient, knowing that there must be a proper investigation of these matters. One would think from those experts over there that it was so simple. If you look at what has happened, we have an Austrian company, a gun dealer in Germany and a very sophisticated operation which broke down the arms and imported the various components separately. 


To think that this is a simple matter that relates to the reduction of 11 SES positions in Customs is preposterous. It is, as I say, rank hypocrisy to come in here today worrying about these shootings in Western Sydney. We have heard nothing from the spokesman opposite or any member of the opposition in the months leading up to this. We have a situation where, as many speakers have indicated, those opposite are crying today about the disappearance of 11 jobs and, at the same time, they are talking about a $70 billion deficit. The opposition leader is making some statement today in which he is going to guarantee that this area is going to be quarantined. Are they going to make a quarantine next week for education and health? This is ridiculous. Why wasn't that quarantine made in the weeks leading up to this point if it was so important? If this matter is related to gun crime in Sydney, why didn't you make that commitment before today? It is only when you are pressed about the realities of the reduction in the workforce in the public service. In the weeks leading up to this, the opposition leader referred back to the efforts of his great and glorious leader, John Howard. We know that that model led to the reduction of 30,000 jobs in this country. And they say that somehow this matter is the end of Western civilisation. 


The member for Cook made the comment, 'Our record is a fact.' The other aspect of this issue of course is border protection. What those opposite are trying to do here is connect the gun issue with the border protection issue, but they are a bit embarrassed by what has happened on that front in the last week or so. The foreign affairs spokesman for once left off the juvenile performances we have seen from her. For instance, in the Maldives a few weeks ago, people who were fighting for democracy were being bashed in the street, and she came in and related that to internal problems in the Labor Party. She has not made a comment on the situation in Syria. Now she is trying to persuade the Indonesians that the opposition leader did not really mean what he said about the coalition's immigration policies on border protection. 'Don't take any notice of what Tony Abbott says. After all, after he is elected as Prime Minister, he is going to go to Indonesia.' Let us worry about our relationship now. 


We have a situation where, as the foreign minister said yesterday, one of the tasks he has set himself is making sure the Australian people understand the fundamental importance of our relationship with Indonesia, the largest democracy in the Islamic world, the largest Islamic country. I was recently up there on a delegation and one of the points the Indonesians made to us was that we are a model of democracy that can be influential in the Arab world. During the Arab Spring they need models; they need examples. The Indonesians said that, 'We, unlike you in Australia, unlike the Americans and Canadians, cannot really influence how that is going.' That country is important internationally, it is a model for the Islamic world with regard to democracy—




Mr Danby:
  Important to Australia too.




Mr LAURIE FERGUSON:
  And it is important to Australia. In the past week the opposition foreign affairs spokeswoman had to go and try to persuade the Indonesians by saying, 'It is not really going to be a situation where they are going to tow the boats back. Don't worry about it. You do not have to cop all the problem.' 




Mr Danby:
  It's just for the Daily Telegraph. 




Mr LAURIE FERGUSON:
  'It is just for the Daily Telegraph and the Herald Sun that we are saying these things. We don't really mean it.' The Indonesian ambassador somehow was not fooled. People who have observed him over a period of time know of his sophisticated knowledge in this area. On the other hand, Indonesia is a democratic country. But in the last few weeks we have also seen some of the conditions in their detention centres, which are—as is the nature of Indonesia—being investigated by their police force. 


The opposition says that we should not make any undertakings with Malaysia because they have not signed international conventions. But, they say, 'We will send boats full of refugee claimants back to Indonesia,' which has not signed either. This same opposition says that Malaysia is so dreadful, yet Anwar Ibrahim, a major opposition leader, can have a court case and be exonerated in their judicial system. We have seen liberalisation of their political processes recently. We cannot make a deal with them to try to reduce the number of boats coming to this country because this opposition wants more boats. Despite this rhetoric, they want more boats and they want more claimants. They want more pictures of boats every day of the week. 


I have made this point before. The opposition immigration spokesman, the member for Cook, says: 'Malaysia is so dreadful. Yes, we did like sending them to Nauru when they were not signatories, but Malaysia is so dreadful.' In the past, he rushed around the place, trying to get the phone number of the Iranian ambassador to see whether he could negotiate to send them back to Iran. So it is wrong to send people to Malaysia but Iran is all right. 


This border protection policy of those opposite has recently been condemned by the European Court of Human Rights. Antonio Guterres, the former President of Portugal and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, made this comment about their policies: 


We have clearly opposed pushbacks in the Italian case in the Mediterranean in the recent past before the Libyan crisis, and we think that that is clearly a violation in relation to the '51 Convention. 


The policy of those opposite is going nowhere except for facing the Indonesians with the crisis of accommodating large numbers of people if they actually truthfully do board boats. When the member for Cook talks about his record being a fact, part of his record is that, under their regime, of the 173 vessels they intercepted they actually managed to board 12. But the other part of the problem, which the Australian people are aware of, is that when they do board those 12 vessels the personnel involved face grave dangers. This week a constituent who was part of that was talking to me about the recognition they should get for their service. We have had a variety of military and ex-military personnel tell us, in very grave terms, of the dangers they face. The Northern Territory coroner found in 2010:


It was apparently these fears that sparked a plan to burn the vessel to prevent its return to Indonesia. A fire would also necessitate rescue of the passengers by the—


Australian Defence Force—


and their transfer to an Australian vessel. 


That is the reality. Those opposite have a policy that is going to insult the Indonesians and break down a crucial relationship for this country. It is going to ignore a real possibility of reducing the number of boats that come to this country by negotiated agreement with a country that we respect, Malaysia. They are going to condemn many of the people they are supposedly so concerned about and crying about these days to Indonesian detention centres which are going to be overcrowded, the state of which has led to a police investigation by the Indonesians in the last week.

"Marino, Nola, MP",LP,2012-03-14,"



Ms MARINO
 (Forrest—Opposition Whip) (16:44):  Why are we here today discussing this matter of public importance proposed by the member for Stirling? The matter of public importance is:


The threat to Australia posed by the Government's budget cut to customs and border protection.


There is one simple reason that we are here. We are here due to one indisputable fact. The Labor government has totally lost control of Australia's borders. It is that simple. We know that 15,900 asylum seekers have arrived on illegal boats. That has put, and is putting, incredible pressure on the resources of this nation and on budgets. Why? Because this Labor government has literally trashed the successful border protection policies of the coalition government. People smugglers are using this opportunity to charge at least $10,000 per person. At the same time, we have seen that the budget for border protection has blown out by $3.9 billion. Unfortunately, Australia's ability to protect and manage its borders under this government is not only a national disgrace but also an international joke. But the joke is on Australian taxpayers.


We know that this Labor government always finds wrong answers to the important issues, whether it is climate change with the great big tax, whether it is on animal welfare in banning live exports, whether it is fiscal stimulus with the global financial crisis, coming up with deadly pink batts and the failed cash-for-clunkers scheme, or whether it is regional education where they tell country students they are independent but make them dependent on their parents' income, which was used to slash their access to independent youth allowance. If it is border protection, the Labor government's answer is to throw open the doors to people smugglers. This is on the back of very desperate people—people who put their lives at risk in leaky boats. They have literally abandoned the principles of border protection.


We know about the cuts that Labor have imposed. We know that they do not take front-line border protection seriously. If they did, we would not have seen cuts that we have. We have seen not only illegal boats but also illicit drugs and weapons. All these things have resulted from the cuts in funds and resources to Customs. We know about the cuts to aerial surveillance by $20.8 million and the loss 2215 aerial surveillance hours. That is more than 90 days. Labor have axed a further 90 staff from Customs on top of the 250 staff cut in the 2010-11 budget. Labor have cut $9.3 million in 2014 to Customs to reduce capital spending and other low-risk organisational activities, I understand. Labor are cutting $34 million over four years for passenger facilitation at Australia's eight international airports. This is not all. There are cuts of $17.3 million over five years for the management of vessels of illegal foreign fishers. In the 2009-10 budget, Labor cut the budget of Customs for cargo screening by $58.1 million. This cut to screening reduced the number of potential sea cargo inspections by 25 per cent. We wonder why we are having this debate today. When these cuts are put together, this gives us an incapacity to manage our borders. The cuts have resulted in a 75 per cent reduction of air cargo inspections. That is why we are here today. In the recent Customs annual report it was revealed that only 4.3 per cent of sea cargo is X-rayed and only 0.6 per cent of sea cargo is physically examined. Can you imagine that in relation to sea containers? What does this mean in practical terms? With even greater volumes of cargo projected for the years ahead, that means even fewer are going to be physically inspected. We have heard today about the cuts to ASIO and the various agencies. This is what we have heard today.


The government has a really poor record of defending Australia's borders and of maintaining our border protection, quarantine and biosecurity. People frequently forget that this has broad-ranging implications for Australian manufacturers of agriculture and food producers who rely on our clean image and our clean quality produce. These industries are regarded as safe and it is essential that we maintain the reputation, but it is being put at risk by the incompetent neglect of biosecurity. Australia has a unique environment that is under threat from pest and disease incursions and needs protection.


The Beale quarantine and biosecurity review must be a constant embarrassment to the government. It was commissioned by Labor and called for hundreds of millions of dollars to be spent on AQIS and quarantine annually to provide real protection for our nation's borders. But what have we seen? We have seen nothing but cuts, as the member for Stirling has said. Instead of heeding this report, the government has failed to act and has spent nearly three years since its release stripping its assets and running it down. Australia's border security is a massive Labor failure. It is a massive cost to Australian taxpayers and, unfortunately for the Labor Party, I think that all Australians are now seeing this for what it is. No wonder the government has to keep coming back to this parliament to extend the credit limit on its credit card debt ceiling of $250 billion.


People are looking for leadership to resolve this issue, and I think the member for Stirling gave that today. Instead, the Labor Party just simply wants to pretend this is not happening, that these cuts are not real and that they are not actually impacting in a very direct sense. If our leaking borders are really not damning enough, the impact of the government's incompetence goes even further. The Department of Immigration and Citizenship is bogged down because the resources are directed to managing asylum seekers. When you look at the lack of skilled people, the impact on 457 visa holders and the impact, as the member for Stirling knows, that that has in Western Australia, that is where the resources should be directed, not into areas of failed Labor government policy.


We are projected to have a shortage of 150,000 skilled workers. This is the area where the resources of the department should be allocated as well as for Customs and Border Protection. Instead, we see the opposite. In 2001 the coalition government made it perfectly clear that Australia was not a soft touch, which is what it is seen as now. It was not a soft touch when it came to border protection. In 2001, people smugglers made 43 successful incursions into Australia. In 2002, they made only one. In the last six years of the coalition government there was an average of just three boats and 50 people per year. It can be done, if there is good leadership and if you use the appropriate policies of the coalition government.


In 2008, the newly-elected Labor government threw open Australia's borders to people smugglers and here we are today with, as a direct result of that, as I said, 15,900 people and a government that has continually raided these budgets. No wonder we are here discussing this matter of public importance today. I support the measures that the member for Stirling has outlined because they reinforce to the Australian people that the coalition once again has the answers. It has the answers on border protection and it will provide strong border protection for this nation. That is the history of the coalition in government and it is one thing—besides managing the economy effectively—that the Australian people can be sure of: the coalition will be a government that provides strong border protection and confidence for the Australian people—something that is sadly lacking under this government.

"Jenkins, Harry, MP",ALP,2012-03-14,"



Mr JENKINS
 (Scullin) (16:54):  I have heard many matters of public importance but never before have I heard an MPI that has been mounted with so disjointed a case. We witnessed in question time today the build-up, which was about a successful police operation in the western suburbs of Sydney today. On closer examination, the Minister for Home Affairs indicated by way of his contribution to this debate and his contribution to the debate on the suspension of standing orders the cooperation that occurred between the Border Protection and Customs Service and the New South Wales police.


What those opposite have not done is to enter into debate in the national interest. They have entered a debate on base party-political grounds. Have a look at their contributions. I challenge people to go through the contributions of the opposition to this MPI and understand what it is that they are arguing. They argue about cuts to the budget of the Customs and Border Protection Service. They then indicate that in some mysterious way, if they were to regain the Treasury bench, they would reinstate these cuts. At the same time, the economic leadership of the coalition, if you can call it leadership, claims that they would make $70 billion more cuts. They have to get fair dinkum if they are wanting us to have a debate in the national interest. They go out there with the hidden agenda of cranking up this issue. We have honourable members talking about the 'missing guns'. It is all about 'stop the guns; stop the Glocks'—that is what they think this is about. But it is not about that. It is about explaining to people what has gone wrong.


The same member who came into this debate so authoritatively claiming that he has this number of guns missing actually related the terms of this MPI to terrorist threat. And he wants to come into this place and claim that this is a debate being conducted in the national interest. I tell you, Madam Deputy Speaker, people expect a lot better standard of debate in this place. They ask that we have a debate that is genuine, that is really about the national interest, that does not grab one police operation to be used for party-political purposes and that does not thoroughly explain to the Australian public what their alternative view is.


It must be hard for a shadow minister who has responsibility for a portfolio area, who is operating in the run-up to an election at which the opposition think they will put before the Australian public their vision as an alternative government, but who cannot be sure as a shadow minister that he can really talk about making reinstatements. In an environment where there will be more cuts, how could he? We go through all the different threads that have been used in this debate. We have had guns; we have had drive-by shootings in Western Sydney. As has been said by every government member in this matter of public importance, we deplore those incidents. What we deplore even more is the use of those occurrences for base political purposes. If we are serious about these matters, the discussions that we have here should be looking for solutions. The only thing arising from the reported actions that have been taken in Sydney today is that we have seen cooperation. We have seen some effort to minimise the way in which this sophisticated form of crime has operated. 


There has been little in this debate from the member for Stirling and the member for Cook about what is actually happening. Because this matter refers to border protection, we have heard that the government has lost control of the borders. If you lose control of the borders the implication is that there are arrivals that we do not know about, that in some way illegal arrivals cannot be detected—and nobody is arguing that, are they? Is anybody arguing that, in fact, our borders are porous. They are especially not arguing that through those who arrive on boats. If those opposite want to have an argument of a different nature about people that come here by air holding a visa and overstay, well that is a different matter. But, no, we do not have debates about that. We will not have debates about that because of the question of whether that is a failure of border control. That is the failure of our ability to be able to investigate, amongst a majority of worthwhile and genuine cases that seek visas to enter into Australia, those people that do not act in a genuine manner. 


As I said from at outset, the thing that most disappoints me about the way in which this matter of public importance is being carried out is that there has been no attempt by the coalition, in the eyes of the Australian public, to enter into a debate that is in the national interest—to enter into a debate that says we can do things better. I am not a great champion of spending cuts as my initial reaction but I would remind those opposite that sometimes they should look at the nature of cuts as against the efficiencies that have been gained. We had an honourable member talking about queues of people coming into airports. There was no discussion about new technology, no discussion of the chipped passport, no discussion of what technology has made more efficient in our processing of visitors. But, no, that does not suit their base party political purposes. 


I know, Madam Deputy Speaker, that you are very attentive in the way that you control the House at these moments. I only hope for your enjoyment, when you sit there in the chair, that we might have debates that rise above the base party political attitude and actually talk in the national interest and thrash out the way in which we might approach a very friendly nation like Indonesia, not in a way that distorts our relationship and not in the way in which the Leader of the Opposition has put it in public debate that suggests the Indonesian government does not share our concern. One of the best speeches over the last four or five years that was made in this place was by President Yudhoyono when he talked about the need for regional cooperation. It is regional cooperation about border protection of every country in the region. So let us not have performances like today, questions that suggest it is all the government's fault. First we had a false suspension of standing orders when they knew they did not have a statutory majority and now we have this matter of public importance that did not raise the level of the national interest by the contributions of those opposite.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mrs D'Ath

"Shorten, Bill, MP",ALP,2012-03-14,"



Mr SHORTEN
 (Maribyrnong—Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation and Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations) (17:03):  by leave—Every Australian who goes to work should return home safely. And in parliament, our workplace—this meeting ground of the national conversation—we are commanded by the annual death toll of people at work to get real on safety.


The latest research for the year 2009-10, compiled by Safe Work Australia and released by the government yesterday, shows that 216 Australians died at work over those 12 months and that the total cost of work related injury, illness and disease can now be assessed at more than $60 billion. The human cost, the emotional cost, is immeasurable. So I do believe it is time—it is time this parliament recognised the failings in workplace safety in our nation. It is time that we listened to more of the stories. It is time to own the statistics and do more about them. It is time to talk of the injured and the dead and of the grieving that follows each death that was needless. It is time we increased our efforts to improve our places of work and make them safer than ever before.


Each holiday season we warn ourselves about the road toll. And so we should. Each approaching Easter brings warnings about safe driving. And so we should be vigilant on our roads this Easter. But when Australians return to work from their holidays this Easter, there is another toll—one that does not get the same attention, even though it is just as important—the toll of work related deaths, injuries and disease. Already in 2012, in just 75 days, at least 25 Australian workers have been killed at work and another 20 have died as a result of someone else's work. The official confirmation of this figure will be the confirmation of human heartbreak.


Only yesterday a 22-year-old man was killed in a workplace explosion. And the day before yesterday a 42-year-old man was crushed by a metal hopper which fell off a forklift. Each year, on average, up to 300 Australians are killed at work and it is estimated conservatively that more than 2,000 will die from industrial diseases caused by exposures at work. In a recent survey conducted by the Australian Bureau of Statistics over 640,000 people reported suffering a work related injury or illness in the previous 12 months.


The personal cost to families and friends is something we only begin to understand when sitting down and listening to the grieving survivors. I have witnessed the terrible consequences of workplace deaths and serious injury—the grief and guilt, anger and despair felt by workmates, colleagues and bosses. The death of a worker in a small business can spell the end of that business. The effect on families and friends is almost indescribable. The average age of workers who are killed at work in Australia is 37. Thirty-seven years old: the age of John Christian Watson when he became our Prime Minister—our first Labor Prime Minister—in 1904. Thirty-seven: the age that Einstein discovered his theory of relativity. Thirty-seven: one year older than Cate Blanchett when she won her first Oscar. Imagine what our nation has lost through the premature deaths of our fellow Australians. Most Australians who are killed at work traumatically are men. Most 37-year-old men that I know are married and have a couple of children; they have a mum and a dad, they have brothers and sisters, they have friends and neighbours.


I remember the Beaconsfield mine tragedy and rescue. The whole of Australia willed Brant Webb and Todd Russell to be brought out of that goldmine alive. We got to know them in those two weeks—their enormous courage, their resourcefulness, but most of all their amazing good spirit and humour in the face of their terrible plight, trapped 925 metres underground beneath hundreds of tonnes of rock. We all exulted with joy and relief when they emerged smiling and waving. I witnessed the joy and relief of their families. But one miner did not make it out of that mine alive: Larry Knight. I attended his funeral. I saw how Larry's family felt; I can imagine how they are still feeling.


Every year nearly 300 workers like Larry, Brant and Todd go to work in the transport yard, the mine, the factory, the farm, the dock, the construction site or the rig and, like Larry, do not come out again. And while these traumatic fatalities—which occur mostly to men—do receive some attention, it is also timely to ask how many women at work suffer for decades under extremely poor health and safety standards—from endemic stress, fatigue or deliberate and debilitating bullying. How many of our women in the workforce are ground down by blatantly poor health and safety conditions at work? It isn't acceptable, and modern Australia should declare it unacceptable.


Yesterday we released the report Work-related traumatic injury fatalities, Australia 2009-10. This is the latest research report on the number of workers, commuters and bystanders killed each year from work-related injuries. The report is sobering and sad. The transport and agriculture industries are the highest-risk industries for workers and bystanders. Over the seven years to 2009-10, there were 450 fatalities in the transport sector, of which 345 were in road freight. Truck-related fatalities across all industries account for one in every three reported deaths. In the seven years of reporting, 567 workers have died in truck-related incidents. In 2009-10, 79 workers died while commuting to and from work and 42 bystanders died as a result of someone else's work-related activity. In fact, a total of 356 bystanders have been killed since 2003. Agriculture, forestry and fishing is another sector with an unacceptable number of fatalities—423 deaths over the seven years to 2009-10. We should never forget farms are workplaces as well as family homes, and 310 workers have died on agricultural properties since 2003-04. Nearly one-third of agricultural workers who died were over the age of 65. This is three times more than older workers killed in other industries. Not surprisingly, construction had the third highest number of fatalities with 281 in the past seven years.


We also need to consider broader measures of injury, primarily because of the lack of any rigorous statistics on the number of Australians dying from diseases caused by exposure at work, such as heart disease, respiratory disease and cancer. The number of deaths from mesothelioma alone is over 550 a year and this number is still rising. This is a nasty legacy of Australia's heavy use of asbestos. We have to ask: could the true number of work-related fatalities be much higher? I, for one, believe Australia underestimates its work toll.


Earlier this week, I also released another report entitled The cost of work-related illness and injury for Australian employers, workers and the community: 2008-09. The report provides an update of the real costs of work-related injury and illness to the Australian economy based on a range of assumptions. The highest costs result from those injuries resulting in the total or partial permanent incapacity of the worker. Costs related to these injuries are borne mainly by the worker and the community. These types of injuries make up a small proportion of the total injuries and illnesses but account for a substantial proportion of the costs. The total cost estimate includes work-related incidents like loss of earnings, loss of human capital, medical and welfare costs, costs of training and staff turnover costs. I also note work-related incidents where no human costs were incurred—near misses, property damage and loss of goodwill. These are not currently included in the total cost estimate.


A key point I want to emphasise today is that deaths and injuries are preventable. They are not accidents. It is the basics that are still killing people in Australia, things that we have known about for 60 years and more—the lack of guarding or proper guarding on machines, the absence of lights and reverse beepers on mobile plant equipment, the unsecured ladders, the faulty or absent scaffolds, or the use of toxic chemicals where there are safer substitutes.


Another important step in safety is proper communication and cooperation. This needs to include parliament regularly reporting the tragic toll. Parliament needs to join in the work of employer organisations and trade unions. The Australian trade union movement has at its core the belief that workers should be safe at work. Unions have had many wins that improve safety. But I still believe the best form of communication is to actually make improvements in the workplace and in the work process. Real changes are the most powerful form of communications.


Workers need to feel that they can raise safety issues on a daily basis without fear, discrimination or ridicule. They need the confidence to speak up. They must feel that health and safety issues will be addressed by management and that their concerns will be taken seriously and dealt with promptly. Workers' voices and their inside knowledge are all too often an untapped health and safety resource for employers: the manufacturing worker saying, 'The machine is making a different noise to the one I have heard every other day I have come here', or the underground miner saying, 'At the start of my shift, this shaft of the mine was popping rocks with a different noise to the one it has made every other day'. 


The vast majority of employers are diligent and conscientious and are horrified at the prospect of their workers being injured or worse. I know a workplace death is devastating to the employer, but we need to replace silence with cooperation. We need employers who listen, who not only take the time to communicate to their workers but also listen to their workers. We need a culture in businesses that openly respects the delivery of bad news at work and employers who act on the bad news and work with their staff to find solutions.


One woman who has experienced the tragedy of a workplace death in her family is Rohan Maheno. About 10 years ago Rohan's husband, Rex, was killed when he was run over by a concrete truck at a Queensland workplace. The impact this terrible incident had on Rohan and her family's life was immeasurable as they sought to come to terms with the effects of losing a husband, father and friend.


Knowing first-hand the consequences that losing someone in a workplace incident has on loved ones, Rohan wanted to share her personal tragedy with others, in the hope that they could learn from her story. Rohan has also worked in the construction industry for another company, Baulderstone, where her story is used in a health and safety program which places the emphasis on a 'workers learning from workers' approach and encourages an open communication between workers and managers on health and safety. Rohan visits Baulderstone worksites to spread her safety message and talk openly about her experiences. The messages 'That could have been me and my family,' and 'Working safely is about caring for your family,' are powerful motivators, highlighting the importance of workplace safety. Rohan's tireless efforts in helping her colleagues understand that incidents and injuries are preventable have won a number of awards.


Importantly, after the 'Rohan's Story' program was rolled out across the organisation in 2009 the reporting of incidents and near misses increased. Every company should know about its near misses but, unless reluctance to hear bad news is replaced by cooperation and open communication, it will be too late. Baulderstone has reported that there has been a significant shift in company culture and in fact fewer disagreements about health and safety when a work process is challenged.


There are a number of systemic problems that face many workplaces, including a poor understanding of due diligence—in other words, insufficient understanding of what managers need to know. There are a number of elements to due diligence: (1) knowledge of work health and safety matters; (2) understanding the nature of the operations of the business and the hazards and risks associated with those operations; (3) ensuring appropriate resources and processes are available to address health and safety issues; (4) dealing with information regarding incidents, hazards and risks and responding in a timely way to that information; (5) the processes for legal compliance; and (6) the need to verify the provision and use of these resources and processes.


The kinds of cultural change needed to address these kinds of systemic problems are enshrined in the model work health and safety legislation which has now been adopted by the Commonwealth, New South Wales, Queensland, the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory. Under the model legislation, workers must be given a reasonable opportunity to express their views and to raise work health and safety issues. Workers must be consulted when hazards are identified and risks are assessed and when decisions are made about eliminating or minimising those risks. This is not a regulatory burden; it is common sense and it happens in good workplaces all over Australia today.


And we should not forget the next generation, our future. Each year, tens of thousands of young people start work for the first time. They have their whole lives in front of them. Eager and inexperienced, they need careful training, coaching and helping. Young workers face a higher risk of injury than more experienced workers. None of our future generation should lose their lives before they have really started. In parliament we should echo the labour movement call that 'an injury to one is an injury to all'.


I ask leave of the House to move a motion to enable the member for Farrer to speak for 15 minutes.


Leave granted.




Mr SHORTEN:
  I move: 


That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the member for Farrer speaking in reply to the ministerial statement for a period not exceeding 15 minutes.


Question agreed to.

"Ley, Sussan, MP",LP,2012-03-14,"



Ms LEY
 (Farrer) (17:19):  I welcome the opportunity to respond on behalf of the coalition to the minister's statement. There is much that is contained in that statement that we would completely concur with. Every workplace fatality is a true tragedy. Every death in the workplace is a shocking, needless and awful waste of life. Too often it is a young life cut short. We as members and senators in the parliament of Australia should be informed of these incidents, fatalities and tragedies. And we should be obliged to consider what policy responses we might make in the face of the findings of investigative bodies.


I agree with the suggestion from the minister that parliament receive regular reports. The reports that he mentioned and that he has released should be on the reading list of members of parliament. It is just so important, with the subject matter we are dealing with, which is death in the workplace, that we do not get political and that we do not score political points. However, I do need to draw the attention of members to what I believe are some of the flaws underpinning some of what the minister said when he talked about moving towards a safer culture in the workplace.


Underpinning much of what he said are the model OH&S laws which recently passed through the federal parliament. In listening to the minister discuss the workplace, he certainly did paint a picture of what I might call traditional workplaces—farms, factories, shops and mines—where there is an employer and an employee, a boss and a worker. A reasonable listener would think that of course we should have measures to keep rogue employers in check and measures that protect vulnerable workers who might not have received proper training and who might be placed under stressful situations and be pressured to work in unsafe situations, work excessive hours or work with poor equipment and feel unable to speak up. Of course we in Australia should be able to say that we have one of the safest workplaces, generally, in the world. And, yes, a reasonable person would certainly nod their head and say that these things should be taken care of. We do want to have the best workplace safety and we want to be continually improving our workplace safety; that is a good thing. But the reality of the model work health and safety legislation—which the minister mentioned in his speech, talking about its relevance to the subject matter—is actually quite different. For a start, Victoria and WA are out. They have decided it is not for them. The Victorians have said that their system is quite good and that if everybody would like to adopt it then that is fine. South Australia is on hold and Tasmania is delayed.


With the legislation as it stands—and obviously it has not been adopted by every state—there are new obligations that managers are coming to terms with. These include extensive consultations with workers and the election of new health and safety representatives from the shop floor. No-one is saying that the new laws are bad in principle, but their application, which members on this side spoke about in great detail when they went through this parliament, is quite badly flawed. Instead of being how the minister has presented it, in relation to an employer and an employee or worker, in the OH&S laws the employer is a PCBU—a person conducting a business or undertaking. That is so that other people will be picked up by the legislation. That particularly includes independent contractors or people who may just be doing a once-only job for somebody, as well as volunteers.


The volunteer issue created a great deal of angst, because we could see that it was going to sound the death knell for some of our really good volunteer organisations. The United Church pointed to a small group of women baking Christmas puddings to raise funds for good work. They would be PCBUs under the OH&S laws, as would Meals on Wheels. Scouts Australia has expressed alarm that their employees, so to speak, have gone from 40 to 700 workers under the new OH&S legislation.


The PCBU is a totally new legal concept. It will require 15 years of judicial testing. Prosecutions under these OH&S laws are criminal in nature. The right to silence is waived. Quite honestly, I think these laws have created a monster. And I think it is important to mention them in the context of this debate, because confrontational workplaces do not generate a good safety culture. The minister's approach and the allowing of the union representation to the extent that it is now being ramped up in workplaces is going to generate some further confrontation. But confrontation does not make for a good safety culture. Confrontational unions do not make for happy workplaces. With a background in aviation I can say that there are safety management systems—there is actually a body of work that talks about safety culture. That has nothing to do with the union movement but is about changing the culture in the workplace. Much could be drawn from this to help us in applying the safety management systems that work well in flying organisations to a lot of other businesses in our community.


I would just caution the minister: please do not tie the very sensitive and very emotional issue of deaths in our workplaces to differences on both sides of the chamber. Nobody would disagree, as I said, with a substantial amount of what the minister said; it all makes perfect sense. I, as members know, am a representative of a rural and regional seat, and I know all too well the types of workplace accidents that happen on farms and in small businesses. They happen when people, particularly the owners of those businesses, are under stress. Often the people who suffer the accidents are members of the family, so it is not an issue between employer and employee as such.


So I am only too aware that the agricultural, forestry and fishing industries are over-represented in the tragic statistics of workplace fatalities. As a mother of an electrical apprentice at the time, I was most concerned when he was just starting his apprenticeship that whoever was looking after him did the job properly and that I did not hear that he had been electrocuted in a roof. I wanted to know that the fact that he might not know everything he was supposed to know would not count against him. As I have said this in this place before, I have been a member of three unions; it is not about being anti-union. I recognise the role unions have played in our history in generating safe workplaces. The shearing industry is a good example. That was a very unsafe workplace at the turn of the century and the unions contributed greatly to making it a safer place for people who worked very long hours doing manual labour in very stressful conditions. But these are the arguments of the past. I believe that the union movement today is trying to insert itself too much into the negotiations between employers and employees. I believe this government is using its occupational health and safety legislation as a platform for union interference.


Earlier I mentioned the importance of training. Training is absolutely vital. It is one of the ingredients in making a safe workplace. The Prime Minister claimed that her occupational health and safety harmonisation was a proud achievement. We pointed out at the time that it actually had not happened at all, and it still has not happened, with not all the states signing up to it. But union fingerprints were all over that legislation at the time. I did speak about the concerns we had around training when that legislation went through the federal parliament. To my mind, the more people who have access to training the better. In 2010 the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission introduced restrictive changes, resulting in a reduction in accredited courses of training of 26 per cent. These new guidelines apparently stemmed from health and safety representatives who, given the power that many hold in the workplace, may well have a vested interest in restricting access. So there you have a bill designed for safety that gives power to representatives in the workplace who have a vested interest in training bodies and that restricts and therefore reduces the availability of high-quality training. I cannot leave this debate without touching on the construction industry. The Royal Commission into the Building and Construction Industry created the Office of the Australian Building and Construction Commission. It goes without saying that the coalition believed having a firm cop on the beat undertaking compliance visits helped support a safe workplace and reduced workplace injuries and fatalities. Again, this is a body that the Gillard government is desperate to abolish. Examples of the threats that may confront this industry once more, when we remove the ABCC, were given to the Cole royal commission and they are all on the record.


I would like to conclude by saying I support the bringing to parliament of the reports and investigations into workplace fatalities. We in the coalition wholeheartedly agree, because every death in the workplace is a real tragedy, that if we can do something about it in terms of policy responses then we should. We make that commitment in good faith. However, we also need to point out to the government that the underpinnings of their occupational health and safety harmonised laws are not generating a good safety culture in the workplace. The ability of unions to be involved to the extent that they are is not about safety at all. We stand ready to make Australian workplaces safer places and to protect every worker from accidents and harm.

Mr KELVIN THOMSON
 (Wills) (17:49):  On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties I present the committee's report entitled Report 123: Treaties tabled on 13 October, 2, 22 and 24 November 2011. 


In accordance with standing order 39(f) the report was made a parliamentary paper.




Mr KELVIN THOMSON:
  by leave—Today I present the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties' Report 123, which contains the committee's views on a series of treaties which were tabled on 13 October 2011 and 2, 22 and 24 November 2011. One of the more important treaties covered in this report was the agreement to extend the existing agreement between the government of Australia and the government of the United States of America concerning the conduct of scientific balloon flights for civil research purposes until 2022. The agreement provides NASA with the use of facilities and services for balloon launchings and recoveries in Australian territory, tracking and transmission of information from each balloon, and the recording and sharing of information from these flights. 


Australia has derived significant scientific and economic benefits from activities conducted under the 2006 agreement, especially through encouraging collaboration between Australian and NASA scientists. The Australian scientific community supports continued participation in NASA's balloon program. Australian scientists have also flown their own experiments or have been collaborators with other scientists. Extending the agreement will enable Australian scientists to continue this research and will further ensure that Australia remains entitled to receive data from these experiments.


In April 2010, a NASA balloon became involved in an accident at launch, and although no-one was injured or killed this appears to have been essentially the result of good fortune. The committee was very interested to hear what measures had been put in place to ensure such an incident was not repeated and from the evidence presented during the inquiry it appears that appropriate corrective procedures have been introduced. Notwithstanding the events of April 2010, the agreement facilitating scientific balloon launches by NASA in Australia is of positive benefit to Australia. The economic, scientific and political benefits certainly justify continuing this relationship. The treaties committee has also approved a series of other treaties, including:


two agreements amending the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships;


an agreement between Australia and the European Space Agency on space vehicle tracking;


four tax information exchange agreements; and, finally,


a social security agreement between Australia and the Republic of Latvia.


This social security agreement provides for improved access to Australian and Latvian retirement benefits and greater portability of these benefits between the two countries. Improved access to benefits is an underlying principle of bilateral social security agreements where the responsibility for providing benefits is shared. Under this agreement, residence in one party's territory will not affect a person's entitlement to benefits under the legislation of the other party. People who move between Australia and Latvia will be able to do so in the knowledge that their rights to benefits are recognised in both countries.


The committee concludes that all the treaties covered in Report 123 should be supported with binding action. On behalf of the committee, I commend the report to the House.

"Prentice, Jane, MP",LP,2012-03-14,"



Mrs PRENTICE
 (Ryan) (17:53):  Road safety is a major issue in our country. Australians were outraged when 521 of our servicemen were killed in the Vietnam War between 1962 and 1975. Yet in less than twelve months on Australian roads last year more than 1,290 lives were lost, more than double the deaths in one year on Australian roads than in more than 12 years of war.


Today I rise to speak on the Road Safety Remuneration Bill 2011 and the Road Safety Remuneration (Consequential Amendments and Related Provisions) Bill 2011. The coalition is committed to improving road safety in the heavy vehicle industry and making roads safer for all road users. Indeed, the coalition has a record of supporting measures which improve conditions for drivers. It was a coalition government which created, implemented and delivered record funding levels through the AusLink program. It was the coalition which developed and promoted the crucial Roads to Recovery program and the Black Spot Program after the Keating government had cancelled it. And it was the coalition which committed to spending $100 million over five years on 100 rest areas on the AusLink network. The latter was as a result of a recommendation calling for higher quality rest stops for heavy vehicles, which came from an inquiry chaired by my colleague the member for Hinkler which delivered the report Beyond the midnight oil. It was an inquiry into managing fatigue in the transport industry. I take this opportunity to pay tribute to my colleague the member for Hinkler for the dedicated and relentless work he has put in for more than a decade to improve safety for all Australians on the road.


Despite the increased number of trucks on the road and the increased distance they travel, numbers of deaths from crashes involving articulated and heavy rigid trucks have decreased. In fact, the NSW Roads and Traffic Authority has concluded that heavy vehicle drivers are at fault in only 31 per cent of heavy vehicle crashes, with the remaining 69 per cent a result of other road users. Of course, even one death is one death too many.


The Road Safety Remuneration Bill was appropriately referred to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Infrastructure and Communications, because most people agree that there is a direct correlation between road safety and the standard and condition of our roads and highways. Sadly, however, this bill is not about road infrastructure, badly neglected by successive Labor governments in Queensland for more than 20 years. No, this legislation is about establishing a new Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal, which is to be given broad powers to investigate and set pay rates and conditions for any segment of the heavy vehicle industry.


No-one doubts the difficulties involved in driving and managing heavy vehicles. During the hearing held by the committee, the Transport Workers Union of Australia raised many varied examples of their members' needs and experiences. One example given was about the Brisbane City Council, which they praised for entrenching driver conditions as part of its garbage contract. In the lead-up to that contract being finalised, I spent five hours in a garbage truck observing firsthand the difficulties experienced by drivers, not the least of which was as a result of the previous Labor Lord Mayor's insistence on an unworkable dual bin truck system.


That firsthand experience is one of the reasons the coalition members tabled a dissenting report—because we know that a one-size bill does not suit all cases. It is very difficult to legislate for conditions which vary so much depending on different driver situations. We are concerned about so-called 'jurisdictional creep', which has seen the proposed bill extended to include intrastate courier operators, which is not supported by the evidence. We also do not believe that adding another layer of bureaucracy will improve safety outcomes but believe rather that it will lead to increased costs for industry and consumers.


This bill proposes to set up a new body and to implement new regulations and new restrictions. This bill and the associated amendments will simply cost taxpayers millions of dollars without any appreciable benefit for the road transport industry. There are already existing laws in each state, and even the Queensland Labor government opposes this bill. Members on the opposite side of the House regularly come into this chamber and say that they are 'listening' to the needs of both business and workers. This bill is further evidence that they are really not listening at all.


As a member of the Standing Committee on Infrastructure and Communications, I would like to express my appreciation to the hardworking secretariat. To Julia Morris, Kilian Perrem, Susan Dinon and Peter Pullen: thank you for your support and assistance. To everyone who made submissions, and especially those who attended the public hearing on 15 February, I thank you for your contribution. Through this process, many concerns were raised about what this bill will achieve—and we were listening.


I would therefore like to reiterate to the House the comments I made in conjunction with my coalition colleagues in the dissenting report. We understand and appreciate the original intention of these bills. We acknowledge the important work that is required to ensure that the safety and welfare of drivers is seriously considered by this parliament. We do not, however, believe that these bills appropriately address these considerations.


The government have indicated that they intend to move some amendments to this bill. It is a shame they could not manage to table them before we started to debate the bill. Indeed, I trust they now take on board the points raised in our dissenting report so we can support them. Wherever there is a move to improve safety that will truly be beneficial to drivers and to the community at large, the coalition will support such a move.


At its core, this bill will establish the Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal, which will be handed very broad powers to investigate the heavy vehicle industry and dictate the pay rates and conditions for its workers. The heavy vehicle industry itself constitutes long-distance operations, the road transport and distribution industry, the cash-in-transit industry, the waste management industry and all other road transport drivers. In doing so, it would also add to the purview of the tribunal all road transport drivers, including independent contractors. The government would then appoint to the tribunal members from Fair Work Australia. It would also comprise industry members. The tribunal could then issue orders, stipulating minimum remuneration and employment conditions, and control other industry practices such as waiting times, working hours and load limits.


There are two main reasons I oppose the main bill. Firstly, it will not perform as it was intended to perform, and it will not make the roads safer in this nation. Secondly, it creates a new layer of bureaucracy and adds to jurisdictional creep between state and federal legislation, decreasing flexibility in the industry and increasing red tape. When will this government learn that you cannot fix problems by more bureaucracy!


In the dissenting report, the coalition noted the lack of evidence that increases in remuneration will lead to an improvement in road safety outcomes. It is a merely an assertion by the government. It is also an assertion that is not even backed up by the government's own regulatory impact statement, which says 'data at this point in time is limited and being definitive around the causal link between rates and safety is difficult'. We need to be very specific here before we go about restructuring an industry. It is easy to say that remuneration rates and safety are linked, but that is not an argument per se to suggest that current remuneration rates or conditions are inadequate. Indeed, during the inquiry I noted that, even if all workers were paid at what they might consider a reasonable rate, there would still exist the competition between workers to succumb to the pressure of delivery time limits. At the margin—at the level of the individual worker—it would be difficult to determine at what level a worker suddenly decides that they are being paid enough. Every worker would like to be paid more, but it would be difficult to determine at what level a worker suddenly decides that they are not going to push through their fatigue and keep driving or when completing the job in less time no longer seems an attractive proposition. We cannot aggregate the risk attitudes of every driver in this industry and come up with a one-size-fits-all policy and regulation that will ensure safety.


The member for Bradfield also questioned during the public hearing whether a worker has time and income preferences such that they may actually decide to work the same number of hours at a higher pay rate, thereby continuing the effects of speeding and fatigue on road safety. This should also be considered in the context of the regulatory scheme under which the transport industry currently operates, and that leads me to my second issue, which is the jurisdictional creep these bills create. Currently, we have rafts of legislation at both the Commonwealth and the state levels that either directly or indirectly cover the road transport industry. Not only are these workers and their conditions subject to the Fair Work Act and its related Modern Award principles; they are also subject to workplace health and safety legislation and independent contractor legislation. There are already existing laws that apply to things like wages, conditions, vehicle standards, fatigue, speed, substance abuse, record keeping and other driver obligations.


Some, including the TWU, have argued that the current regulations are not working. But, if we take a step back and look at the entirety of what is happening in this industry, we see there have been huge reforms passed and many are in the early stages of implementation. We must consider the steps that have been taken more recently to address the specific concerns in the industry. There is the new national initiative, the National Heavy Vehicle Regulator and the national heavy vehicle law, the national fatigue management rules and the upcoming national chain of responsibility measures. These initiatives are designed to specifically address many of the safety issues. For example, the National Heavy Vehicle Regulator will commence its operations from 1 January 2013. It has been developed through many years of consultation through the Coalition of Australian Governments process, to harmonise confusing and conflicting regulations. The regulation includes a national chain of responsibility measure that will make companies directly responsible for unsafe driver behaviour. This regulator also has provisions that relate to, for example, fatigue management. The New South Wales submission to the inquiry commented that a new tribunal could, in fact, make orders that are inconsistent with the national heavy vehicle law.


For the last decade Australian governments have been trying to untangle the very confusing situation in this industry. These bills will be the fourth layer of regulation covering driver fatigue in New South Wales. Today's bills will completely undo the good work that has already been done in this area. It is also important to consider that the main bill will make the industry far less flexible and reduce its ability to adapt and respond to changing circumstances. In this industry flexibility is paramount given the huge dependence on fuel prices and the inherent volatility of global oil prices. In the previous five years to June 2011, productivity gains slumped to only 0.6 per cent per annum. A new tribunal and its road safety remuneration orders will stifle efficiency gains and innovation, reflecting the top-down wishes of the tribunal instead of current conditions which allow the industry to respond to changing conditions.


The dissenting report notes that evidence was submitted to the committee regarding a particular focus on improving road infrastructure, an increased focus with which I agree. Road transport workers have had to drive on insufferable roads for too long. I note that in Queensland the Bruce Highway has been allowed to fall into a state of disrepair by successive state Labor governments. Constantly besieged by natural disasters such as what we saw during the big wet season last year, it can be cut off for inordinate amounts of time. Fortunately, the LNP in Queensland under Campbell Newman have compiled a crisis action plan as a fundamental priority for the main highway of the state, should they win government. It is this kind of constructive action that will make an appreciable difference for road transportation industry workers and all Queenslanders.


At a federal level, the coalition recognises the importance of maintaining our national road network to ensure that our roads are accessible and safe. Since we proudly initiated the Roads to Recovery program in 2001, local councils have been able to maintain and upgrade local roads. At the last election we proposed the restoration of the strategic regional roads program which supports regional connections and creates jobs. It would mean a further $351 million for the health of the regional economy and the safety of those servicing these regional areas. These are real, important measures that the government can implement to ensure that we diminish any factors that may contribute to crashes.


To conclude, today's bills are a reflection of the power that unions have over this Labor government. The onus to prove that there is a causal link between the level of remuneration at the margin and safety on the roads has not been met. So even if I were prepared to accept that premise, we already have a raft of legislation in the states and the Commonwealth as well as new measures, some as yet untried, that have actually had proper consideration through the COAG process. These bills will simply undo all that hard work and further complicate the industry.

Mr CHAMPION
 (Wakefield) (18:06):  It is with great pleasure that I rise to speak on the Road Safety Remuneration Bill 2011, which is being debated cognately with the Road Safety (Consequential Amendments and Related Provisions) Bill 2011. At the heart of what we are debating here today is competition and how competition should be regulated. Competition is generally a beneficial thing. It improves quality, it generally makes firms more efficient and it provides benefits to consumers. Generally speaking competition is a fine thing. That is why we hear so many economists and so many politicians talking about it so often. You will often hear people singing its merits. But competition does have to be regulated appropriately. It is important in any game to have an umpire and a fair set of rules so that people play fairly. 


We have known for some time that the transport industry does need special regulation if it is to be safe and, in particular, if people are to be treated appropriately and with dignity and if people are to be remunerated properly. This is because, although competition generally acts to have a positive effect on our economy, in this area it does not. The reason it generally does not act in a beneficial way in this industry is that we have a race to the bottom. That is what you get with competition in the transport industry. That is because we have two dominant players, Coles and Woolworths. 


I had many dealings with Coles and Woolworths when I was in the retail union and in the retail industry. They are generally good employers. They have good sets of wages and conditions, particularly when you compare them to those of the rest of the world, but they are very tough on the people who deal with them. They are tough on suppliers and tough on people who sign contracts with them. I had some personal experience of this when I was a trolley collector. There was the same race to the bottom in trolley collection that we have seen in other areas of the retail business. Periodically, a contract would be put out for trolley collection services for Coles. In my case it was Coles Burnside, so I worked in a very well-to-do part of Adelaide. Contracts would be let and people would bid for those contracts, and it would simply come down to the price. That is what Coles looked for. There is not much of a quality issue in trolley collection: you either collect the trolleys or you do not. I was a young uni student at the time. What they generally compete on is wages. If there is not fair regulation of those wages then you will pretty soon find a race to the bottom. That is what happened in trolley collection in South Australia. 


We had a situation where the Caretakers and Cleaners Award applied, because generally the company that did the cleaning of the store did the trolley collection. Then some bright spark discovered that, if you split those two services, you were no longer bound by the Caretakers and Cleaners Award. What pretty soon happened is that trolley collection in South Australia became award-free. I was employed under the Caretakers and Cleaners Award in 1994, getting something like 11 or 12 bucks an hour as a casual rate. My employer did not pay any overtime and he did not pay the penalty rates he was supposed to. That is why I joined the union at the time. We found that once those companies became award-free, once they did not feel even nominally obliged to pay the award rate, wages fell to $5 or $6 an hour—and they fell very quickly, almost overnight. So you had people earning $5 or $6 an hour collecting trolleys out the front of Coles and Woolies all over the state of South Australia. You still see this today. Fair Work Australia is to be commended on some of the underpayment matters they have dealt with since award protection has been extended to those workers yet again. So I have seen what happens in a race to the bottom situation with Coles and Woolworths. Again, I am not particularly seeking to demonise them. If someone stumps up a low contract price, they would be fools not to take it. But if, in that low contract price, you are building in unfairly low wages then that is something that the whole community should be concerned about. 


We have seen this in the transport industry as well. It is an industry where you have owner-operators who do 60 per cent of the work and receive about 11 per cent of the income. We know that they are the people at the end of the chain, the people who get squeezed. Whenever people talk about efficiency or productivity in the transport industry, we know who is providing that. We know who has to work longer and work harder. There are not that many efficiency gains you can make in transport. At the end of the day you can squeeze the lemon only so hard. There are only so many costs you can reduce without starting to cut into your wages and other conditions at work. That is why we see that speed is a problem. It is not that drivers want to speed; it is that they have to to meet the conditions of their contract. It is not that they want to work long hours and be away from their friends and their families to do inordinate hours on the road; it is that they have to do long hours. It is not that they want to drive in a state of fatigue; it is because the contract requires them to. That is what this situation, this race to the bottom, generates. Of course no driver would voluntarily use illicit drugs. You would not want to think they would. It is the pressure they are put under, the economic and financial pressure, to meet payments on a truck, to meet the conditions of a contract and to try to get by in what is a cutthroat industry where someone is always going to try to cut in a little bit lower, push the envelope a bit harder, squeeze the lemon a bit tighter—or at least they think they can. Those are the sorts of tough conditions that will predominate in this industry if it is to be unregulated and if fair rules and a fair umpire are not to preside over it. We all have plenty of anecdotal stories, we have all heard them, about people who have bought trucks and have to pay banks, who have to meet the conditions of contracts and feel obligated because they are in so much debt—they are pursuing a legitimate dream that a lot of Australians have, which is to be their own boss and chart out their own economic future. It is hard to do that in an industry which is so cutthroat.


This parliament has an obligation to at least address this very difficult issue. It is not an easy issue to deal with through laws or regulations. It is still something that is going to require individuals to avail themselves of the rights that we are giving them. It will still take a strong trade union movement in this industry to make sure that these important intentions of the federal parliament are actually implemented, because we all know that once these sorts of cultures predominate they tend to be very hard to stamp out.


We know the road toll in this country takes a very bitter toll on the community, and we know that politicians on all sides want to reduce that toll. We have been very successful in doing so through regulation, through laws on drink driving, laws about drug driving, laws about seatbelts and laws about speed. Many of the same arguments that are made against this law, spurious arguments, have been made about those initiatives, but we know that they lower the road toll and lower the cost to the community. That cost is something like $2.7 billion, so it is a huge cost. In my own state of South Australia, we have seen some terrible accidents. I remember one a few years ago—this is a pretty graphic example of what we are talking about here—where a truck ploughed into a couple of cars and the driver was found to have been taking methamphetamine, or some sort of amphetamine, which had been given to him in his pay packet. So, you got your pay envelope, and in your pay envelope were the pills that you took, presumably to stay awake on the road and to meet the competitive pressures of the contracts that you were under. We have had some graphic examples in South Australia. That was probably five or six years ago, maybe a bit longer, but it is a very graphic example for the House about the problems in this industry.


I have been lobbied on this a fair bit over the years by the Transport Workers Union, including by Ray Wyatt and others in my state, who put forward a pretty passionate case. The TWU are not backwards in coming forwards, as my mother used to say. But the strongest stories come from the owner-drivers themselves, from the blokes who do the job on the road. These people have to load at transport yards and often have to put up with very long lines at retail warehouses and they get frustrated at those long lines. They have to put up with delays on our roads and meet pretty tough contracts as well. They have always been the most compelling advocates, I think, of this law.


To conclude, competition must be regulated in certain instances so that we do not have a race to the bottom. A race to the bottom is perhaps the worst form of competition that you can have. It means that the externalities, which in this case are the terrible road toll and the health, safety, welfare and wages of truck drivers, are put at risk if we have competition. They are the things that are not priced in if we have this sort of cutthroat competition at the bottom end. So competition must be regulated, it must have fair rules and it must have a fair umpire. These bills, the details of which have been spoken about for the House's benefit so I will not go over them again, are important not just for the transport industry but also for the people who drive on the roads. We want our truck drivers to be fairly remunerated. We want those owner-drivers who are the most entrepreneurial of small businessmen to be fairly compensated for their time and labour and the risk they take in borrowing money to buy trucks and the like. It is a risky endeavour and they should be compensated appropriately. This bill does that.


I just say to those opposite, I remember a quote from an old union man who was interviewed in a documentary about Red Ted Theodore. This old union bloke, who had been Red Ted's campaign manager, said, 'The conservatives have only ever had one idea—feed the donkey less and whip him harder.' My enduring hope is that the conservative parties do not revisit the rules they had in the 1930s, but rather follow the civilised capitalism of Menzies, the civilised liberalism of Menzies that my grandfather loved so much. I did not always agree with my grandfather, but he was a civilised conservative and I live in hope that the other side can perhaps find it in their common sense to support this commonsense bill.

"McCormack, Michael, MP",Nats,2012-03-14,"



Mr McCORMACK
 (Riverina) (18:21):  Road safety is of paramount importance right across Australia, particularly in regional areas where every highway, byway and single lane country road is regularly used by trucks and semitrailers. These heavy vehicles cargo fresh food from paddocks, grain from silos, fuel from refineries, livestock from saleyards and resources from mines. If it needs to be carried, carted, dumped, hauled, moved, shifted or transported, there is every likelihood a truck or trailer will be the most economical, fastest and most reliable way of getting it from point A to point B. Tarcutta, in my electorate of Riverina, is on the Hume Highway midway between Sydney and Melbourne and has long been popular in the trucking industry as a stopping and changeover point for drivers. The Australian Truck Drivers Memorial, dedicated to truck drivers who have died on the Hume Highway as well as around the country, is situated in a park at Tarcutta. Established in 1994, the memorial contains hundreds of names of truckies who never made it to their destination. Many of those truckies are locals: drivers missed forevermore by partners; fathers whose children never really got to know them; truckies gone before their time. We mourn for them. We know what an important role they played in our transport industry. We appreciate the contribution they made in keeping Australia moving. We feel for their families and the colleagues they left behind.


Truck driving is a tough occupation. It takes a dedicated individual to keep on trucking—long hours, time away from home, days without their daily creature comforts that others take for granted, high expectations, tight deadlines. It is a high pressure job. Truck driving demands commitment, diligence, discipline and unwavering concentration. The consequences of a momentary lapse in judgment or of concentration can be catastrophic. We have all seen the dreadful and heartbreaking television footage and newspaper images of what happens when trucks and cars collide. We all want the road toll to be reduced. We all want loved ones—professional drivers and any road users just going about their daily lives, shopping, mothers taking children to and from school, tourists, whatever the case might be—to return home safely.


The Road Safety Remuneration Bill 2011 and the Road Safety Remuneration (Consequential Amendments and Related Provisions) Bill 2011 will create a new tribunal, empowered to inquire into sectors, issues and practices within the road transport industry and ensure mandatory minimum rates of pay and related conditions for employed and self-employed truck drivers. Since being elected in 2007, the Labor government has been steadily moving towards the introduction of so-called 'safe' rates in the heavy vehicle industry after a long and drawn-out campaign by the powerful Transport Workers Union.


A safe rate, according to the union, is a proposal for an enforceable rate of remuneration for transport workers, determined by the government or other body deemed appropriate, to reduce accidents involving the heavy vehicle industry. But no real research has been done to prove beyond doubt that there is a link between payment to truck drivers and road accidents. The very fact that carriage of this legislation has moved from the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport to the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations exposes the real agenda behind these bills.


This is about giving trade unions more power over the transport industry and control over drivers. In time, this will filter through to cover all forms of drivers—courier drivers, mail contractors and the like. There is no causal link between money and danger to drivers. The government has revealed, only in the past hour, amendments which were apparently approved by the Labor caucus—when it was not quelling internal ructions—a fortnight ago. The lateness of these amendments is unsatisfactory and is a complete rejection of the alleged new paradigm under which this parliament is supposed to be operating.


The transport minister and the Transport Workers Union say these bills will improve safety in the road transport industry, claiming the support of Linfox, 'other good companies'—as the minister termed them, and the Australian Livestock and Rural Transporters Association to back up their argument. The purported link between pay rates and safety outcomes has been heavily questioned by the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Australian Industry Group, Australian Logistics Council, New South Wales branch of the Australian Trucking Association and the Toll Group. The Australian Livestock Markets Association is opposed to these bills because the legislation will cover its members for services which they provide gratuitously but, if these bills are enacted, they will stop doing or will have to impose a charge for.


In his 1 March media conference, the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations—also known as the minister for trade union empowerment—said:


It isn't good enough, and this country is smart enough to prevent a set of circumstances where drivers are rushing to fulfil unrealistic deadlines, they're perhaps required not to be paid for waiting time. They get very low rates of pay—some are around the order of $30,000 a year, which is barely the minimum wage in Australia. Sometimes, in order to meet the very tough deadlines, they have to take illicit substances. We think we can make safer roads for our drivers and their families, but we also believe that safer rates mean safer roads for all Australians.


Truck drivers do not have to take illicit substances. Some might choose to do so, and that is indeed unfortunate and dangerous for themselves and other road users. But the minister used very emotive language to push his message which does not paint an entirely accurate picture of the real situation. To suggest truck drivers get, as he put it, 'very low rates of pay' is perhaps using too broad a brush. Those earning only $30,000 per annum would, I suggest, be working only very casually, certainly not full-time, which was the inference the minister was making.


These bills have been criticised on a number of fronts. No connection has been made between pay rates and road safety. These bills establish another bureaucracy and will mean more red tape for businesses already bound by some of the most stringent and complex regulation in the country. These bills undermine the concept of an independent contractor. The bills' definition of road transport is way too broad. What area of the transport sector will the legislation, if passed, reach? The bills undermine other legislation being developed, including the National Heavy Vehicle Regulator and national occupational health and safety laws. The scope of road safety remuneration orders is also too broad.


These bills will generate additional confusion in the industry as, constitutionally, they will cover only 80 per cent of employee drivers and 60 per cent of owner operators. I note the member for Ryan spoke of the need for additional road funding to promote road safety. She is, of course, very correct. Governments serious about road safety ought to be doing more to improve roads and I call on federal Labor to do just that. The member for Gippsland wrote to transport companies within his electorate to canvass their views about these bills. They expressed their fears about the costs of such measures as well as doubts about the real reasons behind the moves. Freight-carrying companies in the Riverina share these genuine concerns about costs and hidden agendas. 


The member for Wakefield spoke of drivers having to speed to meet what he called cutthroat competitive deadlines. With the point-to-point average speed cameras for heavy vehicles and fixed and mobile radar these days, such drivers will not last long in the heavy vehicle industry. These bills will no doubt carry a hefty wage hike for small trucking firms and the like. These companies are already finding their bottom lines stretched to the limit, particularly in regional Australia. Last year's live cattle export fiasco hit the transport industry in western and northern Australia hard, and the carbon tax from 1 July will make another severe dent in profit margins. As with much of its legislation, the government wants to push these bills through so that they are functioning by 1 July 2012. Given the limited number of parliamentary sitting weeks before that date, the government is again rushing through legislation and failing to appropriately assess the concerns of industry.

"Husic, Ed, MP",ALP,2012-03-14,"



Mr HUSIC
 (Chifley—Government Whip) (18:31):  Regardless of our positions in this chamber, everyone would agree that it is fundamentally the right of every single person that if they leave for work safely they should return home safely. It is simply inconceivable that anyone could disagree with that proposition. However, how do we guarantee that—and I am mindful of some of the comments by the member for Grayndler and Minister for Infrastructure and Transport—when we are told that truck driving is the most dangerous industry in Australia by a factor of 10. The costs of these deaths to the country is about $2 billion per year. 


In the 12 months to June last year there were 210 fatal crashes involving trucks. Again, we say that when people leave home they should be able to return home in the same way they left—safely, in one piece. But heavy trucks account for 2.5 per cent of all vehicle registrations and 7.5 per cent of vehicle kilometres travelled, but they are involved in 15 per cent of all fatal crashes. The official record keeper, the Bureau of Infrastructure, Transport and Regional Economics, says that speed, drugs, alcohol and fatigue are often to blame. I also turn to the fact that the situation continues to get worse, not better. 


I am mindful of the submission that the Transport Workers Union made to the inquiry into the Road Safety Remuneration Bill 2011 and the Road Safety Remuneration (Consequential Amendments and Related Provisions) Bill 2011. In their submission they say:


No other industry is responsible for 330 deaths in a year. No other industry injures 5,350 people per year at the rate of 31 per day. This is an industry in the midst of a severe crisis in safety.


It is simply not getting any better because, if you look at the three years to March 2010, fatal crashes involving heavy, rigid trucks increased an average of 0.3 per cent a year. It may sound like a small amount to others, but if you are involved in that, if you are part of that 0.3 per cent and there is a family that is affected by that, you feel that in a major way. Each road death costs approximately $1.7 million. Each injury in an accident costs over $408,000. When you look the social costs of those deaths, injuries, illnesses and family breakdowns and at the pain and suffering, at some point someone has to pay for this. It is a huge burden, not just in an economic sense but in a social sense as well. 


Is it getting any better? You only need to turn to some of the recent incidents. These were picked up in the Daily Telegraph where it was quoted that earlier this year people had been found to be tampering with the speed limiters that prevent them from going over the speed limit. Trucks exceeding 115 kilometres per hour could be pulled over immediately. There have been incidents where people have been found to be tampering with their trucks for no other reason than to meet deadlines and ease the pressures that are on them. There is wide community recognition of the problem, and we have had countless inquiries. I would liken it to an excuse for inaction. People understand and get the simple proposition that if we improve safety in the trucking industry we make roads safer for everyone—for the people who travel on those roads but, importantly, for people in the trucking industry and their families. 


In 2008, the National Transport Commission—the NTC—investigated the issue of safe payments in the road transport industry and their work spurred the development of these bills. It aimed to provide a valuation with recommendations for the improvement of truck driver payment methods, working conditions and career structures to address safety issues. The widespread concern is that risks are taken and that safety is compromised to meet the demands of the job or to secure pay outcomes. One statistic that flawed me was the one that suggested that about 30 per cent of owner drivers are paid below the award rate. No-one else would accept that. If anyone else in the general community was paid that amount of money there would be an uproar. 


Again, I refer to the submission made by the TWU where they had a survey conducted last year that illustrated some of the dangerous on-road behaviours. Forty-eight per cent of drivers report almost one day a week in unpaid waiting time, and for delivery drivers it is more than 10 hours a week. Fifty-six per cent of owner drivers have had to forgo vehicle maintenance because of economic pressure and the need to keep working and the high cost of repairs. Another 27 per cent felt they had to drive too fast, and nearly 40 per cent felt pressured to drive longer than legally allowed. This is what people are saying directly from the industry, the pressures that people at the coalface feel they have to operate under. The NTC report looked at the link between remuneration and road safety, and that link was quite clear. The report found:


…the overwhelming weight of evidence indicates that commercial/industrial practices affecting road transport play a direct and significant role—


I will repeat that—


…a direct and significant role in causing hazardous practices. There is solid survey evidence linking payment levels and systems to crashes, speeding, driving while fatigued and drug use.


Yet we have the member for Riverina coming in here a few moments ago and saying that there is not enough proof. For them it has not been proved beyond any shadow of a doubt, despite all the work done, that there is any sort of link when clearly, in the absence of any contrary evidence put forward in the debate by those opposite, the work that has been undertaken shows otherwise.


It is worth making the point at this juncture that, through countless inquiries, responses to incidents, responses to the media interest that has been aroused by this, and in dealing with families that have been traumatised, there is one organisation that has continuously, passionately and determinedly pressed the case for something to be done. I want to place on the record my admiration for the Transport Workers Union of Australia—in particular Tony Sheldon, Michael Kane, who I notice up in the gallery, and my friend and colleague the New South Wales Secretary Wayne Forno. In years to come, people will be able to say that the work done by this organisation has saved their lives or spared them from injury. There are people in this chamber who say that too much power has been wielded by one organisation in this matter; but to be honest I thank God that that power has been exercised because families have not had to be traumatised by the death of their loved ones, whether they are the people driving those vehicles or general commuters involved in accidents. I congratulate the TWU for the work they have done.


The NTC report formed the platform for these bills. If you look at the objectives of the legislation, there are a number of things it seeks to do. I want in particular to draw attention to the fact that it aims to promote safety and fairness in the road transport industry by, for example, ensuring road transport drivers do not have remuneration-related incentives to work in an unsafe manner; removing remuneration-related incentives and pressures that contribute to unsafe work practices; ensuring that road transport drivers are paid for their work, including loading and unloading vehicles or waiting for someone else to load or unload their vehicles; and developing and applying reasonable and enforceable standards to the road transport industry supply chain to ensure the safety of road transport drivers.


We also seek to set up a Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal to ensure that we promote the objectives of the act and safety and fairness in the industry. It will ensure that work is done in an evidence-based and research-focused way. It will also create determinations known as road safety remuneration orders which will be in addition to any existing rights that employed drivers have under industrial instruments or that owner-drivers have under their contracts for service. These bills will ensure that the years of talk, of hand wringing, of saying something has to be done will end. We will make sure that there is something in place to resolve the issues that people in the trucking industry have had to deal with for years.


In spite of all this, when we finally get to a point where we can take action, we still have those that try to propagate myths about what this legislation will do. Some suggest that safe rates will cost consumers, ignoring the reality that every single death costs $2 million; every injury costs over $400,000. Who do people believe bears this cost? This cost is heavily borne by the families involved but it is also, ultimately, borne by the public. It is spurious to claim that the implementation of this bill would lead to costs when these costs are already being borne. The aim is to reduce the costs, economic and social, on those families. There are people that say that voluntary systems would work better, when there is simply no evidence to suggest that the voluntary systems that have been in place so far have assisted in any way, shape or form. They have had no impact to date. The death rate, the injury rate  and the incident rate continue to grow. Worse still is the argument put forward by those opposite that there is no proof that remuneration and safety are linked, when in fact a huge volume of work has been undertaken to show this. I will read an excerpt from the NTC report, quoting Professor Michael Belzer from the University of Michigan: 


The point estimates indicate that if mileage rate were to increase to $0.37 per mile, drivers would reduce their weekly hours to be in compliance with current regulations. At this rate, drivers are being compensated at a rate sufficient for them to be able to satisfy their income requirements without being induced to work in excess of mandated law.


Those opposite said in a dissenting report that they were unconvinced safe rates would lead to an improvement in road safety outcomes. They also said that the link between remuneration and safety in the transport industry has not been definitively established. They suggested that improving road infrastructure and enforcing existing laws would achieve safety improvements. This is simply an excuse to know, not act. It would be improper to reveal too much of the committee's consideration of the bills, but there was an attempt to work together within that committee. However, the dissenting report betrays the fact that none of those opposite can point to anything that they did in their time in government—when they had an opportunity to deal with this—or that they could do now, as an opposition, that would improve this situation and avoid deaths. Those opposite would rather find ways to delay—for example, requiring us to be able to establish beyond any reasonable doubt that there is a link between remuneration and safety. Until the point that we could do that, we would still have people in the trucking industry and other people using those roads dying to satisfy their demand for absolute proof that there is a link between the two—when huge volumes of work have been done to prove just that. I would argue that, if they oppose this legislation, those opposite are absolutely compelled to tell this chamber one thing that they would do to save people's lives and prevent injury. Do not tell us existing laws have to be enforced better, because the evidence suggests that even to this point people are abusing the law by either playing with speed limiters or engaging in drug use because of the very pressures they have to operate under.



Those opposite have to get serious. They have to look at the families of those truckers who have died and the families who have been injured in road accidents involving trucks and explain to them why further inaction is a recipe for anything good in the general community. They are compelled to demonstrate to this chamber what they would do to improve the situation. (Time expired)

"Kelly, Craig, MP",LP,2012-03-14,"



Mr CRAIG KELLY
 (Hughes) (18:46):  I rise tonight to speak on the Road Safety Remuneration Bill 2011 and the Road Safety (Consequential Amendments and Related Provisions) Bill 2011. Firstly, I would like to express my admiration for our nation's truck drivers. These guys—and some women—are the salt of the earth. They work long hours in isolated conditions and often in a very isolated environment away from family and friends. It is a very dangerous occupation. It is an industry in which over the last couple of years we have seen around 250 people killed and 1,000 more seriously injured. I am proud to say that on this side of the House there are several members who hold licences to drive heavy vehicles while on the other side, in the so-called workers' party, there is an absolute dearth of those who even know what a clutch is.


The purpose of this bill is to create a new government bureaucracy, to be called the Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal, which will inquire into sector issues and practices in the road transport industry and issue orders and set mandatory rates of pay and related conditions for employed and self-employed drivers. However, it should be noted that this bill will create confusion in the industry, as constitutionally the bill will not apply to over 40 per cent of owner-operators and over 20 per cent of employee drivers.


The reason behind this bill is that many of our nation's truck drivers today are being placed under undue economic pressure. One of the inherent difficulties that our nation's truck drivers face is delays—delays through roadworks, delays through accidents, delays through rain and delays through being caught in peak hour traffic. These delays can easily happen in a journey on any of our nation's roads, whether it is just across town or from one side of our continent to the other. Of the few examples I have noted, there are obviously a range of controllable and uncontrollable actions. The penalty clauses forced upon drivers, sometimes enforced from outside their contracts, do not make such distinctions.


When looking at the causes of delays, I need look no further than two nights ago when I, along with many of my New South Wales colleagues, was driving down to Canberra late on Monday night for this parliamentary sitting. There were roadworks at Marulan and the traffic was banked up for 10 kilometres. Whilst sitting in the traffic jam for over an hour meant little to me—I simply arrived here in Canberra an hour later—I could not help but notice the number of trucks that were lined up and experiencing the same set of circumstances. But what was only a slight annoyance to me was actually stripping money from the pockets of these blokes in their trucks. It was snatching food from their dinner tables, because these blokes are not fortunate enough to have a job where they sit around each night with their family. It is a tough job they have to do.


Marulan is located midway between Sydney and Canberra and it is an important trucking stop on the Sydney to Melbourne trip. That chaos on Monday night came from about 200 metres of a single lane on the Hume Highway being closed outside of peak hours. That may have been amplified by the increased road use of New South Wales parliamentarians and their staff making their way to Canberra or even Canberrans who had taken the day off for Canberra Day returning from holidays. But this was not even peak hour and we saw trucks held up for several hours, which would have delayed all the trucking between Sydney and Melbourne by several hours that day.


While these delays are inherent in the nature of the industry, the supermarket duopoly have been taking advantage of their centralised power to hold trucking companies and our drivers to ransom by giving them unreasonable deadlines and penalising them if they are delayed by even just a few minutes. I have even heard of one instance of a company being fined $50,000 because they were no more than a few minutes late with a delivery to one of the supermarket duopolists. What did the duopolist say when the company complained? They simply said, 'What can you do—take us to court?' That is unfortunately the market power that the supermarket duopoly have. They are able to act outside our laws and outside commercial practices.


Even Lindsay Fox has commented on the undue market power of the supermarket duopoly, accusing them of dictating terms and 'expecting everything for nothing'. In a recent interview in the Australian newspaper the Linfox founder offered his thoughts on the dominance of the two major supermarkets. Despite him having recently signed a new five-year deal with Coles, these are the comments he made. He said:


They are too big … You can't dictate the terms and conditions of what people have got to trade with you. And they are getting to that stage. They are trying to dictate to everyone …


They are expecting everything for nothing. They are going to crucify the farmers, crucify the bread manufacturers and if you spoke to most of the consumer goods manufacturers at the moment, you would get a very mixed response about the aspects of dealing with these companies.


We all believe in a free market, but a free market means just that: it means freedom. It means freedom in contract negotiation. It means freedom for one party to stand up and simply say 'Get stuffed' and pack their bags and walk away. But when the market becomes overly concentrated, that very freedom is taken away and others in the supply chain become nothing other than economic serfs.


So the real solution to the problem we have with the undue market pressure being put on our truck drivers—the unreasonable delivery times they are made to adhere to and the unreasonable waiting times—is what I would call the Standard Oil option—that is, to reverse the undue market concentration that has been occurring in this market for years and years. In any legislation we need to make sure we are addressing the cause of the problem and not putting a bandaid over the wound. It is obvious from the speeches from both sides of the House that the root cause of the problem—the economic pressure that is being put on our truck drivers—is the growing market concentration of the supermarket duopoly. These bills, unfortunately, do not tackle that root cause, and that is something we need to address.


I now turn to some of the other pressures our trucking industry will face in the future. While these bills look at the economic pressure on the transport industry, let us not forget the pain that every single member of this government voted to inflict on our transport industry with the world's largest carbon tax. From 1 July 2014 there will be an extra impost of 6.85c per litre on the cost of diesel. What that means for every owner-operator and for every truck that makes on average three round trips a week between Sydney and Melbourne is that $5,000 will be ripped out of their pockets. How can members of this government come in here and talk about helping truck drivers when their own policies are going to add $5,000 a year in costs onto them?


There are other issues we need to look at to improve the safety of our truck drivers. It is not just accidents. Truck drivers also face diesel pollution. We know diesel pollution is hazardous to human health. The groups that are at particular risk are industries that are especially involved in trucking. For truck drivers it is not only the pollution from their own diesel trucks but the elevated background pollution where they work—in ports, from cargo handling equipment, from ships and from locomotives. A recent investigation in California by the Coalition for Clean and Safe Ports, analysing the air quality inside truck cabs, revealed alarmingly high levels of diesel pollution and a threat to our drivers' health. Diesel engines emit a toxic brew of particulate matter as smog-forming nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds. Diesel exhaust is estimated to be responsible for 70 per cent of the total cancer risks from air pollution. Numerous studies have documented this risk. According to a recent California Air Resources Board report, trucks involved in the movement of goods were responsible for more than half of the estimated 2,400 premature deaths attributable to diesel exhaust from the Californian freight industry. Also, the monitoring of air inside cabs has found an alarmingly high level of pollution.


Again, how can we assist in making the health of our drivers better? What can we do? Firstly, diesel pollution can be reduced by regular maintenance of trucks—making sure that trucks are at their best performance. But how can we do that if in this parliament we are legislating to make truck drivers pay an extra $5,000 a year through the carbon tax? There are of course other things we can do. We can limit idling time and the time they spend waiting in queues. But, again, we cannot do that unless we balance the market power between our independent drivers and our supermarket duopoly. Too often we hear that by having such a concentrated market we get market efficiencies.


If I operate a warehouse and I have trucks coming to me, it makes my operation very efficient if I can have the trucks I need to unload lined up one by one, so that when I unload one truck another truck pulls up. That makes my operation efficient, so that is how I want to do it. On the other hand, when drivers can be so easily delayed on our roads today, that puts the burden back on those drivers—which makes them more inefficient. They have to plan their trips, they have to leave hours earlier than they normally would and they have to wait in queues, simply to make that warehouse more efficient. So while that warehouse may become more efficient, what actually happens is that our entire supply chain becomes less efficient. These are the problems we have when our market becomes overly concentrated.


The other issue we need to look at is how to improve the health, wellbeing and safety of our nation's truck drivers—and of course it gets back to diesel fuel. The diesel fuel that we currently burn in trucks has very high levels of particulate matter. There is a way of reducing that, and that is through the process of coal liquefaction. We have the capability here in Australia, with our supplies of brown coal, especially in the Latrobe Valley, to produce diesel fuel through coal liquefaction. This would have particulates reduced by about 40 per cent. If we were able to do that it would substantially increase our ability to make our trucking safer. It would reduce the particulate matter in the cabs of trucks and make drivers' health a lot better, and that is what these bills also fail to address.


In the remaining minutes I have I will say a few kind words about Mr Tony Sheldon, the head of the TWU. I do not see him up in the gallery, but I believe he has been in Parliament House for the last couple of days. I believe he has truck drivers' best interests at heart. However, I think these bills need a bit of work, Tony. I do not think they are quite there. I think we need to look at and tackle the undue power of the supermarket duopoly, because we want to see all Australian truck drivers have a fair go. We want to make sure that the truck drivers of Australia have hope, reward and opportunity, as the rest of us do, and I hope we can achieve that in the future.



The SPEAKER:  I would ask honourable members to sit down, because the honourable member is about to be advised by me that, it being 7 pm, I am about to propose the question that the House do now adjourn. The honourable member will have the opportunity of continuing his remarks at an appropriate time.

"Prentice, Jane, MP",LP,2012-03-14,"



Mrs PRENTICE
 (Ryan) (17:53):  Road safety is a major issue in our country. Australians were outraged when 521 of our servicemen were killed in the Vietnam War between 1962 and 1975. Yet in less than twelve months on Australian roads last year more than 1,290 lives were lost, more than double the deaths in one year on Australian roads than in more than 12 years of war.


Today I rise to speak on the Road Safety Remuneration Bill 2011 and the Road Safety Remuneration (Consequential Amendments and Related Provisions) Bill 2011. The coalition is committed to improving road safety in the heavy vehicle industry and making roads safer for all road users. Indeed, the coalition has a record of supporting measures which improve conditions for drivers. It was a coalition government which created, implemented and delivered record funding levels through the AusLink program. It was the coalition which developed and promoted the crucial Roads to Recovery program and the Black Spot Program after the Keating government had cancelled it. And it was the coalition which committed to spending $100 million over five years on 100 rest areas on the AusLink network. The latter was as a result of a recommendation calling for higher quality rest stops for heavy vehicles, which came from an inquiry chaired by my colleague the member for Hinkler which delivered the report Beyond the midnight oil. It was an inquiry into managing fatigue in the transport industry. I take this opportunity to pay tribute to my colleague the member for Hinkler for the dedicated and relentless work he has put in for more than a decade to improve safety for all Australians on the road.


Despite the increased number of trucks on the road and the increased distance they travel, numbers of deaths from crashes involving articulated and heavy rigid trucks have decreased. In fact, the NSW Roads and Traffic Authority has concluded that heavy vehicle drivers are at fault in only 31 per cent of heavy vehicle crashes, with the remaining 69 per cent a result of other road users. Of course, even one death is one death too many.


The Road Safety Remuneration Bill was appropriately referred to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Infrastructure and Communications, because most people agree that there is a direct correlation between road safety and the standard and condition of our roads and highways. Sadly, however, this bill is not about road infrastructure, badly neglected by successive Labor governments in Queensland for more than 20 years. No, this legislation is about establishing a new Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal, which is to be given broad powers to investigate and set pay rates and conditions for any segment of the heavy vehicle industry.


No-one doubts the difficulties involved in driving and managing heavy vehicles. During the hearing held by the committee, the Transport Workers Union of Australia raised many varied examples of their members' needs and experiences. One example given was about the Brisbane City Council, which they praised for entrenching driver conditions as part of its garbage contract. In the lead-up to that contract being finalised, I spent five hours in a garbage truck observing firsthand the difficulties experienced by drivers, not the least of which was as a result of the previous Labor Lord Mayor's insistence on an unworkable dual bin truck system.


That firsthand experience is one of the reasons the coalition members tabled a dissenting report—because we know that a one-size bill does not suit all cases. It is very difficult to legislate for conditions which vary so much depending on different driver situations. We are concerned about so-called 'jurisdictional creep', which has seen the proposed bill extended to include intrastate courier operators, which is not supported by the evidence. We also do not believe that adding another layer of bureaucracy will improve safety outcomes but believe rather that it will lead to increased costs for industry and consumers.


This bill proposes to set up a new body and to implement new regulations and new restrictions. This bill and the associated amendments will simply cost taxpayers millions of dollars without any appreciable benefit for the road transport industry. There are already existing laws in each state, and even the Queensland Labor government opposes this bill. Members on the opposite side of the House regularly come into this chamber and say that they are 'listening' to the needs of both business and workers. This bill is further evidence that they are really not listening at all.


As a member of the Standing Committee on Infrastructure and Communications, I would like to express my appreciation to the hardworking secretariat. To Julia Morris, Kilian Perrem, Susan Dinon and Peter Pullen: thank you for your support and assistance. To everyone who made submissions, and especially those who attended the public hearing on 15 February, I thank you for your contribution. Through this process, many concerns were raised about what this bill will achieve—and we were listening.


I would therefore like to reiterate to the House the comments I made in conjunction with my coalition colleagues in the dissenting report. We understand and appreciate the original intention of these bills. We acknowledge the important work that is required to ensure that the safety and welfare of drivers is seriously considered by this parliament. We do not, however, believe that these bills appropriately address these considerations.


The government have indicated that they intend to move some amendments to this bill. It is a shame they could not manage to table them before we started to debate the bill. Indeed, I trust they now take on board the points raised in our dissenting report so we can support them. Wherever there is a move to improve safety that will truly be beneficial to drivers and to the community at large, the coalition will support such a move.


At its core, this bill will establish the Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal, which will be handed very broad powers to investigate the heavy vehicle industry and dictate the pay rates and conditions for its workers. The heavy vehicle industry itself constitutes long-distance operations, the road transport and distribution industry, the cash-in-transit industry, the waste management industry and all other road transport drivers. In doing so, it would also add to the purview of the tribunal all road transport drivers, including independent contractors. The government would then appoint to the tribunal members from Fair Work Australia. It would also comprise industry members. The tribunal could then issue orders, stipulating minimum remuneration and employment conditions, and control other industry practices such as waiting times, working hours and load limits.


There are two main reasons I oppose the main bill. Firstly, it will not perform as it was intended to perform, and it will not make the roads safer in this nation. Secondly, it creates a new layer of bureaucracy and adds to jurisdictional creep between state and federal legislation, decreasing flexibility in the industry and increasing red tape. When will this government learn that you cannot fix problems by more bureaucracy!


In the dissenting report, the coalition noted the lack of evidence that increases in remuneration will lead to an improvement in road safety outcomes. It is a merely an assertion by the government. It is also an assertion that is not even backed up by the government's own regulatory impact statement, which says 'data at this point in time is limited and being definitive around the causal link between rates and safety is difficult'. We need to be very specific here before we go about restructuring an industry. It is easy to say that remuneration rates and safety are linked, but that is not an argument per se to suggest that current remuneration rates or conditions are inadequate. Indeed, during the inquiry I noted that, even if all workers were paid at what they might consider a reasonable rate, there would still exist the competition between workers to succumb to the pressure of delivery time limits. At the margin—at the level of the individual worker—it would be difficult to determine at what level a worker suddenly decides that they are being paid enough. Every worker would like to be paid more, but it would be difficult to determine at what level a worker suddenly decides that they are not going to push through their fatigue and keep driving or when completing the job in less time no longer seems an attractive proposition. We cannot aggregate the risk attitudes of every driver in this industry and come up with a one-size-fits-all policy and regulation that will ensure safety.


The member for Bradfield also questioned during the public hearing whether a worker has time and income preferences such that they may actually decide to work the same number of hours at a higher pay rate, thereby continuing the effects of speeding and fatigue on road safety. This should also be considered in the context of the regulatory scheme under which the transport industry currently operates, and that leads me to my second issue, which is the jurisdictional creep these bills create. Currently, we have rafts of legislation at both the Commonwealth and the state levels that either directly or indirectly cover the road transport industry. Not only are these workers and their conditions subject to the Fair Work Act and its related Modern Award principles; they are also subject to workplace health and safety legislation and independent contractor legislation. There are already existing laws that apply to things like wages, conditions, vehicle standards, fatigue, speed, substance abuse, record keeping and other driver obligations.


Some, including the TWU, have argued that the current regulations are not working. But, if we take a step back and look at the entirety of what is happening in this industry, we see there have been huge reforms passed and many are in the early stages of implementation. We must consider the steps that have been taken more recently to address the specific concerns in the industry. There is the new national initiative, the National Heavy Vehicle Regulator and the national heavy vehicle law, the national fatigue management rules and the upcoming national chain of responsibility measures. These initiatives are designed to specifically address many of the safety issues. For example, the National Heavy Vehicle Regulator will commence its operations from 1 January 2013. It has been developed through many years of consultation through the Coalition of Australian Governments process, to harmonise confusing and conflicting regulations. The regulation includes a national chain of responsibility measure that will make companies directly responsible for unsafe driver behaviour. This regulator also has provisions that relate to, for example, fatigue management. The New South Wales submission to the inquiry commented that a new tribunal could, in fact, make orders that are inconsistent with the national heavy vehicle law.


For the last decade Australian governments have been trying to untangle the very confusing situation in this industry. These bills will be the fourth layer of regulation covering driver fatigue in New South Wales. Today's bills will completely undo the good work that has already been done in this area. It is also important to consider that the main bill will make the industry far less flexible and reduce its ability to adapt and respond to changing circumstances. In this industry flexibility is paramount given the huge dependence on fuel prices and the inherent volatility of global oil prices. In the previous five years to June 2011, productivity gains slumped to only 0.6 per cent per annum. A new tribunal and its road safety remuneration orders will stifle efficiency gains and innovation, reflecting the top-down wishes of the tribunal instead of current conditions which allow the industry to respond to changing conditions.


The dissenting report notes that evidence was submitted to the committee regarding a particular focus on improving road infrastructure, an increased focus with which I agree. Road transport workers have had to drive on insufferable roads for too long. I note that in Queensland the Bruce Highway has been allowed to fall into a state of disrepair by successive state Labor governments. Constantly besieged by natural disasters such as what we saw during the big wet season last year, it can be cut off for inordinate amounts of time. Fortunately, the LNP in Queensland under Campbell Newman have compiled a crisis action plan as a fundamental priority for the main highway of the state, should they win government. It is this kind of constructive action that will make an appreciable difference for road transportation industry workers and all Queenslanders.


At a federal level, the coalition recognises the importance of maintaining our national road network to ensure that our roads are accessible and safe. Since we proudly initiated the Roads to Recovery program in 2001, local councils have been able to maintain and upgrade local roads. At the last election we proposed the restoration of the strategic regional roads program which supports regional connections and creates jobs. It would mean a further $351 million for the health of the regional economy and the safety of those servicing these regional areas. These are real, important measures that the government can implement to ensure that we diminish any factors that may contribute to crashes.


To conclude, today's bills are a reflection of the power that unions have over this Labor government. The onus to prove that there is a causal link between the level of remuneration at the margin and safety on the roads has not been met. So even if I were prepared to accept that premise, we already have a raft of legislation in the states and the Commonwealth as well as new measures, some as yet untried, that have actually had proper consideration through the COAG process. These bills will simply undo all that hard work and further complicate the industry.

"Champion, Nick, MP",ALP,2012-03-14,"



Mr CHAMPION
 (Wakefield) (18:06):  It is with great pleasure that I rise to speak on the Road Safety Remuneration Bill 2011, which is being debated cognately with the Road Safety (Consequential Amendments and Related Provisions) Bill 2011. At the heart of what we are debating here today is competition and how competition should be regulated. Competition is generally a beneficial thing. It improves quality, it generally makes firms more efficient and it provides benefits to consumers. Generally speaking competition is a fine thing. That is why we hear so many economists and so many politicians talking about it so often. You will often hear people singing its merits. But competition does have to be regulated appropriately. It is important in any game to have an umpire and a fair set of rules so that people play fairly. 


We have known for some time that the transport industry does need special regulation if it is to be safe and, in particular, if people are to be treated appropriately and with dignity and if people are to be remunerated properly. This is because, although competition generally acts to have a positive effect on our economy, in this area it does not. The reason it generally does not act in a beneficial way in this industry is that we have a race to the bottom. That is what you get with competition in the transport industry. That is because we have two dominant players, Coles and Woolworths. 


I had many dealings with Coles and Woolworths when I was in the retail union and in the retail industry. They are generally good employers. They have good sets of wages and conditions, particularly when you compare them to those of the rest of the world, but they are very tough on the people who deal with them. They are tough on suppliers and tough on people who sign contracts with them. I had some personal experience of this when I was a trolley collector. There was the same race to the bottom in trolley collection that we have seen in other areas of the retail business. Periodically, a contract would be put out for trolley collection services for Coles. In my case it was Coles Burnside, so I worked in a very well-to-do part of Adelaide. Contracts would be let and people would bid for those contracts, and it would simply come down to the price. That is what Coles looked for. There is not much of a quality issue in trolley collection: you either collect the trolleys or you do not. I was a young uni student at the time. What they generally compete on is wages. If there is not fair regulation of those wages then you will pretty soon find a race to the bottom. That is what happened in trolley collection in South Australia. 


We had a situation where the Caretakers and Cleaners Award applied, because generally the company that did the cleaning of the store did the trolley collection. Then some bright spark discovered that, if you split those two services, you were no longer bound by the Caretakers and Cleaners Award. What pretty soon happened is that trolley collection in South Australia became award-free. I was employed under the Caretakers and Cleaners Award in 1994, getting something like 11 or 12 bucks an hour as a casual rate. My employer did not pay any overtime and he did not pay the penalty rates he was supposed to. That is why I joined the union at the time. We found that once those companies became award-free, once they did not feel even nominally obliged to pay the award rate, wages fell to $5 or $6 an hour—and they fell very quickly, almost overnight. So you had people earning $5 or $6 an hour collecting trolleys out the front of Coles and Woolies all over the state of South Australia. You still see this today. Fair Work Australia is to be commended on some of the underpayment matters they have dealt with since award protection has been extended to those workers yet again. So I have seen what happens in a race to the bottom situation with Coles and Woolworths. Again, I am not particularly seeking to demonise them. If someone stumps up a low contract price, they would be fools not to take it. But if, in that low contract price, you are building in unfairly low wages then that is something that the whole community should be concerned about. 


We have seen this in the transport industry as well. It is an industry where you have owner-operators who do 60 per cent of the work and receive about 11 per cent of the income. We know that they are the people at the end of the chain, the people who get squeezed. Whenever people talk about efficiency or productivity in the transport industry, we know who is providing that. We know who has to work longer and work harder. There are not that many efficiency gains you can make in transport. At the end of the day you can squeeze the lemon only so hard. There are only so many costs you can reduce without starting to cut into your wages and other conditions at work. That is why we see that speed is a problem. It is not that drivers want to speed; it is that they have to to meet the conditions of their contract. It is not that they want to work long hours and be away from their friends and their families to do inordinate hours on the road; it is that they have to do long hours. It is not that they want to drive in a state of fatigue; it is because the contract requires them to. That is what this situation, this race to the bottom, generates. Of course no driver would voluntarily use illicit drugs. You would not want to think they would. It is the pressure they are put under, the economic and financial pressure, to meet payments on a truck, to meet the conditions of a contract and to try to get by in what is a cutthroat industry where someone is always going to try to cut in a little bit lower, push the envelope a bit harder, squeeze the lemon a bit tighter—or at least they think they can. Those are the sorts of tough conditions that will predominate in this industry if it is to be unregulated and if fair rules and a fair umpire are not to preside over it. We all have plenty of anecdotal stories, we have all heard them, about people who have bought trucks and have to pay banks, who have to meet the conditions of contracts and feel obligated because they are in so much debt—they are pursuing a legitimate dream that a lot of Australians have, which is to be their own boss and chart out their own economic future. It is hard to do that in an industry which is so cutthroat.


This parliament has an obligation to at least address this very difficult issue. It is not an easy issue to deal with through laws or regulations. It is still something that is going to require individuals to avail themselves of the rights that we are giving them. It will still take a strong trade union movement in this industry to make sure that these important intentions of the federal parliament are actually implemented, because we all know that once these sorts of cultures predominate they tend to be very hard to stamp out.


We know the road toll in this country takes a very bitter toll on the community, and we know that politicians on all sides want to reduce that toll. We have been very successful in doing so through regulation, through laws on drink driving, laws about drug driving, laws about seatbelts and laws about speed. Many of the same arguments that are made against this law, spurious arguments, have been made about those initiatives, but we know that they lower the road toll and lower the cost to the community. That cost is something like $2.7 billion, so it is a huge cost. In my own state of South Australia, we have seen some terrible accidents. I remember one a few years ago—this is a pretty graphic example of what we are talking about here—where a truck ploughed into a couple of cars and the driver was found to have been taking methamphetamine, or some sort of amphetamine, which had been given to him in his pay packet. So, you got your pay envelope, and in your pay envelope were the pills that you took, presumably to stay awake on the road and to meet the competitive pressures of the contracts that you were under. We have had some graphic examples in South Australia. That was probably five or six years ago, maybe a bit longer, but it is a very graphic example for the House about the problems in this industry.


I have been lobbied on this a fair bit over the years by the Transport Workers Union, including by Ray Wyatt and others in my state, who put forward a pretty passionate case. The TWU are not backwards in coming forwards, as my mother used to say. But the strongest stories come from the owner-drivers themselves, from the blokes who do the job on the road. These people have to load at transport yards and often have to put up with very long lines at retail warehouses and they get frustrated at those long lines. They have to put up with delays on our roads and meet pretty tough contracts as well. They have always been the most compelling advocates, I think, of this law.


To conclude, competition must be regulated in certain instances so that we do not have a race to the bottom. A race to the bottom is perhaps the worst form of competition that you can have. It means that the externalities, which in this case are the terrible road toll and the health, safety, welfare and wages of truck drivers, are put at risk if we have competition. They are the things that are not priced in if we have this sort of cutthroat competition at the bottom end. So competition must be regulated, it must have fair rules and it must have a fair umpire. These bills, the details of which have been spoken about for the House's benefit so I will not go over them again, are important not just for the transport industry but also for the people who drive on the roads. We want our truck drivers to be fairly remunerated. We want those owner-drivers who are the most entrepreneurial of small businessmen to be fairly compensated for their time and labour and the risk they take in borrowing money to buy trucks and the like. It is a risky endeavour and they should be compensated appropriately. This bill does that.


I just say to those opposite, I remember a quote from an old union man who was interviewed in a documentary about Red Ted Theodore. This old union bloke, who had been Red Ted's campaign manager, said, 'The conservatives have only ever had one idea—feed the donkey less and whip him harder.' My enduring hope is that the conservative parties do not revisit the rules they had in the 1930s, but rather follow the civilised capitalism of Menzies, the civilised liberalism of Menzies that my grandfather loved so much. I did not always agree with my grandfather, but he was a civilised conservative and I live in hope that the other side can perhaps find it in their common sense to support this commonsense bill.

"McCormack, Michael, MP",Nats,2012-03-14,"



Mr McCORMACK
 (Riverina) (18:21):  Road safety is of paramount importance right across Australia, particularly in regional areas where every highway, byway and single lane country road is regularly used by trucks and semitrailers. These heavy vehicles cargo fresh food from paddocks, grain from silos, fuel from refineries, livestock from saleyards and resources from mines. If it needs to be carried, carted, dumped, hauled, moved, shifted or transported, there is every likelihood a truck or trailer will be the most economical, fastest and most reliable way of getting it from point A to point B. Tarcutta, in my electorate of Riverina, is on the Hume Highway midway between Sydney and Melbourne and has long been popular in the trucking industry as a stopping and changeover point for drivers. The Australian Truck Drivers Memorial, dedicated to truck drivers who have died on the Hume Highway as well as around the country, is situated in a park at Tarcutta. Established in 1994, the memorial contains hundreds of names of truckies who never made it to their destination. Many of those truckies are locals: drivers missed forevermore by partners; fathers whose children never really got to know them; truckies gone before their time. We mourn for them. We know what an important role they played in our transport industry. We appreciate the contribution they made in keeping Australia moving. We feel for their families and the colleagues they left behind.


Truck driving is a tough occupation. It takes a dedicated individual to keep on trucking—long hours, time away from home, days without their daily creature comforts that others take for granted, high expectations, tight deadlines. It is a high pressure job. Truck driving demands commitment, diligence, discipline and unwavering concentration. The consequences of a momentary lapse in judgment or of concentration can be catastrophic. We have all seen the dreadful and heartbreaking television footage and newspaper images of what happens when trucks and cars collide. We all want the road toll to be reduced. We all want loved ones—professional drivers and any road users just going about their daily lives, shopping, mothers taking children to and from school, tourists, whatever the case might be—to return home safely.


The Road Safety Remuneration Bill 2011 and the Road Safety Remuneration (Consequential Amendments and Related Provisions) Bill 2011 will create a new tribunal, empowered to inquire into sectors, issues and practices within the road transport industry and ensure mandatory minimum rates of pay and related conditions for employed and self-employed truck drivers. Since being elected in 2007, the Labor government has been steadily moving towards the introduction of so-called 'safe' rates in the heavy vehicle industry after a long and drawn-out campaign by the powerful Transport Workers Union.


A safe rate, according to the union, is a proposal for an enforceable rate of remuneration for transport workers, determined by the government or other body deemed appropriate, to reduce accidents involving the heavy vehicle industry. But no real research has been done to prove beyond doubt that there is a link between payment to truck drivers and road accidents. The very fact that carriage of this legislation has moved from the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport to the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations exposes the real agenda behind these bills.


This is about giving trade unions more power over the transport industry and control over drivers. In time, this will filter through to cover all forms of drivers—courier drivers, mail contractors and the like. There is no causal link between money and danger to drivers. The government has revealed, only in the past hour, amendments which were apparently approved by the Labor caucus—when it was not quelling internal ructions—a fortnight ago. The lateness of these amendments is unsatisfactory and is a complete rejection of the alleged new paradigm under which this parliament is supposed to be operating.


The transport minister and the Transport Workers Union say these bills will improve safety in the road transport industry, claiming the support of Linfox, 'other good companies'—as the minister termed them, and the Australian Livestock and Rural Transporters Association to back up their argument. The purported link between pay rates and safety outcomes has been heavily questioned by the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Australian Industry Group, Australian Logistics Council, New South Wales branch of the Australian Trucking Association and the Toll Group. The Australian Livestock Markets Association is opposed to these bills because the legislation will cover its members for services which they provide gratuitously but, if these bills are enacted, they will stop doing or will have to impose a charge for.


In his 1 March media conference, the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations—also known as the minister for trade union empowerment—said:


It isn't good enough, and this country is smart enough to prevent a set of circumstances where drivers are rushing to fulfil unrealistic deadlines, they're perhaps required not to be paid for waiting time. They get very low rates of pay—some are around the order of $30,000 a year, which is barely the minimum wage in Australia. Sometimes, in order to meet the very tough deadlines, they have to take illicit substances. We think we can make safer roads for our drivers and their families, but we also believe that safer rates mean safer roads for all Australians.


Truck drivers do not have to take illicit substances. Some might choose to do so, and that is indeed unfortunate and dangerous for themselves and other road users. But the minister used very emotive language to push his message which does not paint an entirely accurate picture of the real situation. To suggest truck drivers get, as he put it, 'very low rates of pay' is perhaps using too broad a brush. Those earning only $30,000 per annum would, I suggest, be working only very casually, certainly not full-time, which was the inference the minister was making.


These bills have been criticised on a number of fronts. No connection has been made between pay rates and road safety. These bills establish another bureaucracy and will mean more red tape for businesses already bound by some of the most stringent and complex regulation in the country. These bills undermine the concept of an independent contractor. The bills' definition of road transport is way too broad. What area of the transport sector will the legislation, if passed, reach? The bills undermine other legislation being developed, including the National Heavy Vehicle Regulator and national occupational health and safety laws. The scope of road safety remuneration orders is also too broad.


These bills will generate additional confusion in the industry as, constitutionally, they will cover only 80 per cent of employee drivers and 60 per cent of owner operators. I note the member for Ryan spoke of the need for additional road funding to promote road safety. She is, of course, very correct. Governments serious about road safety ought to be doing more to improve roads and I call on federal Labor to do just that. The member for Gippsland wrote to transport companies within his electorate to canvass their views about these bills. They expressed their fears about the costs of such measures as well as doubts about the real reasons behind the moves. Freight-carrying companies in the Riverina share these genuine concerns about costs and hidden agendas. 


The member for Wakefield spoke of drivers having to speed to meet what he called cutthroat competitive deadlines. With the point-to-point average speed cameras for heavy vehicles and fixed and mobile radar these days, such drivers will not last long in the heavy vehicle industry. These bills will no doubt carry a hefty wage hike for small trucking firms and the like. These companies are already finding their bottom lines stretched to the limit, particularly in regional Australia. Last year's live cattle export fiasco hit the transport industry in western and northern Australia hard, and the carbon tax from 1 July will make another severe dent in profit margins. As with much of its legislation, the government wants to push these bills through so that they are functioning by 1 July 2012. Given the limited number of parliamentary sitting weeks before that date, the government is again rushing through legislation and failing to appropriately assess the concerns of industry.

"Husic, Ed, MP",ALP,2012-03-14,"



Mr HUSIC
 (Chifley—Government Whip) (18:31):  Regardless of our positions in this chamber, everyone would agree that it is fundamentally the right of every single person that if they leave for work safely they should return home safely. It is simply inconceivable that anyone could disagree with that proposition. However, how do we guarantee that—and I am mindful of some of the comments by the member for Grayndler and Minister for Infrastructure and Transport—when we are told that truck driving is the most dangerous industry in Australia by a factor of 10. The costs of these deaths to the country is about $2 billion per year. 


In the 12 months to June last year there were 210 fatal crashes involving trucks. Again, we say that when people leave home they should be able to return home in the same way they left—safely, in one piece. But heavy trucks account for 2.5 per cent of all vehicle registrations and 7.5 per cent of vehicle kilometres travelled, but they are involved in 15 per cent of all fatal crashes. The official record keeper, the Bureau of Infrastructure, Transport and Regional Economics, says that speed, drugs, alcohol and fatigue are often to blame. I also turn to the fact that the situation continues to get worse, not better. 


I am mindful of the submission that the Transport Workers Union made to the inquiry into the Road Safety Remuneration Bill 2011 and the Road Safety Remuneration (Consequential Amendments and Related Provisions) Bill 2011. In their submission they say:


No other industry is responsible for 330 deaths in a year. No other industry injures 5,350 people per year at the rate of 31 per day. This is an industry in the midst of a severe crisis in safety.


It is simply not getting any better because, if you look at the three years to March 2010, fatal crashes involving heavy, rigid trucks increased an average of 0.3 per cent a year. It may sound like a small amount to others, but if you are involved in that, if you are part of that 0.3 per cent and there is a family that is affected by that, you feel that in a major way. Each road death costs approximately $1.7 million. Each injury in an accident costs over $408,000. When you look the social costs of those deaths, injuries, illnesses and family breakdowns and at the pain and suffering, at some point someone has to pay for this. It is a huge burden, not just in an economic sense but in a social sense as well. 


Is it getting any better? You only need to turn to some of the recent incidents. These were picked up in the Daily Telegraph where it was quoted that earlier this year people had been found to be tampering with the speed limiters that prevent them from going over the speed limit. Trucks exceeding 115 kilometres per hour could be pulled over immediately. There have been incidents where people have been found to be tampering with their trucks for no other reason than to meet deadlines and ease the pressures that are on them. There is wide community recognition of the problem, and we have had countless inquiries. I would liken it to an excuse for inaction. People understand and get the simple proposition that if we improve safety in the trucking industry we make roads safer for everyone—for the people who travel on those roads but, importantly, for people in the trucking industry and their families. 


In 2008, the National Transport Commission—the NTC—investigated the issue of safe payments in the road transport industry and their work spurred the development of these bills. It aimed to provide a valuation with recommendations for the improvement of truck driver payment methods, working conditions and career structures to address safety issues. The widespread concern is that risks are taken and that safety is compromised to meet the demands of the job or to secure pay outcomes. One statistic that flawed me was the one that suggested that about 30 per cent of owner drivers are paid below the award rate. No-one else would accept that. If anyone else in the general community was paid that amount of money there would be an uproar. 


Again, I refer to the submission made by the TWU where they had a survey conducted last year that illustrated some of the dangerous on-road behaviours. Forty-eight per cent of drivers report almost one day a week in unpaid waiting time, and for delivery drivers it is more than 10 hours a week. Fifty-six per cent of owner drivers have had to forgo vehicle maintenance because of economic pressure and the need to keep working and the high cost of repairs. Another 27 per cent felt they had to drive too fast, and nearly 40 per cent felt pressured to drive longer than legally allowed. This is what people are saying directly from the industry, the pressures that people at the coalface feel they have to operate under. The NTC report looked at the link between remuneration and road safety, and that link was quite clear. The report found:


…the overwhelming weight of evidence indicates that commercial/industrial practices affecting road transport play a direct and significant role—


I will repeat that—


…a direct and significant role in causing hazardous practices. There is solid survey evidence linking payment levels and systems to crashes, speeding, driving while fatigued and drug use.


Yet we have the member for Riverina coming in here a few moments ago and saying that there is not enough proof. For them it has not been proved beyond any shadow of a doubt, despite all the work done, that there is any sort of link when clearly, in the absence of any contrary evidence put forward in the debate by those opposite, the work that has been undertaken shows otherwise.


It is worth making the point at this juncture that, through countless inquiries, responses to incidents, responses to the media interest that has been aroused by this, and in dealing with families that have been traumatised, there is one organisation that has continuously, passionately and determinedly pressed the case for something to be done. I want to place on the record my admiration for the Transport Workers Union of Australia—in particular Tony Sheldon, Michael Kane, who I notice up in the gallery, and my friend and colleague the New South Wales Secretary Wayne Forno. In years to come, people will be able to say that the work done by this organisation has saved their lives or spared them from injury. There are people in this chamber who say that too much power has been wielded by one organisation in this matter; but to be honest I thank God that that power has been exercised because families have not had to be traumatised by the death of their loved ones, whether they are the people driving those vehicles or general commuters involved in accidents. I congratulate the TWU for the work they have done.


The NTC report formed the platform for these bills. If you look at the objectives of the legislation, there are a number of things it seeks to do. I want in particular to draw attention to the fact that it aims to promote safety and fairness in the road transport industry by, for example, ensuring road transport drivers do not have remuneration-related incentives to work in an unsafe manner; removing remuneration-related incentives and pressures that contribute to unsafe work practices; ensuring that road transport drivers are paid for their work, including loading and unloading vehicles or waiting for someone else to load or unload their vehicles; and developing and applying reasonable and enforceable standards to the road transport industry supply chain to ensure the safety of road transport drivers.


We also seek to set up a Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal to ensure that we promote the objectives of the act and safety and fairness in the industry. It will ensure that work is done in an evidence-based and research-focused way. It will also create determinations known as road safety remuneration orders which will be in addition to any existing rights that employed drivers have under industrial instruments or that owner-drivers have under their contracts for service. These bills will ensure that the years of talk, of hand wringing, of saying something has to be done will end. We will make sure that there is something in place to resolve the issues that people in the trucking industry have had to deal with for years.


In spite of all this, when we finally get to a point where we can take action, we still have those that try to propagate myths about what this legislation will do. Some suggest that safe rates will cost consumers, ignoring the reality that every single death costs $2 million; every injury costs over $400,000. Who do people believe bears this cost? This cost is heavily borne by the families involved but it is also, ultimately, borne by the public. It is spurious to claim that the implementation of this bill would lead to costs when these costs are already being borne. The aim is to reduce the costs, economic and social, on those families. There are people that say that voluntary systems would work better, when there is simply no evidence to suggest that the voluntary systems that have been in place so far have assisted in any way, shape or form. They have had no impact to date. The death rate, the injury rate  and the incident rate continue to grow. Worse still is the argument put forward by those opposite that there is no proof that remuneration and safety are linked, when in fact a huge volume of work has been undertaken to show this. I will read an excerpt from the NTC report, quoting Professor Michael Belzer from the University of Michigan: 


The point estimates indicate that if mileage rate were to increase to $0.37 per mile, drivers would reduce their weekly hours to be in compliance with current regulations. At this rate, drivers are being compensated at a rate sufficient for them to be able to satisfy their income requirements without being induced to work in excess of mandated law.


Those opposite said in a dissenting report that they were unconvinced safe rates would lead to an improvement in road safety outcomes. They also said that the link between remuneration and safety in the transport industry has not been definitively established. They suggested that improving road infrastructure and enforcing existing laws would achieve safety improvements. This is simply an excuse to know, not act. It would be improper to reveal too much of the committee's consideration of the bills, but there was an attempt to work together within that committee. However, the dissenting report betrays the fact that none of those opposite can point to anything that they did in their time in government—when they had an opportunity to deal with this—or that they could do now, as an opposition, that would improve this situation and avoid deaths. Those opposite would rather find ways to delay—for example, requiring us to be able to establish beyond any reasonable doubt that there is a link between remuneration and safety. Until the point that we could do that, we would still have people in the trucking industry and other people using those roads dying to satisfy their demand for absolute proof that there is a link between the two—when huge volumes of work have been done to prove just that. I would argue that, if they oppose this legislation, those opposite are absolutely compelled to tell this chamber one thing that they would do to save people's lives and prevent injury. Do not tell us existing laws have to be enforced better, because the evidence suggests that even to this point people are abusing the law by either playing with speed limiters or engaging in drug use because of the very pressures they have to operate under.



Those opposite have to get serious. They have to look at the families of those truckers who have died and the families who have been injured in road accidents involving trucks and explain to them why further inaction is a recipe for anything good in the general community. They are compelled to demonstrate to this chamber what they would do to improve the situation. (Time expired)

"Kelly, Craig, MP",LP,2012-03-14,"



Mr CRAIG KELLY
 (Hughes) (18:46):  I rise tonight to speak on the Road Safety Remuneration Bill 2011 and the Road Safety (Consequential Amendments and Related Provisions) Bill 2011. Firstly, I would like to express my admiration for our nation's truck drivers. These guys—and some women—are the salt of the earth. They work long hours in isolated conditions and often in a very isolated environment away from family and friends. It is a very dangerous occupation. It is an industry in which over the last couple of years we have seen around 250 people killed and 1,000 more seriously injured. I am proud to say that on this side of the House there are several members who hold licences to drive heavy vehicles while on the other side, in the so-called workers' party, there is an absolute dearth of those who even know what a clutch is.


The purpose of this bill is to create a new government bureaucracy, to be called the Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal, which will inquire into sector issues and practices in the road transport industry and issue orders and set mandatory rates of pay and related conditions for employed and self-employed drivers. However, it should be noted that this bill will create confusion in the industry, as constitutionally the bill will not apply to over 40 per cent of owner-operators and over 20 per cent of employee drivers.


The reason behind this bill is that many of our nation's truck drivers today are being placed under undue economic pressure. One of the inherent difficulties that our nation's truck drivers face is delays—delays through roadworks, delays through accidents, delays through rain and delays through being caught in peak hour traffic. These delays can easily happen in a journey on any of our nation's roads, whether it is just across town or from one side of our continent to the other. Of the few examples I have noted, there are obviously a range of controllable and uncontrollable actions. The penalty clauses forced upon drivers, sometimes enforced from outside their contracts, do not make such distinctions.


When looking at the causes of delays, I need look no further than two nights ago when I, along with many of my New South Wales colleagues, was driving down to Canberra late on Monday night for this parliamentary sitting. There were roadworks at Marulan and the traffic was banked up for 10 kilometres. Whilst sitting in the traffic jam for over an hour meant little to me—I simply arrived here in Canberra an hour later—I could not help but notice the number of trucks that were lined up and experiencing the same set of circumstances. But what was only a slight annoyance to me was actually stripping money from the pockets of these blokes in their trucks. It was snatching food from their dinner tables, because these blokes are not fortunate enough to have a job where they sit around each night with their family. It is a tough job they have to do.


Marulan is located midway between Sydney and Canberra and it is an important trucking stop on the Sydney to Melbourne trip. That chaos on Monday night came from about 200 metres of a single lane on the Hume Highway being closed outside of peak hours. That may have been amplified by the increased road use of New South Wales parliamentarians and their staff making their way to Canberra or even Canberrans who had taken the day off for Canberra Day returning from holidays. But this was not even peak hour and we saw trucks held up for several hours, which would have delayed all the trucking between Sydney and Melbourne by several hours that day.


While these delays are inherent in the nature of the industry, the supermarket duopoly have been taking advantage of their centralised power to hold trucking companies and our drivers to ransom by giving them unreasonable deadlines and penalising them if they are delayed by even just a few minutes. I have even heard of one instance of a company being fined $50,000 because they were no more than a few minutes late with a delivery to one of the supermarket duopolists. What did the duopolist say when the company complained? They simply said, 'What can you do—take us to court?' That is unfortunately the market power that the supermarket duopoly have. They are able to act outside our laws and outside commercial practices.


Even Lindsay Fox has commented on the undue market power of the supermarket duopoly, accusing them of dictating terms and 'expecting everything for nothing'. In a recent interview in the Australian newspaper the Linfox founder offered his thoughts on the dominance of the two major supermarkets. Despite him having recently signed a new five-year deal with Coles, these are the comments he made. He said:


They are too big … You can't dictate the terms and conditions of what people have got to trade with you. And they are getting to that stage. They are trying to dictate to everyone …


They are expecting everything for nothing. They are going to crucify the farmers, crucify the bread manufacturers and if you spoke to most of the consumer goods manufacturers at the moment, you would get a very mixed response about the aspects of dealing with these companies.


We all believe in a free market, but a free market means just that: it means freedom. It means freedom in contract negotiation. It means freedom for one party to stand up and simply say 'Get stuffed' and pack their bags and walk away. But when the market becomes overly concentrated, that very freedom is taken away and others in the supply chain become nothing other than economic serfs.


So the real solution to the problem we have with the undue market pressure being put on our truck drivers—the unreasonable delivery times they are made to adhere to and the unreasonable waiting times—is what I would call the Standard Oil option—that is, to reverse the undue market concentration that has been occurring in this market for years and years. In any legislation we need to make sure we are addressing the cause of the problem and not putting a bandaid over the wound. It is obvious from the speeches from both sides of the House that the root cause of the problem—the economic pressure that is being put on our truck drivers—is the growing market concentration of the supermarket duopoly. These bills, unfortunately, do not tackle that root cause, and that is something we need to address.


I now turn to some of the other pressures our trucking industry will face in the future. While these bills look at the economic pressure on the transport industry, let us not forget the pain that every single member of this government voted to inflict on our transport industry with the world's largest carbon tax. From 1 July 2014 there will be an extra impost of 6.85c per litre on the cost of diesel. What that means for every owner-operator and for every truck that makes on average three round trips a week between Sydney and Melbourne is that $5,000 will be ripped out of their pockets. How can members of this government come in here and talk about helping truck drivers when their own policies are going to add $5,000 a year in costs onto them?


There are other issues we need to look at to improve the safety of our truck drivers. It is not just accidents. Truck drivers also face diesel pollution. We know diesel pollution is hazardous to human health. The groups that are at particular risk are industries that are especially involved in trucking. For truck drivers it is not only the pollution from their own diesel trucks but the elevated background pollution where they work—in ports, from cargo handling equipment, from ships and from locomotives. A recent investigation in California by the Coalition for Clean and Safe Ports, analysing the air quality inside truck cabs, revealed alarmingly high levels of diesel pollution and a threat to our drivers' health. Diesel engines emit a toxic brew of particulate matter as smog-forming nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds. Diesel exhaust is estimated to be responsible for 70 per cent of the total cancer risks from air pollution. Numerous studies have documented this risk. According to a recent California Air Resources Board report, trucks involved in the movement of goods were responsible for more than half of the estimated 2,400 premature deaths attributable to diesel exhaust from the Californian freight industry. Also, the monitoring of air inside cabs has found an alarmingly high level of pollution.


Again, how can we assist in making the health of our drivers better? What can we do? Firstly, diesel pollution can be reduced by regular maintenance of trucks—making sure that trucks are at their best performance. But how can we do that if in this parliament we are legislating to make truck drivers pay an extra $5,000 a year through the carbon tax? There are of course other things we can do. We can limit idling time and the time they spend waiting in queues. But, again, we cannot do that unless we balance the market power between our independent drivers and our supermarket duopoly. Too often we hear that by having such a concentrated market we get market efficiencies.


If I operate a warehouse and I have trucks coming to me, it makes my operation very efficient if I can have the trucks I need to unload lined up one by one, so that when I unload one truck another truck pulls up. That makes my operation efficient, so that is how I want to do it. On the other hand, when drivers can be so easily delayed on our roads today, that puts the burden back on those drivers—which makes them more inefficient. They have to plan their trips, they have to leave hours earlier than they normally would and they have to wait in queues, simply to make that warehouse more efficient. So while that warehouse may become more efficient, what actually happens is that our entire supply chain becomes less efficient. These are the problems we have when our market becomes overly concentrated.


The other issue we need to look at is how to improve the health, wellbeing and safety of our nation's truck drivers—and of course it gets back to diesel fuel. The diesel fuel that we currently burn in trucks has very high levels of particulate matter. There is a way of reducing that, and that is through the process of coal liquefaction. We have the capability here in Australia, with our supplies of brown coal, especially in the Latrobe Valley, to produce diesel fuel through coal liquefaction. This would have particulates reduced by about 40 per cent. If we were able to do that it would substantially increase our ability to make our trucking safer. It would reduce the particulate matter in the cabs of trucks and make drivers' health a lot better, and that is what these bills also fail to address.


In the remaining minutes I have I will say a few kind words about Mr Tony Sheldon, the head of the TWU. I do not see him up in the gallery, but I believe he has been in Parliament House for the last couple of days. I believe he has truck drivers' best interests at heart. However, I think these bills need a bit of work, Tony. I do not think they are quite there. I think we need to look at and tackle the undue power of the supermarket duopoly, because we want to see all Australian truck drivers have a fair go. We want to make sure that the truck drivers of Australia have hope, reward and opportunity, as the rest of us do, and I hope we can achieve that in the future.



The SPEAKER:  I would ask honourable members to sit down, because the honourable member is about to be advised by me that, it being 7 pm, I am about to propose the question that the House do now adjourn. The honourable member will have the opportunity of continuing his remarks at an appropriate time.

Mrs MOYLAN
 (Pearce) (19:01):  It is timely that I have the call for this adjournment debate this evening, because this morning in Parliament House the Parliamentary Diabetes Support Group joined with Diabetes Australia and the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation to launch a new research paper by the Baker IDI Heart and Diabetes Institute. Associate Professor Jonathan Shaw, who was responsible for the research in this report entitled Diabetes: the silent pandemic and its impact on Australia, outlined for senators, members and guests the dimensions of the challenge facing Australia in managing the diabetes pandemic.


On best estimates, about one million Australians have diabetes. Another half a million are estimated to have diabetes but remain undiagnosed. Another 100,000 new cases are diagnosed every year in Australia. On current trends, we can expect that number will grow to three million Australians with diabetes by 2025. The cost to the healthcare system is now around $6 billion annually, therefore we can expect a sharp escalation in costs to around $18 billion by 2025. The cost to individuals and their families goes beyond economic considerations as diabetes can have a devastating impact on a person's quality of life as the disease takes its malevolent course. As the report highlights:


Diabetes mellitus currently represents one of the most challenging public health problems of the 21st century. There are over 1.5 million Australians with diabetes, including those who are undiagnosed. This results in substantial morbidity and mortality, particularly from cardiovascular complications, eye and kidney diseases and limb amputations.


This is why the United Nations passed resolution 61/225 in January 2007. Amongst other things, this resolution designated 14 November as World Diabetes Day to highlight the challenge posed by diabetes and called on member states to observe this day to raise public awareness of diabetes and encouraged member states to develop national policies for the prevention, treatment and care of diabetes.


In 1997, the federal government declared diabetes a national health priority. Along with state governments, it committed to supporting programs to monitor and improve diabetes prevention, detection and management. Notwithstanding the best intentions, the Baker IDI research shows that diabetes prevalence is still on the rise and that more needs to be done. I would like to acknowledge the excellent work of the Director and Chief Executive Officer of IDI Baker, Professor Garry Jennings AM, and of Associate Professor Shaw. This is indeed an outstanding document that they have produced. It provides evidence-based research on which to base effective policies and I hope that it will inform both the government and the coalition in that respect.


This research has been carried out in partnership with Diabetes Australia, whose CEO is Lewis Kaplan, and the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, which is headed up by Mr Mark Wilson. We are no strangers to the work that the foundation does in this place with the biannual Kids in the House program. Both of these organisations are tireless and effective advocates for people with diabetes in Australia. They have a very important role to play as peak consumer organisations.




Mr Baldwin:
  Hear, hear!




Mrs MOYLAN:
  This research also has the strong support of the Parliamentary Diabetes Support Group. I heard the member for Paterson saying: 'Hear hear!' He is one of the great supporters of the Parliamentary Diabetes Support Group, and has attended many of the excellent functions we have had in this place. The group has a crossbench membership which has worked with peak organisations to encourage government to maintain its commitment to diabetes as a national health priority. I take this opportunity to thank in particular the member for Lyons, the member for Moore, the member for Isaacs, and Senator Claire Moore, all of whom form the executive of the PDSG. I commend this report to the House.

"Christensen, George, MP",Nats,2012-03-14,"



Mr CHRISTENSEN
 (Dawson) (09:30):  Families and parenthood are very important. They are important in particular for children. That is why when families fall apart we need to do all we can to ensure that the child has access not only to both parents but to adequate finance for their future and that it is all done in a fair and reasonable way.


But if my constituent concerns are anything to go by, the current child support system is anything but fair and reasonable. In fact, many would say that the system is broken. Today I want to outline three cases, of many different constituent stories, where the child support system has resulted in an unfair deal. The first I refer to is that of Ken, who lives in the Whitsundays. He is the father of two children. He suffered a separation and his ex-partner now has sole custody of his children. He is awaiting a court hearing so that some court orders for custody can be put in place, but all the while he is not allowed to see his children.


The Child Support Agency is assessing his child support, based on an income of $95,000, when his actual income is significantly less than that. The report that was done by the CSA into his income was based on more false assumptions and wild speculation than one would encounter in an episode of Inspector Morse.


I also refer to Darrell, who lives in my electorate, who has told me that a very good friend of his has to pay child support to his ex-wife in Japan. She took the children off to Japan and will not let him know where they are and, because Japan is not part of The Hague convention, there is no ability for them to come back.


Finally, I refer to John, a fellow in Mackay, whose ex-partner, who is in breach of court orders, took his children to a town 350 kilometres away. They have no contact with him at all. The Child Support Agency is now making him pay for those extra days when he should be seeing the children—but he is not, through no control of his own.


All these issues need to be addressed. It has become clear to me that there needs to be a nexus between the child support system and Family Court orders. To quote one of my constituents: 


The Child Support Agency is going to be responsible for a whole new stolen generation in the future. Parents have to pay and pay and CSA has nothing in place to ensure that access is available to parents who are doing the right thing in providing for their children. It is easy to take away money, to take tax returns and drive parents to the brink but hold no responsibility in making sure that the paying parent sees their child.

Mr DREYFUS
 (Isaacs—Cabinet Secretary, Parliamentary Secretary for Industry and Innnovation and Parliamentary Secretary for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency) (09:33):  I rise to speak about the launch of the Dandenong Multicultural Youth Soccer Tournament, which I attended on Saturday, 18 February, along with my parliamentary colleague Senator Kate Lundy, then Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister and Parliamentary Secretary for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs.


The Dandenong Multicultural Youth Soccer Tournament, now in its second year, brings together eight teams to compete for the multicultural cup. Participants come from a diverse range of backgrounds: Sudan, Somalia, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Kenya, Djibouti, Sierra Leone, Ghana, Tanzania, Angola, Zambia, Congo, Iraq, Afghanistan, Burma and Iran. Many of those people have of course experienced significant trauma before coming to Australia. The soccer tournament provides an opportunity for these newly-arrived migrants and refugees to forge links with the Australian community and celebrates Australia's unique brand of multiculturalism through the universal language of sport. On the soccer field each person is considered equal. It makes no difference what race a person is, what language they speak or what beliefs they hold. On the soccer field our differences fade away. Although in each game only one team can win, every player in the tournament wins in other ways. I am confident that the friendships formed during the tournament will long outlast the contest on the soccer field. It is fitting that this tournament, an event centred on promoting the values of multiculturalism, is held in the City of Greater Dandenong. Greater Dandenong is a community that brings together more than 170 nationalities. 


The youth soccer tournament is one of many events held across my electorate that brings the community together to celebrate our rich cultural diversity. It fits with the way the people in Greater Dandenong live in harmony and share in the opportunities that Australia has to offer. I wish all the competitors the very best of luck and look forward to the tournament grand final which will take place in April. 


In keeping with the theme of community spirit through sport and recreation, I was privileged to preview the completely rebuilt Noble Park Aquatic Centre on Tuesday, 17 January at a turning-of-the-tap ceremony. The aquatic centre was officially opened on 8 March.


The aquatic centre is a valuable asset to the local community that can be used by people of all ages, all cultural backgrounds and all levels of physical ability. The recently redeveloped centre offers a range of sporting and recreation opportunities and features a 50-metre heated outdoor pool with ramp access, Melbourne's biggest water slide, group exercise classes and multipurpose rooms available for community meetings and functions. 


The redevelopment of the aquatic centre is an example of local, state and federal governments working together to help create better facilities for the local community. Through the community infrastructure program, the federal government contributed $7.3 million towards this $20.8 million project, which was also funded by the City of Greater Dandenong and a grant given by the former Victorian Labor government. The project supported many jobs and played a part in the protection our Labor government provided to the Australian economy. (Time expired)

Ms BRODTMANN
 (Canberra) (09:59):  The images of the floods that we have seen in the last few weeks have yet again highlighted the resilience of the Australian people across the eastern states of Australia as we have borne witness, once again, to another natural disaster. We have all seen the pictures of abandoned cars, of houses full of silt and mud, of water up to the eaves of houses, of people driving around in boats where normally the main streets are, of stranded livestock and of people spending the night bunked down in emergency accommodation. These events seem to be occurring far more regularly than in the past. The CSIRO report that came out last night indicated that the world is going to get warmer and wetter in the future, so we will probably be seeing these very graphic and distressing images far more regularly. The thing that strikes home to us is the real impact that these situations have on people's lives—the huge destruction and the huge trauma that they cause to people across the nation.


As the Prime Minister pointed out yesterday, many areas in regional Australia are still bracing for the floods as the water makes its way towards their communities. I can only imagine what they must be going through and the trauma, the fear and the terror that they must be facing in having, possibly, their lives' work disrupted or ruined and the years it is going to take for them to recover from that situation. We had nothing on the scale of what we saw in New South Wales here in Canberra but we did get a little taste of it, particularly in Oaks Estate and Tharwa in my electorate, and over the border in Queanbeyan.


Last Monday I went out to Oaks Estate to see the impact of the floods there. There is a road that flanks the side of Oaks Estate that has been specifically designed for heavy traffic to drive around the edge as a shortcut from Canberra to Queanbeyan. That road is very low-lying and it has been completely washed away. Essentially it is one big river now with torrents of water running past it. I do not want to think about the damage bill. The community of Oaks Estate is a very small, tight and loyal community and they underscored to me the impact that it is having on their businesses. There is a successful floristry business there and the owner of that business said that this road being washed away has been an ongoing problem. He also highlighted the fact that as a result of large vehicles not being able to get to his business it has an impact on his bottom line of about $100,000 over a number of years, so they are significant figures for a very successful small business. As anyone knows who has been in small business, that is a significant sum.


I also went out to Tharwa that afternoon and the road crew kindly gave me a tour of the work that they have been doing, working overnight, 24/7 over that weekend while the rains were still coming, to get the bridges fixed out at Tharwa particularly at Angle Creek crossing just outside of Tharwa, again a very low-level bridge. Both sides of the bridge at Angle Creek crossing had been washed away so there was no way that people could get onto the bridge. The crew was working overtime to get the entry points onto the bridge built and secure so that people could make their way to work, because otherwise they had to drive a circuitous and lengthy route to get to work. I commend the work that those road crews were doing. They were doing a great job above and beyond to ensure that the people of the Tharwa area could use that bridge as soon as possible.


The impact of the floods in the Canberra region has been relatively significant but, as I said, nothing on the scale of what we saw throughout New South Wales. The real impact is on the infrastructure and the roads. Driving throughout Canberra you see potholes everywhere. 


Also, the new Cotter Dam wall, only half complete, overflowed not long ago and the spill caused damage to equipment, further delaying the project. The delays are having an impact on the workers as well. As a result of the heavy rain, a number of workers have been stood down. My colleague Dean Hall at the CFMEU is very concerned about it and has been working closely with the company managing the building of the new Cotter Dam wall to ensure the workers are looked after. As I said, there have been road closures and parks and reserves have been closed due to dangerous conditions. Even Lake Burley Griffin has been closed. 


Everyone in New South Wales would be well aware that many of the local shows did not take place. With Canberra being in the Capital Region, we are deeply connected to surrounding areas and we know the amount of work local communities put into their shows. They are one of the highlights of their social calendar. Even though those events were postponed, I understand many of them took place last week. I had planned to be with Tuggeranong Community Council on Clean Up Australia Day to help clean Lake Tuggeranong, which has also had some impact from flooding and severe rains. That clean-up also had to be cancelled because of the torrential rain—it was biblical. We saw severe weather warnings in Cooma, Queanbeyan and other parts of our region.


Today I want to focus on Wagga Wagga, given the connection with Canberra. As we know, a week ago we had news that Wagga Wagga was under threat from some of the worst floods since 1853. The thoughts and prayers of Canberrans went out to the people of Wagga. When I was at ANU, there were a lot of kids from Wagga studying at the ANU and now Canberrans go to Wagga to study. I am organising a number of forums with schools around Canberra in April and May to talk about the school funding review. I will be doing the government schools in clusters, the independent schools individually and the Catholic schools as a series of groups. So last week I was at St Edmund's College talking to the principal. I had a tour of the school and spoke to the school community for International Women's Day. The principal was telling me that a number of students come from Wagga to study at that school and that a number of the Wagga families had been affected. He was in a dilemma as to what to do, whether to send the kids home or to keep them here. The kids were naturally traumatised. They were concerned about their families and about the impact of the floods on their community. So floods have a knock-on effect right around the region.


Wagga was declared a disaster zone and almost 9,000 people were evacuated, as were smaller towns nearby. Thankfully the Murrumbidgee levee held and Wagga residents were able to return home, but the clean-up continues. I am sure there are many people who understand what the residents of Wagga are going through. I urge them to help. A Wagga appeal has been set up. I encourage Canberrans to contribute even a small amount to help the people of Wagga rebuild and get on with their lives. Canberrans are great volunteers. We have the highest volunteering rate in the country and we are also great contributors to those in need. So I encourage Canberrans to dig as deep as they can to help with the Wagga appeal. If there is anyone in the Canberra region who is still concerned about the impact of the floods I encourage them to call Canberra Connect on 13 22 81 for up-to-date information on road closures and bridge closures.


Finally, I have focused on the Wagga region for this speech. My colleague from Eden-Monaro will talk about Queanbeyan, to which we in Canberra are very closely connected. I commend the member for Riverina for the work he did during the floods. We saw him a lot on the television. I know from the experiences of the member for Eden-Monaro in 2010 that it is incredibly traumatic for the communities, and that that trauma is shared by the local member. I commend the work of the member for Riverina in looking after his community and trying to help them through this difficult time. Once again, I encourage Canberrans to donate to the Wagga appeal.

Mr ALBANESE
 (Grayndler—Leader of the House and Minister for Infrastructure and Transport) (10:10):  Natural disaster declarations have been made in some 63 local government areas in New South Wales and Victoria, which gives an idea of the scale of these floods. I acknowledge the work that has taken place from the federal government, state governments, local governments and, most importantly, from volunteer organisations, particularly in areas such as the Riverina.


Today, though, I take the opportunity to recognise the work that takes place in urban communities. I would like to recognise the contribution of the Marrickville SES in the recent rain and flooding in the inner west of Sydney. In my electorate the Cooks River flooded; houses were affected and cars floated away. There was a devastating impact in a way in which I, who have lived in the area my whole life, have never seen. It was the worst I have seen occur.


During the storms last week and the flooding that occurred in the inner west of Sydney, the Marrickville SES unit was involved in 47 flood and storm operations which included flood response, tree and debris removal, local road closures and traffic response. The Marrickville SES unit services the entire Marrickville local government area and is led by local controller Michael Carney, who has served our local community for 22 years now. It is important to recognise that these people are all volunteers. They give up their own time to go out whenever there is an incident. In the past, it has been more storm damage that they have had to deal with, including major storm damage some years ago.


The unit is involved in many local community events and provides a wide range of local education programs—there are committed volunteers at every single local community festival and event. On Sunday I attended Bairro Portugues, the Portuguese festival in Petersham hosted by Marrickville Council. There it was quite evident that the local community were going up to the SES, who were wearing their traditional orange uniforms, and thanking them for the contribution that they make. The NSW State Emergency Service is dedicated to helping people when they are in most need. In NSW, the service consists of 231 units and over 10,000 volunteers. I take this opportunity to thank those people, whether they be in rural communities or in urban communities such as mine, who make such a great contribution to civil society.

"Kelly, Mike, MP",ALP,2012-03-14,"



Dr MIKE KELLY
 (Eden-Monaro—Parliamentary Secretary for Defence) (10:13):  It is a privilege to rise to make a statement on indulgence, given what we have heard about the sterling and magnificent efforts of all our first responders and emergency organisations and the great work they have done in the context of the challenges—the extensive flooding—that have been thrown at our communities in two successive years. I would particularly like to add my thanks to and respect and admiration for the members of the SES, the RFS, the police and the ambos, who have all been extremely busy over this disastrous period of time in the last few weeks. I went to visit the SES headquarters in Queanbeyan. There are a lot of very fine men and women there, volunteers all, who have done some sterling work, including a large number of flood rescues. I think we saw something like 164 flood rescues performed by the SES in New South Wales during the last few weeks. One performed in Queanbeyan was a perfect example of the courage and dedication of our first responders. A gentleman who was caught in the Queanbeyan River flooding was spotted by the Queanbeyan police, who dived in to try and rescue him. They got into a bit of trouble trying to do that but were quite happy to put their lives on the line to perform that effective rescue. In the end, the SES were able ensure the safety of all of those people involved. We salute the service of those first responders doing a great job.


My region suffered terribly from the floods last year. I live on the Queanbeyan River and I watched nervously as it rose and threatened the homes around me and my own home. Fortunately, we avoided flood damage, but many others suffered the effects of that. This year Queanbeyan avoided the worst of that, but of the other councils in my region—I have seven councils in my electorate—five have been declared disaster areas: Palerang, Bombala, Cooma-Monaro, Snowy River Shire and Bega Valley Shire.


I was distressed also to see the damage and threats that were posed to the populations of the areas of Tumut and Tumbarumba, which were part of my electorate before the last redistribution. I would like to give special comment and praise to the member for Riverina, Michael McCormack, who is now representing those two areas and doing a very fine job of making sure he was out there assisting in relation to the flood damage in Riverina. We all salute the service that Michael is rendering to Riverina and those former parts of my electorate in Tumut and Tumbarumba. Well done to Michael.


The damage in my region has highlighted the sorts of challenges that are posed by these floods to local councils. It has also been a terrible disruption right across our region, because this is the show season. For the first time in its history the Bemboka Show has been cancelled. We have seen Dalgety, Delegate and Cooma shows all affected. This is a terrible blow to these rural and regional communities, who often focus on these events as a key way of promoting their produce, getting together and celebrating their success and results of their work and enjoying themselves. It has been a very sad time having those shows cancelled, and they also bring in a lot of income to these local communities, so we have forgone that.


A particularly bad blow in the region has been the loss of the Brown Mountain road, which is the main link to the far South Coast and the Canberra and capital region. Many people use that road to come up to the ACT for vital health services, work and education. It is an absolutely critical artery, and we have seen the total subsidence of a section of road on Brown Mountain. The estimate from the RTA is that they may not have that road open until Easter. That is going to be a very significant impediment and blow to all of the people living in that far south region to not only their amenity of life but the towns of Nimmitabel and Bemboka particularly depend on passing traffic—the bakeries and the famous Bemboka Pie Shop, whose wares I have savoured many times; I particularly love their pepper steak pie and recommend it to everyone—and are suffering very badly from that loss of traffic through the area. We are seeing significant impact around my region, and the disaster relief assistance is going to be very much appreciated for the repairs, principally to the roads and bridges. 


There has been a lot of farm damage. In the last year I toured around areas of New South Wales and visited a lot of farmers and councils as part of my portfolio responsibilities formerly in agriculture, fisheries and forestry. It was a terrible tragedy then because last year's crop was going to get people back on track after having suffered through so many years of drought. We saw a real knock-on consequence of not being able to get the headers moving south from Queensland to Victoria and getting bogged down; the roads preventing those whose crops were not flood damaged from getting to market; and the many kilometres of fencing that were destroyed, which poses a huge problem for farmers. Over in the Wagga area I remember visiting one farm where the flooding came down from the Tumbarumba region and had washed a huge quantity of gravel over the topsoil so that there was about a metre of gravel over the top of that topsoil, denying the farmer even access to his productive soils. Interestingly, too, we have seen a lot of infrastructure that was obviously many decades old being exposed for the faults of the civil engineering technologies of the time. One particular bridge I saw there had the approaches completely washed away, though the bridge itself was intact. What we also have to focus on in response to these disasters is what people refer to as betterment. As we rebuild these bridges and roads, we should look to the best possible civil engineering technology and the latest advances to prepare ourselves for these major disasters, which appear to be a pattern that we will be having to deal with in a wash-out, if you will pardon the expression, from the climate change effects that we seem to be experiencing—the situation where our weather events are increased in intensity and significance. 


This poses a planning challenge to all our councils, and the federal government is very keen to work closely and directly with local councils. It is one of the reasons why we really enjoyed working with them directly through the Australian Council of Local Governments. We are hoping now to see a referendum go forward which will give local councils status under the Constitution and through that mechanism enable the federal government to get even more closely involved with supporting them. They all face big challenges in their operational budgets, and I work closely with Mayor Walter Reynolds and his general manager, Peter Bascomb, in Palerang; Mayor Bob Stewart and general manager Don Cottee in Bombala; Dean Lynch in Cooma-Monaro and his general manager John Vucic; Mayor John Cahill and his general manager Joe Vescio in Snowy River; and of course Tony Allen, the mayor of Bega, and his general manager Peter Tegart. We have got fine men all doing great work for their communities, but the challenge of their operational budgets and sustaining infrastructure is getting beyond a lot of councils and we need to find a better way of supporting them in the years ahead.


I commend all those who are out there working hard in the councils and our first responders, but also, given my current responsibilities in the Defence portfolio, I would like to pass my thanks to our wonderful men and women of the Australian Defence Force who have been out there rendering great assistance in support of our superb member for Riverina, Michael McCormack, who has been at the forefront of his community's efforts. I know he has appreciated the presence of the ADF and in particular Colonel David Hay, who is out there. They are doing great work in sandbagging—which obviously we have a fair bit of experience with in the Defence Force—evacuations and transport operations and supporting the efforts of the SES and the emergency personnel around those affected areas. I like to make sure that the Australian community is aware that the Australian Defence Force provides this sort of disaster assistance and relief and support to the community on a regular basis. There is rarely a time when some element of the Defence Force is not involved in some way in supporting the community year-round and deploying the assets and the heavy-lift capabilities that the Defence Force is capable of in support of our own communities. We do welcome their involvement and I salute and praise their services as well.


I am heartbroken to see some of the damage that has been caused all around our region and, as I said earlier, my former areas of Tumut and Tumbarumba, which are now being well looked after by the current member. But the silver lining to the cloud is seeing the way this Australian community and our volunteer services respond to emergencies of this nature. It is extremely heart warming and I think it is a rare thing in this world. As you travel around and see the problems international communities face, I think they would give their right arm to have the sort of voluntary support that we experience in this country. I salute their service.

"Buchholz, Scott, MP",LP,2012-03-14,"



Mr BUCHHOLZ
 (Wright) (12:15):  The Insurance Contracts Amendment Bill 2011 seeks to change the insurance laws by introducing a standard definition of flood insurance contracts and a key facts sheet that is required to be provided for home building and home contents insurance policies. The coalition will support this bill; however, we have a number of concerns about the final implementation of the measures it introduces. 


Following the major floods in 2010 and 2011 in parts of Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria and Western Australia the issue of inadequate flood insurance cover and confusion about what was covered in insurance policies has become predominant. There were seriously damaged households with no or inadequate insurance coverage. Wide variations in the definition of 'flood' between insurance policies and the lack of understanding of what was covered by policies contributed to these gaps in insurance coverage. 


My electorate of Wright was enormously devastated by the floods 12 months ago. A policy holder came home after having been evacuated from their town to be standing in their dining room with evidence of up to four feet of water having been through their living room. At least their house was still there. In some cases people's houses were still inundated with water. There was a degree of comfort that came over those people, who had been paying insurance premiums for 20 and 30 years with good intent, as they believed their houses were insured. Can you imagine their despair, after losing their worldly possessions and in many cases losing loved ones, when hydrology reports on the area indicated that their policy did not cover them as the determination was that it was riverine flooding? This bill seeks to address and recalibrate the definition of flooding to a standard definition through all insurance policies. 


To give the nation an idea of the degree of flooding and the devastation that was incurred by the people of Wright particularly, I draw on the example of the Steinhart family. Sue relived the story of devastation that she underwent. They have a low-set house; it is about two or three feet off the ground, like a typical housing commission home. It goes down the back steps onto a concrete pad, which is their laundry. She was out the back in the laundry and she felt two or three inches of water under her feet, up to her ankles, and because it was not raining she thought that the washing machine had overflowed. She opened the back door to try and let the water out, and the wheelie bins at the back of the door were starting to float away. She grabbed a couple of pumpkins to put on top of the wheelie bins to stop them from floating around. There were three pumpkins and by the time she had picked the last one up, the wheelie bins were gone. By this stage the water was up to her knees. She went up the two steps in fright to find the kids, while trying to assess how quick this water was coming. 


The kids were playing in the bedroom. She got the kids out the window up onto the carport skillion on the side of the house. By this stage the water was up to her hips. Her husband was in the other bedroom trying to smash the window open, panicking. He got the window out and got the last kid up onto the skillion. By the time the family had evacuated onto the skillion the water was lapping onto the skillion roof and they scrambled to get onto the main roof—the apex of the house. They got onto the apex. I said to her, 'How long did all that take to evolve?' She said, 'As long as it took me to tell you this story.' That is how quickly the water came. My heart goes out to those families in Queensland that were downstream from us. They are experiencing flooding in Victoria at the moment. I understand the mass devastation that happens as a result of flooding. In Wright we had very little notice. Subsequently, we suffered an enormous loss of life.


In speaking in support of this bill, if there is a bipartisan message—leave all the politics out of it—that we can share with Australians, and in particular Australians that may not be affected by floods this time, it is this: pick up the phone, spend 40c, invest that time with your insurance company and get some peace of mind. This bill will cover definitions of flooding for new policies. I really want to encourage Australians who have insurance to satisfy this in their minds. Do not leave it until the disaster season; pick up the phone, ring the insurance companies and get some idea as to whether or not they are insured and what the definition of flood means to them.


The Natural Disaster Insurance Review was commissioned on 4 March 2011 in response to this problem. Consultation commenced on 5 April 2011 and review recommendations were received by the government on 30 September 2011 but not released until November. The report contained 47 recommendations providing independent reviews of issues relating to the insurance in light of the natural disasters. Despite having six weeks to consider the recommendations, the government deferred decisions on 39 of the 47 recommendations. In fact, the biggest decision it made was that it was committed to further reviews. It seems to be a common motif of government—why govern when you can have a review, an inquiry, a reference group or some official sounding form of procrastination? It is all or nothing with this government. It is either endless procrastination or knee-jerk reactions. It is either weak-kneed indecision or frantic overreaction. Mining tax—snap decision. Live exports—snap decision. Asylum seekers—months of inaction followed by one knee-jerk reaction after another. Climate change—'Yes we are, no we're not. Wait for a while. No, definitely not under a government I lead,' and finally 'Yes we are,' again.


Returning to the legislation, this bill makes two changes to insurance contracts law following from the review. It provides for a standard definition of flood insurance contracts and requires that customers are provided with a key facts sheet outlining information about their home and building contents insurance policies. However, this is enabling legislation only. Both the standard definition of 'flood' and the specific contents of the key facts sheet will be made in regulations by changes to the Insurance Contracts Regulations 1985.


The industry supports these changes although they have some concerns about the final version of the regulations. As is often the case with the coalition, we see bills come through the House where the intent of the bill may be there but the devil is in the detail. With this particular bill we share the industry's concerns that we do not have the regulations tabled as yet. However, in general, the changes are seen to be acceptable given the level of confusion and uncertainty that surrounded the issue of insurance coverage in the wake of the 2010-11 floods and the industry supports the purpose of the bill. The coalition will be watching the final regulations closely to ensure that they provide adequate certainty to all parties to insurance contracts. 'Certainty' is the key word here. What annoys the living daylights out of people is not knowing where they stand, particularly if they have just gone through the worst experience possible, which I outlined in my opening comments. The standard definition of flood will mean that every time the word 'flood' appears in an insurance contract it will be taken to mean the definition as outlined in the current regulation across all insurance companies. The legislation also restricts contracts including compound phrases with the word 'flood', such as 'flash flood' or 'incidental flooding'. The legislation does not require that all insurance policies insure against flood.


The coalition has consistently supported efforts to develop a standard definition for 'flood' across the entire country and across every insurance company. After the floods in New South Wales in mid-2007 and in Queensland in 2008, the common definition for flood was put forward as an important change by the industry at that time. The federal Labor government did nothing to progress a common definition for flood after the ACCC scuttled previous attempts to ensure such a definition in 2008. It took the disastrous floods of 2011 for Labor to finally consider this matter again. The coalition supports recommendation 36 of the Natural Disaster Insurance Review that the government introduce a standard definition of flood so as to avoid any consumer confusion surrounding flood coverage within insurance policies.


I also take this opportunity to note the contribution of the Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs in its inquiry and the members for Blair, Moreton and Murray, who played a vital role in travelling through the country and receiving evidence in that inquiry. I note their contribution to assisting communities with reference to understanding insurance ramifications. The final report recommends the definition of flood be as proposed within the Reforming flood insurance: clearing the waters consultation paper:


'Flood' means the covering of normally dry land by water that has escaped or been released from the normal confines of:


(a) any lake, or any river, creek or other natural watercourse, whether or not altered or modified; or


(b) any reservoir, canal or dam.


That is basically an extension of riverine flooding, where it comes up out of a creek bed and which would normally make your flood insurance nonvalid. The example I gave you was about the Steinhardt's, whose house backed onto a creek. Even though a 23-foot wall of water came across the flat, the insurance company took the position that, because the water came down through the creek bed first and came up out of the creek milliseconds before a 23-foot wall of water followed it, it was deemed to be riverine flooding.


It should be noted that, with the present disaster season well underway, the benefits of any standard definition will be deferred until the legislation passes. The bill requires that a key facts sheet be provided, outlining important information in relation to home building and home contracts insurance policies. The key facts sheet is meant to provide consumers with key information to allow them to more easily understand and compare insurance policies. We all know how flippant we can be with insurance policies. They have two to three pages of fine print and 'would you sign on the bottom line and forward, John'. The intent of the key facts sheet is to outline some of the basic principles that your policy should cover. The draft requirements of the key facts sheet has not yet been released. In his second reading speech Minister Shorten stated that the government would release the details in 2012 and that they would be consumer tested before being introduced. Industry does not object to the key facts sheet but there are some concerns about its final form.


While the industry broadly supports the changes in this legislation, some concerns still remain. Specifically, my colleagues and I on the House Standing Committee on Economics take issue with elements of the final report on the bill. Specifically we are unable to agree with paragraphs 2.50 and 2.51 of the report, which outline assurances that the Department of the Treasury was engaged in consultative dialogue with the industry and consumer groups as well as the observation that there were 'no points raised in submissions or at the hearing that the Treasury was not already across or was not taking steps to consider solutions'. The clear evidence from the industry representatives at the hearing was industry's frustration that many issues, as identified in this report, that have been raised with the government over the operation of the Insurance Contracts Amendments Bill remain unresolved, with industry awaiting comprehensive consultation on regulations before obtaining any clarity on the identified issues. We note that, disappointingly, the bill has missed much of the detail craved by industry to bring certainty. 


In closing, I would like to offer my sincere and heartfelt concern to those people in parts of Australia whose homes are currently inundated. I pray that there should be no loss of life, because the form of the flooding is not similar to ours, but flash flooding. Our hearts go out to everyone concerned and may God bless them in their recovery.

"Jones, Stephen, MP",ALP,2012-03-14,"



Mr STEPHEN JONES
 (Throsby) (12:30):  A year ago today a terrible tsunami hit the north-east coast of the island of Honshu, Japan. We have spent a good amount of time appropriately this morning debating a motion in tribute to the people of Japan. We expressed our sympathy as a parliament for the suffering that they have undergone and congratulated them on their recovery efforts. In preparation for that debate, I took time to go through some of the reportage of the event, particularly from Japanese newspapers. I came across numerous stories about reports of discoveries of ancient stone markers on hillsides around some of the devastated villages. Those stone markers were like a warning from ancient generations to current generations not to build below that point. 


The reason that those markers were placed somewhere halfway up the hillsides, warning future generations never to build below this point, is that in the past people had experienced tsunami damage—the wiping out of villages—and they knew that it was unsafe to build in those zones. They were sending out a clarion call to future generations: beware. Indeed, before the Second World War, residents had been prohibited from building construction in those areas close to the coast that were subject to tsunami disaster, but during the postwar period there was enormous demand, particularly for affordable housing, in those areas and residential construction did proceed. 


I find that story a useful segue into the debate that we are having here today about the amendments to the Insurance Contracts Act because, as the member for Wright has rightly indicated in his contribution to the debate, the renewed impetus for amendments to this legislation is the terrible floods that went through Queensland, including in his electorate, and northern New South Wales in late December 2010 and early 2011. It reminds us all that Australia is a flood-prone nation. Anyone watching the TV news in the past week will have seen the terrifying images of streets and buildings half submerged in enormous expanses of brown muddy water. It is unfortunate that these images and the flooding taking place in the states of New South Wales and Victoria, even as we speak today, are not an uncommon lived Australian experience. 


Many of our first settlements in this country took place on the banks of our great rivers. Indeed, many country towns owe their existence to being in places where river crossings could be made. The Insurance Contracts Amendment Bill 2011, which is before the House today, was prompted by those terrible events in December 2010 and 2011. Those events remind us, in many respects, that there are many things that we need to do to ensure that we do not see the terrible suffering, the loss of life and the loss of property that we saw as a result of those flood events. Major flood events like that, which followed higher than average rainfall, had a devastating impact on those who lost loved ones and also saw their life's worth of treasured possessions disappear under a torrent of water. What is left behind is a huge task to rebuild lives, property, infrastructure and communities. Some estimates of the total cost of the 2010-11 floods are around the $10 billion mark. According to the Insurance Council of Australia, these floods resulted in nearly 50,000 insurance claims, with insurance payouts expected to be around $2.3 billion. Cyclone Yasi resulted in more than 60,000 claims, adding over $850 million to insurance claims. If you add in the cost of the floods taking place this month, the bill to Commonwealth, state and local governments will be even higher again.


The Insurance Council of Australia says that seven per cent of residential property in Australia is exposed to predictable and repetitive flooding, causing an estimated $400 million to $450 million in damages each and every year. The cost, which cannot always be measured in purely economic terms, is significant. It is also a cost that comes from the spreading of urban development.


This is where I return to the point I made earlier. In part, the bill before the parliament today is a part of the cure but it is not a part of the prevention. State and territory governments have legislation providing for affordable, intelligible third-party car insurance. These are very important, but they are no alternative to programs that are aimed at reducing bad driving. The legislation before the House today is important but it is no alternative to planning and land use policies that ensure we do not build suburbs and houses in places known to be prone to regular flooding. The challenge for state and local government planning authorities is to ensure that when they are approving new urban development, or revising existing ones, they do not put people in harm's way.


We know that the more our urban centres spread out into our flood plains, the more the risk of flood events for the households within those regions. In my own region, in parts of the Illawarra and the Southern Highlands of NSW, urban development in flood-prone areas is a live and controversial issue. In Throsby, suburbs such as Albion Park and Dapto include low-lying areas that frequently see serious flooding. Despite this, urban development marches on. To give one example, a new development approved at Calderwood, near Albion Park, will see the construction of over 4,500 new homes on what was formerly high-value agricultural land. This land, and the land around it, has been subject to regular flooding and is still subject to regular flooding. Not surprisingly, many locals and the local council have expressed concerns about this development and the cost of ensuring that it is done in a way that mitigates or reduces the threat of floods to the residents who purchase housing and land packages in that area.


The surrounding suburb of Albion Park is largely a dormitory suburb that is poorly served by public transport, so the majority of travel in this area is by private motor vehicle. Access roads in and out of these locals areas, like the Illawarra Highway and West Dapto Road, are regularly flooded and cut off. Only last March extensive flooding meant that many students of Albion Park school were forced to spend the night at their local school when parents could not get through the flooded roads to pick them up. For many who know this region well there is concern about the long-term implications to our region of the changed land use that is entailed in new housing developments.


I simply make the point that the legislation before this House, which deals with the definition of flood and the provisions of flood insurance, will not compensate for the need for credible and thorough land-use planning, particularly for suburbs like those I have just described. This is not to take anything away from the heartfelt words of members, such as the member for Wright, who have expressed the deep concerns in their communities and have reflected upon the anguish that was visited upon them by the 2010-11 floods. I am sure that each and every member in this place shares the concern and sympathy and would like to do everything possible to ensure that those communities get back on their feet. I argue that a part of ensuring that we do everything possible is ensuring that we have a coordinated approach to flood mapping and land use strategies that are about the prevention and not cure.


I turn now to the measures within this bill. I am pleased that the measures within this bill provide some important consumer protections for families and small businesses wanting to ensure that they have the right insurance protection for their homes and businesses. One part of the response that we are dealing with today is how we can ensure that consumers can financially manage the risks to their property from flood damage. The government's proposals are to, firstly, ensure that we have a standard definition of what a flood is for the purpose of insurance policies. As a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics I have participated in a recent inquiry into this bill. As part of that inquiry the committee held a roundtable public hearing in early February to consider the proposed measures. The government's proposals for a standard definition and for a fact sheet for consumers were strongly supported by all participants at the hearing. 


These standard definition of 'flood', which will be introduced as a result of this bill, describes riverine flooding and reserves the term 'flood' for flooding in this context only. The reason this definition is necessary is that there are a number of sources of inundation of water into properties. The Insurance Council of Australia has identified three broad categories. The first is stormwater or rainfall run-off, commonly referred to as flash flooding, in localised urban areas from high-intensity rainfall. This form of flooding is regularly covered by the current definitions of flooding within insurance contracts. The second is riverine flooding, which is flooding from watercourses or catchments overflowing their banks. Again, this is often covered but not always covered in standard form contracts. The third is flooding as a result of storm surge or the sea level rising. This is rarely if ever covered in any of the standard form insurance contracts. The regulations include the proposed wording of 'flood' to be used in these insurance contracts as follows:


Flood means the covering of normally dry land by water that has escaped or been released from the normal confines of:


A. any lake, or any river, creek or other natural watercourse, whether or not altered or modified; or


B. any reservoir, canal, or dam.


The primary benefit of having a standard definition is so that consumers can better understand their insurance coverage. This will also decrease the number of disputes over insurance claims, which were significant in the wake of the floods in Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria over the last 12 to 18 months. This will be an important administrative cost saving for insurance companies, who will no longer have to allocate resources to contesting uncertain definitions for flood damage and the definitions of flood damage within those insurance contracts. This new definition will apply to home building and home contents, small business and strata title insurance policies. This is a simple and practical measure that will enable consumers to make better informed decisions regarding the extent to which policies provide cover for flood, and what flood cover actually means.


The second important measure contained within the bill involves introducing a one-page fact sheet which will outline key information in relation to home building and home contents policies in an easy to read and consumer friendly layout. This measure will make the purchase of home building and home contents policies simpler for consumers, assisting them to compare policies with a consistent document and facilitate more effective and informed decision making. The detail of these measures, including the actual wording of a standard definition of 'flood' and the content of the key facts sheet, will be contained in the insurance contract regulations and will be released for public consultation. The response from the insurers and particularly from the Insurance Council of Australia has been positive. Given these measures being brought forward in the bill, it will now be important to monitor how the implementation of these will affect consumers taking out insurance in flood prone areas. It is important that people living in flood prone areas are aware of the risk of flooding and have appropriate insurance to cover this risk. The insurance industry already maps and models flood risk when determining insurance premiums, often relying on data from local and state government authorities. I support the call by the Insurance Council of Australia to ensure that we have a standard mechanism for mapping flood and flood risk. I also support the call to ensure that this information is available to all within the community to assist better land use planning and better assessment of risks for both insurers and those seeking to cover themselves against the risk of flood.


Nothing within this bill is going to do anything that will alter the climate and climatic risks but it will ensure that when the insurers are taking out a contract they can be sure of what coverage they are actually paying for. I commend the bill to the House.

"Entsch, Warren, MP",LP,2012-03-14,"



Mr ENTSCH
 (Leichhardt—Chief Opposition Whip) (12:45):  I rise today to also speak on this bill, the Insurance Contracts Amendment Bill 2011, and to indicate my support for the measures contained within this bill. The bill changes the insurance law to introduce a standard definition of flood contracts. This is something that is long overdue in this area and over many years we have seen despair, I guess, from people who have been subjected to a flood situation only to find that, even though they thought they were covered, they had no insurance cover whatsoever. It was primarily because of the very narrow definition that was used by the insurance companies.




Mr Adams:
  And your government did nothing about it.




Mr ENTSCH:
  I was going to get onto that one. Back in 2007 after the New South Wales floods and again in 2008 in Queensland, a common definition for floods was put forward by the coalition as an important change by the industry at that time. What happened then is that the ACCC scuttled those previous attempts to introduce such a definition back in 2008 and my colleague and his government on the other side have done nothing at all to progress a common definition up until now. So it is great to see that we are actually moving forward in this area.


The other area we are looking at is there being a requirement that the insurance companies provide consumers with a key facts sheet outlining key information about their home building and their home contents insurance policies so that they can minimise the risk of misinterpretation, if you like, and people can feel comfortable with what they are paying for and that they are actually going to get in a time of crisis what they think they are paying for.


The Social Policy and Legal Affairs Committee did the inquiry on this. About the end of the time they were doing this report it started to become evident that there were other areas where there were some serious issues of insurance failure within the insurance industry. One of those areas was in strata title. Talking to the chair, Graham Perrett, I explained some of the issues we were facing in northern Australia, that while we were starting to get a bit of a handle on some of these issues with flood, up in my area we did not have flood problems, we had cyclone problems. Nevertheless, the devastation is just as profound and if you find you have no cover then the impact on the householder is just as serious. The problem that we were starting to experience up there was that insurance companies were actually withdrawing from Northern Australia. They were doing so in a most alarming manner in that they were increasing premiums to levels that were well beyond affordability. Of course, people could not afford to renew their policies. More and more insurance companies were refusing to insure. Initially, they denied that they were doing that in the area, but I have a letter here from Lumley Insurance, dated 14 February 2012. The letter is to Ms Schmitzer, who lives in North Cairns. The letter basically said:


With effect from 19th October 2011 Lumley Insurance ceased writing Household and Landlords Insurance in post codes 4737 and above.


That, in effect, is from Sarina north. Unfortunately, this is not an isolated incident. More and more insurance companies have been withdrawing their services in Northern Australia, based not on risk but purely on postcodes. It has become a serious problem up there, whether you are trying to get flood insurance, cyclone insurance or any sort of household insurance. 


We were faced with another challenge up there with how insurance companies were charging in the area. For example, the insurance premiums for a block of units valued at $10 million in the Cairns region, over a four-year period up until 2011, went from $11,000 to $12,000 to $23,500 to $92,500. You can imagine the impact that that has on families when they are trying to insure. It is also causing major issues in that units are becoming unsellable. We have many examples here where individuals can no longer live in their units. They cannot sell them because of the inflated insurance prices and the rates are greater than any return that you could get in a 12-month period.


As I said, I spoke to the minister and to Graham Perrett, Chair of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs. They graciously agreed to extend the hearing of the flood inquiry and to include body corporate insurance. They have had meetings up in Port Douglas, Cairns, Townsville and here in Canberra. The committee has done outstanding work. The report will be tabled later this month. I am confident that we will see in that report some recommendations that will extend over and above what we are seeing here in this bill, which will look at affordability of insurance in Northern Australia and also the availability of it. 


At Brooklyn Village, a dozen retired couples or individuals are living in what used to be an old mining village. For some reason known only to the council, they decided in their wisdom that, rather than subdivide the individual houses that were there into normal title, they would zone it as strata title. We have a strata title on individual houses, on lots from 1,000 square metres up to 13 acres. But they are all strata title. 


Under the current legislation, as it stands, those people have to insure the entire property for replacement value, including the old community hall that is sitting there and has never been used, the disused swimming pool, the tennis courts and a whole lot of things that are part of the village.  We also have 12 families living there that cannot get insurance. Of course, it is a major concern for them. Again, this issue was raised at the inquiry. I am hoping that we can find a way whereby we can get the insurance companies back into these regions. 


Other areas have been faced with similar crises in recent times—New Zealand and Japan, with the tsunamis, and, more recently and relevantly, in Thailand, with the floods. They are still recovering from that. The Thai government has now taken an initiative to provide underwriting of insurance companies. They have set up a scheme to allow residential and small to medium businesses to get insurance cover for flood. Up to that point you could not get any sort of insurance in Thailand, which was having a major impact. I understand that after the dreadful tsunami—we commemorated the anniversary only a couple of days ago—the Japanese government is looking at doing a similar thing. New Zealand has already implemented an underwriting policy in relation to earthquakes, providing an opportunity for landholders or property owners to buy affordable insurance to give them the security they need.


I know that in the Northern Territory—it is the only one in Australia—the TIO provides an underwriting facility to ensure insurance prices are affordable. There is no point having insurance if individuals or families cannot afford the policy. The other problem is that, even if premiums reduce to a level where they are remotely affordable, companies are putting so many extra requirements on them in relation to excesses that there is no way claims will succeed. So in effect policies are of no value at all.


Have a look at the progression or the failure of the industry, particularly in Northern Australia. I understand similar problems are being faced in the Murray area, and I suspect that with the flooding now going through New South Wales and Victoria we will see similar challenges as they recover from the disaster: affordability and insurance contracting or retracting out of regions continues. When the committee came to Port Douglas, one witness was Mandy Coxon, who has the Mossman Gorge Bed and Breakfast. She wrote a letter saying:


I have never written such a letter before nor have I ever felt I had a need to. However, with Cyclone Yasi we are not entitled to any sort of government rescue package but we run a small B&B. It is very modest. We were making an income of about $50,000 but because of all the economic problems in the area that income has reduced to $20,000 a year, but our insurance premium has gone up from $3,000 to $5,506.


She said that that works out at about 25 per cent of the annual turnover of their small business. It comes to a point where it is not affordable. I spoke to Mandy only a couple of weeks ago and she said that the insurance company which had offered her insurance at the increased price has now said that they are withdrawing their offer. She can no longer get insurance for her small B&B and it looks as though she is going to have to close her business down. 


We are seeing the same sort of thing in rural residential, where you are finding people on acreage. If they are not running it as an agribusiness and it is over five acres, most insurance companies are now refusing point blank to insure properties. So there are a lot of properties around the area now which are uninsured. One thing we can be sure of is that over time there will be more cyclones and more floods. The Insurance Contracts Amendment Bill is a very small step in the right direction of recognising that there need to be significant changes in interpretation and there has to be a way to ensure competition remains in the market so that we do not get more of these letters from insurance companies advising that, based purely on the postcode, that they will no longer consider the insurance risk.


While I commend these initiatives to the parliament, I say that it is only a very small step in the right direction. I know more recommendations will come out later this month and I suspect that given the failure of insurance in rural residential and other markets like B&B there will be further requirements in relation to reform, so that affordable and effective insurance can give people peace of mind and security, which they need to protect their assets, so that people do not become homeless with no chance of ever replacing their life savings. I commend the bill to the House.

"Adams, Dick, MP",ALP,2012-03-14,"



Mr ADAMS
 (Lyons) (16:31):  In 2010-11, there were a significant number of natural disasters in Australia: Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania all experienced severe flooding. For two years in a row now we have had extremely wet conditions and a lot more flooding in Queensland, Victoria and New South Wales. The number of people adversely affected by these natural disasters as a result of inadequate insurance cover has highlighted the level of consumer confusion about what is covered in insurance policies, in particular the extent to which policies provide cover for flood and what cover for flood means.


On 5 April 2011, the government released a consultation paper entitled 'Reforming Flood Insurance: Clearing the Waters' in order to engage the community in suggesting improvements to the regulatory framework and other aspects of Australia's insurance market. The paper contained two key proposals designed to improve clarity for consumers in relation to insurance policies and, in particular, the cover provided for various types of flood—namely, a standard definition of flood as well as a key facts sheet, the KFS, to outline the key information in relation to home building and home contents policies.


The Insurance Contracts Amendment Bill 2011 implements those proposals. The main points in this bill cover the standard definition of flood, which, hopefully, will reduce consumers' confusion regarding what is and what is not included in insurance policies and will avoid situations where neighbouring properties affected by the same inundation event receive different claim assessments because the policies covering them, where they exist, use different definitions of flood.


Compliance costs will be incurred by the industry for reassessing and rewriting policies. Industry has also indicated that a standard definition could result in repricing policies or in products being withdrawn, as those policies might provide greater coverage for flood, but at least this will be known to the consumer and they can take action to mitigate the risk. Either way, it will help both the insurance provider and the consumer to be more informed. Of course, this brings in the situation of where we build, planning laws and issues in relation to insurance. The key facts sheet, by outlining key information in a concise form, will provide increased simplicity, consistency and comparability for consumers where they are making decisions regarding the purchase of the HBHC insurance policies. The key facts sheet will also facilitate more effective decision-making through an increased level of familiarity: knowing what to look for and the meaning of certain words and concepts. While the actual wording for 'flood' included in regulations will be subject to consultation, it is expected to be consistent with the wording proposed by the government's consultation paper Reforming flood insurance:Clearing the waters. The proposed wording is that 'flood' means the covering of normally dry land by water that has escaped or been released from normal confines of any lake or any river, creek or other natural watercourse, whether or not altered or modified, or any reservoir, canal or dam. There is still work being done on these words, but I believe this will be the background definition that will be part of the regulations currently being revised.


Insurance providers are required to use a standard definition of the term 'flood' when using the word 'flood' or other parts of speech or grammatical forms of that word, such as flooding, in the prescribed contract, or the notice or other document or information, as provided in those regulations. If the definition or meaning of the word 'flood' or other parts of speech or grammatical form of that word, such as flooding, is different from the definition of the meaning of the word 'flood' provided in the regulations, the prescribed contract will be taken to have the meaning of 'flood' as provided in the regulations.


During the times of the floods in Tasmania in my electorate of Lyons—mainly in early 2011—we had great confusion among the insurance companies, who could not decide what was a flood and what was not. It made it very hard for people to claim anything and even harder for them to mitigate risk into the future. People just did not know what the circumstances were. 


Tasmania did it hard during the debate about public liability insurance as well, as there was a great deal of misinformation floating around at the time. The insurance industry failed on both of those occasions to be on the front foot, looking at what the consumer needs were and meeting their needs. It took a while before something could be done to allow small groups to stage events and be able to afford public liability, but it was a tangled web to get through and it took many community organisations in my electorate a long time to work their way through this—and some were lost in the process. 


It is the same with floods and other natural disasters. If people can assess their risk and are able to realise what could happen given a series of circumstances then they can do something, but when they run blind on how insurance companies operate or what meaning certain words have then everybody loses, most of all small clients who can least afford it. 


The report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs entitled In the wake of disasters was timely and covered a lot of the heartbreak that occurred during the 2011 floods, and hopefully will help those people still struggling in the floods this year. Those recent problems and floods have taken a large toll on people and entire communities—there is enormous trauma that comes from significant or total destruction of one's home, its contents, the businesses that people run and the loss of stock or the loss of pets through flooding. On top of this, affected residents have to deal with the disruptions to work, school, social networks, accommodation, health and transport. Trying to sort out insurance on top of all of this and trying to work through the processes you are required to when collecting insurance when there is a lack of information is soul destroying for individuals. I saw that during the floods in January 2011 in Tasmania. We need to go on funding services to assist communities with the practical aspects of rebuilding lives and we need to fund financial and emotional counselling. We must also ensure that insurance cover is seen as a part of the process. It should be possible to start sorting out one's life if there are guidelines that are easy to follow and an understanding of what insurance can cover and what the community can do to help those exposed to uninsurable events. This is not something new, but extreme events are becoming more common in this current climate cycle and people need to be aware of those problems.


I remember some of the problems that occurred in my electorate in the township of Railton in the municipality of Kentish. The river behind one particular house rose. Flood waters came up. That was seen as a flood. The water coming out of the storm water drain on the road side was not seen as a flood. And these waters rushed into the gardens and the houses along that street. Then there was an argument about who was insured and who was not. Different households were with different insurance companies. Sometimes the same insurance assessor was used by different insurance companies. The assessor made the arguments. But the companies made different decisions about what insurance was going to be paid. This confused people and made them very angry. It was very bad for the industry. They need to be on top of that.


Coming back to the issues, sometimes it does not matter how good a plan you use. You can still run into problems. But with the high-tech spatial stuff that we have today you can certainly plan a lot better. This will help municipal planners to decide where we can build as they will see where river courses are and where the water runs. If we could document all the history that we already have sitting around, that would give us a great deal of help in being able to put in place a proper process for urban planning in the future. Some places where we should not build will show up. If somebody wants to build there and take the risk, then you could offer them the opportunity to do that. But they would not get insured. As long as everybody understood that and got it, that would be okay. It is not good calling foul if you have built somewhere dangerous. And that goes with fires as well. We need to be a lot smarter about where we let people build and about how we look after fire-prone areas.


Where people build is defined by planning laws. I remember that in my home town of Longford there was a back creek, which ran into the South Esk. The planning for this town was defined by the 1929 flood. The 1929 flood was a very large flood in northern Tasmania. A king tide in the Tamar River came right up to Launceston, flooding all of Invermay, with a lot of that area inundated and put totally under water. The South Esk backed up right into the hinterlands and the township of Longford was totally inundated, with the back creek also catching a lot of rainfall from the mountains. Those flood levels defined where you could build in that town. It was not until recent years that mitigation through building a flood levy changed that. Now a new regime is operating. That town has a very fine school, fine clubs and two chemists and it should have the opportunity to grow and meet people's building needs. The importance of the insurance industry, which I mentioned earlier, goes back to those days of liability.


Also, on this occasion I take on board that in crises like those we have seen in New Zealand and in Japan the insurance industry—which is a very important industry for any community—would need help to look after those things, but in the normal circumstances that we have been experiencing in this country those industries should be much more advanced in where they are going to be into the future. When we start thinking about climate change and some of the issues that can come out of that, I believe that the industry needs to be on the front foot, not on the back foot, where it has been for some time. I also believe that improved spatial technology should allow us to do a lot more in being able to get our municipal planning into some level where people are not building on flood plains and where we can overcome many of these problems into the future. I do not say that we can overcome them all, but we should be able to overcome many.


So I believe this bill is the start of the process. There is much more we can do to allow and get insurance companies to do their work better and to be proactive but to ensure that there are fair parameters under which to work, much as we did with the public liability. I believe that this bill will do that and that it gets us there. It is certainly a bill that gives us a good start in sorting out some of the basic problems, which included the definitions around flooding. I support the bill.

"Jones, Ewen, MP",LP,2012-03-14,"



Mr EWEN JONES
 (Herbert) (16:46):  I would just like to say to the previous speaker that, when the creek flooded and it was going into the South Esk, I just hope that the water quality going through to the Boag's brewery, with waters from the North Esk River, was still in pristine condition. It is very important. The North and South Esk Rivers are a national treasure, and Boag's premium is of course one of the great beers of the world.


I rise to speak on the Insurance Contracts Amendment Bill 2011. This bill changes the laws governing insurance in the wake of the 2010 and 2011 floods throughout parts of Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria. The coalition does broadly support this bill. We recognise the insurance problems that the natural disasters around the country exposed and created and we will give our support to these measures and help address them. We are, however, concerned with the implementation of the changes being made in the bill.


Specifically, this bill will introduce the standard definition of flooding for insurance contracts. This will address the problem that arose following the season of natural disasters where residents, many having lost everything as a result of flooding, discovered that their insurance did not cover them because different policies defined flooding in different ways. We saw the birth of a new word with 'inundation' when it came through. I had never lived through an inundation. When I was a kid in my home town of Texas, we only ever had floods. This created confusion and lack of understanding for policy holders, but creating a standard definition means there will only be one interpretation for flooding wherever it appears in the insurance contract. This is a measure that the insurance industry and the coalition have repeatedly supported over the last five years following other flooding disasters, and it has taken until now for this government to push this through.


This bill introduces a requirement for insurance policies to come with a key facts sheet. This key facts sheet is supposed to help consumers better understand prospective policies and be able to more easily compare and asses their options. While industry broadly supports this idea and in fact many insurers already provide something similar, we are still weighing the draft requirements of these. In the retail side of the motor vehicle industry, there used to be a thing when a friend of mine had a Ford dealership in Townsville. He said his first dealer arrangement was with Esanda and it said, 'We the undersigned agree that Esanda takes a lien over everything in this lot with the following exceptions,' and it was a two-foolscap-page document which covered the arrangement between him and his finance company. The last one I delivered to him when I was working for Capital Finance was about 400 pages long. That is where we have gone with this. It is not the government's fault, but it is the nature of litigation in this country that we are pushing these things. It is important to note that this bill only provides legislation that will enable these proposed changes to take place. While the coalition agree in principle with these changes, we will be waiting to see the changes in their legislative form to get a better idea of how these measures will be rolled out.


While we in North Queensland may not have experienced the flooding that has taken place in South-East Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria, we did suffer through Cyclone Yasi, one of the worst cyclones to hit the region in close to a century, and surely the biggest storm that this country has ever seen. Since that disaster, Townsville residents have been plagued with insurance problems, from companies pulling out of their North Queensland market to skyrocketing premiums. Townsville residents have been left wondering how they can pay for insurance cost increases on top of the rising cost of living that this government has presided over.


For Townsville, one of the biggest problems has been an increase in strata title insurance. I have had numerous people living in apartment complexes coming to me and complaining about the astronomical increases in body corporate insurance that they have been forced to swallow. Do not forget that the thing about strata title insurance is that with house insurance you can take a punt that you are not going to get a fire and no-one is going to chase you up, but not having strata title insurance is against the law and you are criminally liable under the strata title act; you must have this strata title insurance. Many of these concerns were heard at the strata title insurance inquiry that recently visited Townsville for a public hearing, and I would like to pass on my thanks to the member for Moreton for his proactive actions in bringing that inquiry to Townsville and Cairns. I would also like to thank both him and the member for Blair for the way they conducted that inquiry, especially the bits I saw in Townsville. It was clear to me that they were actively looking for answers, and I hope that their final report will reflect the sincerity and concern expressed to them by the attendees.


The attendees at the meeting in Townsville were predominantly self-funded retirees and pensioners. They are the ones who are most affected by these problems, and they are the ones who can least afford them and have been forced to cop these huge premium increases. We have asked them to come to a unit building as a cheaper way for them to see out the autumn of their years. They have to survive on a set income. They cannot cope with premium rises of nearly 700 per cent. They also risk the reduction of their capital base. If the unit dwelling becomes unaffordable and there is a market issue with too many properties on the market, the unit price will drop, making their lives more unsustainable.


Tom and Tina Pietzsch attended the hearing. They are self-funded retirees living in one of three apartments in a unit complex. The only shared facilities in the complex are a pool area and a lift. In 20 years the complex has made two claims—a small one after Cyclone Larry in 2006 and a slightly bigger one after Yasi last year. They have seen their premiums triple to $15,000 in one hit from before Yasi. When this was added to the maintenance and other costs that the body corporate fee needs to pay for, living in a unit suddenly became unattainable for Townsville residents.


I spoke to the widow of a friend of mine. She is living in a modest unit in North Ward, which is a central suburb in Townsville. Her concern was not so much how she could afford the huge increase in premiums. She does not have the option. She has to be able to afford it. She has no option. Her only option was to consider which foods she could do without. That goes into play in things like the health debate. We are talking about older people here, living in these things, who are going to end up not being able to survive or who will suffer health deterioration in a hospital. These are the things that people have to go through.


I also spoke to Mick Price, who is a mate of mine, about insurance in Townsville. Mick lives in a two-level apartment complex on the marina in Townsville. Over just three years, his body corporate insurance bill has risen some 690 per cent. Over those three years, his body corporate insurance premiums have risen from $27,000 to $187,000. In anyone's language, that is simply unsustainable. Part of Mick's problem is that there is simply no flexibility in the way they insure. They have three buildings which housed the unit dwellings. They have another building which acts as a garage and a shed for the complex. If they had the option to not insure the whole but to flexibly insure parts to different degrees, he would be happier. He would like to see flexibility over what products he could take. Being on the marina, they have absolutely no need for flood insurance, but they are still getting billed for it. When we have this problem with insurance costs in North Queensland, we need to be working with the industry to make these changes that could help bring premiums down. He would countenance an increase in excess—not to the extent of $250,000 but to, say, $20,000—to help lower that cost burden. I know that insurer Zurich said that for every dollar they received in premiums they paid out $1.15. So somewhere along the line someone is taking advantage of the system. If you increase the excess it will take away those things where people are claiming for fans, blinds and all those silly things that in the normal course of events you would not do.


I spoke also with Melinda Holborn, who lives in a block of townhouses on the banks of the Ross River. They went through Cyclone Yasi without the loss of even a fence paling. Still they saw in one year their insurance premium rise from $14,000 to $81,000. They shopped around and were able to get the price down to just over $50,000, but the pain is immediate and severe. Again Melinda wants to be able to insure with some sort of flexibility. Where she lives they have a tidal riverfront which is protected by two weirs and a dam, yet they are seen as high risk due to being a river frontage property.


I believe in markets. I do not want to see government intervention here. I believe we are seeing a short-term reaction which plays into the world market. I believe that as the financial markets contract worldwide underwriters will leave the market, making funds scarce. To compensate, insurers will have to raise the return on the investment to make it more attractive. Put these things together and you have rising premiums. I believe that the market will make a decision on the viability of the North Queensland body corporate insurance market. I believe that very soon some guy somewhere will be looking for margin and market share. They will look at the North Queensland market and decide that they should be getting some of this market and they will come in at a discounted price. I do not believe that CGU, which is the only company which is currently offering body corporate insurance to larger dwellings, should be vilified for raising premiums. I think they should be thanked for still offering a product. It is the big insurers of Queensland, and in particular Suncorp, who have made their commercial decision to leave North Queensland. They are still taking our car insurance, life insurance and home and contents insurance. They have just left this part of their portfolio. I would like to call on all North Queenslanders to weigh up their insurance and banking decisions with this in mind.


After 2011 proved to be such a horror year of natural disasters in Queensland and other parts of the country, a natural disaster insurance review was commissioned just over 12 months ago. Recommendations were received in September. After six weeks to consider these recommendations we have now seen this government defer 39 of the 47 recommendations that were made. Their biggest decision so far was to commit to further reviews. We have seen detrimental flooding come once again this year and we still have not seen much progress made on the lessons learned from the last lot of flooding. This government needs to get its act together and take decisive action on the review's full recommendations. The more we continue to delay, the more natural disaster victims we will have who cannot benefit from the lessons of past disasters.


Most people out there say they simply do not understand what is going on. They do not understand why their premium has risen so much. It would help if someone could give them a reason. But the people who come to my office are not making claims. It is not as if they have been making spurious claims. Cyclone Yasi came through Townsville and was basically a category 2.5. It was a big storm and I am not trying to belittle anything. There were lots of trees down but we did not cop anywhere near what Cardwell and Tully did. Those guys are the ones sitting there telling me that they just do not understand. They ask, 'Why is it that we are copping it in the neck at this very moment?' No-one can give them an answer. The insurance company says it is reinsurance. Nobody seems to be able to understand what is going on. We have asked people to move out of their family home into units on a fixed income and it is simply unsustainable. Those are the people we have to worry about because they are the ones who will be the collateral damage.


I support the measures taken in this bill, though it remains to be seen how successful the implementation will be. The natural disasters of the last 18 months have brought about many problems with insurance policies. While it is good to see measures being taken to address concerns associated with flooding, insurance problems are continuing to hurt North Queenslanders. I will be closely watching the government's response to the outcome of the strata title inquiry and doing whatever I can to ensure that this government and the insurance industry are working towards a solution. As I said before, I think the member for Moreton, who is heading this inquiry, has done a fantastic job and has come at this at the right angle. But we want to see what actually happens when the decisions and the recommendations have to be made. Thank you very much to for the opportunity to speak on this bill.

WYATT ROY
 (Longman) (17:00):  When the floodwaters rose in my electorate in January last year there was an overall sense of fear, uncertainty and panic in my community. The waters came up so quickly that in some circumstances there was very little time for evacuations or preparations. But for all of the fear and all the uncertainty surrounding the floods themselves it was the aftermath that has struck at the hearts of thousands of Queenslanders, including many living in my community. After the waters subsided, unmistakable genuine dread, panic and frustration set in. In the days following the tragic Queensland floods of 2011 my office was inundated with calls from concerned local residents who were unsure whether they were covered by insurance and what they needed to do to find out the truth from their insurance providers, who at the time seemed to be less than forthcoming with the relevant information.


For these people, who had lost all of their worldly possessions, the fear and uncertainty as they waited for judgment on whether they were covered by their insurance was paralysing. In some cases this fear was justified. Many who had thought that they were covered by their insurance simply were not and were instead left to the mercy of the community to come to their assistance. It is for these families that we are here today to debate the Insurance Contracts Amendment Bill 2011.


This bill introduces two measures: a standard definition of 'flood' for insurance contracts and a requirement of insurance providers to provide key facts sheets to consumers taking out home building and contents insurance policies. In January 2011 many individuals were left without insurance coverage when they had mistakenly assumed they would be covered—all of which could be put down to mistaken understandings facilitated by the use of compound, complicated phrases which, without experience in the insurance industry, seemed almost impossible to decipher the true meaning and extent of coverage for flood incidents.


The confusion experienced by people in my community was not an isolated incident. It was not isolated to a particular insurance provider or just to our community. In fact, individuals across the country were confused. The devastating floods that this country faced demonstrated that the existing regulations governing insurance contracts were insufficient and inadequate for the people of this country.


The disturbing and disappointing reality is that the lack of a common definition for 'flood' was first highlighted as an issue back in 2007. Yet it has taken nearly five more years and a series of devastating floods across the country for those across the chamber to give this issue the importance it deserves and to start to make some progress towards a solution. Even the insurance industry itself, which was pushing for a standard definition, was unable to encourage this Labor government to pursue this issue with the stamina and commitment it deserved. No, this government's resolve wavered at the first hurdle when initial plans to introduce a common definition were scuttled by the ACCC.


Those on the opposite side of the House let this issue lay dormant until they received the resounding wake-up call of the 2011 floods. It was not until the wake-up call of last year's floods, and at the insistence of this side of the House, that this Labor government finally took action on this issue. In March the National Disaster Insurance Review was commissioned and in April consultations began. But, when the review's recommendations were received by the government in September, instead of taking immediate action on the recommendations, the powers that be held back the release of the review until November, thereby preventing any genuine action before the start of another Australian wet season and the floods that we have again seen across this country.


More disappointing still was the government's decision to defer decisions on 39 of the total of 47 recommendations of the report. It would seem that the only tangible, solid action that this government was willing to take was to commit to still further reviews. In marked contrast to those opposite, the coalition has always stood for action and has consistently sought to achieve a standard, universal definition of 'flood' to be utilised by all insurance providers in their contracts. We on this side of the House support the recommendation of the natural disaster insurance review, that the government should introduce a standard definition of 'flood' in order to avoid any consumer confusion surrounding flood coverage within insurance policies. The final report recommends that the definition of 'flood' be:


...  the covering of normal dry land by water that has escaped or been released from the normal confines of:


(a) any lake, or any river, creek or other natural watercourse, whether or not altered or modified; or


(b) any reservoir, canal or dam.


We on this side of the House support this standard definition for floods across the entire country and across every insurance company.


After the devastating floods of last year, I held extensive community consultation both online and in person with stakeholders and affected locals in my community. This consultation revealed the desperate need to address the lack of a standard definition of 'flood'. One of the many people from my community that I spoke to told me, and I quote verbatim:


The government needs to look into the wording of what a flood et cetera are in insurance companies as most people are only now finding out what their policy really means to them.


This was one of the many desperate cries for help from my community. Yet another was from a local resident of Mary Street, Caboolture—one of the worst affected local streets during the flood. Despite having been insured with the same company for 26 years and being under the impression that he was covered for flood, this gentleman's insurance claim after the flood was declined. The ambiguity surrounding whether the flood was a flash-flooding event or a riverine-rising event means that he sadly discovered that he would not be covered for the damage to his home. One can only imagine the desperation that this gentleman and his wife felt upon receiving this news. I can only imagine that this surprising and devastating news would not have been needed to be delivered if this Labor government had been more proactive in making changes to insurance contract laws when concerns were first raised in 2007.


It was the compelling testimonials and broader community feedback that were the motivation for me to make a submission to the commission of inquiry into the Queensland floods. In my response to the commission of inquiry, and based on the extensive feedback that I received from the community during the community consultation that I conducted in my electorate, I recommended that a standard definition of 'flood' be developed by the Insurance Council of Australia and applied by all insurance providers and that policyholders be provided with information about their level of cover in plain English.


My community has experienced firsthand the importance of a single universal definition for the word 'flood' and the confusion experienced due to the many and varied definitions of flood in insurance contracts. The outcome of the confusing jargon so often used in insurance contracts has in some instances shattered the dreams of families who have lost everything only to find that their insurance did not cover their losses. For those who were left without insurance coverage, my local community did an excellent job, and I thank the countless individuals who did a wonderful job in facilitating delivery of emergency goods and assistance to the many families in my region.


This standard universal definition will provide clarity to the many people in my electorate when planning their future insurance. Those residents on Dale Street in Burpengary will have greater certainty when taking out insurance policies. While this may not be a solution to the poor planning decisions that have gone before, the regulation of a standard definition of 'flood', will allow them to make informed choices about whether they take out flood coverage. Sadly, for some in my community these measures have come too late. But unless a standard definition of 'flood' is created and used now, many more will suffer the same fate as those in my community did in January last year.


The second measure that this bill deals with is that of the key facts sheet. It is the intention that this bill will require all insurance companies to provide consumers with a key facts sheet about their policy. This is a commonsense measure that will enable consumers to effectively compare apples with apples when it comes to their insurance and give them every opportunity to make an educated and informed decision regarding their home and contents insurance. In an industry that has been fraught with confusion and ambiguity, evidence of which has been seen in the way the flood related claims have played out over the past 12 months, measures to increase transparency are important, if not essential. Unfortunately, the draft requirements for the key facts sheets have not yet been released. However, the minister has indicated that they will be put through rigorous consumer testing before the final regulations are decided upon. It is absolutely critical that this process of consumer testing be adhered to. The purpose of the key fact sheet is to help consumers to make informed decisions about their insurance products. The ability of the key fact sheets to be an effective tool for informing consumers will depend on the content that is required to be included. If this is not thoroughly tested and vetted to check that it is achieving these goals, this measure will not reach its potential.


It is important that this measure delivers an effective result for the consumer so that we do not see a repeat of what we saw last year. Although I rise to speak in support of this bill today, I have concerns about the implementation of the two measures that this bill seeks to add to insurance law. It is important to note that this bill will merely enable changes to be made to the Insurance Contracts Regulations. The regulations of these two measures are not controlled by this bill and there is concern both by industry and on this side of the chamber about the uncertainty left by this bill. Until we see the regulations themselves and know how these measures will be enforced under the regulations, it is difficult to assess the adequacy of the measures. It is absolutely imperative that more time is not wasted—that Australians have the benefit of both a standard and a universal definition of flood and the advantage of a key fact sheet from insurance providers in order to enable them to easily compare insurance policies. It is in this vein that I support this bill.

"Van Manen, Bert, MP",LP,2012-03-14,"



Mr VAN MANEN
 (Forde) (17:11):  I too rise to speak on the Insurance Contracts Amendment Bill 2011. This bill proposes to change insurance law to introduce a standard definition of flood in insurance contracts and a key fact sheet to give people more and easier-to-identify information on their home and building contents policies, and to enable them to compare different policies from different companies.


I think it is worthwhile at this point to look at a bit of the history of this measure. The Insurance Council of Australia originally proposed a standard definition of 'flood' in 2008 following the New South Wales floods of 2007. The initial proposal by the Insurance Council of Australia was subsequently rejected by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission following concerns raised by various consumer groups. In its statement, the ACCC encouraged the consumer groups and the Insurance Council of Australia to work together on the development of a common definition of flood which would make it easier for consumers to understand what the term means.


Before we get to the actions—or, should I say, lack thereof—of those opposite and this current government, let us look at what our wonderful consumer advocate groups have done. It appears that these consumer advocate groups have failed to follow up on the ACCC's encouragement to work with the Insurance Council of Australia to develop a standard definition of flood for insurance policies. If this is the case, and I have been led to believe by the Insurance Council that it is, then these so-called consumer advocate groups have let down the very consumers whose interests they are supposedly representing or protecting, which has contributed to costing these consumers tens of millions of dollars in the process. Equally, as I just mentioned, the current federal Labor government has done nothing to progress a common definition of flood after the ACCC scuttled the industry attempt to introduce a definition in 2008. It is interesting when you compare the wording of that proposed definition with the proposed standard wording in this bill. There are far more similarities than differences.


It has taken the disastrous floods in Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria and Cyclone Yasi in 2011 to finally get those opposite to act and realise the seriousness of addressing the issue for the victims of flooding. It has become even more relevant in the past week and a half, when we have seen flooding in southern New South Wales and northern Victoria. The government's initial step following these disasters was to commission the Natural Disaster Insurance Review in March 2011. The review recommendations were received by the government in September 2011 but were not released until November 2011, and they contained some 47 recommendations. In a stunning case of déjà vu, we remember the Henry tax review. Despite having six weeks to consider the recommendations, the government has deferred decisions on 39 of the report's 47 recommendations. In fact the government's biggest decision was to commit to further reviews. I wonder how those who have been flooded are feeling about that.


At least we now have something on the table. But this is only enabling legislation, creating the mechanism by which the regulations can be drawn up by the minister to be inserted into the Insurance Contracts Act. There are some questions as to what the wording of the regulations will be. The question now becomes: when will these regulations be announced to provide consumers and the insurance industry with much-needed certainty? I have been advised by the Insurance Council of Australia that at least five insurers have announced that they have or will be introducing standard flood definitions in their policies, and they are looking to do so in good faith in anticipation of the fact that the regulations, when introduced, will honour the key points outlined in this bill. Once again, this demonstrates the capacity of business to deal with community concerns.


This bill seeks to define the standard definition of flood, along with restricting the use of compound phrases including words such as flash flooding or accidental flooding. I think that is a very good step because there is much confusion about what the definitions in current household contents policies actually say. If I have a look at my policy, I find you need to almost be a lawyer to understand it. I am fortunate that I do not live in an area that is likely to be flooded. If I do get flooded, there will be a lot of people in a lot of trouble. However, the legislation before us today does not require all insurance policies to insure against flooding. People still need to be very mindful of what they are actually getting in their insurance policies, and that is part of the importance of the key facts sheet. The definition proposed is:


'Flood' means the covering of normally dry land by water that has escaped or been released from the normal confines of:


(a) any lake, or any river, creek or other natural watercourse, whether or not altered or modified; or


(b) any reservoir, canal or dam.


Any standard definition will not benefit current flood victims as it will only take effect once this legislation is passed and the regulations have been inserted into the Insurance Contracts Act. As the member for Longman has pointed out, the industry supports this change along with the proposed key facts sheet; however, there are still concerns about the final version of these regulations. The key facts sheet is meant to provide consumers with key information to allow them to more easily understand and compare insurance policies.


In 2012, we saw renewed flooding in Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria. As the minister was quoted saying on the ABC several days ago, already some 8,000 insurance claims totalling around $64 million have been lodged as a result of the latest flooding and, as the minister rightly pointed out, this figure will only increase. As we debate this legislation, there are still towns in Victoria and New South Wales who are affected by flooding and homeowners are still looking to sandbag and protect their properties. But it is not only homeowners; there are many small businesses in these small country towns that are also being affected. These latest natural disasters serve as a reminder of how vulnerable we all are to nature's vagaries. We need to ensure that we do everything that we can to protect ourselves and the community during these times. It is predominantly through the use of insurance in this modern age that we look to do that. That is why it is so important that these changes to the Insurance Contracts Act to provide this standard definition and to require insurers to provide a key facts sheet are introduced as soon as possible to give everybody certainty about what their level of cover is.


One of the key concerns for me, though, is that this standard definition of flood cover is being introduced after flooding events have occurred. What effect is this going to have on premiums? We have already seen or heard of instances in which there have significant increases in premiums as a result of properties being in flood-affected areas. In a time when people's living costs are going through the roof, these increased premium costs are only going to make it more difficult for people to maintain their policies. That is another reason why these issues should have been dealt with four or five years ago when the problems first arose. If that had been done, potentially the costs of the policies would have been more manageable.


While the floods last year had very little impact on my electorate, I remember the 1974 floods and the devastating effect they had on my community at that time. Two houses in my street were washed away as a result of that flooding. I saw the effect that had on the families involved. I was also involved in cleaning up other houses in the community that had been inundated. As former senior flood forecaster for the Bureau of Meteorology Geoff Heatherwick stated in the Courier Mail yesterday, it is important to remember that these past floods can and will occur again. It is only a question of when.


There are other issues to do with properties being flooded, such as town planning and development decisions. Our councils and state governments have a significant requirement on them to have a look at their policies and processes in this regard.


As my colleagues have stated, the coalition is supportive of these amendments. However we maintain our concern about whether what is outlined in these bills before us will ultimately be reflected in the regulations. Australians want certainty and the government must act now to ensure that the recommendations that have had their implementation delayed or deferred are addressed as soon as possible. There should be more than plenty of motivation in light of recent disasters to warrant a speedy resolution to this matter. The coalition await the final regulations as we want to ensure that they provide the certainty and the clarity that are required so that all parties to insurance contracts have confidence, especially the purchasers of home and contents insurance policies.

"Ciobo, Steven, MP",LP,2012-03-14,"



Mr CIOBO
 (Moncrieff) (17:23):  I am pleased to rise to speak on the Insurance Contracts Amendment Bill 2011. This is a bill that I had some involvement with in my capacity as deputy chair of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics when the committee undertook a short inquiry into the operation of the bill. The issue is, as we have all heard from many contributors to this debate, a country that is fraught with extremes. Extremes in nature occur on a regular basis. In this past two months alone in my city of the Gold Coast we have seen very significant falls. Flooding occurred only a week ago through large tracts of the Australian countryside. People's lives have been put on hold; people's livelihoods have been put on hold. People's homes have been directly affected and impacted upon by flooding. The issue is what can government do to assist. Following the tragic floods that took place in the summer of 2011, when we saw devastation across so many parts of Australia, in particular in Brisbane, Ipswich, and in parts of Victoria, we know there were many people who thought that they were adequately protected and covered by flood insurance only to, horrifyingly, discover subsequently that they did not have flood cover, or at least not be covered for the incident that occurred to them.


When this bill came before the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics, it was a chance to explore in more detail the way the bill would operate to alleviate the concerns that people had and to provide surety and certainty that their insurance would provide them with the benefit of that cover should their home or otherwise be flooded. What quickly came to pass though was that this bill is effectively nothing more than what is known as colloquially referred to as a coathanger bill. It is a bill that pushes through principle only, and it is a bill that does not contain the actual important information—and in fact that will be deferred to being passed in the regulation. So we have a bill that is, for all intents and purposes, next to useless when it comes to providing certainty for people who are wondering whether or not they have got adequate flood cover, and what exactly the word 'flood 'means in their insurance policy. This an easy fix. The fact is the government has been sitting on information now for a matter of years about how they should best deal with issue of flood. The fact is that the government could have incorporated a definition of the word 'flood' into this bill and not have deferred the matter to regulation. 


What is clear is that industry and stakeholders have been yearning for clarity around this issue in their consolations with government and with Treasury. As part of the roundtable inquiry that the House of Representatives economics committee undertook, there was significant discussion around whether industry was confident that the final version that we will see in the regulation will mirror industry expectations, and provide certainty and clarity of the type that was sought. What is also clear is that concerns were raised as well with the operation of the second element of the bill which deals with the key facts sheet that would need to be issued as a consequence of the passage of this legislation. 


In both instances, although we are supportive of the bill insofar as it is a pathway to providing surety and clarity, we are disappointed that this information was not contained in the legislation itself. Given the significant period of time that has elapsed since this whole journey began, it is obvious that there would have been opportunity to incorporate that information into the bill. I note in particular the supplementary remarks made by the member for Higgins, the member for Wright and me with respect to the committee's recommendations that the bill be passed. Although, yes, we certainly were supportive, as Liberal members of the committee, we stated we:


... cannot ... agree with paragraphs 2.50 and 2.51 of the report that outlined assurances that outlined assurances the Department of Treasury was engaged in constructive dialogue with industry and consumer groups; as well as the observation that there were 'no points raised in submissions or at the hearing that the Treasury was not already across or was taking steps to consider solutions'.


The reason we focused explicitly on rebutting those two paragraphs was that that was not clear, it was not plain and it was not apparent. The reality is that a number of comments were made by industry stakeholders that actually ran quite to the contrary. Very clear statements were made that it depended on what was actually contained within regulation and that that would dictate whether industry, and indeed consumers, would be better off. Statements were made, during the inquiry about the definition of flood and the impact of it. The transcript states:


Mr Ciobo: Wasn’t that the entire point of this bill—


to define floods?


Mr Anning: Not the actual definition of flood. That is subject to the discussions under the regulations.


Mr Ciobo: So, we actually have no clarification yet of what the impact of this would be on potentially thousands of people …


Mr Anning: … I guess the point is we are not at the point of having the clarity to even form a view.


So if that does not underscore the extent to which there is industry confusion and apprehension about the operation of the regulations of this bill then I do not know how it could be more plainly put. The reality is that all Australians want to have some certainty with respect to flood insurance. In my electorate of Moncrieff, based on the Gold Coast, I have literally hundreds if not thousands of homes that sit on the waterfront. I have so many homes that are placed upon canals, placed upon rivers, and owners that question whether or not there is actually going to be an impact if a flood were to go through. Of course the great flood that people of the Gold Coast still talk about is 1974 flood. People in Brisbane used to talk about the 1974 floods until the 2011 floods. The Gold Coast was spared and had the good grace and good fortune of not having the devastation we saw in Brisbane in 2011. That notwithstanding, people still talk about the 1974 floods and the 1974 flood levels. In this respect, it is obvious that people want definitions and clarity around the word 'flood' because it has direct impact on their coverage.


Take, for example, a home that is situated on a canal. There would be word games played under policies previously where, if as a consequence of rain, there was a flood coupled with a king tide that actually pushed seawater back in the canal estate and caused water to go into the home, whether it was freshwater or salt water would actually determine whether or not your policy was in place—whether or not you have coverage by virtue of the fact that it was seawater or freshwater. 


These kinds of examples of hairsplitting ultimately caused the problems that have led to the quest for a common definition of the word 'flood'. In this respect it is clear that we join with the government in wanting this issue to be resolved. But, again, I restate our concern that this was not resolved within the bill and now once again has been deferred to the regulations—something that is still going to take some time to come forward.


The second element of this particular bill deals with the issue of the key facts sheet. The key facts sheet is of itself a good idea. A key facts sheet provides a high-level summary of the information contained within the policy and the operation of policy for the benefit of consumers. It is not, however, a replacement for the policy itself. It is important that not be held out as being the case, because people need to understand that they can look at a key facts sheet to achieve exactly that—the key facts—but not to have a comprehensive understanding.


There are also a number of housekeeping matters that were raised before the House of Representatives Economics Committee inquiry, which Deputy Speaker Leigh would be very familiar with, which dealt with the issue of the operation of the key facts sheet and whether or not the key facts sheet would need to be sent out to consumers for each and every additional alteration to the policy document, or whether it could be, for example, an annual event. Again, there is no clarity around these issues because these issues ultimately are dependent upon the passage of the regulations. For us as an opposition trying to hold this very poor government to account, the fact remains that we are required to now sit idly by and wait for Treasury to undertake its consultation and for that information to be contained within regulations, which would then presumably be subject to a disallowance motion. So for those reasons we think this is particularly poor form the government's part and we think it is not a particularly good way to provide good governance and certainty to industry, stakeholders and to consumers. I will confine my comments to those. As I said, we do support the passage of the bill, but this could have been a much, much better effort.

"Mirabella, Sophie, MP",LP,2012-03-14,"



Mrs MIRABELLA
 (Indi) (17:33):  I rise to support the Insurance Contracts Amendment Bill 2011 and do so with great degree of disappointment and without overwhelming enthusiasm. I think on the whole most of what is contained in the bill is a step in the right direction, but there is such a deficiency of actual substance to it that it will provide little comfort to those people who have suffered during the floods and who want greater clarity. 


I also think that the Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation unrealistically raised expectations in the wake of the January 2011 floods. Those who had hoped for real, substantial measures have been badly let down, because of course, as has been said by previous speakers, and most eloquently just before me by the member for Moncrieff, the devil is fundamentally in the detail—in the regulations that will accompany this bill. All of us, not just members of the opposition but those Australians out there who are wanting to know what the government policy is, will have to wait until those regulations come out. People in my electorate do it tough. They are subject to significant natural disasters. In many ways, natural disasters, whether they be fires or floods, are a way of life for so many people in central and north-east Victoria, and something that we have learnt to live with. Where policymakers can come into play is when they can be proactive regarding policy frameworks that make it as easy as possible for people to respond to and prepare for natural disasters.


The main purpose of the bill is obviously to set a standard definition for flood. There is general agreement that it is high time that there was a nationally agreed definition for flood and that that is adopted. We all know that the insurance industry want to minimise risk and maximise return, and the ambiguity regarding a definition for flood has allowed them to pursue their commercial interests, as is to be expected. But this has left customers out in the cold, sometimes in the most atrocious of fashions. Unfortunately, we are yet to see the wording of this standard definition, so you can understand, Mr Deputy Speaker Leigh, why I am not wholeheartedly jumping for joy and embracing this legislation with great enthusiasm because it is crucial that the definition is right. It is one thing to support a well-meaning concept; it is another thing for that well-meaning concept can be incorporated in an accepted and well understood, simple definition. 


The second component of the bill is the provision of a fact sheet for policyholders. Again, it is a noble concept and a sensible proposal. But the lack of detail about when the fact sheets will be made available, what they will contain, what they need to contain and whether the language is simple make it difficult to pass judgment until we actually see the regulations. The Natural Disaster Insurance Review put forward some very sensible suggestions—and it did raise the expectations of many people in the electorate. A key recommendation is the mandatory application of flood cover, but with a requirement to provide an opt-out clause. The importance of this recommendation was brought to light this year in my electorate when the RACV made the decision to apply flood cover to all insurance policies without giving customers the ability to opt out. The day the policy renewal invoices were sent out, my office was inundated and the phones ran hot. I am told that there was a 50-metre long queue outside the RACV offices in Wodonga. I spoke to countless customers whose insurance premiums skyrocketed overnight. 


Just to appreciate the anxiety that this caused, I will list a couple of examples of the overnight increases in the insurance premiums. Joan from Park Lane in Wangaratta has lived in her house for 15 years. She has seen several floods in her time, none of which have impacted on her property. Yet her insurance premium rose from $540 a year to more than $3,000 a year. That is an increase of more than 550 per cent. Dianne from Martin Place in Wangaratta saw her premium go from $1,188 a year to $9,552 a year. That is an increase of more than 800 per cent. Chris Blake from Mansfield has never seen floods pass through her town before and her house has never been impacted, yet her insurance premium went from $470 to $2,400. That is an increase of 500 per cent. Chris has been looking elsewhere for a new policy, but is finding it increasingly difficult. AAMI quoted her $5,000. Most insurance companies in fact will not even give her a quote at all. This goes beyond just the RACV. I fear these problems will spread unless something is done soon. Giving consumers the choice of insurance by opting out is a very sensible suggestion, so they can decide the level of cover that they can afford and the risks with which they can live. I have had countless examples of consumers—just like the ones I have mentioned, constituents of mine—who have been left high and dry by their insurers. I think it is important to quote these examples, because I have heard some very questionable statistics floating around about how few customers will be impacted by the decisions of companies like the RACV. I would be more than happy to put forward these examples to the minister if they would assist him in progressing his deliberations on the very important issues and recommendations raised in this review. 


This particular issue does go deeper. I have also spoken to local insurance brokers, and they have told me that some insurance companies have just left some parts of my electorate altogether. What happens when it comes time to sell a property that cannot be insured for under $10,000 a year or that cannot be insured at all? If this particular practice spreads, we will have a crisis in the housing industry in some parts of this country. Who on earth is going to buy a property that cannot be insured, or that costs more than $10,000 a year to insure?


So this does need urgent attention. I understand the minister is looking at the legal consequences of a proposal to introduce mandatory flood cover with a compulsory opt-out proposal. I look forward to advice on this matter in the near future. It is absolutely critical to many people across the country—in capital cities and in the regions—who are experiencing great anxiety and uncertainty, not only about their insurance cover but also about the value of their primary asset, which is their home. I hope the minister does move quickly, because many of my constituents are being left uninsured in the meantime. 


On a final point, the NDIR proposed a national flood overlay map. This is a very important recommendation. One of the problems customers face when their insurance companies tell them they are in a flood zone is that it is very difficult to make a compelling argument in response. Local knowledge and experience does not really carry much weight. Insurance companies are not required to disclose their flood map data, which puts customers in a particularly disadvantageous position if they do not agree that they are in a flood zone. A national flood overlay map would empower customers to appeal, by providing them with nationally consistent, high-quality data. I hope the government gives this due consideration, because it is a sensible proposal. 


In summary, I support the bill before the House, but it is only a very small step—and, in many ways, a motherhood step. The substance will be in the regulations and that is where we will assess the details to ensure that they are adequate and live up to their promises. 


There is much to be done, and many Australians will be watching very closely to ensure that the minister's rhetoric during the floods of 2011 is backed up with substantial policy responses and real legislation that address the fundamental problems that are crippling many homeowners at the moment.

Mr SHORTEN
 (Maribyrnong—Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation and Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations) (17:44):  I thank honourable members for their contributions to the debate on the Insurance Contracts Amendment Bill 2011—including the member for Indi for her charming contribution. I note that she was attacking the government for making statements; it puzzles me somewhat why the coalition when they were in power failed to do any of what we are doing, because floods are not new. This government has acted. This bill will implement measures to assist consumers to make effective decisions in relation to their insurance needs through increased clarity and accessibility of information. 


Schedule 1 of the bill will amend the Insurance Contracts Act 1984 to provide a standard definition of 'flood' across all home building and home contents insurance policies, and to extend this definition to cover small businesses and strata title bodies corporate. The definition provides a clear and easily understandable meaning for what is commonly known as riverine flooding—the covering of normally dry land with water that has escaped or been released from the normal confines of any lake, river, creek or any other natural water course or alternatively any reservoir, canal or dam. This measure will reduce consumer confusion regarding what is and what is not included in insurance contracts. It will avoid situations in which neighbouring properties affected by the same inundation event received different claims assessments because the flood policies covering them used different definitions of flood.


This measure will also improve the ability of consumers to evaluate potential insurance policies and compare like products with different insurer providers. I have moved amendments to the bill to ensure that the standard definition of 'flood' can operate as intended. The amendments respond to concerns raised by insurers in consultation with the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics as outlined by the committee's advisory report on the Insurance Contracts Amendment Bill released on 17 February 2012. I note that the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics recommended that the House of Representatives pass this bill. The details of the standard definition of 'flood' will be included in the regulations. Draft regulations were released for consultation late last year and Treasury will be undertaking further consultation in order to ensure that the wording and application of the standard definition is appropriate.


Schedule 2 of the bill will amend the Insurance Contracts Act 1984 to implement a requirement for insurers to provide consumers with a key facts sheet for home building and home contents insurance policies. This measure will make the purchase of home building and home contents policies simpler for consumers by assisting them compare policies with a consistent document and by facilitating more informed decision making.


On 29 February 2012 I released a discussion paper on the key facts sheet, which seeks stakeholder views on the format, content, structure and provision of the key facts sheet. Feedback on the discussion paper will allow the government to develop a prototype key facts sheet, which will be consumer tested. Once consumer testing is finalised, regulations will be made to give effect to the key facts sheet.


Some opposition members, as is their wont, have criticised the government for including elements of the standard definition, including the prescribed contracts to which it will apply and the wording of the definition in regulations. The prescribed contracts to which the standard definition of 'flood' will apply will be contained in regulations. This is consistent with the location of the standard cover regime for standardised contracts and reduces the potential for unintended consequences for both consumers and insurers. This is particularly important given that the standard definition will apply to small business and strata title policies. The wording of the standard definition of 'flood' will also be contained in the regulations. This will ensure that the policy intent of the new standard definition of 'flood' can be achieved in a simple and effective way and will safeguard against the potential for the standard definition of 'flood' to apply inappropriately.


The consultation process that the government has undertaken has been transparent and thorough. In April 2011 the government released a discussion paper that contained the proposed definition. The Natural Disaster Insurance Review considered this issue and in its final report recommended the adoption of the government's preferred definition. The government is now undertaking a final round of consultation on the wording. Both consumer groups and the insurance industry have publicly supported the government's preferred definition, in many cases expressing pleasure that at last a government has acted after 40 or 50 years—far too long.


The details of the key facts sheet for home building and home contents insurance policies will be contained in regulations, which is consistent with other similar one-page disclosure documents, such as the home loan key facts sheet.


In conclusion, this bill delivers on the government's commitment to provide consumers with a better understanding of what is included in insurance policies.

Mr SHORTEN
 (Maribyrnong—Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation and Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations) (17:49):  by leave—I present a supplementary memorandum to the bill. I move government amendments (1) to (6) as circulated:


(1)   Schedule 1, page 3 (after line 3), before item 1, insert:




1A  Paragraph 11(10)(a)



   After ""37"", insert "", 37C"".




1B  Paragraph 11(10)(c)



   After ""37"", insert "", 37C"".


(2) Schedule 1, item 1, page 4 (line 27), omit ""The prescribed contract is taken"", substitute ""The flood provisions of the prescribed contract are taken"".


(3) Schedule 1, item 1, page 5 (lines 3 and 4), omit ""the prescribed contract is taken"", substitute ""those provisions are taken"".


(4) Schedule 1, item 1, page 5 (lines 7 and 8), omit ""the contract"", substitute ""those provisions"".


(5) Schedule 1, item 1, page 5 (after line 15), after subsection 37D(5), insert:


   (5A) To avoid doubt, this section does not affect the operation of any provisions of a prescribed contract that are not flood provisions.


(6) Schedule 1, page 5 (after line 30), at the end of the Schedule, add:




2  Subsection 38(3)



   After ""37"", insert "", 37C"".


Today I am moving amendments to the bill to ensure that the standard definition of 'flood' can operate as intended. The amendments respond to concerns raised by insurers in consultation with the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics, as outlined in the committee's Advisory report on the Insurance Contracts Amendment Bill2011 released on 17 February 2012. I note that the House Standing Committee on Economics recommended that the House of Representatives pass the bill.


Amendment (1) addresses concerns raised by insurers that they be required to provide information to insured people on their flood cover to satisfy the 'clearly inform' requirement every time a renewal, extension, variation or reinstatement of an insurance policy is made. These amendments will ensure that insurers will have only to provide information to the insured on their flood cover initially or before entering into an insurance policy, or at the first renewal after the amending legislation commences or any variation that changes the extent of flood cover. In addition, amendment (6) will ensure that insurers will not be required to provide information to the insurer to satisfy the 'clearly inform' requirement about whether an interim contract provides flood cover. This is consistent with the treatment that applies to interim contracts in respect of providing information on exclusions and limitations under the Insurance Contracts Act 1984.


Amendments (2) to (5) respond to concerns raised by insurers that the bill may prohibit any limitation on the operation of the standard definition of flood such as exclusions for specific items or high-risk properties such as seawalls, jetties and pontoons, or exclusion for flood damage within the first 72 hours of a policy being issued. The amendments will ensure that insurance policies that provide flood cover do not affect the terms and conditions that would otherwise be applicable to flood cover.


Question agreed to.


Bill, as amended, agreed to.

"Buchholz, Scott, MP",LP,2012-03-14,"



Mr BUCHHOLZ
 (Wright) (12:15):  The Insurance Contracts Amendment Bill 2011 seeks to change the insurance laws by introducing a standard definition of flood insurance contracts and a key facts sheet that is required to be provided for home building and home contents insurance policies. The coalition will support this bill; however, we have a number of concerns about the final implementation of the measures it introduces. 


Following the major floods in 2010 and 2011 in parts of Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria and Western Australia the issue of inadequate flood insurance cover and confusion about what was covered in insurance policies has become predominant. There were seriously damaged households with no or inadequate insurance coverage. Wide variations in the definition of 'flood' between insurance policies and the lack of understanding of what was covered by policies contributed to these gaps in insurance coverage. 


My electorate of Wright was enormously devastated by the floods 12 months ago. A policy holder came home after having been evacuated from their town to be standing in their dining room with evidence of up to four feet of water having been through their living room. At least their house was still there. In some cases people's houses were still inundated with water. There was a degree of comfort that came over those people, who had been paying insurance premiums for 20 and 30 years with good intent, as they believed their houses were insured. Can you imagine their despair, after losing their worldly possessions and in many cases losing loved ones, when hydrology reports on the area indicated that their policy did not cover them as the determination was that it was riverine flooding? This bill seeks to address and recalibrate the definition of flooding to a standard definition through all insurance policies. 


To give the nation an idea of the degree of flooding and the devastation that was incurred by the people of Wright particularly, I draw on the example of the Steinhart family. Sue relived the story of devastation that she underwent. They have a low-set house; it is about two or three feet off the ground, like a typical housing commission home. It goes down the back steps onto a concrete pad, which is their laundry. She was out the back in the laundry and she felt two or three inches of water under her feet, up to her ankles, and because it was not raining she thought that the washing machine had overflowed. She opened the back door to try and let the water out, and the wheelie bins at the back of the door were starting to float away. She grabbed a couple of pumpkins to put on top of the wheelie bins to stop them from floating around. There were three pumpkins and by the time she had picked the last one up, the wheelie bins were gone. By this stage the water was up to her knees. She went up the two steps in fright to find the kids, while trying to assess how quick this water was coming. 


The kids were playing in the bedroom. She got the kids out the window up onto the carport skillion on the side of the house. By this stage the water was up to her hips. Her husband was in the other bedroom trying to smash the window open, panicking. He got the window out and got the last kid up onto the skillion. By the time the family had evacuated onto the skillion the water was lapping onto the skillion roof and they scrambled to get onto the main roof—the apex of the house. They got onto the apex. I said to her, 'How long did all that take to evolve?' She said, 'As long as it took me to tell you this story.' That is how quickly the water came. My heart goes out to those families in Queensland that were downstream from us. They are experiencing flooding in Victoria at the moment. I understand the mass devastation that happens as a result of flooding. In Wright we had very little notice. Subsequently, we suffered an enormous loss of life.


In speaking in support of this bill, if there is a bipartisan message—leave all the politics out of it—that we can share with Australians, and in particular Australians that may not be affected by floods this time, it is this: pick up the phone, spend 40c, invest that time with your insurance company and get some peace of mind. This bill will cover definitions of flooding for new policies. I really want to encourage Australians who have insurance to satisfy this in their minds. Do not leave it until the disaster season; pick up the phone, ring the insurance companies and get some idea as to whether or not they are insured and what the definition of flood means to them.


The Natural Disaster Insurance Review was commissioned on 4 March 2011 in response to this problem. Consultation commenced on 5 April 2011 and review recommendations were received by the government on 30 September 2011 but not released until November. The report contained 47 recommendations providing independent reviews of issues relating to the insurance in light of the natural disasters. Despite having six weeks to consider the recommendations, the government deferred decisions on 39 of the 47 recommendations. In fact, the biggest decision it made was that it was committed to further reviews. It seems to be a common motif of government—why govern when you can have a review, an inquiry, a reference group or some official sounding form of procrastination? It is all or nothing with this government. It is either endless procrastination or knee-jerk reactions. It is either weak-kneed indecision or frantic overreaction. Mining tax—snap decision. Live exports—snap decision. Asylum seekers—months of inaction followed by one knee-jerk reaction after another. Climate change—'Yes we are, no we're not. Wait for a while. No, definitely not under a government I lead,' and finally 'Yes we are,' again.


Returning to the legislation, this bill makes two changes to insurance contracts law following from the review. It provides for a standard definition of flood insurance contracts and requires that customers are provided with a key facts sheet outlining information about their home and building contents insurance policies. However, this is enabling legislation only. Both the standard definition of 'flood' and the specific contents of the key facts sheet will be made in regulations by changes to the Insurance Contracts Regulations 1985.


The industry supports these changes although they have some concerns about the final version of the regulations. As is often the case with the coalition, we see bills come through the House where the intent of the bill may be there but the devil is in the detail. With this particular bill we share the industry's concerns that we do not have the regulations tabled as yet. However, in general, the changes are seen to be acceptable given the level of confusion and uncertainty that surrounded the issue of insurance coverage in the wake of the 2010-11 floods and the industry supports the purpose of the bill. The coalition will be watching the final regulations closely to ensure that they provide adequate certainty to all parties to insurance contracts. 'Certainty' is the key word here. What annoys the living daylights out of people is not knowing where they stand, particularly if they have just gone through the worst experience possible, which I outlined in my opening comments. The standard definition of flood will mean that every time the word 'flood' appears in an insurance contract it will be taken to mean the definition as outlined in the current regulation across all insurance companies. The legislation also restricts contracts including compound phrases with the word 'flood', such as 'flash flood' or 'incidental flooding'. The legislation does not require that all insurance policies insure against flood.


The coalition has consistently supported efforts to develop a standard definition for 'flood' across the entire country and across every insurance company. After the floods in New South Wales in mid-2007 and in Queensland in 2008, the common definition for flood was put forward as an important change by the industry at that time. The federal Labor government did nothing to progress a common definition for flood after the ACCC scuttled previous attempts to ensure such a definition in 2008. It took the disastrous floods of 2011 for Labor to finally consider this matter again. The coalition supports recommendation 36 of the Natural Disaster Insurance Review that the government introduce a standard definition of flood so as to avoid any consumer confusion surrounding flood coverage within insurance policies.


I also take this opportunity to note the contribution of the Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs in its inquiry and the members for Blair, Moreton and Murray, who played a vital role in travelling through the country and receiving evidence in that inquiry. I note their contribution to assisting communities with reference to understanding insurance ramifications. The final report recommends the definition of flood be as proposed within the Reforming flood insurance: clearing the waters consultation paper:


'Flood' means the covering of normally dry land by water that has escaped or been released from the normal confines of:


(a) any lake, or any river, creek or other natural watercourse, whether or not altered or modified; or


(b) any reservoir, canal or dam.


That is basically an extension of riverine flooding, where it comes up out of a creek bed and which would normally make your flood insurance nonvalid. The example I gave you was about the Steinhardt's, whose house backed onto a creek. Even though a 23-foot wall of water came across the flat, the insurance company took the position that, because the water came down through the creek bed first and came up out of the creek milliseconds before a 23-foot wall of water followed it, it was deemed to be riverine flooding.


It should be noted that, with the present disaster season well underway, the benefits of any standard definition will be deferred until the legislation passes. The bill requires that a key facts sheet be provided, outlining important information in relation to home building and home contracts insurance policies. The key facts sheet is meant to provide consumers with key information to allow them to more easily understand and compare insurance policies. We all know how flippant we can be with insurance policies. They have two to three pages of fine print and 'would you sign on the bottom line and forward, John'. The intent of the key facts sheet is to outline some of the basic principles that your policy should cover. The draft requirements of the key facts sheet has not yet been released. In his second reading speech Minister Shorten stated that the government would release the details in 2012 and that they would be consumer tested before being introduced. Industry does not object to the key facts sheet but there are some concerns about its final form.


While the industry broadly supports the changes in this legislation, some concerns still remain. Specifically, my colleagues and I on the House Standing Committee on Economics take issue with elements of the final report on the bill. Specifically we are unable to agree with paragraphs 2.50 and 2.51 of the report, which outline assurances that the Department of the Treasury was engaged in consultative dialogue with the industry and consumer groups as well as the observation that there were 'no points raised in submissions or at the hearing that the Treasury was not already across or was not taking steps to consider solutions'. The clear evidence from the industry representatives at the hearing was industry's frustration that many issues, as identified in this report, that have been raised with the government over the operation of the Insurance Contracts Amendments Bill remain unresolved, with industry awaiting comprehensive consultation on regulations before obtaining any clarity on the identified issues. We note that, disappointingly, the bill has missed much of the detail craved by industry to bring certainty. 


In closing, I would like to offer my sincere and heartfelt concern to those people in parts of Australia whose homes are currently inundated. I pray that there should be no loss of life, because the form of the flooding is not similar to ours, but flash flooding. Our hearts go out to everyone concerned and may God bless them in their recovery.

"Jones, Stephen, MP",ALP,2012-03-14,"



Mr STEPHEN JONES
 (Throsby) (12:30):  A year ago today a terrible tsunami hit the north-east coast of the island of Honshu, Japan. We have spent a good amount of time appropriately this morning debating a motion in tribute to the people of Japan. We expressed our sympathy as a parliament for the suffering that they have undergone and congratulated them on their recovery efforts. In preparation for that debate, I took time to go through some of the reportage of the event, particularly from Japanese newspapers. I came across numerous stories about reports of discoveries of ancient stone markers on hillsides around some of the devastated villages. Those stone markers were like a warning from ancient generations to current generations not to build below that point. 


The reason that those markers were placed somewhere halfway up the hillsides, warning future generations never to build below this point, is that in the past people had experienced tsunami damage—the wiping out of villages—and they knew that it was unsafe to build in those zones. They were sending out a clarion call to future generations: beware. Indeed, before the Second World War, residents had been prohibited from building construction in those areas close to the coast that were subject to tsunami disaster, but during the postwar period there was enormous demand, particularly for affordable housing, in those areas and residential construction did proceed. 


I find that story a useful segue into the debate that we are having here today about the amendments to the Insurance Contracts Act because, as the member for Wright has rightly indicated in his contribution to the debate, the renewed impetus for amendments to this legislation is the terrible floods that went through Queensland, including in his electorate, and northern New South Wales in late December 2010 and early 2011. It reminds us all that Australia is a flood-prone nation. Anyone watching the TV news in the past week will have seen the terrifying images of streets and buildings half submerged in enormous expanses of brown muddy water. It is unfortunate that these images and the flooding taking place in the states of New South Wales and Victoria, even as we speak today, are not an uncommon lived Australian experience. 


Many of our first settlements in this country took place on the banks of our great rivers. Indeed, many country towns owe their existence to being in places where river crossings could be made. The Insurance Contracts Amendment Bill 2011, which is before the House today, was prompted by those terrible events in December 2010 and 2011. Those events remind us, in many respects, that there are many things that we need to do to ensure that we do not see the terrible suffering, the loss of life and the loss of property that we saw as a result of those flood events. Major flood events like that, which followed higher than average rainfall, had a devastating impact on those who lost loved ones and also saw their life's worth of treasured possessions disappear under a torrent of water. What is left behind is a huge task to rebuild lives, property, infrastructure and communities. Some estimates of the total cost of the 2010-11 floods are around the $10 billion mark. According to the Insurance Council of Australia, these floods resulted in nearly 50,000 insurance claims, with insurance payouts expected to be around $2.3 billion. Cyclone Yasi resulted in more than 60,000 claims, adding over $850 million to insurance claims. If you add in the cost of the floods taking place this month, the bill to Commonwealth, state and local governments will be even higher again.


The Insurance Council of Australia says that seven per cent of residential property in Australia is exposed to predictable and repetitive flooding, causing an estimated $400 million to $450 million in damages each and every year. The cost, which cannot always be measured in purely economic terms, is significant. It is also a cost that comes from the spreading of urban development.


This is where I return to the point I made earlier. In part, the bill before the parliament today is a part of the cure but it is not a part of the prevention. State and territory governments have legislation providing for affordable, intelligible third-party car insurance. These are very important, but they are no alternative to programs that are aimed at reducing bad driving. The legislation before the House today is important but it is no alternative to planning and land use policies that ensure we do not build suburbs and houses in places known to be prone to regular flooding. The challenge for state and local government planning authorities is to ensure that when they are approving new urban development, or revising existing ones, they do not put people in harm's way.


We know that the more our urban centres spread out into our flood plains, the more the risk of flood events for the households within those regions. In my own region, in parts of the Illawarra and the Southern Highlands of NSW, urban development in flood-prone areas is a live and controversial issue. In Throsby, suburbs such as Albion Park and Dapto include low-lying areas that frequently see serious flooding. Despite this, urban development marches on. To give one example, a new development approved at Calderwood, near Albion Park, will see the construction of over 4,500 new homes on what was formerly high-value agricultural land. This land, and the land around it, has been subject to regular flooding and is still subject to regular flooding. Not surprisingly, many locals and the local council have expressed concerns about this development and the cost of ensuring that it is done in a way that mitigates or reduces the threat of floods to the residents who purchase housing and land packages in that area.


The surrounding suburb of Albion Park is largely a dormitory suburb that is poorly served by public transport, so the majority of travel in this area is by private motor vehicle. Access roads in and out of these locals areas, like the Illawarra Highway and West Dapto Road, are regularly flooded and cut off. Only last March extensive flooding meant that many students of Albion Park school were forced to spend the night at their local school when parents could not get through the flooded roads to pick them up. For many who know this region well there is concern about the long-term implications to our region of the changed land use that is entailed in new housing developments.


I simply make the point that the legislation before this House, which deals with the definition of flood and the provisions of flood insurance, will not compensate for the need for credible and thorough land-use planning, particularly for suburbs like those I have just described. This is not to take anything away from the heartfelt words of members, such as the member for Wright, who have expressed the deep concerns in their communities and have reflected upon the anguish that was visited upon them by the 2010-11 floods. I am sure that each and every member in this place shares the concern and sympathy and would like to do everything possible to ensure that those communities get back on their feet. I argue that a part of ensuring that we do everything possible is ensuring that we have a coordinated approach to flood mapping and land use strategies that are about the prevention and not cure.


I turn now to the measures within this bill. I am pleased that the measures within this bill provide some important consumer protections for families and small businesses wanting to ensure that they have the right insurance protection for their homes and businesses. One part of the response that we are dealing with today is how we can ensure that consumers can financially manage the risks to their property from flood damage. The government's proposals are to, firstly, ensure that we have a standard definition of what a flood is for the purpose of insurance policies. As a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics I have participated in a recent inquiry into this bill. As part of that inquiry the committee held a roundtable public hearing in early February to consider the proposed measures. The government's proposals for a standard definition and for a fact sheet for consumers were strongly supported by all participants at the hearing. 


These standard definition of 'flood', which will be introduced as a result of this bill, describes riverine flooding and reserves the term 'flood' for flooding in this context only. The reason this definition is necessary is that there are a number of sources of inundation of water into properties. The Insurance Council of Australia has identified three broad categories. The first is stormwater or rainfall run-off, commonly referred to as flash flooding, in localised urban areas from high-intensity rainfall. This form of flooding is regularly covered by the current definitions of flooding within insurance contracts. The second is riverine flooding, which is flooding from watercourses or catchments overflowing their banks. Again, this is often covered but not always covered in standard form contracts. The third is flooding as a result of storm surge or the sea level rising. This is rarely if ever covered in any of the standard form insurance contracts. The regulations include the proposed wording of 'flood' to be used in these insurance contracts as follows:


Flood means the covering of normally dry land by water that has escaped or been released from the normal confines of:


A. any lake, or any river, creek or other natural watercourse, whether or not altered or modified; or


B. any reservoir, canal, or dam.


The primary benefit of having a standard definition is so that consumers can better understand their insurance coverage. This will also decrease the number of disputes over insurance claims, which were significant in the wake of the floods in Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria over the last 12 to 18 months. This will be an important administrative cost saving for insurance companies, who will no longer have to allocate resources to contesting uncertain definitions for flood damage and the definitions of flood damage within those insurance contracts. This new definition will apply to home building and home contents, small business and strata title insurance policies. This is a simple and practical measure that will enable consumers to make better informed decisions regarding the extent to which policies provide cover for flood, and what flood cover actually means.


The second important measure contained within the bill involves introducing a one-page fact sheet which will outline key information in relation to home building and home contents policies in an easy to read and consumer friendly layout. This measure will make the purchase of home building and home contents policies simpler for consumers, assisting them to compare policies with a consistent document and facilitate more effective and informed decision making. The detail of these measures, including the actual wording of a standard definition of 'flood' and the content of the key facts sheet, will be contained in the insurance contract regulations and will be released for public consultation. The response from the insurers and particularly from the Insurance Council of Australia has been positive. Given these measures being brought forward in the bill, it will now be important to monitor how the implementation of these will affect consumers taking out insurance in flood prone areas. It is important that people living in flood prone areas are aware of the risk of flooding and have appropriate insurance to cover this risk. The insurance industry already maps and models flood risk when determining insurance premiums, often relying on data from local and state government authorities. I support the call by the Insurance Council of Australia to ensure that we have a standard mechanism for mapping flood and flood risk. I also support the call to ensure that this information is available to all within the community to assist better land use planning and better assessment of risks for both insurers and those seeking to cover themselves against the risk of flood.


Nothing within this bill is going to do anything that will alter the climate and climatic risks but it will ensure that when the insurers are taking out a contract they can be sure of what coverage they are actually paying for. I commend the bill to the House.

Mr ENTSCH
 (Leichhardt—Chief Opposition Whip) (12:45):  I rise today to also speak on this bill, the Insurance Contracts Amendment Bill 2011, and to indicate my support for the measures contained within this bill. The bill changes the insurance law to introduce a standard definition of flood contracts. This is something that is long overdue in this area and over many years we have seen despair, I guess, from people who have been subjected to a flood situation only to find that, even though they thought they were covered, they had no insurance cover whatsoever. It was primarily because of the very narrow definition that was used by the insurance companies.




Mr Adams:
  And your government did nothing about it.




Mr ENTSCH:
  I was going to get onto that one. Back in 2007 after the New South Wales floods and again in 2008 in Queensland, a common definition for floods was put forward by the coalition as an important change by the industry at that time. What happened then is that the ACCC scuttled those previous attempts to introduce such a definition back in 2008 and my colleague and his government on the other side have done nothing at all to progress a common definition up until now. So it is great to see that we are actually moving forward in this area.


The other area we are looking at is there being a requirement that the insurance companies provide consumers with a key facts sheet outlining key information about their home building and their home contents insurance policies so that they can minimise the risk of misinterpretation, if you like, and people can feel comfortable with what they are paying for and that they are actually going to get in a time of crisis what they think they are paying for.


The Social Policy and Legal Affairs Committee did the inquiry on this. About the end of the time they were doing this report it started to become evident that there were other areas where there were some serious issues of insurance failure within the insurance industry. One of those areas was in strata title. Talking to the chair, Graham Perrett, I explained some of the issues we were facing in northern Australia, that while we were starting to get a bit of a handle on some of these issues with flood, up in my area we did not have flood problems, we had cyclone problems. Nevertheless, the devastation is just as profound and if you find you have no cover then the impact on the householder is just as serious. The problem that we were starting to experience up there was that insurance companies were actually withdrawing from Northern Australia. They were doing so in a most alarming manner in that they were increasing premiums to levels that were well beyond affordability. Of course, people could not afford to renew their policies. More and more insurance companies were refusing to insure. Initially, they denied that they were doing that in the area, but I have a letter here from Lumley Insurance, dated 14 February 2012. The letter is to Ms Schmitzer, who lives in North Cairns. The letter basically said:


With effect from 19th October 2011 Lumley Insurance ceased writing Household and Landlords Insurance in post codes 4737 and above.


That, in effect, is from Sarina north. Unfortunately, this is not an isolated incident. More and more insurance companies have been withdrawing their services in Northern Australia, based not on risk but purely on postcodes. It has become a serious problem up there, whether you are trying to get flood insurance, cyclone insurance or any sort of household insurance. 


We were faced with another challenge up there with how insurance companies were charging in the area. For example, the insurance premiums for a block of units valued at $10 million in the Cairns region, over a four-year period up until 2011, went from $11,000 to $12,000 to $23,500 to $92,500. You can imagine the impact that that has on families when they are trying to insure. It is also causing major issues in that units are becoming unsellable. We have many examples here where individuals can no longer live in their units. They cannot sell them because of the inflated insurance prices and the rates are greater than any return that you could get in a 12-month period.


As I said, I spoke to the minister and to Graham Perrett, Chair of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs. They graciously agreed to extend the hearing of the flood inquiry and to include body corporate insurance. They have had meetings up in Port Douglas, Cairns, Townsville and here in Canberra. The committee has done outstanding work. The report will be tabled later this month. I am confident that we will see in that report some recommendations that will extend over and above what we are seeing here in this bill, which will look at affordability of insurance in Northern Australia and also the availability of it. 


At Brooklyn Village, a dozen retired couples or individuals are living in what used to be an old mining village. For some reason known only to the council, they decided in their wisdom that, rather than subdivide the individual houses that were there into normal title, they would zone it as strata title. We have a strata title on individual houses, on lots from 1,000 square metres up to 13 acres. But they are all strata title. 


Under the current legislation, as it stands, those people have to insure the entire property for replacement value, including the old community hall that is sitting there and has never been used, the disused swimming pool, the tennis courts and a whole lot of things that are part of the village.  We also have 12 families living there that cannot get insurance. Of course, it is a major concern for them. Again, this issue was raised at the inquiry. I am hoping that we can find a way whereby we can get the insurance companies back into these regions. 


Other areas have been faced with similar crises in recent times—New Zealand and Japan, with the tsunamis, and, more recently and relevantly, in Thailand, with the floods. They are still recovering from that. The Thai government has now taken an initiative to provide underwriting of insurance companies. They have set up a scheme to allow residential and small to medium businesses to get insurance cover for flood. Up to that point you could not get any sort of insurance in Thailand, which was having a major impact. I understand that after the dreadful tsunami—we commemorated the anniversary only a couple of days ago—the Japanese government is looking at doing a similar thing. New Zealand has already implemented an underwriting policy in relation to earthquakes, providing an opportunity for landholders or property owners to buy affordable insurance to give them the security they need.


I know that in the Northern Territory—it is the only one in Australia—the TIO provides an underwriting facility to ensure insurance prices are affordable. There is no point having insurance if individuals or families cannot afford the policy. The other problem is that, even if premiums reduce to a level where they are remotely affordable, companies are putting so many extra requirements on them in relation to excesses that there is no way claims will succeed. So in effect policies are of no value at all.


Have a look at the progression or the failure of the industry, particularly in Northern Australia. I understand similar problems are being faced in the Murray area, and I suspect that with the flooding now going through New South Wales and Victoria we will see similar challenges as they recover from the disaster: affordability and insurance contracting or retracting out of regions continues. When the committee came to Port Douglas, one witness was Mandy Coxon, who has the Mossman Gorge Bed and Breakfast. She wrote a letter saying:


I have never written such a letter before nor have I ever felt I had a need to. However, with Cyclone Yasi we are not entitled to any sort of government rescue package but we run a small B&B. It is very modest. We were making an income of about $50,000 but because of all the economic problems in the area that income has reduced to $20,000 a year, but our insurance premium has gone up from $3,000 to $5,506.


She said that that works out at about 25 per cent of the annual turnover of their small business. It comes to a point where it is not affordable. I spoke to Mandy only a couple of weeks ago and she said that the insurance company which had offered her insurance at the increased price has now said that they are withdrawing their offer. She can no longer get insurance for her small B&B and it looks as though she is going to have to close her business down. 


We are seeing the same sort of thing in rural residential, where you are finding people on acreage. If they are not running it as an agribusiness and it is over five acres, most insurance companies are now refusing point blank to insure properties. So there are a lot of properties around the area now which are uninsured. One thing we can be sure of is that over time there will be more cyclones and more floods. The Insurance Contracts Amendment Bill is a very small step in the right direction of recognising that there need to be significant changes in interpretation and there has to be a way to ensure competition remains in the market so that we do not get more of these letters from insurance companies advising that, based purely on the postcode, that they will no longer consider the insurance risk.


While I commend these initiatives to the parliament, I say that it is only a very small step in the right direction. I know more recommendations will come out later this month and I suspect that given the failure of insurance in rural residential and other markets like B&B there will be further requirements in relation to reform, so that affordable and effective insurance can give people peace of mind and security, which they need to protect their assets, so that people do not become homeless with no chance of ever replacing their life savings. I commend the bill to the House.

"Adams, Dick, MP",ALP,2012-03-14,"



Mr ADAMS
 (Lyons) (16:31):  In 2010-11, there were a significant number of natural disasters in Australia: Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania all experienced severe flooding. For two years in a row now we have had extremely wet conditions and a lot more flooding in Queensland, Victoria and New South Wales. The number of people adversely affected by these natural disasters as a result of inadequate insurance cover has highlighted the level of consumer confusion about what is covered in insurance policies, in particular the extent to which policies provide cover for flood and what cover for flood means.


On 5 April 2011, the government released a consultation paper entitled 'Reforming Flood Insurance: Clearing the Waters' in order to engage the community in suggesting improvements to the regulatory framework and other aspects of Australia's insurance market. The paper contained two key proposals designed to improve clarity for consumers in relation to insurance policies and, in particular, the cover provided for various types of flood—namely, a standard definition of flood as well as a key facts sheet, the KFS, to outline the key information in relation to home building and home contents policies.


The Insurance Contracts Amendment Bill 2011 implements those proposals. The main points in this bill cover the standard definition of flood, which, hopefully, will reduce consumers' confusion regarding what is and what is not included in insurance policies and will avoid situations where neighbouring properties affected by the same inundation event receive different claim assessments because the policies covering them, where they exist, use different definitions of flood.


Compliance costs will be incurred by the industry for reassessing and rewriting policies. Industry has also indicated that a standard definition could result in repricing policies or in products being withdrawn, as those policies might provide greater coverage for flood, but at least this will be known to the consumer and they can take action to mitigate the risk. Either way, it will help both the insurance provider and the consumer to be more informed. Of course, this brings in the situation of where we build, planning laws and issues in relation to insurance. The key facts sheet, by outlining key information in a concise form, will provide increased simplicity, consistency and comparability for consumers where they are making decisions regarding the purchase of the HBHC insurance policies. The key facts sheet will also facilitate more effective decision-making through an increased level of familiarity: knowing what to look for and the meaning of certain words and concepts. While the actual wording for 'flood' included in regulations will be subject to consultation, it is expected to be consistent with the wording proposed by the government's consultation paper Reforming flood insurance:Clearing the waters. The proposed wording is that 'flood' means the covering of normally dry land by water that has escaped or been released from normal confines of any lake or any river, creek or other natural watercourse, whether or not altered or modified, or any reservoir, canal or dam. There is still work being done on these words, but I believe this will be the background definition that will be part of the regulations currently being revised.


Insurance providers are required to use a standard definition of the term 'flood' when using the word 'flood' or other parts of speech or grammatical forms of that word, such as flooding, in the prescribed contract, or the notice or other document or information, as provided in those regulations. If the definition or meaning of the word 'flood' or other parts of speech or grammatical form of that word, such as flooding, is different from the definition of the meaning of the word 'flood' provided in the regulations, the prescribed contract will be taken to have the meaning of 'flood' as provided in the regulations.


During the times of the floods in Tasmania in my electorate of Lyons—mainly in early 2011—we had great confusion among the insurance companies, who could not decide what was a flood and what was not. It made it very hard for people to claim anything and even harder for them to mitigate risk into the future. People just did not know what the circumstances were. 


Tasmania did it hard during the debate about public liability insurance as well, as there was a great deal of misinformation floating around at the time. The insurance industry failed on both of those occasions to be on the front foot, looking at what the consumer needs were and meeting their needs. It took a while before something could be done to allow small groups to stage events and be able to afford public liability, but it was a tangled web to get through and it took many community organisations in my electorate a long time to work their way through this—and some were lost in the process. 


It is the same with floods and other natural disasters. If people can assess their risk and are able to realise what could happen given a series of circumstances then they can do something, but when they run blind on how insurance companies operate or what meaning certain words have then everybody loses, most of all small clients who can least afford it. 


The report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs entitled In the wake of disasters was timely and covered a lot of the heartbreak that occurred during the 2011 floods, and hopefully will help those people still struggling in the floods this year. Those recent problems and floods have taken a large toll on people and entire communities—there is enormous trauma that comes from significant or total destruction of one's home, its contents, the businesses that people run and the loss of stock or the loss of pets through flooding. On top of this, affected residents have to deal with the disruptions to work, school, social networks, accommodation, health and transport. Trying to sort out insurance on top of all of this and trying to work through the processes you are required to when collecting insurance when there is a lack of information is soul destroying for individuals. I saw that during the floods in January 2011 in Tasmania. We need to go on funding services to assist communities with the practical aspects of rebuilding lives and we need to fund financial and emotional counselling. We must also ensure that insurance cover is seen as a part of the process. It should be possible to start sorting out one's life if there are guidelines that are easy to follow and an understanding of what insurance can cover and what the community can do to help those exposed to uninsurable events. This is not something new, but extreme events are becoming more common in this current climate cycle and people need to be aware of those problems.


I remember some of the problems that occurred in my electorate in the township of Railton in the municipality of Kentish. The river behind one particular house rose. Flood waters came up. That was seen as a flood. The water coming out of the storm water drain on the road side was not seen as a flood. And these waters rushed into the gardens and the houses along that street. Then there was an argument about who was insured and who was not. Different households were with different insurance companies. Sometimes the same insurance assessor was used by different insurance companies. The assessor made the arguments. But the companies made different decisions about what insurance was going to be paid. This confused people and made them very angry. It was very bad for the industry. They need to be on top of that.


Coming back to the issues, sometimes it does not matter how good a plan you use. You can still run into problems. But with the high-tech spatial stuff that we have today you can certainly plan a lot better. This will help municipal planners to decide where we can build as they will see where river courses are and where the water runs. If we could document all the history that we already have sitting around, that would give us a great deal of help in being able to put in place a proper process for urban planning in the future. Some places where we should not build will show up. If somebody wants to build there and take the risk, then you could offer them the opportunity to do that. But they would not get insured. As long as everybody understood that and got it, that would be okay. It is not good calling foul if you have built somewhere dangerous. And that goes with fires as well. We need to be a lot smarter about where we let people build and about how we look after fire-prone areas.


Where people build is defined by planning laws. I remember that in my home town of Longford there was a back creek, which ran into the South Esk. The planning for this town was defined by the 1929 flood. The 1929 flood was a very large flood in northern Tasmania. A king tide in the Tamar River came right up to Launceston, flooding all of Invermay, with a lot of that area inundated and put totally under water. The South Esk backed up right into the hinterlands and the township of Longford was totally inundated, with the back creek also catching a lot of rainfall from the mountains. Those flood levels defined where you could build in that town. It was not until recent years that mitigation through building a flood levy changed that. Now a new regime is operating. That town has a very fine school, fine clubs and two chemists and it should have the opportunity to grow and meet people's building needs. The importance of the insurance industry, which I mentioned earlier, goes back to those days of liability.


Also, on this occasion I take on board that in crises like those we have seen in New Zealand and in Japan the insurance industry—which is a very important industry for any community—would need help to look after those things, but in the normal circumstances that we have been experiencing in this country those industries should be much more advanced in where they are going to be into the future. When we start thinking about climate change and some of the issues that can come out of that, I believe that the industry needs to be on the front foot, not on the back foot, where it has been for some time. I also believe that improved spatial technology should allow us to do a lot more in being able to get our municipal planning into some level where people are not building on flood plains and where we can overcome many of these problems into the future. I do not say that we can overcome them all, but we should be able to overcome many.


So I believe this bill is the start of the process. There is much more we can do to allow and get insurance companies to do their work better and to be proactive but to ensure that there are fair parameters under which to work, much as we did with the public liability. I believe that this bill will do that and that it gets us there. It is certainly a bill that gives us a good start in sorting out some of the basic problems, which included the definitions around flooding. I support the bill.

Mr EWEN JONES
 (Herbert) (16:46):  I would just like to say to the previous speaker that, when the creek flooded and it was going into the South Esk, I just hope that the water quality going through to the Boag's brewery, with waters from the North Esk River, was still in pristine condition. It is very important. The North and South Esk Rivers are a national treasure, and Boag's premium is of course one of the great beers of the world.


I rise to speak on the Insurance Contracts Amendment Bill 2011. This bill changes the laws governing insurance in the wake of the 2010 and 2011 floods throughout parts of Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria. The coalition does broadly support this bill. We recognise the insurance problems that the natural disasters around the country exposed and created and we will give our support to these measures and help address them. We are, however, concerned with the implementation of the changes being made in the bill.


Specifically, this bill will introduce the standard definition of flooding for insurance contracts. This will address the problem that arose following the season of natural disasters where residents, many having lost everything as a result of flooding, discovered that their insurance did not cover them because different policies defined flooding in different ways. We saw the birth of a new word with 'inundation' when it came through. I had never lived through an inundation. When I was a kid in my home town of Texas, we only ever had floods. This created confusion and lack of understanding for policy holders, but creating a standard definition means there will only be one interpretation for flooding wherever it appears in the insurance contract. This is a measure that the insurance industry and the coalition have repeatedly supported over the last five years following other flooding disasters, and it has taken until now for this government to push this through.


This bill introduces a requirement for insurance policies to come with a key facts sheet. This key facts sheet is supposed to help consumers better understand prospective policies and be able to more easily compare and asses their options. While industry broadly supports this idea and in fact many insurers already provide something similar, we are still weighing the draft requirements of these. In the retail side of the motor vehicle industry, there used to be a thing when a friend of mine had a Ford dealership in Townsville. He said his first dealer arrangement was with Esanda and it said, 'We the undersigned agree that Esanda takes a lien over everything in this lot with the following exceptions,' and it was a two-foolscap-page document which covered the arrangement between him and his finance company. The last one I delivered to him when I was working for Capital Finance was about 400 pages long. That is where we have gone with this. It is not the government's fault, but it is the nature of litigation in this country that we are pushing these things. It is important to note that this bill only provides legislation that will enable these proposed changes to take place. While the coalition agree in principle with these changes, we will be waiting to see the changes in their legislative form to get a better idea of how these measures will be rolled out.


While we in North Queensland may not have experienced the flooding that has taken place in South-East Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria, we did suffer through Cyclone Yasi, one of the worst cyclones to hit the region in close to a century, and surely the biggest storm that this country has ever seen. Since that disaster, Townsville residents have been plagued with insurance problems, from companies pulling out of their North Queensland market to skyrocketing premiums. Townsville residents have been left wondering how they can pay for insurance cost increases on top of the rising cost of living that this government has presided over.


For Townsville, one of the biggest problems has been an increase in strata title insurance. I have had numerous people living in apartment complexes coming to me and complaining about the astronomical increases in body corporate insurance that they have been forced to swallow. Do not forget that the thing about strata title insurance is that with house insurance you can take a punt that you are not going to get a fire and no-one is going to chase you up, but not having strata title insurance is against the law and you are criminally liable under the strata title act; you must have this strata title insurance. Many of these concerns were heard at the strata title insurance inquiry that recently visited Townsville for a public hearing, and I would like to pass on my thanks to the member for Moreton for his proactive actions in bringing that inquiry to Townsville and Cairns. I would also like to thank both him and the member for Blair for the way they conducted that inquiry, especially the bits I saw in Townsville. It was clear to me that they were actively looking for answers, and I hope that their final report will reflect the sincerity and concern expressed to them by the attendees.


The attendees at the meeting in Townsville were predominantly self-funded retirees and pensioners. They are the ones who are most affected by these problems, and they are the ones who can least afford them and have been forced to cop these huge premium increases. We have asked them to come to a unit building as a cheaper way for them to see out the autumn of their years. They have to survive on a set income. They cannot cope with premium rises of nearly 700 per cent. They also risk the reduction of their capital base. If the unit dwelling becomes unaffordable and there is a market issue with too many properties on the market, the unit price will drop, making their lives more unsustainable.


Tom and Tina Pietzsch attended the hearing. They are self-funded retirees living in one of three apartments in a unit complex. The only shared facilities in the complex are a pool area and a lift. In 20 years the complex has made two claims—a small one after Cyclone Larry in 2006 and a slightly bigger one after Yasi last year. They have seen their premiums triple to $15,000 in one hit from before Yasi. When this was added to the maintenance and other costs that the body corporate fee needs to pay for, living in a unit suddenly became unattainable for Townsville residents.


I spoke to the widow of a friend of mine. She is living in a modest unit in North Ward, which is a central suburb in Townsville. Her concern was not so much how she could afford the huge increase in premiums. She does not have the option. She has to be able to afford it. She has no option. Her only option was to consider which foods she could do without. That goes into play in things like the health debate. We are talking about older people here, living in these things, who are going to end up not being able to survive or who will suffer health deterioration in a hospital. These are the things that people have to go through.


I also spoke to Mick Price, who is a mate of mine, about insurance in Townsville. Mick lives in a two-level apartment complex on the marina in Townsville. Over just three years, his body corporate insurance bill has risen some 690 per cent. Over those three years, his body corporate insurance premiums have risen from $27,000 to $187,000. In anyone's language, that is simply unsustainable. Part of Mick's problem is that there is simply no flexibility in the way they insure. They have three buildings which housed the unit dwellings. They have another building which acts as a garage and a shed for the complex. If they had the option to not insure the whole but to flexibly insure parts to different degrees, he would be happier. He would like to see flexibility over what products he could take. Being on the marina, they have absolutely no need for flood insurance, but they are still getting billed for it. When we have this problem with insurance costs in North Queensland, we need to be working with the industry to make these changes that could help bring premiums down. He would countenance an increase in excess—not to the extent of $250,000 but to, say, $20,000—to help lower that cost burden. I know that insurer Zurich said that for every dollar they received in premiums they paid out $1.15. So somewhere along the line someone is taking advantage of the system. If you increase the excess it will take away those things where people are claiming for fans, blinds and all those silly things that in the normal course of events you would not do.


I spoke also with Melinda Holborn, who lives in a block of townhouses on the banks of the Ross River. They went through Cyclone Yasi without the loss of even a fence paling. Still they saw in one year their insurance premium rise from $14,000 to $81,000. They shopped around and were able to get the price down to just over $50,000, but the pain is immediate and severe. Again Melinda wants to be able to insure with some sort of flexibility. Where she lives they have a tidal riverfront which is protected by two weirs and a dam, yet they are seen as high risk due to being a river frontage property.


I believe in markets. I do not want to see government intervention here. I believe we are seeing a short-term reaction which plays into the world market. I believe that as the financial markets contract worldwide underwriters will leave the market, making funds scarce. To compensate, insurers will have to raise the return on the investment to make it more attractive. Put these things together and you have rising premiums. I believe that the market will make a decision on the viability of the North Queensland body corporate insurance market. I believe that very soon some guy somewhere will be looking for margin and market share. They will look at the North Queensland market and decide that they should be getting some of this market and they will come in at a discounted price. I do not believe that CGU, which is the only company which is currently offering body corporate insurance to larger dwellings, should be vilified for raising premiums. I think they should be thanked for still offering a product. It is the big insurers of Queensland, and in particular Suncorp, who have made their commercial decision to leave North Queensland. They are still taking our car insurance, life insurance and home and contents insurance. They have just left this part of their portfolio. I would like to call on all North Queenslanders to weigh up their insurance and banking decisions with this in mind.


After 2011 proved to be such a horror year of natural disasters in Queensland and other parts of the country, a natural disaster insurance review was commissioned just over 12 months ago. Recommendations were received in September. After six weeks to consider these recommendations we have now seen this government defer 39 of the 47 recommendations that were made. Their biggest decision so far was to commit to further reviews. We have seen detrimental flooding come once again this year and we still have not seen much progress made on the lessons learned from the last lot of flooding. This government needs to get its act together and take decisive action on the review's full recommendations. The more we continue to delay, the more natural disaster victims we will have who cannot benefit from the lessons of past disasters.


Most people out there say they simply do not understand what is going on. They do not understand why their premium has risen so much. It would help if someone could give them a reason. But the people who come to my office are not making claims. It is not as if they have been making spurious claims. Cyclone Yasi came through Townsville and was basically a category 2.5. It was a big storm and I am not trying to belittle anything. There were lots of trees down but we did not cop anywhere near what Cardwell and Tully did. Those guys are the ones sitting there telling me that they just do not understand. They ask, 'Why is it that we are copping it in the neck at this very moment?' No-one can give them an answer. The insurance company says it is reinsurance. Nobody seems to be able to understand what is going on. We have asked people to move out of their family home into units on a fixed income and it is simply unsustainable. Those are the people we have to worry about because they are the ones who will be the collateral damage.


I support the measures taken in this bill, though it remains to be seen how successful the implementation will be. The natural disasters of the last 18 months have brought about many problems with insurance policies. While it is good to see measures being taken to address concerns associated with flooding, insurance problems are continuing to hurt North Queenslanders. I will be closely watching the government's response to the outcome of the strata title inquiry and doing whatever I can to ensure that this government and the insurance industry are working towards a solution. As I said before, I think the member for Moreton, who is heading this inquiry, has done a fantastic job and has come at this at the right angle. But we want to see what actually happens when the decisions and the recommendations have to be made. Thank you very much to for the opportunity to speak on this bill.

WYATT ROY
 (Longman) (17:00):  When the floodwaters rose in my electorate in January last year there was an overall sense of fear, uncertainty and panic in my community. The waters came up so quickly that in some circumstances there was very little time for evacuations or preparations. But for all of the fear and all the uncertainty surrounding the floods themselves it was the aftermath that has struck at the hearts of thousands of Queenslanders, including many living in my community. After the waters subsided, unmistakable genuine dread, panic and frustration set in. In the days following the tragic Queensland floods of 2011 my office was inundated with calls from concerned local residents who were unsure whether they were covered by insurance and what they needed to do to find out the truth from their insurance providers, who at the time seemed to be less than forthcoming with the relevant information.


For these people, who had lost all of their worldly possessions, the fear and uncertainty as they waited for judgment on whether they were covered by their insurance was paralysing. In some cases this fear was justified. Many who had thought that they were covered by their insurance simply were not and were instead left to the mercy of the community to come to their assistance. It is for these families that we are here today to debate the Insurance Contracts Amendment Bill 2011.


This bill introduces two measures: a standard definition of 'flood' for insurance contracts and a requirement of insurance providers to provide key facts sheets to consumers taking out home building and contents insurance policies. In January 2011 many individuals were left without insurance coverage when they had mistakenly assumed they would be covered—all of which could be put down to mistaken understandings facilitated by the use of compound, complicated phrases which, without experience in the insurance industry, seemed almost impossible to decipher the true meaning and extent of coverage for flood incidents.


The confusion experienced by people in my community was not an isolated incident. It was not isolated to a particular insurance provider or just to our community. In fact, individuals across the country were confused. The devastating floods that this country faced demonstrated that the existing regulations governing insurance contracts were insufficient and inadequate for the people of this country.


The disturbing and disappointing reality is that the lack of a common definition for 'flood' was first highlighted as an issue back in 2007. Yet it has taken nearly five more years and a series of devastating floods across the country for those across the chamber to give this issue the importance it deserves and to start to make some progress towards a solution. Even the insurance industry itself, which was pushing for a standard definition, was unable to encourage this Labor government to pursue this issue with the stamina and commitment it deserved. No, this government's resolve wavered at the first hurdle when initial plans to introduce a common definition were scuttled by the ACCC.


Those on the opposite side of the House let this issue lay dormant until they received the resounding wake-up call of the 2011 floods. It was not until the wake-up call of last year's floods, and at the insistence of this side of the House, that this Labor government finally took action on this issue. In March the National Disaster Insurance Review was commissioned and in April consultations began. But, when the review's recommendations were received by the government in September, instead of taking immediate action on the recommendations, the powers that be held back the release of the review until November, thereby preventing any genuine action before the start of another Australian wet season and the floods that we have again seen across this country.


More disappointing still was the government's decision to defer decisions on 39 of the total of 47 recommendations of the report. It would seem that the only tangible, solid action that this government was willing to take was to commit to still further reviews. In marked contrast to those opposite, the coalition has always stood for action and has consistently sought to achieve a standard, universal definition of 'flood' to be utilised by all insurance providers in their contracts. We on this side of the House support the recommendation of the natural disaster insurance review, that the government should introduce a standard definition of 'flood' in order to avoid any consumer confusion surrounding flood coverage within insurance policies. The final report recommends that the definition of 'flood' be:


...  the covering of normal dry land by water that has escaped or been released from the normal confines of:


(a) any lake, or any river, creek or other natural watercourse, whether or not altered or modified; or


(b) any reservoir, canal or dam.


We on this side of the House support this standard definition for floods across the entire country and across every insurance company.


After the devastating floods of last year, I held extensive community consultation both online and in person with stakeholders and affected locals in my community. This consultation revealed the desperate need to address the lack of a standard definition of 'flood'. One of the many people from my community that I spoke to told me, and I quote verbatim:


The government needs to look into the wording of what a flood et cetera are in insurance companies as most people are only now finding out what their policy really means to them.


This was one of the many desperate cries for help from my community. Yet another was from a local resident of Mary Street, Caboolture—one of the worst affected local streets during the flood. Despite having been insured with the same company for 26 years and being under the impression that he was covered for flood, this gentleman's insurance claim after the flood was declined. The ambiguity surrounding whether the flood was a flash-flooding event or a riverine-rising event means that he sadly discovered that he would not be covered for the damage to his home. One can only imagine the desperation that this gentleman and his wife felt upon receiving this news. I can only imagine that this surprising and devastating news would not have been needed to be delivered if this Labor government had been more proactive in making changes to insurance contract laws when concerns were first raised in 2007.


It was the compelling testimonials and broader community feedback that were the motivation for me to make a submission to the commission of inquiry into the Queensland floods. In my response to the commission of inquiry, and based on the extensive feedback that I received from the community during the community consultation that I conducted in my electorate, I recommended that a standard definition of 'flood' be developed by the Insurance Council of Australia and applied by all insurance providers and that policyholders be provided with information about their level of cover in plain English.


My community has experienced firsthand the importance of a single universal definition for the word 'flood' and the confusion experienced due to the many and varied definitions of flood in insurance contracts. The outcome of the confusing jargon so often used in insurance contracts has in some instances shattered the dreams of families who have lost everything only to find that their insurance did not cover their losses. For those who were left without insurance coverage, my local community did an excellent job, and I thank the countless individuals who did a wonderful job in facilitating delivery of emergency goods and assistance to the many families in my region.


This standard universal definition will provide clarity to the many people in my electorate when planning their future insurance. Those residents on Dale Street in Burpengary will have greater certainty when taking out insurance policies. While this may not be a solution to the poor planning decisions that have gone before, the regulation of a standard definition of 'flood', will allow them to make informed choices about whether they take out flood coverage. Sadly, for some in my community these measures have come too late. But unless a standard definition of 'flood' is created and used now, many more will suffer the same fate as those in my community did in January last year.


The second measure that this bill deals with is that of the key facts sheet. It is the intention that this bill will require all insurance companies to provide consumers with a key facts sheet about their policy. This is a commonsense measure that will enable consumers to effectively compare apples with apples when it comes to their insurance and give them every opportunity to make an educated and informed decision regarding their home and contents insurance. In an industry that has been fraught with confusion and ambiguity, evidence of which has been seen in the way the flood related claims have played out over the past 12 months, measures to increase transparency are important, if not essential. Unfortunately, the draft requirements for the key facts sheets have not yet been released. However, the minister has indicated that they will be put through rigorous consumer testing before the final regulations are decided upon. It is absolutely critical that this process of consumer testing be adhered to. The purpose of the key fact sheet is to help consumers to make informed decisions about their insurance products. The ability of the key fact sheets to be an effective tool for informing consumers will depend on the content that is required to be included. If this is not thoroughly tested and vetted to check that it is achieving these goals, this measure will not reach its potential.


It is important that this measure delivers an effective result for the consumer so that we do not see a repeat of what we saw last year. Although I rise to speak in support of this bill today, I have concerns about the implementation of the two measures that this bill seeks to add to insurance law. It is important to note that this bill will merely enable changes to be made to the Insurance Contracts Regulations. The regulations of these two measures are not controlled by this bill and there is concern both by industry and on this side of the chamber about the uncertainty left by this bill. Until we see the regulations themselves and know how these measures will be enforced under the regulations, it is difficult to assess the adequacy of the measures. It is absolutely imperative that more time is not wasted—that Australians have the benefit of both a standard and a universal definition of flood and the advantage of a key fact sheet from insurance providers in order to enable them to easily compare insurance policies. It is in this vein that I support this bill.

"Van Manen, Bert, MP",LP,2012-03-14,"



Mr VAN MANEN
 (Forde) (17:11):  I too rise to speak on the Insurance Contracts Amendment Bill 2011. This bill proposes to change insurance law to introduce a standard definition of flood in insurance contracts and a key fact sheet to give people more and easier-to-identify information on their home and building contents policies, and to enable them to compare different policies from different companies.


I think it is worthwhile at this point to look at a bit of the history of this measure. The Insurance Council of Australia originally proposed a standard definition of 'flood' in 2008 following the New South Wales floods of 2007. The initial proposal by the Insurance Council of Australia was subsequently rejected by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission following concerns raised by various consumer groups. In its statement, the ACCC encouraged the consumer groups and the Insurance Council of Australia to work together on the development of a common definition of flood which would make it easier for consumers to understand what the term means.


Before we get to the actions—or, should I say, lack thereof—of those opposite and this current government, let us look at what our wonderful consumer advocate groups have done. It appears that these consumer advocate groups have failed to follow up on the ACCC's encouragement to work with the Insurance Council of Australia to develop a standard definition of flood for insurance policies. If this is the case, and I have been led to believe by the Insurance Council that it is, then these so-called consumer advocate groups have let down the very consumers whose interests they are supposedly representing or protecting, which has contributed to costing these consumers tens of millions of dollars in the process. Equally, as I just mentioned, the current federal Labor government has done nothing to progress a common definition of flood after the ACCC scuttled the industry attempt to introduce a definition in 2008. It is interesting when you compare the wording of that proposed definition with the proposed standard wording in this bill. There are far more similarities than differences.


It has taken the disastrous floods in Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria and Cyclone Yasi in 2011 to finally get those opposite to act and realise the seriousness of addressing the issue for the victims of flooding. It has become even more relevant in the past week and a half, when we have seen flooding in southern New South Wales and northern Victoria. The government's initial step following these disasters was to commission the Natural Disaster Insurance Review in March 2011. The review recommendations were received by the government in September 2011 but were not released until November 2011, and they contained some 47 recommendations. In a stunning case of déjà vu, we remember the Henry tax review. Despite having six weeks to consider the recommendations, the government has deferred decisions on 39 of the report's 47 recommendations. In fact the government's biggest decision was to commit to further reviews. I wonder how those who have been flooded are feeling about that.


At least we now have something on the table. But this is only enabling legislation, creating the mechanism by which the regulations can be drawn up by the minister to be inserted into the Insurance Contracts Act. There are some questions as to what the wording of the regulations will be. The question now becomes: when will these regulations be announced to provide consumers and the insurance industry with much-needed certainty? I have been advised by the Insurance Council of Australia that at least five insurers have announced that they have or will be introducing standard flood definitions in their policies, and they are looking to do so in good faith in anticipation of the fact that the regulations, when introduced, will honour the key points outlined in this bill. Once again, this demonstrates the capacity of business to deal with community concerns.


This bill seeks to define the standard definition of flood, along with restricting the use of compound phrases including words such as flash flooding or accidental flooding. I think that is a very good step because there is much confusion about what the definitions in current household contents policies actually say. If I have a look at my policy, I find you need to almost be a lawyer to understand it. I am fortunate that I do not live in an area that is likely to be flooded. If I do get flooded, there will be a lot of people in a lot of trouble. However, the legislation before us today does not require all insurance policies to insure against flooding. People still need to be very mindful of what they are actually getting in their insurance policies, and that is part of the importance of the key facts sheet. The definition proposed is:


'Flood' means the covering of normally dry land by water that has escaped or been released from the normal confines of:


(a) any lake, or any river, creek or other natural watercourse, whether or not altered or modified; or


(b) any reservoir, canal or dam.


Any standard definition will not benefit current flood victims as it will only take effect once this legislation is passed and the regulations have been inserted into the Insurance Contracts Act. As the member for Longman has pointed out, the industry supports this change along with the proposed key facts sheet; however, there are still concerns about the final version of these regulations. The key facts sheet is meant to provide consumers with key information to allow them to more easily understand and compare insurance policies.


In 2012, we saw renewed flooding in Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria. As the minister was quoted saying on the ABC several days ago, already some 8,000 insurance claims totalling around $64 million have been lodged as a result of the latest flooding and, as the minister rightly pointed out, this figure will only increase. As we debate this legislation, there are still towns in Victoria and New South Wales who are affected by flooding and homeowners are still looking to sandbag and protect their properties. But it is not only homeowners; there are many small businesses in these small country towns that are also being affected. These latest natural disasters serve as a reminder of how vulnerable we all are to nature's vagaries. We need to ensure that we do everything that we can to protect ourselves and the community during these times. It is predominantly through the use of insurance in this modern age that we look to do that. That is why it is so important that these changes to the Insurance Contracts Act to provide this standard definition and to require insurers to provide a key facts sheet are introduced as soon as possible to give everybody certainty about what their level of cover is.


One of the key concerns for me, though, is that this standard definition of flood cover is being introduced after flooding events have occurred. What effect is this going to have on premiums? We have already seen or heard of instances in which there have significant increases in premiums as a result of properties being in flood-affected areas. In a time when people's living costs are going through the roof, these increased premium costs are only going to make it more difficult for people to maintain their policies. That is another reason why these issues should have been dealt with four or five years ago when the problems first arose. If that had been done, potentially the costs of the policies would have been more manageable.


While the floods last year had very little impact on my electorate, I remember the 1974 floods and the devastating effect they had on my community at that time. Two houses in my street were washed away as a result of that flooding. I saw the effect that had on the families involved. I was also involved in cleaning up other houses in the community that had been inundated. As former senior flood forecaster for the Bureau of Meteorology Geoff Heatherwick stated in the Courier Mail yesterday, it is important to remember that these past floods can and will occur again. It is only a question of when.


There are other issues to do with properties being flooded, such as town planning and development decisions. Our councils and state governments have a significant requirement on them to have a look at their policies and processes in this regard.


As my colleagues have stated, the coalition is supportive of these amendments. However we maintain our concern about whether what is outlined in these bills before us will ultimately be reflected in the regulations. Australians want certainty and the government must act now to ensure that the recommendations that have had their implementation delayed or deferred are addressed as soon as possible. There should be more than plenty of motivation in light of recent disasters to warrant a speedy resolution to this matter. The coalition await the final regulations as we want to ensure that they provide the certainty and the clarity that are required so that all parties to insurance contracts have confidence, especially the purchasers of home and contents insurance policies.

"Ciobo, Steven, MP",LP,2012-03-14,"



Mr CIOBO
 (Moncrieff) (17:23):  I am pleased to rise to speak on the Insurance Contracts Amendment Bill 2011. This is a bill that I had some involvement with in my capacity as deputy chair of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics when the committee undertook a short inquiry into the operation of the bill. The issue is, as we have all heard from many contributors to this debate, a country that is fraught with extremes. Extremes in nature occur on a regular basis. In this past two months alone in my city of the Gold Coast we have seen very significant falls. Flooding occurred only a week ago through large tracts of the Australian countryside. People's lives have been put on hold; people's livelihoods have been put on hold. People's homes have been directly affected and impacted upon by flooding. The issue is what can government do to assist. Following the tragic floods that took place in the summer of 2011, when we saw devastation across so many parts of Australia, in particular in Brisbane, Ipswich, and in parts of Victoria, we know there were many people who thought that they were adequately protected and covered by flood insurance only to, horrifyingly, discover subsequently that they did not have flood cover, or at least not be covered for the incident that occurred to them.


When this bill came before the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics, it was a chance to explore in more detail the way the bill would operate to alleviate the concerns that people had and to provide surety and certainty that their insurance would provide them with the benefit of that cover should their home or otherwise be flooded. What quickly came to pass though was that this bill is effectively nothing more than what is known as colloquially referred to as a coathanger bill. It is a bill that pushes through principle only, and it is a bill that does not contain the actual important information—and in fact that will be deferred to being passed in the regulation. So we have a bill that is, for all intents and purposes, next to useless when it comes to providing certainty for people who are wondering whether or not they have got adequate flood cover, and what exactly the word 'flood 'means in their insurance policy. This an easy fix. The fact is the government has been sitting on information now for a matter of years about how they should best deal with issue of flood. The fact is that the government could have incorporated a definition of the word 'flood' into this bill and not have deferred the matter to regulation. 


What is clear is that industry and stakeholders have been yearning for clarity around this issue in their consolations with government and with Treasury. As part of the roundtable inquiry that the House of Representatives economics committee undertook, there was significant discussion around whether industry was confident that the final version that we will see in the regulation will mirror industry expectations, and provide certainty and clarity of the type that was sought. What is also clear is that concerns were raised as well with the operation of the second element of the bill which deals with the key facts sheet that would need to be issued as a consequence of the passage of this legislation. 


In both instances, although we are supportive of the bill insofar as it is a pathway to providing surety and clarity, we are disappointed that this information was not contained in the legislation itself. Given the significant period of time that has elapsed since this whole journey began, it is obvious that there would have been opportunity to incorporate that information into the bill. I note in particular the supplementary remarks made by the member for Higgins, the member for Wright and me with respect to the committee's recommendations that the bill be passed. Although, yes, we certainly were supportive, as Liberal members of the committee, we stated we:


... cannot ... agree with paragraphs 2.50 and 2.51 of the report that outlined assurances that outlined assurances the Department of Treasury was engaged in constructive dialogue with industry and consumer groups; as well as the observation that there were 'no points raised in submissions or at the hearing that the Treasury was not already across or was taking steps to consider solutions'.


The reason we focused explicitly on rebutting those two paragraphs was that that was not clear, it was not plain and it was not apparent. The reality is that a number of comments were made by industry stakeholders that actually ran quite to the contrary. Very clear statements were made that it depended on what was actually contained within regulation and that that would dictate whether industry, and indeed consumers, would be better off. Statements were made, during the inquiry about the definition of flood and the impact of it. The transcript states:


Mr Ciobo: Wasn’t that the entire point of this bill—


to define floods?


Mr Anning: Not the actual definition of flood. That is subject to the discussions under the regulations.


Mr Ciobo: So, we actually have no clarification yet of what the impact of this would be on potentially thousands of people …


Mr Anning: … I guess the point is we are not at the point of having the clarity to even form a view.


So if that does not underscore the extent to which there is industry confusion and apprehension about the operation of the regulations of this bill then I do not know how it could be more plainly put. The reality is that all Australians want to have some certainty with respect to flood insurance. In my electorate of Moncrieff, based on the Gold Coast, I have literally hundreds if not thousands of homes that sit on the waterfront. I have so many homes that are placed upon canals, placed upon rivers, and owners that question whether or not there is actually going to be an impact if a flood were to go through. Of course the great flood that people of the Gold Coast still talk about is 1974 flood. People in Brisbane used to talk about the 1974 floods until the 2011 floods. The Gold Coast was spared and had the good grace and good fortune of not having the devastation we saw in Brisbane in 2011. That notwithstanding, people still talk about the 1974 floods and the 1974 flood levels. In this respect, it is obvious that people want definitions and clarity around the word 'flood' because it has direct impact on their coverage.


Take, for example, a home that is situated on a canal. There would be word games played under policies previously where, if as a consequence of rain, there was a flood coupled with a king tide that actually pushed seawater back in the canal estate and caused water to go into the home, whether it was freshwater or salt water would actually determine whether or not your policy was in place—whether or not you have coverage by virtue of the fact that it was seawater or freshwater. 


These kinds of examples of hairsplitting ultimately caused the problems that have led to the quest for a common definition of the word 'flood'. In this respect it is clear that we join with the government in wanting this issue to be resolved. But, again, I restate our concern that this was not resolved within the bill and now once again has been deferred to the regulations—something that is still going to take some time to come forward.


The second element of this particular bill deals with the issue of the key facts sheet. The key facts sheet is of itself a good idea. A key facts sheet provides a high-level summary of the information contained within the policy and the operation of policy for the benefit of consumers. It is not, however, a replacement for the policy itself. It is important that not be held out as being the case, because people need to understand that they can look at a key facts sheet to achieve exactly that—the key facts—but not to have a comprehensive understanding.


There are also a number of housekeeping matters that were raised before the House of Representatives Economics Committee inquiry, which Deputy Speaker Leigh would be very familiar with, which dealt with the issue of the operation of the key facts sheet and whether or not the key facts sheet would need to be sent out to consumers for each and every additional alteration to the policy document, or whether it could be, for example, an annual event. Again, there is no clarity around these issues because these issues ultimately are dependent upon the passage of the regulations. For us as an opposition trying to hold this very poor government to account, the fact remains that we are required to now sit idly by and wait for Treasury to undertake its consultation and for that information to be contained within regulations, which would then presumably be subject to a disallowance motion. So for those reasons we think this is particularly poor form the government's part and we think it is not a particularly good way to provide good governance and certainty to industry, stakeholders and to consumers. I will confine my comments to those. As I said, we do support the passage of the bill, but this could have been a much, much better effort.

"Mirabella, Sophie, MP",LP,2012-03-14,"



Mrs MIRABELLA
 (Indi) (17:33):  I rise to support the Insurance Contracts Amendment Bill 2011 and do so with great degree of disappointment and without overwhelming enthusiasm. I think on the whole most of what is contained in the bill is a step in the right direction, but there is such a deficiency of actual substance to it that it will provide little comfort to those people who have suffered during the floods and who want greater clarity. 


I also think that the Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation unrealistically raised expectations in the wake of the January 2011 floods. Those who had hoped for real, substantial measures have been badly let down, because of course, as has been said by previous speakers, and most eloquently just before me by the member for Moncrieff, the devil is fundamentally in the detail—in the regulations that will accompany this bill. All of us, not just members of the opposition but those Australians out there who are wanting to know what the government policy is, will have to wait until those regulations come out. People in my electorate do it tough. They are subject to significant natural disasters. In many ways, natural disasters, whether they be fires or floods, are a way of life for so many people in central and north-east Victoria, and something that we have learnt to live with. Where policymakers can come into play is when they can be proactive regarding policy frameworks that make it as easy as possible for people to respond to and prepare for natural disasters.


The main purpose of the bill is obviously to set a standard definition for flood. There is general agreement that it is high time that there was a nationally agreed definition for flood and that that is adopted. We all know that the insurance industry want to minimise risk and maximise return, and the ambiguity regarding a definition for flood has allowed them to pursue their commercial interests, as is to be expected. But this has left customers out in the cold, sometimes in the most atrocious of fashions. Unfortunately, we are yet to see the wording of this standard definition, so you can understand, Mr Deputy Speaker Leigh, why I am not wholeheartedly jumping for joy and embracing this legislation with great enthusiasm because it is crucial that the definition is right. It is one thing to support a well-meaning concept; it is another thing for that well-meaning concept can be incorporated in an accepted and well understood, simple definition. 


The second component of the bill is the provision of a fact sheet for policyholders. Again, it is a noble concept and a sensible proposal. But the lack of detail about when the fact sheets will be made available, what they will contain, what they need to contain and whether the language is simple make it difficult to pass judgment until we actually see the regulations. The Natural Disaster Insurance Review put forward some very sensible suggestions—and it did raise the expectations of many people in the electorate. A key recommendation is the mandatory application of flood cover, but with a requirement to provide an opt-out clause. The importance of this recommendation was brought to light this year in my electorate when the RACV made the decision to apply flood cover to all insurance policies without giving customers the ability to opt out. The day the policy renewal invoices were sent out, my office was inundated and the phones ran hot. I am told that there was a 50-metre long queue outside the RACV offices in Wodonga. I spoke to countless customers whose insurance premiums skyrocketed overnight. 


Just to appreciate the anxiety that this caused, I will list a couple of examples of the overnight increases in the insurance premiums. Joan from Park Lane in Wangaratta has lived in her house for 15 years. She has seen several floods in her time, none of which have impacted on her property. Yet her insurance premium rose from $540 a year to more than $3,000 a year. That is an increase of more than 550 per cent. Dianne from Martin Place in Wangaratta saw her premium go from $1,188 a year to $9,552 a year. That is an increase of more than 800 per cent. Chris Blake from Mansfield has never seen floods pass through her town before and her house has never been impacted, yet her insurance premium went from $470 to $2,400. That is an increase of 500 per cent. Chris has been looking elsewhere for a new policy, but is finding it increasingly difficult. AAMI quoted her $5,000. Most insurance companies in fact will not even give her a quote at all. This goes beyond just the RACV. I fear these problems will spread unless something is done soon. Giving consumers the choice of insurance by opting out is a very sensible suggestion, so they can decide the level of cover that they can afford and the risks with which they can live. I have had countless examples of consumers—just like the ones I have mentioned, constituents of mine—who have been left high and dry by their insurers. I think it is important to quote these examples, because I have heard some very questionable statistics floating around about how few customers will be impacted by the decisions of companies like the RACV. I would be more than happy to put forward these examples to the minister if they would assist him in progressing his deliberations on the very important issues and recommendations raised in this review. 


This particular issue does go deeper. I have also spoken to local insurance brokers, and they have told me that some insurance companies have just left some parts of my electorate altogether. What happens when it comes time to sell a property that cannot be insured for under $10,000 a year or that cannot be insured at all? If this particular practice spreads, we will have a crisis in the housing industry in some parts of this country. Who on earth is going to buy a property that cannot be insured, or that costs more than $10,000 a year to insure?


So this does need urgent attention. I understand the minister is looking at the legal consequences of a proposal to introduce mandatory flood cover with a compulsory opt-out proposal. I look forward to advice on this matter in the near future. It is absolutely critical to many people across the country—in capital cities and in the regions—who are experiencing great anxiety and uncertainty, not only about their insurance cover but also about the value of their primary asset, which is their home. I hope the minister does move quickly, because many of my constituents are being left uninsured in the meantime. 


On a final point, the NDIR proposed a national flood overlay map. This is a very important recommendation. One of the problems customers face when their insurance companies tell them they are in a flood zone is that it is very difficult to make a compelling argument in response. Local knowledge and experience does not really carry much weight. Insurance companies are not required to disclose their flood map data, which puts customers in a particularly disadvantageous position if they do not agree that they are in a flood zone. A national flood overlay map would empower customers to appeal, by providing them with nationally consistent, high-quality data. I hope the government gives this due consideration, because it is a sensible proposal. 


In summary, I support the bill before the House, but it is only a very small step—and, in many ways, a motherhood step. The substance will be in the regulations and that is where we will assess the details to ensure that they are adequate and live up to their promises. 


There is much to be done, and many Australians will be watching very closely to ensure that the minister's rhetoric during the floods of 2011 is backed up with substantial policy responses and real legislation that address the fundamental problems that are crippling many homeowners at the moment.

"Shorten, Bill, MP",ALP,2012-03-14,"



Mr SHORTEN
 (Maribyrnong—Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation and Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations) (17:44):  I thank honourable members for their contributions to the debate on the Insurance Contracts Amendment Bill 2011—including the member for Indi for her charming contribution. I note that she was attacking the government for making statements; it puzzles me somewhat why the coalition when they were in power failed to do any of what we are doing, because floods are not new. This government has acted. This bill will implement measures to assist consumers to make effective decisions in relation to their insurance needs through increased clarity and accessibility of information. 


Schedule 1 of the bill will amend the Insurance Contracts Act 1984 to provide a standard definition of 'flood' across all home building and home contents insurance policies, and to extend this definition to cover small businesses and strata title bodies corporate. The definition provides a clear and easily understandable meaning for what is commonly known as riverine flooding—the covering of normally dry land with water that has escaped or been released from the normal confines of any lake, river, creek or any other natural water course or alternatively any reservoir, canal or dam. This measure will reduce consumer confusion regarding what is and what is not included in insurance contracts. It will avoid situations in which neighbouring properties affected by the same inundation event received different claims assessments because the flood policies covering them used different definitions of flood.


This measure will also improve the ability of consumers to evaluate potential insurance policies and compare like products with different insurer providers. I have moved amendments to the bill to ensure that the standard definition of 'flood' can operate as intended. The amendments respond to concerns raised by insurers in consultation with the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics as outlined by the committee's advisory report on the Insurance Contracts Amendment Bill released on 17 February 2012. I note that the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics recommended that the House of Representatives pass this bill. The details of the standard definition of 'flood' will be included in the regulations. Draft regulations were released for consultation late last year and Treasury will be undertaking further consultation in order to ensure that the wording and application of the standard definition is appropriate.


Schedule 2 of the bill will amend the Insurance Contracts Act 1984 to implement a requirement for insurers to provide consumers with a key facts sheet for home building and home contents insurance policies. This measure will make the purchase of home building and home contents policies simpler for consumers by assisting them compare policies with a consistent document and by facilitating more informed decision making.


On 29 February 2012 I released a discussion paper on the key facts sheet, which seeks stakeholder views on the format, content, structure and provision of the key facts sheet. Feedback on the discussion paper will allow the government to develop a prototype key facts sheet, which will be consumer tested. Once consumer testing is finalised, regulations will be made to give effect to the key facts sheet.


Some opposition members, as is their wont, have criticised the government for including elements of the standard definition, including the prescribed contracts to which it will apply and the wording of the definition in regulations. The prescribed contracts to which the standard definition of 'flood' will apply will be contained in regulations. This is consistent with the location of the standard cover regime for standardised contracts and reduces the potential for unintended consequences for both consumers and insurers. This is particularly important given that the standard definition will apply to small business and strata title policies. The wording of the standard definition of 'flood' will also be contained in the regulations. This will ensure that the policy intent of the new standard definition of 'flood' can be achieved in a simple and effective way and will safeguard against the potential for the standard definition of 'flood' to apply inappropriately.


The consultation process that the government has undertaken has been transparent and thorough. In April 2011 the government released a discussion paper that contained the proposed definition. The Natural Disaster Insurance Review considered this issue and in its final report recommended the adoption of the government's preferred definition. The government is now undertaking a final round of consultation on the wording. Both consumer groups and the insurance industry have publicly supported the government's preferred definition, in many cases expressing pleasure that at last a government has acted after 40 or 50 years—far too long.


The details of the key facts sheet for home building and home contents insurance policies will be contained in regulations, which is consistent with other similar one-page disclosure documents, such as the home loan key facts sheet.


In conclusion, this bill delivers on the government's commitment to provide consumers with a better understanding of what is included in insurance policies.
