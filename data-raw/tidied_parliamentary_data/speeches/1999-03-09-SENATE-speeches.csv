"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,1999-03-09,"—On the first day back, I got stumped with a question from Senator Harradine on Australia Day. I now have an answer from the Prime Minister on that and I seek leave to have the answer incorporated in Hansard .
Leave granted.
The answer read as follows—
Australia Day is a special day of celebration when all Australians can share the sense of patriotism and spirit that makes our country great and unique. Its celebration on 26 January each year provides all Australians with the opportunity to contemplate the past and take pride in our achievements as a nation and to think about the future.
While I appreciate that some people in the community would prefer an Australia Day long weekend, the government considers that it is more appropriate to maintain the symbolism of Australia's national day by celebrating the occasion as a national event on 26 January.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Australia Day Holiday</title>,Questions Without Notice,1,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1999-03-09,"—I give notice that, on the next day of sitting, I shall move:
That the provisions of paragraphs (5) to (7) of standing order 111 not apply to the Therapeutic Goods Legislation Amendment Bill 1999, allowing it to be considered during this period of sittings.
Madam Deputy President, I also table a statement of reasons justifying the need for this bill to be considered during this sitting and I seek leave to have the statement incorporated in Hansard .
Leave granted.
The statement read as follows—
STATEMENT OF REASONS FOR INTRODUCTION AND PASSAGE
Therapeutic Goods Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1999)
Amendments are proposed to the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 and the Therapeutic Goods Amendment Act 1997 to implement reforms to the regulation of complementary medicines.
Consumers, industry and government alike have been beset with anomalies and frustration in the marketing and regulatory control of complementary medicines.
Calls for the urgent reform of regulation in this area have come from a large proportion and cross-section of the Australian population. Complementary medicines are having an increasing impact on the Australian population with over 60 percent of Australians estimated to use Complementary healthcare products at least once a year. Complementary healthcare products are now widely available through direct marketing, pharmacies, health food stores and supermarkets. The Australian complementary healthcare industry has an estimated annual turnover in excess of I billion dollars. 

There are around 17,000 complementary healthcare products on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods and an estimated 6,000 complementary medicine practitioners in Australia (not including massage therapists).
This Bill helps clarify the scope of complementary medicine regulation, elevates the status of the expert committee which evaluates complementary medicines, and introduces safeguards to protect against unscrupulous practices.
These changes have been canvassed at length with, and agreed to by, the complementary medicines industry, consumer groups, a wide variety of government agencies and health practitioners.
A range of administrative and educational reforms are also being implemented to overcome the major perceptual and regulatory barriers for complementary medicines. Legislative change and implementation of these reforms will provide a `one stop regulatory shop' for the complementary healthcare industry.
The establishment of the Office of Complementary Medicine, the establishment of a government/industry/consumers consultative forum, new administrative procedures, and enhanced regulations are all due to take effect by 1 April 1999.
Introduction and passage of the amendments in this session is urgent in order to overcome anomalies and ensure alignment of the range of reforms being implemented over the coming weeks.

Senator Brown to move, on the next day of sitting:
That the Senate—
(a)	 notes the proposal for an international airport on Kooragang Island, Newcastle, a project which would:
	 (i)	 demolish the largest wetland rehabilitation project in the southern hemisphere,
	 (ii)	 be directly adjacent to wetlands which come under the protection of three international treaties to which Australia is a signatory, including the Ramsar treaty aimed at protecting migratory birds, and
	 (iii)	 be close to some of the most densely urbanised areas of Newcastle, exposing them to the kind of flight path noise pollution which has caused Sydney residents so much distress; and
(b)	 condemns the proposal.

That the following bill be introduced: A Bill for an Act to amend the Criminal Code Act 1995, and for other purposes. Criminal Code Amendment (Bribery of Foreign Public Officials) Bill 1999.",SENATE,<title>NOTICES</title>,<title>Presentation</title>,Notices,2,1
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,1999-03-09,"—I move:
That, in the opinion of the Senate, the following is a matter of urgency:
The failure of the Government to ensure Centrelink provides adequate levels of public 
 service to the millions of Australians who rely on Commonwealth income support payments.
It is important that the Senate does debate this matter of urgency today, which relates to the failure of the government to ensure Centrelink provides adequate levels of public service to the millions of Australians who rely on Commonwealth income support payments. It is urgent because the level of service being provided to Centrelink clients is declining, as is evident from the figures provided by the government in response to serious questions raised with them at the estimates committee process. The increase in demand for Centrelink services is not being met, is not being funded, by this government.
The government do not seem to want to accept this as a serious public policy question. They want to hide behind the Centrelink board. They want to dismiss it as merely the concerns of unions with members working in Centrelink. But it is a far more widespread issue than that and it is a far more important issue than the government would have the Australian public believe.
We have a situation where each day on average 276,000 calls to Centrelink go unanswered. Australian pensioners, families and unemployed people—clients of Centrelink—ring up for advice and service and on an average day 276,000 of them cannot get an answer. In answer to a question from me at estimates hearings the department estimated that one in six of the calls made to Centrelink are successfully connected. Only one person in six actually gets through to speak to an operator.
The minister tries to say that there is not a problem. If you are a private company, you would be out of business if that were the level of service that you provided. We say that this is a matter of serious public concern. That sort of service level is not adequate, it is not what Australian taxpayers deserve, and the government should do better.
I notice that the minister is not speaking in the debate today, and I think that is a shame, although Senator Payne and others will probably do a better job. But it is important that the minister front up to this issue. At question time today she said, `We have not 
 made any staff reductions in Centrelink. These are decisions taken by the board.' So when it is good news, the minister is out there saying, `It is all to my credit.' When there is a problem, it is the Centrelink board's problem—nothing to do with the government.
This is clearly an issue that has to be sheeted home to the government, because it is the government that supplies the funds. The government has imposed a 10 per cent so-called efficiency dividend on Centrelink. That has forced it to reduce services and to reduce staff numbers. What we see in the service provided by Centrelink is a direct result of the service levels it is able to provide with the money that it receives from the Commonwealth. The minister cannot duck this issue. She provides the funding that allows Centrelink to do the job.
The government has increased the number of functions that Centrelink has to perform at the same time as reducing its funding and being involved in the process that has seen its staff reduced by 20 per cent. The vast majority of that staff reduction is occurring in this financial year. So what we are seeing is an organisation that is receiving less money and employing fewer staff but, as the minister said at question time, is dealing with a very much increased demand for its services. The minister said today that the number of calls coming in to Centrelink and the demand for its services is increasing, particularly through the call centres. I agree with her. That is evidently the case. What is not increasing are the government resources to meet that demand, to provide the service.
The minister mentioned, with some sense of satisfaction, that the number of calls answered had increased. The figure given to us formally in the estimates hearings was an increase of 17.6 per cent in the number of calls answered in 1998 compared with 1997. I do not dispute those figures.
What the minister did not say at question time was that the number of calls made had increased by 90 per cent—an increase of 90 per cent in the number of people calling but only 17 per cent more getting through. So the problem is getting worse. I agree that more people are getting connected, but the demand 
 has outstripped the supply of services by a very large factor. We have, on the minister's own figures, 276,000 calls every day not being answered. I think that is a matter of urgency and public concern, and it is not just an agenda for unions involved in the industry.
I get hundreds of letters from people dissatisfied with the service they get from Centrelink. Most of them do not actually criticise the staff. In fact, most of them—including the one I have in front of me today—are quite complimentary of the staff. But, as they say, that is when they get through. If they are successful in getting through, the staff are very efficient in providing the service. But the problem is that if they ring they cannot get through, and if they go to the offices they are often faced with very long queues.
These are not claims made by the opposition in isolation. These are claims based on the evidence produced by the minister's department through the estimates process. In the last couple of days we have received the latest of the answers to the questions that sought to elicit the information about these very real problems being experienced by clients of Centrelink. So we are not making these figures up. These figures are on the public record, supplied by Centrelink, describing the problems they have in meeting their customers' needs. One in six of their clients gets through on the phone—one in six. It is a hit ratio that is just not good enough in anybody's terms. And 276,000 calls unanswered on an average day is clearly not acceptable.
This is a problem that has to be faced up to. The government has to look at what it is doing about adequately resourcing Centrelink. The government is responsible. There is an increased demand. There are needs to be met in the community. The government is allocating more functions to Centrelink by decisions it takes every month and yet it is a service which has had its staff numbers reduced, its funding reduced and its capacity to service the clients seriously diminished.
The only thing the government ever says about social security in this country involves fraud, and it has been nailed pretty clearly in 
 the last week or so that the government has been relying on fairly dodgy figures about fraud. A lot of what is claimed are overpayments are made from genuine errors—errors by departmental officers or, I suspect, errors brought about by the fact that, if you want to fix a problem at Centrelink, you cannot get through to them on the phone to fix it even if you want to.
What is clear, though, is that the government has dined out on this fraud argument for months. The majority of the minister's press releases seem to be about fraud—not about caring for the people who need assistance in the community, but about the alleged campaign to eliminate fraud. We all support the elimination of fraud. What we do not support is the use of dodgy figures to misrepresent what is really going on in Centrelink. It is clear that Centrelink is not meeting the demands of the clients—the seven million or so Australians who rely on the services of Centrelink to access income support payments and to receive other assistance to allow them to live their lives, and if they cannot get through on the phone, if they cannot get service, then they experience real hardships.
Senator Crowley, who is going to speak later in the debate, has shown me a number of examples of correspondence that she has received. I have a number of them here that I have received from constituents which detail their very real experiences. I think I mentioned in the last debate on this issue that I tried to ring the telephone lines to gauge the response, and I had very mixed results. You can get through relatively easily on some lines on certain days by just listening to muzak for a fairly reasonable period of time—which, in itself, is a most painful experience—but on other lines you just cannot get through. At peak times like Christmas and Easter the average figure of 276,000 unanswered calls per day increases exponentially. There are great numbers of people who cannot get service at a time when they need service—when they need access to income support information, when they need the sort of support that the Commonwealth government should be providing to them.
It is a matter of urgency that we pressure the current conservative government of this country to do something to more adequately resource Centrelink so it can provide the services those seven million Australians rely on. We must take this issue seriously and not dismiss it because the facts do not suit our argument.

"Payne, Sen Marise",LP,1999-03-09,"—It gives me great pleasure to have the opportunity to rise in this debate to address the urgency motion moved by Senator Evans today on Centrelink. It gives me particular pleasure to address the facts about Centrelink and not just the rhetoric. It would be very easy to deal only in rhetoric on this issue, and that is something that the government certainly does not intend to do. There is one matter on which I agree with Senator Evans, and that is that this is a very serious issue. Some of the allegations that have been flying around in recent times about the operation of Centrelink need to be very seriously addressed.
Let us look at some of the facts. Let us look at the fact that Centrelink deals with 6.2 million customers a year, that it employs 24,000 people across 400 sites throughout the country, that it is a service delivery organisation that sends 66 million pieces of correspondence to customers each year, that it deals with over 400,000 booked appointments per month, that it receives over 19 million phone calls a year and that its Internet site now has over 12 million hits a year, conducting over 12½ million online transactions per annum. Centrelink is a service delivery organisation which, in total, makes over 232 million payments each year.
It is an extraordinary level of activity from a key government service delivery organisation that is dealing with millions of Australians. It is a service delivery organisation that was innovative at the time of its introduction and continues to be so. It is crucial for the delivery of government assistance and programs. Any assertion that members of the government do not care about those Australians in the community in need of that assistance and in need of that support is absolutely rejected. Senator Newman noted after the 
 launch of Centrelink—as, in fact, did the Prime Minister—that there has not been a more important reform in terms of service delivery to Australians. In putting government services under one roof for the first time, there is now a one-stop shop for information about government assistance, about programs, for Australians from all around the country from a wide range of backgrounds.
It is an organisation that was always aimed at being the human face of government with a focus on customer service—without queues or standing in front of counters, with better forms and with more user-friendly correspondence. With only a cursory glance at the statistics that I have referred to, you can actually see that Centrelink is pursuing that aim. For many Australians, particularly those living in country areas, it has been difficult to do business with government offices, particularly as times have become harder. I will return to the special challenges facing rural Australia at the moment. But I do want to look at some of the facts, as I said when I began, in relation to this particular urgency motion.
Centrelink make it their business to survey their customers. Extensive customer surveys have indicated that nearly 75 per cent of customers are either satisfied or very satisfied with the overall quality of service delivered by Centrelink customer service centres. They have a customer feedback service. The result was an 11 per cent reduction in the total number of complaints in 1997-98 as recorded—not by Centrelink itself—by the Commonwealth Ombudsman. They continue to meet or to exceed overall performance on timeliness standards for decisions on customer entitlements. They are achieving a 98 per cent performance on accuracy of decisions for customer claims, above their own performance targets.
We now have many more places for customers to do business—service is provided in over 1,000 locations, including the recent establishment of 74 new agents to add to the 180 that are already working in rural and remote Australia. The use of technology is opening up access even further. Videoconferencing, electronic kiosks, the provision of fax 
 and personal computer access is giving better access to services for rural Australians. What about opening hours? What about something very simple like that? Call centres are now open longer. There is access to Centrelink from Monday to Friday from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Just a few years ago under the previous government the call centres operated from 8.30 a.m. to 4.30 p.m. and customer service centres were closed every Wednesday afternoon. Tough, if you chose that time to try to visit. That means there is a 12½ per cent increase in customer access time.
Centrelink Call continues to provide service to customers in languages other than English. In key indigenous areas, such as Darwin and Cairns, new call centres have been opened to provide service to indigenous customers in northern Australia. In plain, simple terms, there are now more call centres—22 compared to 17 in the last year of the Labor government—and more operators—now 3,000 compared to only 1,449 in 1995-96—and many of those are located in areas of need like rural Australia.
The new national telecommunications platform that supports Centrelink is the most sophisticated in the country. It links all the call centres into a single virtual centre. They are now moving to the next level of automation—better use of voice response—which is more tuned to customer requirements. As I think the minister mentioned in her answer to a question this afternoon, the Centrelink call centre in Bunbury in Western Australia won the most recent award for outstanding private and public call service in Western Australia.
These are changes which are providing for Australians who need better access and greater contact. Access also available to customers through the Internet is now responding to over 1,000 requests a week, and that is growing. The personalised service, which I have spoken about in this chamber before, that Centrelink emphasises through the offer of one main contact for each customer will be in place across the board by the year 2000. It is what customers have told the government and Centrelink they want. They will also then be able to have decisions made on the spot.
It is a new way of doing business. It looks at the whole customer and their needs at the time of contact based on what is happening with their life. The sorts of life events that Centrelink have been looking at as part of the one main contact model include things like looking for a job, planning retirement or needing help after someone in their family has died. This model will provide a wider range of access also using more electronic service delivery—expert systems to support the staff—in turn providing better service to customers.
I do want to go back to the provision of rural call centres because a recognition of the support that this government has provided to customers in rural and regional Australia is distinctly lacking in the offerings from the other side. The minister announced the establishment of a new network of rural call centres in late 1998. The first two locations announced were Maryborough in Queensland and Port Augusta in South Australia. A further three locations are to be identified and announced in a short period of time. They will all be regionally based. They will be staffed by locals. They will be highly visible in communities, which is the key to the Australian society and economy.
There is a carefully planned aim to have the locations and catchment areas spread across time zones to allow rural customers greater access outside standard business hours. It is not that easy to phone between 9 and 5. We are going to try to address that very problem. In putting that policy and approach together, Centrelink actively sought the views of customers in rural and regional Australia and, as a result, regard the provision of those services as a key priority, in turn reflecting the view of the government that rural and regional Australia is critical to this nation.
Finally, in addressing the issue of whether Centrelink is failing to provide adequate levels of service, as is alleged by those opposite, I do want to briefly look at some statistical comparisons. Let us look at call centres. In 1994-95 call centres dealt with 11.6 million calls annually. In the last financial year, in 1997-98, they dealt with 19.2 million calls. In 1994-95 call centres handled 
 an average of 223,000 calls weekly. In 1997-98 they handled over 403,000 calls. In 1994-95 they had 1,377 full-time equivalent staff. In the last financial year that number had reached 2,980.
Some would say the numbers speak for themselves. I think the numbers speak volumes about the commitment of this government to ensuring that Centrelink is an efficient service delivery organisation, that this government is addressing the needs of customers as they are reported to the government through extensive customer surveys and that Centrelink itself has one main priority, and that is supporting and serving those customers who need assistance most.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Centrelink: Service Levels</title>,Matters of Urgency,6,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-03-09,"—The Senate this afternoon is examining the issue of the adequacy of the levels of service provided by Centrelink and whether or not the matter is urgent. The government may not think it is urgent, and they can quote all the figures they like—numbers of calls, dollars, staff numbers, et cetera—but it is pretty clear that, in effect, it all boils down to the adequacy of the service.
All of us know that this has been an ongoing problem for a number of years—indeed, from before the creation of Centrelink. The telephone call service is completely inadequate. All of us would have had many calls from the public over many years, I am sure, expressing their irritation about the difficulty of getting through and the inadequacy of the advice. They have all been well documented, and the fact that it has not been addressed over such a long period of time highlights why this is an urgent issue.
Centrelink serves over six million Australians, including many of the most vulnerable people in our society. At the moment, in terms of the focus of a lot of Centrelink's activities, their prioritisation is economic efficiency over and above their levels of service, and Australians are clearly suffering as a consequence.
It is worth emphasising the point the minister raised in question time today, and it is a point I would agree with—that is, the problem particularly relating to the Centrelink call service goes back many years to when it 
 was originally established under the old Department of Social Security by the previous Labor government. Complaints about the inadequacy of that service and the difficulty in getting through go back years, go back to when Labor was in office. It is an ongoing problem, and it shows the whole problem that has eventuated from shifting away from that direct personal service to using a new method of telephone communication, dressing it up as better customer contact, basically to try to save some money.
As I have mentioned a few times before in this place, I previously worked for the Department of Social Security as it then was. There is absolutely no doubt that it is enormously beneficial both for the staff and for the clientele, or customer as they are called these days, to have continuity, to have a direct personal contact—somebody who actually knows their personal situation and who does not just see them as being represented by a few sparse details on a computer screen or a few ticks in boxes on a form.
They are real people with individual circumstances and situations. If every time they try to contact Centrelink—assuming they can get through—they get a different person who does not know anything about their situation, they have to go over their circumstances again. Those sorts of problems inevitably lead to inadequate service, unnecessary frustration, unnecessary delay and the extra use of Australian people's time—client time, customer time and also staff time.
As has been well debated and well highlighted lately, the government has imposed an efficiency dividend upon Centrelink to force it to become so-called efficient. They are not talking about more effective services but about saving money. In fact, the special efficiency dividend of 2½ per cent, not applicable to other departments, has been added to the standard annual efficiency dividend of one per cent. The special efficiency dividend has resulted in $38.2 million being returned to the government in the last financial year. It will continue to be applied and, of course, will result in the loss of thousands of Centrelink jobs.
Clearly, all of us know that the service levels are inadequate at the moment, despite the best efforts of the existing staff. At the end of the day, it comes down to the number of people you have trying to assist the unemployed, pensioners, family payment recipients, et cetera. It might be that the department is so-called more efficient—it has lots of nice logos, good corporate marketing, et cetera—but that is of little comfort, I am sure, to unemployed people who are just trying to get a basic service and who are being told that not enough people are employed there to service those who are out of work, on the pension, or whatever the case may be. Over the coming year, Centrelink anticipates substantial reductions in its funding from its client department, so it is likely to have a funding drop of hundreds of millions of dollars over the next three years. Again, that is clearly going to affect the appropriate level of service.
It is worth having a look at the business plan which Centrelink announced last year and which identified three stages of development for Centrelink. One of them related to electronic service delivery and how that is to be achieved in the absence of permanent in-house technology staff now that that has been outsourced; and how that is going to be maintained in light of Centrelink's difficulties in keeping its computer systems from crashing and its phone lines open is not made clear in the business plan. At least humans do not crash, not unless they are under the kind of strain that many Centrelink staff are. They have to cope with these cuts on a daily basis and they face further heavy job losses.
Another stage of the Centrelink business plan related to establishing `a new identity with a strong emphasis on customer service'. Yet, in its first year of operation, Centrelink has experienced difficulties in delivering effective customer services to the extent that it has had the highest number of complaints to the Commonwealth Ombudsman out of all government agencies. Of course, that relates particularly to the issue that many people point to in relation to the call service, the teleservice. It is not just people complaining about not being able to get through; it is 
 people complaining about the adequacy or the correctness of the advice they get when they finally do get through.
Again, this has to come back to the strain and the load that the staff are under—the inadequacy of resources provided to them, including particular training in relation to all the areas that they have to have expertise in, and the ongoing complexity of the Social Security Act and other acts that Centrelink has responsibility for, and changes are almost being made daily to all that legislation. How anybody—let alone people at the end of the telephone and the public—is supposed to keep up with it is beyond me. How are the public supposed to know what their rights and responsibilities are? It is hard to see, and one can hardly expect that anything is going to be done to improve that situation when resources are going to be further cut.
The other stage of the business plan related to consolidation. However, consolidation does not mean examining and fixing problems of underresourcing and, therefore, fixing service delivery deficiencies; rather, it is another word for further resource cuts. The stated aim of the organisation during this stage of its business plan is to become a more efficient and competitive organisation, to reduce overheads and costs, to stay in business; it is not to serve the needs of its clients or improve the level of service delivery. That is not the major focus.
You then reach the situation where the organisation—no doubt almost unavoidably because of the way it has been structured and set up and the goals and requirements it is required to meet—has to focus on overheads and costs, on staying in business and on being efficient and competitive, rather than the adequacy of the service it provides to millions of Australians, many of whom are in desperate circumstances and need urgent, immediate and correct information about where they can get assistance. To not be able to get through and get assistance or to get incorrect assistance is clearly not only bad news, frustrating and inappropriate for those people; it is socially and economically inefficient.
In the interest of saving a few bucks from an organisational perspective, that creates 
 broader social problems for the rest of the community as well as for the people directly affected. Often times, you will find a greater amount has to be spent down the track by all sorts of other agencies to address those issues of poverty and disadvantage that could have been fixed if people got prompt, speedy, adequate and appropriate assistance when they needed it. That probably does not bother Centrelink in a sense, because they are focused on their own overheads and costs. Those other ongoing broader social and economic costs that develop as a result of not having a stitch in time when the need first arises are shared amongst all sorts of other departments, federal, state and local government agencies and non-government agencies. It is a cost shifting exercise that does not impact on Centrelink's own bottom line, so it is not a matter of concern to them.
The Democrats believe that this is clearly an urgent matter and is of great concern to many, many Australians. It is a problem that has been around for many years. Both this government and the previous Labor government have not done enough to address this basic need, the most basic aspect—the first level of contact for people who are often facing the most difficult aspect of their lives.

"Crowley, Sen Rosemary",ALP,1999-03-09,"—I rise to speak to this matter of urgency—that is:
The failure of the Government to ensure Centrelink provides adequate levels of public service to the millions of Australians who rely on Commonwealth income support payments.
That is payments of whatever sort. It is certainly important that we have the opportunity to remind the Senate as well as the community—who have been telling us, actually—just how important this matter is. Some of my Liberal colleagues across the chamber have been jeering that this is just a front for the unions who want us to come in here and say whatever the unions want us to say and that there really is not a major problem out there at all. It is not a Labor Party front, and it is not a union front. It is actually thousands of constituents who are regularly 
 writing to us, and I have two letters here which I will quote from.
If the government has not got the message yet that Centrelink is in major trouble, then it is being as blind and obstructionist to this as it was to the Job Network. It took a new government and a new minister to finally admit how wrong you were on Job Network. When are you going to admit that a disaster is in the making with Centrelink? It is a disaster, because something like six million to seven million Australians are outraged at the way they are being treated through the insufficient funding and staffing of this program.
I have a letter here from a constituent in Hackham West in South Australia. I do not wish to give this person's name, but the letter states:
Dear Senator Crowley,
My wife is on the age pension . . . My concern arises from the situation where my wife has to inform Centrelink of her intention to travel overseas, even if, as in this case, only for four weeks holiday. You might rightly ask what is the problem? Well, when we tried to contact Centrelink by telephone, we were advised (by a machine) that there was up to a 20 minute wait! So we decided to visit the local offices, only to find that it was very busy with the unemployed, et cetera, so we left it and I decided to advise them by letter and await a certificate for travel.
His letter goes on, but that is not me or the PSU or any other stoolie for government making up this story. This is one of the hundreds of letters from constituents.
Here is another letter from a gentleman in Bowden in my own state again. His concern is how he can assist his elderly parents find nursing home accommodation—not an unusual situation for some families. His letter states:
The problem is it is almost impossible to get anyone at Centrelink on the telephone. No matter what time of the working day I have rung, I have always met with the engaged signal. I even once rang the Department of Aged Services in Canberra and spoke to someone there who was very helpful who offered to transfer me to Centrelink via their direct telephone so I could get the information I sought. A similar result. After over five minutes of the engaged tone, I admitted defeat and hung up.
In the next paragraph, he said that he never did bother to finalise it in terms of his father's 
 arrangements because there was no absolute requirement. He was just defeated. But in the situation of his mother:
I was asked by the nursing home to check with Centrelink to find why they had not been notified as to what fees they could charge her. I tried five times that day, on the 11th February 1999, at various times to reach Centrelink, only to be met with an engaged tone each time.
He went on to say:
I am employed full time, which means waiting over five minutes is very inconvenient and extremely wasteful of my time. However, the nursing home was waiting for a reply. The relevant forms had been sent in some months before. On Friday 12th February 1999, I sat down and phoned, prepared to wait until I actually got to speak to someone. After over six minutes of the engaged signal, I joined part of the queue and listened to four tunes of music interspersed with recorded messages thanking me for my patience, which was wearing very thin. After over 20 minutes, I actually got to speak to an operator who answered my query promptly. The system at Centrelink was at fault, having recorded my mother's position wrongly.
He said he found the advice very helpful when he finally got to it. He continued:
When I asked though why it had taken so long to speak to anyone, I was told, `This is the norm due to lack of staff and to the increased demand.'
Why would you say there is no problem when letter after letter records the same problem? By way of defence, Senator Marise Payne said, `Let me tell you how many calls we take.' That is very good news, but it will not do at all if four times as many people are not getting their calls answered as those who are getting their calls answered. We do not really want to know the good news if it is not telling us the truth—that is, the full truth—and that is the bad news as well.
When the Labor government was in office, we often had to listen to criticisms from the then coalition opposition about the problems with the telecall system in Social Security—and there were some. It is better to admit to those problems and try to address them than to say, `Rubbish, go away, we are fine.' Everybody knows that there is a major problem out there with Centrelink. It is not going to be solved by significantly cutting the money to Centrelink and slashing the number of staff.
 From 18 January to 5 February in 1998, Centrelink failed to answer—people received an engaged signal—81.5 per cent of calls. It was not a one-off, caused by early year peak loads. We know that the system is gridlocked. The government is planning to cut $154 million from it and to take a further 5,000 staff out of the system. It is a disaster that the government refuses to acknowledge. We have a minister saying anything you like—from, `We are answering more calls than ever before,' through to, `It is just the Labor Party telling bad news stories.' That is not the case. There is an urgent need out there for something to be done to address the difficulties confronting Centrelink. The problem will not be solved by cutting staff numbers and by cutting the money.
Senator Payne said that there will soon be one person designated to look after a particular client—indeed, a lot of clients would like that—but she also points out that it will not be operative until 2000. One worries about how it will be operative, given that we are supposed to have a system that is operating now and it is not. It is a major concern, an urgent matter, particularly as colleagues opposite want to say how important it is that we meet the needs of people, that we try to assist those who are struggling to get a modest income that is right and on time.
People are ringing up because we have encouraged them to do that. We have encouraged them to make sure that they have it right. We have said, `If you have any difficulties, please ring.' It is an absolute insult—to say nothing of it being a great unkindness and inhospitable—to say to people, `Please ring but there won't be a telephone able to be answered.' People are being driven to absolute frustration about these waiting times. It is a matter of considerable urgency.
I am terribly interested in why the government are so defensive about this matter. It reminds me, as I said before, of their approach to Job Network. The more they insisted there was no problem, the more the community laughed at them. The community is laughing—except that it may be crying right now because it knows.
Often colleagues opposite use the line, `How long is it since you have rung?' Like everybody in this place, I can say that I have rung Centrelink. I have to report that my shortest wait was a mere 20 minutes, which I think is the sort of time that most citizens report. For many people—like those whose letters I have read—it is not a reasonable expectation for people in the work force to have to wait that long to get through. It is a system that is completely ruined, it is not operating, and it is not good enough.
I cannot understand why Senator Knowles keeps insisting that it is okay. The problem is that the government seems to be unaware that it matters a whole lot, because the citizens know. I have people in the community ringing up or writing to me saying that they have these massive waits. I do not have to convince the community, but I do need to remind the community that the problem belongs to this government. It belongs to this minister, Senator Newman, and it belongs to this Prime Minister, Mr Howard. They are the ones who say one thing out of one side of their mouths and who reduce the services out of the other—they prefer to cut the staff, to cut the money and to cut the services. Why is that? So that out of that budget surplus they can give tax cuts to the top end of town.

"Knowles, Sen Susan",LP,1999-03-09,"—The scaremongering of the Labor Party really does know no bounds. Since they have been in opposition they have terrified the aged, they have terrified the ill, they have terrified those using child care, they have terrified the unemployed and they are now setting about terrifying those who need the services of Centrelink. It really is quite disgraceful and quite despicable.
I say those things against a backdrop where a government—the Howard government—has had to be the one to increase expenditure in all of those areas. It is the Howard government that has increased expenditure in aged care; it is the Howard government that has increased expenditure in health; it is the Howard government that has reduced unemployment from the million people who were unemployed under Labor; and it is the How 
 ard government that has taken on the role and the responsibility to help those who are least able to help themselves—through Centrelink.
 It is interesting that Senator Crowley only attacks those who are delivering the services. The Labor Party are now using an interesting tactic in that they keep on attacking the public servants. Senator Crowley said that the members of the CPSU, the public servants union, are government stoolies. If I were a public servant, I would be deeply offended by that.
Why do those opposite now hate public servants? I think it is just beyond the pale that, with 99.9 per cent of public servants being totally apolitical in the execution of their jobs, those opposite are getting down to this base political attack—attacking the person, attacking those who are delivering the services.
Senator Crowley, who has not bothered to stay around to hear this response, talked about lack of staff. She knows full well that it has been the Howard government that has increased staff numbers. She talked of there being a further 5,000 jobs to go. She also knows full well that that is not true. That has been the subject of a previous urgency motion or matter of public importance raised by those opposite in this very place—and she knows that not to be true.
But that does not stop Senator Crowley coming in here and repeating that over and over again. The same is done with issues relating to the aged, the infirm and everyone else. Repeat that it is bad and it will get legs and will never ever stop. She also said that she did not want to know the good news. Of course she does not want to know the good news. Unfortunately, that is the one thing she has in common with Senator Bartlett's contribution. Senator Bartlett said, `Don't worry about the facts.' For Senator Bartlett to say that in this place I think is a sad reflection—don't worry about the increases in staff, don't worry about the increases in calls taken, don't worry about the increases in services provided; just knock Centrelink for the sake of it.
Senator Bartlett talked about Centrelink being the recipient of the highest number of calls to the Ombudsman, but he did not bother to add that Centrelink, since 1997-98, 
 has had a reduction of 11 percent in the number of complaints to the Ombudsman. It is a matter of misrepresentation. It does not matter what it is about. It does not matter whether it is about tax. It is just knock, knock, knock and oppose.
I am reminded of a comment that Senator Evans—the proposer of this motion today—made at a committee hearing in Sydney only a few weeks ago. He told a witness, `Just a bit of advice for the lot of you concerned about the complexity: just oppose a GST on everything; I find that the easiest way.' That is the philosophy: oppose everything that the Howard government does; do not try to do anything in a bipartisan way for the future of this country.
This motion is totally without foundation. One only need look at the hard data which supports what the government has done to improve service levels for the clients of Centrelink, and Senator Payne went through that extensively. Despite inheriting a social security system which mystified even the Labor government and its cabinet ministers, the coalition government has sought to bring into line government assistance to the benefit of everyone in the community and not simply play around with it in the way the Labor Party did for 13 long years.
The coalition government has put into place real reforms for service delivery and complaints handling procedures which go way beyond whatever Labor conceived, to say nothing of whatever it did. Yet those opposite have the temerity to come in here and knock, knock, knock. Making the most of technology, Centrelink, as I have said, has been able to reduce the total number of complaints recorded by the Commonwealth Ombudsman by 11 per cent. It has met or exceeded performance indicators for timeliness of handling calls and achieved 98 per cent performance on accuracy of decisions for customer claims.
Yet this mob opposite are prepared to come in and complain and grizzle. When are they ever going to say, `Let us put the future of this country first; let us look at something in a bipartisan way and try to get the best results'? When are they ever going to congratulate those workers who are delivering the 
 increased performances? Furthermore, as Senator Payne highlighted, rural Australians are now assisted far and beyond whatever was done for them when the Labor government was in office—yet now, as members of the opposition, they will not give any credit for that.
Now there is the use of videoconferencing for rural Australians, Internet kiosks and an additional 74 new Centrelink agents on top of the 180 existing already in these areas. Why didn't the Labor government do this? And why don't those opposite now agree that that is a desirable outcome? How can more call centres—22 now compared with 17 in 1995-96 under Labor—and more operators—3,000 compared with 1,449 in 1995-96 under Labor—be a reduction in service? It is simply mathematically impossible and illogical.
But I think the key to this greatly improved approach to service is exemplified by the move to personalised services, and Senator Payne has gone through many of those. Those customers for the first time will have one contact to deal with their issues, and that is desirable. Previously, they were shipped all over the place and had nobody with whom to make contact on a regular basis. Decisions will be made on the basis of individual client need and life circumstances—and not according to some Labor Party edict.
I think it is about time that this Labor opposition actually put its nose to the grindstone and came up with some policies of its own, instead of simply knock, knock, knocking every single, solitary initiative that this government has delivered and every single, solitary improvement to a system that they allowed to degenerate.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Centrelink: Service Levels</title>,Matters of Urgency,6,1
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,1999-03-09,"—I rise to support the motion of Senator Evans, being the failure of the government to ensure that Centrelink provides adequate levels of public service to the millions of Australians who rely on Commonwealth income support payments. It would be easy to go through the long litany of problems that this government has created in terms of its administrative bungles when it comes to the question of social security and income support payments, 
 be they in the social security area itself or in the student services area.
But it is not the hardworking staff of government departments—who have been attacked so viciously by this government in terms of their wages and conditions and have been subject to massive lay-offs and downsizing of department structures—who ought be held responsible for that. What ought be said is that, clearly, this is a responsibility of the government, and the problems of this Centrelink service ought be laid directly at the government's feet.
We must clearly identify that this is a government that have a long history of abuse when it comes to the question of payments to low income people in this country. They have made political careers out of seeking to demonise people on social security benefits. They have sought to appeal to the lowest and the most base motives of the Australian community in their claims about dole bludging and income receipt from various corners. However, the facts do not support the propaganda efforts by this government to demonise people on social security.
In 1996 the government under Minister Newman said that she was going to operate a dob in a dole bludger hotline. What she established was that various articles across the country were planted in such a way as to highlight people hanging over the back fence and sole parents being spied upon. There was a whole series of claims made about the way in which it was alleged the social security system was being defrauded on a widespread basis. What we established after we examined the operations of this so-called dob in a dole bludger hotline was that four out of five claims made by anonymous callers turned out to be totally without foundation. They were totally baseless, and the department has acknowledged that.
In August 1996 the government through the Treasurer announced that it was seeking a crackdown on social security fraud. We have heard this minister on numerous occasions in a sanctimonious and supercilious manner suggest that this government is not interested in paying people who are greedy but not needy. This is a government full of ministers 
 who are up to their noses in the trough in terms of ripping off the taxation system through their share registers, their use of trusts and various other mechanisms to enrich themselves. We have seen a government which has had casualty after casualty on the question of enriching themselves through the share market, totally inconsistent with their responsibilities to administer the Crown, the responsibilities of government.
In the student area, claims were made by Minister Vanstone who, among many others, has joined in this crusade against people on low incomes. Do you remember the so-called Wright family? I remember the most infamous of press releases put out by Senator Jeannie Ferris who said that there were millionaires on government welfare benefits. We discovered that there was nothing of the sort. We established that it was a fabrication. The department had created a situation under the direction of the government that they were seeking to fabricate the suggestion that there were 5,000 millionaires rorting Austudy.
We have seen a similar pattern emerge when it came to the government's claims before the election, using quite extensive advertisements in the press under public funding, to claim that the government was going to save $46 million per week by fraud detection—quite a blatant attack upon people on social security benefits. The truth is that we found out there were hundreds of thousands of Australians who had been overpaid and that actions by the government itself in making mistakes accounted for most of the moneys that the government was now trying to identify as fraud. The great fraud that has existed in this country has been the government. The fraud that it has tried to perpetrate has been on the claims that it has made about the issue of people abusing social security. The fraud has been on the Australian people by this government seeking to misuse statistics, misuse the Public Service for quite clearly partisan political ends.

"Eggleston, Sen Alan",LP,1999-03-09,"—What this motion is really about is nothing less than a full frontal attack on the social security policies of the Howard government. We have heard a litany of attacks from 
 Senators Evans, Crowley and Carr who seem to think that the policies of this government, which have been very positive and progressive, leave something to be desired when compared with Labor's record.
Let us have a look at what Labor's record was. Under Labor, Australia's social security system was left in a mess. Some $1.5 billion a year was being wasted in payments to people who were not entitled to benefits. Under Labor, the unemployed could get the dole without looking for work or putting anything back into the community.
—That is a lie.
—That is not a lie. We introduced the Work for the Dole scheme.
—Senator Eggleston, could you please resume your seat for one moment. Senator Forshaw, firstly, you are interjecting out of your seat. Secondly, I call you to withdraw that interjection.
—I will withdraw, but I did not refer to the speaker as a liar. I said that that was a lie.
—As I said, under Labor, the unemployed could get the dole without looking for work or putting anything back into the community. The social security system under Labor was too complex, making it very difficult for ordinary citizens to even begin to understand their entitlements.
What the coalition government has done since it came into office, just a bare three years ago, is that it has set about cleaning up the mess left after 13 years of Labor. Labor has opposed the coalition's efforts to improve the social security system every step of the way. Labor has criticised the coalition's efforts to stamp down on fraud. Labor has criticised the migrant waiting period. Labor criticised the job seeker diary program and, most importantly, as Senator Forshaw has just demonstrated, Labor has criticised the Work for the Dole scheme.
Let us have a look at some of the achievements of the Howard government in social security policy. First of all, the Howard government attacked social security fraud and non-compliance, resulting in savings of $46 
 million a week on future outlays and in 570,000 social security cheats being caught. These are people whom Labor was quite happy to let milk the system while people who really needed social security support were denied benefits. The coalition has introduced the family tax payment, covering 976,659 children in low income families. The coalition has implemented a waiting period before migrants can receive social security. Migrants now have to wait two years before accessing welfare payments, except family allowance and Medicare.
The coalition has been the first government to guarantee by law that pensions will be maintained at 25 per cent of total male average weekly earnings. The coalition has extended the eligibility for pharmaceutical benefits and replaced unemployment benefits and Austudy with a single youth allowance. The coalition has developed a package of measures to improve the position of carers. The coalition has reformed the child support system and given older people the chance to work past the previous retirement age of 65. The coalition has tightened the activity test requirements for job seekers and eased the social security assets test, making it easier for older low income farmers to receive the age pension.
And, most importantly, to make the whole social security system more efficient and more easy to access, the coalition established Centrelink as a one-stop shop to provide government assistance programs from under the one roof—and that includes social security, employment assistance and child-care assistance.
Centrelink's phone system means that people all over the country can access the social security system in an easy and quicker way. Perhaps through this phone system and the use of a modern computerised system there have been some teething troubles, but the teething troubles are just an indication of the popularity and success of the system. It shows that the system is working well and the government is working to improve the services provided.
Let us just have look at some of those improvements, which both Senator Knowles 
 and Senator Payne have gone through to some extent. There are more places for customers to do business. Services are now provided in over 1,000 locations, including the recent establishment of 70 new agents to add to the 180 already working in rural and remote Australia. The use of technology such as video conferencing, electronic kiosks, fax and personal computer access means that people have better access to the social security system than they ever did before.
We had Senator Bartlett a little while ago—he has now returned to the chamber—wanting to go back to the pre computer days when you walked into a centre and were dealt with by an officer behind the counter. That was fine, but the officer behind the counter did not have access to the broad range of services which under the modern system somebody accessing the computer can provide simply by tapping on the console. They bring up the client's or customer's history. Most importantly, today Centrelink is moving to a new service model which means that instead of a client having to say what they want the officer asks some questions about their life events and offers them a package of social security benefits tailored to whatever their problem is. That is an extraordinary improvement because it puts the emphasis on the officer rather than the client. (Time expired)

—What about your wig and gown?
—My wig and gown have been left off too. Mr Acting Deputy President, I thank the Senate for the courtesy of ensuring that I can continue my remarks on the Judiciary Amendment Bill 1998 .
I want to say some things about the separation of the Australian Government Solicitor, which will be in a new situation to that which it previously occupied. We used talk about the Australian Government Solicitor as being part of the Attorney-General's Department. It is now the intention of the government to set this body apart, to some extent at least, to put it on a professional basis and to make it comparable to a private firm of solicitors.
This is another example of where this government declares a principle but takes that principle only a certain way. If the Australian Government Solicitor is going to be put on the same basis as a private firm, does that mean that the people within the Australian Government Solicitor will be paid on the same basis as members of a private firm? 
 Will the good people now sitting in the advisers' box be rewarded with pay commensurate with a senior partner in a big firm? Will they be given a car and trips to conventions overseas? In other words, will they be treated on the basis that the second reading speech sets out—that the Australian Government Solicitor is now going to be treated as a firm? The probable answer to that is no, they will not be. So we will be asking the Australian Government Solicitor to do all the work expected of people in the private firms but to be rewarded on a different basis. They will be expected to work long hours—they already do work long hours—but they will be rewarded differently.
We cannot go on changing the way government services are delivered by setting out in legislation and in second reading speeches that a particular section of the government will now be set up like a firm in the private sector and then use that proposition to get more work from those people, get those people to work harder, but not reward them as they would be rewarded were they in the private sector. The other interesting thing is that the private sector is taking people from the Australian Government Solicitor and the Attorney-General's office more and more and rewarding them very generously, as they should be rewarded. Some of the best legal minds in the private sector originally came from the Australian Government Solicitor. Fortunately, there are still great minds in that department, but it must tax the patience of the people in the department to be treated the way they have been.
This legislation, in separating out the Australian Government Solicitor from the department and making it, as it were, a private firm, is saying that the principles that operate in the private firms ought to operate in the Australian Government Solicitor. There are some very fine solicitors in private firms. In fact I am tempted to name some of them, but that would be advertising on a broadcast day.
Over the years I have known people from the Australian Government Solicitor who are dedicated to giving public service. In other words, there are people who go through law 
 school and go into the Public Service who want to do just that—to give public service. They are interested in the sort of work they do, whether it be the development of policy in the criminal area or doing constitutional cases or doing work on the international stage or developing principles set out in conventions such as the Convention on the Rights of the Child or those conventions dealing with political freedoms and so on. I think that is an approach that ought to be encouraged. In private firms there are people who want to serve their clients as best they can and with all the ability they have. They also want to make a profit from the fees that they raise, as they are entitled to.
Both those approaches—the approach taken by those who go into the Public Service, into the Attorney-General's Department, and the approach taken by those who go into private firms—are very honourable and are to be commended. But there is an important difference and one which should be preserved. The two groups of lawyers, if you like, are after two different objectives. The group in the department is interested in serving the public in a wide sense, as I said, in developing public policy and in seeing that the law, which is the underpinning of our society, is as good as it can be, and in seeing that the overarching rule of law under which we live is preserved and kept in all its integrity. That is a noble ambition. It is one that this bill, because of the principles behind it, attacks and puts at risk. I think that is a great shame.
The Attorney-General's legal directions should be subject to disallowance by this Senate. They should be subject to supervision by this Senate and, as the law now stands, they are not. That could easily be cured, and it should be. That is the first proposition I make.
Secondly, and more importantly, this bill—it is really a bill that deals with structures, with the way departments are set up—does rest on very important principles that we should not let go through without some opposition. It is symbolic, I think, of a lot of the problems that occur in the Public Service now where the whole flavour, the whole philosophy, the whole culture of the Public 
 Service is under attack. The great traditions that the Public Service has of giving generous service to the public, of looking to the good of the community, are put at too great a risk.",SENATE,<title>JUDICIARY AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,13,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-03-09,"—The bill we are debating today is the Judiciary Amendment Bill 1998 , which has been reintroduced after having lapsed due to the federal election last October and which has been examined in depth by my Democrat colleague Senator Stott Despoja. My comments today are also on behalf of her and the Democrats as a whole. The Democrats as a party have been consistently opposed to economic rationalism. We view this bill with continuing suspicion. The Democrats have opposed, and will continue to oppose, privatisation unless it can be manifestly shown in a public inquiry that there is a clear public benefit in that process. Competition for competition's sake does not justify a divestment of public assets or a loss of public control over those assets. We believe the Australian Government Solicitor is just such an asset. The continuing high quality of legal advice and scholarship is something to be applauded.
At its core this bill seeks to establish the Australian Government Solicitor as a statutory authority separate from the Attorney-General's Department and sets out the constitution, functions and powers of the AGS, including the persons and bodies for whom the AGS may provide. In essence, the Australian Government Solicitor will now function as a statutory body rather than an arm of the department of the Attorney-General. While this process is not privatisation, it is certainly a form of corporatisation. It forms a move away from the direction of ensuring adequate public control of public institutions. The Australian Democrats continue to support a vibrant public sector and will continue to oppose the mean-spirited view that the public sector is inherently bad, a view frequently espoused by the proponents of competition policy and privatisation reforms.
However, we cannot ignore or hide from what has happened over the last few years in what was previously a very vibrant public sector, and this bill has to be considered in 
 this context. In the last five years over 200,000 public sector jobs have disappeared as funding for many core services has dried up. Instead of slowing, the winding back of the public sector looks set to continue as competition policy, contracting out, corporatisation and privatisation move further into top gear. That means more job losses, lower levels of services, especially in regional areas, higher prices for many services and the potential reduction in the public and parliamentary oversight of what were previously publicly controlled resources.
In the Senate the Democrats have provided, and will continue to provide, a strong voice as the defenders of a legitimate and valid role for the public sector. We will continue to demand a proper justification for what are essentially ideologically driven reforms and insist that the interests of the community and the public must be made paramount.
The Democrats oppose the contracting out of essential government services where this will lead to less accountability, higher costs to the public or a lowering of standards and access. We are concerned that that may be the case in the circumstances we are discussing in this legislation. We will also continue to defend the independence of the Public Service and oppose efforts to politicise the Public Service through short-term contract employment or linking salary to the achievement of government objectives. The Democrats have frequently expressed our deep regret and strong concern at the massive run-down of Australia's public sector infrastructure, funding for which is now at a 40-year low.
We have also repeatedly expressed our support for a strong accountability regime for public sector service delivery including performance standards, a liberal freedom of information regime without ministerial intervention and ready access to the ombudsman scheme. This regime should also apply to corporatised and contracted out public services. We will seek to ensure that those principles apply as much as possible to public services even when they have been corporatised and contracted out because we believe they are fundamental principles. That is the reason that the Democrats as a party have 
 spoken strongly in defence of a legitimate and valid role for the public sector. We believe that the office of the Australian Government Solicitor is one that does have a valuable and important public role.
In the first part of his speech last night, Senator Cooney alluded to the AGS being a place of excellence. I would like to add my support to the comments he made. In the past—and I expect it will be in the future—the Australian Government Solicitor has been a centre of legal excellence. Some of our brightest legal public servants have served within this institution. There is, in the view of the Democrats, no demonstrated imperative to alter the present mix.
In his second reading speech some time back now, the Attorney-General said:
The reforms will contribute to the delivery of more efficient and effective legal service to the Commonwealth.
I must say that the Australian Democrats remain to be convinced about that assertion. Competition does not necessarily mean efficiency. On that point, I must question what exactly the Attorney means. Are we to take the Attorney to mean that the present arrangements in the AGS are lacking in that efficiency and are not effective? I find that assertion fairly difficult to accredit, given the obvious high esteem that the AGS is presently held in and the obvious heavy reliance that the Commonwealth placed on the AGS in the past and currently does and will with inevitable future litigation to which the Commonwealth is a party.
Indeed, the Attorney did make a salient point:
The AGS is not, and cannot be, the same as privately owned law firms. Its unique value to government is based on its government ownership and its expertise in delivering consistent and coordinated legal services to government clients.
The Australian Democrats could not agree more with that assertion, but as part of that we also see strong value in the AGS remaining fully within the Public Service. The Attorney suggests that there are legitimate areas of work that the AGS should be engaged in. He cites public international law matters, advice to cabinet, constitutional law 
 and matters concerning national security. The Democrats are in total agreement with that assertion. That is why if this bill passes the second reading stage the Democrats will be moving amendments that enshrine those areas of legal practice. That relates to amendments which have already been circulated in the chamber.
As my colleague Senator Andrew Murray in particular and all other Democrat senators have asserted many times in the past, parliamentary scrutiny of the executive, of the government, is essential in maintaining the health of our democratic institutions. To that end, I note with considerable interest the comments made by the Attorney regarding effective scrutiny of legal service directions that are capable of applying either generally to Commonwealth legal work or specifically to work being performed in relation to a particular matter. In a letter to the Scrutiny of Bills Committee, the Attorney noted:
The Government considers it appropriate for Legal Services Directions that are of a legislative character (these are most likely to be the Directions of general application) to be subject to Parliamentary scrutiny. When the Bill was drafted it was expected that Directions of a legislative character would be subject to Parliamentary scrutiny under the Legislative Instruments Bill. The Government remains of the view that this would be the most effective process for subjecting Directions of a legislative character to effective Parliamentary scrutiny.
The Australian Democrats are pleased to hear that, but there is something essential in the Attorney's response which has been left out, and that is that the Legislative Instruments Bill did not pass the last parliament. In fact the House of Representatives has not yet dealt with the 30 or so amendments to the bill that were made by the Senate. One of those amendments was to ensure that the Attorney-General could not, by certificate alone, determine that what would otherwise be a legislative instrument under the bill—and therefore disallowable—was not in fact a legislative instrument. Clearly if such a provision were to be enacted, then effective parliamentary scrutiny could be signed away by the stroke of a pen. So the Attorney is not really telling us the whole story in his response to the Scrutiny of Bills Committee.
I think it is worth mentioning the importance of the Scrutiny of Bills Committee, which examines legislation not on the grounds of policy but according to basic fundamental parliamentary principles and basic principles of justice. It performs a very valuable and often very underrated role in ensuring the effective law making of this parliament. It is for that reason that its deliberations and the information it provides when it does find an area of importance in the bill should be paid attention to and given proper consideration.
I have had the good fortune of being on the Senate Regulations and Ordinances Committee since the election. That committee scrutinises an enormous number of legislative instruments, of disallowable instruments. It is definitely not high profile work, it is not necessarily exciting work in many senses, but it is absolutely crucial work. Being part of that committee highlights just how huge the amount of delegated legislation has become in recent times compared with what occurred in the earlier years of this parliament since Federation. It shows how widespread the use of delegated legislation is and it shows how important it is to ensure that the sorts of things that are done through those mechanisms are subject to some form of scrutiny—a form of scrutiny that is not as adequate as the full parliamentary scrutiny which occurs with legislation, but which at least provides some opportunity for consideration of what is being done and an opportunity to pursue amendment or prevention of inappropriate things being done.
The record of that committee over many years highlights not only that it is important to scrutinise legislative instruments but also the fact that, often not for any deliberate or Machiavellian purpose but simply through drafting errors or mistakes, the instruments do not achieve what they are intended to or have unintended consequences or go beyond the reach that is suggested by them. If that occurs already in a notable number of the instruments that are provided and scrutinised by that committee, then it does give cause for concern that we are potentially leaving open another whole area where the Attorney-General can determine something not to be a 
 legislative instrument and can therefore remove it from any form of scrutiny at all. That is inappropriate not just in terms of what may be undesirable policy actions but in terms of a check and balance, a review over the basic effectiveness of what is being done.
The Democrats therefore support the position taken by the Scrutiny of Bills Committee as appeared in the Alert Digest, which states:
The committee is concerned that the process favoured by the Government for effective scrutiny of Legal Service Directions is dependent on a Bill, the Legislative Instruments Bill, which has been in existence in one form or another since 1994 but has not yet passed into law. Until the Legislative Instruments Bill is passed into law, the committee favours, at least as an interim measure, provision for Parliamentary scrutiny of these Directions in the Judiciary Amendment Bill.
The Australian Democrats support that position and we will be moving an amendment accordingly.
I am a bit perplexed at the government's position in relation to this issue, which I am sure will be outlined a bit further when the amendments come on for debate in the committee stage. One cannot assert that a raft of legal services such as national security will not be tendered out and then the government will not be prepared to put their legislation where their rhetoric is. Nor is it possible, on one hand, to claim support for parliamentary scrutiny and then, on the other hand, say, `We will have to wait for that in another bill.' It is just not a credible response.
The Senate has heard a lot in the last day or two about the concern of the Democrats, certainly about the amount of faith and trust we can put in the government's word if they guarantee that something will appear at a future date. Without revisiting debates about the youth wages legislation and guarantees about the Youth Allowance and tax packages and that sort of thing, certainly there is an increased degree of concern amongst the Democrats about how much we can be sure that what is said is going to be done will actually be done. For that reason also I think it makes it dangerous to simply rely on a bill that is yet to be passed to deal with a matter which is relevant today in the legislation that we are dealing with now.
In conclusion, I emphasise that the Democrats remain unconvinced of the imperative of this bill. We recognise the direction that many Public Service bodies have gone in in recent years and the way that this is in some ways just part of that process, and that is a direction that the Democrats have not supported. Nonetheless, that is what the government has persisted with doing. We continue to have concerns that, if this bill passes the second reading stage, amendments need to be made to ensure that accountability and transparency will be enhanced across all arms of the Public Service. Therefore, our amendments, which, as I said previously, have already been circulated, will be moved to assert that position.",SENATE,<title>JUDICIARY AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,13,1
"Vanstone, Sen Amanda",LP,1999-03-09,"—I want to thank honourable senators for their contributions. Senator Cooney and Senator Bartlett have generously issued an invitation for the delay of the passage of the Judiciary Amendment Bill 1998  until after the passage of the Legislative Instruments Bill.
I may seek some advice on whether the Legislative Instruments Bill is the most debated and most discussed bill that has ever been introduced into this parliament. It has had a very protracted debate, and an invitation to postpone this bill until that one is finalised may well be an invitation to indefinite delay. Certainly that is what appears to have happened with the Legislative Instruments Bill, regrettably. Clearly, the government would prefer to pass the Judiciary Amendment Bill and use the opportunity to return the invitation to Senator Bartlett and Senator Cooney to reconsider their position and basically pass the Legislative Instruments Bill after passing this one.
This bill gives effect to the government's decisions on implementing the report of the review of the Attorney-General's Legal Practice of March 1997—sometimes called the Logan report. The bill provides for the establishment of the Australian Government Solicitor as a statutory authority separate from the Attorney-General's Department. It gives the Attorney-General the power to issue legal services directions in relation to Commonwealth legal work. Those directions will apply 
 primarily to clients but will be capable of applying to private law firms as well as the AGS. It makes necessary transitional and consequential amendments, including in relation to the duties, rights and obligations of Attorney-General's Department lawyers. The reforms are the logical extension of the reforms to Commonwealth legal services under the previous Labor government. They give the Commonwealth agencies greater freedom of choice, ensure accountability in relation to their legal services and will enable significant savings to be achieved on expenditure on legal services.
There are two key reasons why the delivery of legal services to the Commonwealth will be improved as a result of the bill. Firstly, the position of the AGS and its staff will be protected and enhanced and, secondly, the position of the Commonwealth in receiving legal services will, similarly, be enhanced. I will deal first with the position of the AGS and its staff. The reforms will strengthen the position of the AGS and enable it to compete more effectively with the private sector. In particular, the flexibility provided in the terms and conditions on which staff are employed will enable the AGS to take action to retain and recruit excellent staff. Most importantly, the essential terms and conditions which apply to AGS officers at present will be effectively preserved following the enactment of the bill.
Terms and conditions, including ordinary leave, will be governed by certified agreements or Australian workplace agreements. APS awards will be a reference point in determining whether the agreements meet the no disadvantage test that applies under the workplace relations act. The AGS proposes to provide for existing maternity leave entitlements to be retained. It is envisaged that a regulation will be made under the Maternity Leave (Commonwealth Employees) Act 1973 to continue the entitlements provided to AGS staff. Similarly, there would be no change to long service leave arrangements as long as the Long Service Leave (Commonwealth Employees) Act continued to apply. Overall, this will enhance AGS efficiency and lead to better value for money whether legal services are 
 provided by the AGS in-house lawyers or private lawyers.
The overall quality of legal services to the Commonwealth is an important part of the Attorney-General's first law officer role. If the quality of legal services were to suffer—as Senator Bolkus seems to think they will—this first law officer role and the essential operations of government would be jeopardised. The government would not let this occur. I am quite happy to indicate to Senator Bolkus that the government will conduct an independent review of Commonwealth legal services and will take any steps necessary to ensure that Commonwealth departments and agencies have the resources to obtain appropriate legal services. We acknowledge that this is essential for the proper operation of government.
The second point made by Senator Bolkus is that the Office of Legal Services Coordination is inadequately resourced. Once again, with respect, Senator Bolkus's point is misconceived. Senator Bolkus did refer to the fact that additional resources had been made available, but he did so inadequately. He did not refer to the fact that the number of lawyers in the office had been increased from two to six, including a senior position which will be filled later this month by an experienced SES band 1 officer.
—I specifically said that. You are wrong.
—I note Senator Bolkus's interjection. If I have been incorrectly advised, I will indicate that for the record at a later point in time. It is difficult to be certain about the level of resources that will be required for this office in the future, but the expectations are that the current resources will enable it to do its job effectively.
However, the Attorney-General has already referred to the high priority he attaches to the office's function and has indicated that he will not allow its role to suffer because of any lack of resources. The Attorney-General has given an assurance that the resources allocated to the office will be kept under review. In addition, the independent review to be conducted of the cost of Commonwealth legal 
 services will also review the adequacy of the office's resources.
The third point made by Senator Bolkus was that the terms and conditions of AGS staff will not be adequately protected. Once again, Senator Bolkus is completely wrong. I am advised that the essential terms and conditions which apply to AGS officers at present will be effectively preserved following enactment of the bill. Terms and conditions, including ordinary leave, will be governed by certified agreements or Australian workplace agreements. APS awards will be a reference point in determining whether the agreements meet the no disadvantage test that applies under the workplace relations act.
Under the certified agreement which has been proposed for AGS staff, there will be an overall pay rise of at least three per cent for AGS employees. So much for any suggestion that the government or the AGS will be seeking to make its staff worse off. Similar points can be made about other terms and conditions.
The superannuation rights of existing staff who are members of the CSS or the PSS will be protected. The existing membership of current officers has been continued through regulations made in 1998 under the Superannuation Act 1976 and the Superannuation Act 1990. The AGS proposes to provide for existing maternity leave entitlements to be retained. It is envisaged that a regulation will be made under the Maternity Leave (Commonwealth Employees) Act 1973 to continue the entitlements provided to AGS staff. Similarly, there will be no change to the long service leave arrangements as the long service leave act will continue to apply.
Existing AGS staff who are employed by the new AGS will retain their mobility rights under part IV of the Public Service Act 1922. As a consequence, officers who have been transferred will have the right to apply for APS jobs as if they remained an officer of the APS. They will also have the right to apply for reappointment to the APS if their career in the AGS is adversely affected by a change in the functions of the AGS, if their employment is terminated by the AGS other than on invalidity grounds or if compassionate 
 grounds exist. This will effectively ensure that these existing AGS staff have the same rights to continued employment in the Public Service and voluntary redundancies as existing APS staff.
I turn briefly to the parliamentary scrutiny of legal services directions. During the debate Senator Cooney expressed concern that the parliamentary scrutiny of legal services directions of a legislative character proposed under the bill is not available. He refers to the recent report of the Senate Scrutiny of Bills Committee and its concern that no provision has been provided to allow for parliamentary scrutiny of the directions. I can see the point Senator Cooney was making. We are not opposed to that scrutiny taking place; however, it does remain the government's view that it would be inappropriate to pursue a fragmented approach by amending the bill to deal specifically with the parliamentary scrutiny of the directions. In our view the best way to achieve effective scrutiny of instruments of a legislative nature is by way of a suitable legislation instruments bill. This would provide a comprehensive regime for the scrutiny of those instruments, including legal services directions, that can be made under the bill.
In conclusion, there are two reasons why the delivery of legal services to the Commonwealth will be improved as a result of this bill. Firstly, as I said, the position of the AGS and its staff is protected and enhanced; and, secondly, the position of the Commonwealth in receiving legal services is enhanced. The reforms will strengthen the position of the AGS and enable it to compete more effectively with the private sector. In particular, the flexibility provided in the terms and conditions on which staff are employed will enable the AGS to take action to retain and recruit excellent staff.
The bill will operate to improve the Commonwealth's position as a purchaser of legal services. The Attorney-General will have the power to issue legal services directions under the Judiciary Amendment Bill, to set general rules and to give specific instructions on the conduct of the Commonwealth's legal affairs. At present, policies operating in this 
 area do not have this status and do not have the same extensive scope of operation as would be possible under the legal services directions.
Areas of Commonwealth legal work that are essential to the core operations of government will remain tied to government lawyers, primarily the AGS. These areas are: constitutional, cabinet, national security and public international law. This will ensure consistent coordinated advice in these key areas. In essence, this bill will lead to an improved AGS and an improved framework within which Commonwealth legal services are provided.
Question resolved in the affirmative.
Bill read a second time.",SENATE,<title>JUDICIARY AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,13,1
"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,1999-03-09,"—At the outset, Labor 
 wishes to state in clear and unequivocal terms that we oppose the full privatisation of Telstra and, as a consequence, oppose the Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill 1998 . We oppose this bill because it seeks to achieve outcomes not in the interest of Australian taxpayers. Those outcomes are, firstly, the sale of 16 per cent of Telstra immediately and, secondly, the sale of the outstanding 51 per cent of Telstra in a most shoddy and bogus manner. This aspect, in particular, Labor finds remarkable. If it were not so serious, it could almost be described as a farce—that the government could seek to dispose of $A50 billion without further parliamentary scrutiny. This package authorises the sale of the final 51 per cent of Telstra, worth somewhere between $A50 billion and $A60 billion.
Witnesses to the recent Senate inquiry into this package of bills almost universally condemned the model proposed by the government for an inquiry into the service levels of Telstra. Witnesses variously condemned the limited time frame of six months, the proposal to conduct the inquiry in secret, the fact that the public would not be asked to make submissions, the refusal of the government to release any terms of reference for the inquiry prior to Senate  consideration, the fact that the eventual terms of reference would be set by regulation, not legislation, despite repeated government denials, and the limited nature of the inquiry, in that it only addresses Telstra service levels, not the adequacy or sufficiency of competition within the telecommunications market. I can quote what was variously said by the state of Western Australia, the NFF, ATUG and Optus. The Consumers Telecommunications Network said:
. . . we view with alarm the apparent reneging on the government's commitment to ensuring there would be a public process in which there would be public access to information and the opportunity for the public to participate. As we have said in our submission, it appears to us that, despite the fact that there will be a review, that can be conducted in secret. There is no obligation on the minister to reveal the results of the review or, indeed, if the review makes a recommendation there is no obligation on the minister to follow the recommendation . . . 
The CEPU said:
The period of six months is short in the context of a decision whose impacts will be felt for generations. With Telstra management publicly and vigorously committed to full privatisation, it is hard to imagine that the company will not be able to muster the energy to jump the immediate hurdle presented to it.
The Western Australian government said:
The six months mooted in the Bill as a period under which a measured service performance would be a criterion for the government relinquishing majority ownership would not be acceptable. A period of twelve months is considered an absolute minimum.
Finally, ATUG said:
I think the Government should have confidence that past experience of an open consultative process has been very successful. Therefore it seems to us very inappropriate to do it that way (in private).
But if the disposal of $50 billion to $60 billion of taxpayers' money without parliamentary scrutiny is a disgraceful political act, equally bad are the priorities of the government. Minister Alston has made repeated references to the social bonus involved in the sale of Telstra. The minister has not been so keen to discuss the obscene amount of transaction fees proposed to be allocated to brokers and bankers.
The social bonus can be characterised as relatively modest. The Bills Digest breaks up the social bonus as follows: an additional $250 million to the Natural Heritage Trust; $70 million over five years to be expended from the rural transaction centres reserve for modern communication services in rural areas; $150 million over three years to be expended from untimed local calls access reserve to allow or improve untimed local calls access; an additional $81 million for regional communication needs over five years; and, finally, $120 million over five years to be expended from the TV fund reserved for improved ABC or SBS reception. It is a total of $671 million over five years for a series of, at best, relatively modest TV, telephony and communications service improvements. Put another way, an average of $134 million over five years is the social bonus to 18 million Australians. Put plainly, the social bonus is an average of $7.40 per year for five years for each and every Australian.
This can be compared with the fees to be paid by the Commonwealth for the sale of shares. The ALP minority report explains the fees disbursement in some detail. At page 60, it says:
The Department of Finance and Administration gave evidence to this inquiry that the current value of the Commonwealth's remaining shares in Telstra is $55.4 billion. According to the Explanatory Memorandum to the Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill 1998 , fees for the sale of these shares are expected to amount to between 1.5 and 2 per cent of sale proceeds. On this basis, the Government will pay bankers and lawyers between $800 million and $1.1 billion for the sale.
If we assume there are 1,000 or thereabouts, which is exceptionally high, persons involved in the sale of the  remainder of Telstra—lawyers, accountants, financial advisers, brokers, agents and various consultants—each will receive an average fee of between $800,000 and $1.1 million. This can only be properly characterised as obscene greed and virtual theft. It is simply outrageous.
We appear to have in this debate two sets of rules. Firstly, specific amounts are allocated to be spent over a five-year period for modest improvement in select Telecom services. We should note carefully that percentage figures are not allocated. Specific amounts are only allocated by the government. Secondly, when it comes to fees for bankers and lawyers, the fees are set at between 1½ per cent and two per cent of sale proceeds.
When the bill was tabled in the House last November, the share price of Telstra was around $6. It is currently around $9. Every time the share price goes up, bankers, lawyers and brokers cream off hundreds of millions of taxpayers' money for private gain. There is no extra work involved with the share price movement. There are no additional requirements. No extra staff are hired. No extra supporting or computing staff are necessary. It is simply a transfer of heroic proportions to a select group of professionals because there is no cap on fees or no fixed fee. Any percentage based on aggregate sale  proceeds in a booming telco, booming stock market, is simply greed and waste. Each Australian who funded the growth of Telstra receives in 
 compensation a lousy $7.40 a year for five years. To quote page 60 in conclusion on this point:
Opposition Senators condemn the Government for its pitiful attempt at bribery. The residents of rural and regional Australia, far from feeling placated by additional funding, should feel outraged that their telecommunications needs are worth less than the services supplied by the myriad of bankers and lawyers fortunate enough to be aboard the Telstra sale gravy train.
I turn now to Labor's rationale for continuing opposition to the privatisation of Telstra. It basically boils down to the reasons spelt out in the ALP minority report. Those reasons are: firstly, service levels in less profitable areas of Australia; secondly, remittances or dividends to government; thirdly, offshore remittances; fourthly, maintenance of Australia's telecommunications infrastructure; fifthly, investment by Telstra in research and development in this nation; and, finally, loss of jobs. I will address each of these points in turn.
Since the sale of the first one-third of Telstra, it is clear that service levels in the less profitable areas of Australia have declined. By keeping Telstra in public hands, the federal government will retain the right to direct Telstra to ensure that adequate service levels and access to up-to-date technology are delivered to all Australians, particularly those in remote, rural and regional Australia.
Secondly, the money that Telstra generates each year and pays to the government directly benefits taxpayers. As the level of government ownership in Telstra decreases, so does the dividend to government at the end of each financial year. By keeping Telstra in public hands, the federal government will continue to receive these funds—funds which will grow each year into the future.
Thirdly, 35 per cent of the profits of a fully privatised Telstra will go offshore. Fourthly, investment in and maintenance of Australia's national telecommunications infrastructure will decline as more of Telstra is sold. Australia's telecommunications infrastructure is too critical an element of the economic, industrial and social framework of the nation to allow any further dilution of government ownership and control.
Fifthly, levels of investment by Telstra in research and development for the public good have already begun to decline. Instead of selling Telstra, the government should be ensuring that Telstra continues to invest time, resources and expertise in the innovations and technical infrastructure necessary to take Australian industry into the new millennium.
Finally, privatisation gives rise to an environment where the emphasis is on reducing staff and staffing costs. This means fewer workers and degraded workplace conditions for those lucky enough to retain a job. Telstra has shed nearly 25 per cent of its total work force in less than two years, with further job cuts scheduled for both the current and subsequent financial years.
As more and more of Telstra is sold, the pressures on the Telstra board to make decisions based solely on economic and logistic imperatives will increase. Profit for shareholders will become the primary and, eventually, under a fully privatised Telstra, the only concern. Bitter experience since the sale of the first one-third of Telstra has shown that, as more and more of Telstra is sold, service levels will decline, particularly in rural and regional areas; investment in research and development for the national good will cease; levels of foreign ownership will increase, with more and more of Telstra's profits going overseas; more jobs will be lost in regional Australia; investment in and maintenance of the telecommunications infrastructure in rural and regional areas will decrease; and any notion that Telstra has a social—and not just a legislative—obligation to provide services to the sick, the disabled, the elderly and the isolated in the Australian community will vanish completely.
 Turning now to chapter 3 of the ALP minority report, it is clear, as the report identifies, that the current pro-competitive regulatory regime for telecommunications is still in its infancy. However, it is possible to identify failings in the regime's operation. Witnesses to the Senate hearings—industry participants as well as consumer and community organisations—repeatedly asserted there was not, as yet, a fully operative competitive environment in telecommunications in 
 Australia. Each of those groups alleged Australian consumers, particularly those in rural and regional Australia, are paying substantially more for telecommunications services than consumers in other countries—and receiving poorer services.
Recent decisions of the ACCC with respect to interconnect charges, access to the Telstra local call network and the issuing of competition notices by the ACCC with respect to customer churn are welcome developments. However, for practical effect, the cooperation of Telstra is essential. Telstra has indicated a willingness to pursue its sole interests in the strongest manner. Indeed, Telstra was the only industry participant to criticise attempts in the proposed bill to improve the current regulatory environment. Telstra said in its submission, and I quote from page 62 of the report:
Telstra continues to have concerns with the measures proposed by the Government for amendment to the Trade Practices Act—specifically, increasing the powers of the ACCC to enable it to order disclosure of Telstra's costs to its competitors. Telstra considers this is harmful to competition, because it would enable competitors to price Telstra's costs, rather than their own, which is at odds with the primary aim of the access regime which is to promote the long term interests of end users.
Various alternatives were put forward by witnesses to improve the competitive environment. Firstly, ring fencing: this requires Telstra's various entities to deal with each other at arms length. It is unsatisfactory because it is an artificial commercial device. The ALP does not believe it is warranted as yet. Secondly, cease and desist orders: various companies and parties proposed mechanisms to swiftly stop suspected breaches of anti-competitive conduct. Again, their solutions were unsatisfactory, because such orders may involve judicial action by an administrative body and hence breach the doctrine of separation of powers.
The ACCC was circumspect in its comments concerning these pro-competition reforms. Both the department and the ACCC seemed to say they had concerns about the current operation of the act and advised that the minister had requested further advice on this aspect. Accordingly, the ALP is of the 
 view there is some strength to arguments concerning anti-competitive conduct. Some of the investigatory procedures under the act simply make speedy resolution of complaints almost impossible.
Finally, turning to the issues of competitive tendering for USOs and public disclosure of USO levy cost data, the Senate committee heard a lot of evidence on both of these topics. Most of the carriers expressed an interest in being allowed to bid for the USO on a regional basis. Each of the carriers said that they could provide the service on a competitive and cost-effective basis. A range of other participants—ATUG, the NFF, the Western Australian government and the Consumers Telecommunications Network—entered some concerns, particularly regarding implementation in the event that the successful carrier should fail and withdraw from the market.
The ALP has listened to these concerns and makes two comments. Firstly, the ALP is in favour of pursuing further the notion of competitive tendering of the USO on a regional basis; and, secondly and most importantly, our support for that proposition is conditional upon Telstra remaining the only national universal service provider. In respect of disclosure of USO costs, only Telstra opposed full public disclosure because such disclosure might give competitors a commercial advantage. The ALP is of the view that, to date, there has been too much secrecy associated with USO cost calculation. This aspect needs to be reviewed.
In winding up, let me repeat four points. Firstly, the ALP totally opposes any further privatisation of Telstra, and we intend to honour to the hilt our 1998 election commitment. Secondly, the current competitive regime is clearly inadequate, and the government should be pursuing an agenda that allows for full competition. Thirdly, the ALP has made a range of practical suggestions concerning the USO competitive tendering and the operation of the customer service guarantee. Fourthly, the government attempt to establish a secret sham inquiry to sell off the outstanding 51 per cent of Telstra without further reference to parliament is a mechanism 
 to achieve a 100 per cent sale of Telstra. It is achieved by an outrageous distribution of almost $1.1 billion in fees, and it should be rejected on those grounds alone.
In conclusion, we are again debating the privatisation of Australia's largest, most profitable corporation—a corporation that was built on the labours of Australian taxpayers, both present and past. We are now debating whether or not the remaining 66.6 per cent of Telstra under full public ownership—the part of Telstra that is still owned by all Australians, regardless of their financial position or status—should be given over to the market and sold as shares, a process in which not all Australians may be able to participate.
The process of full privatisation leaves nothing for future generations of Australians who follow in our footsteps, except perhaps the right to compete in the marketplace for the opportunity to purchase a tiny part of Telstra or to be lucky enough to inherit shares. These shares are limited in number. Once sold, they leave the control of the Commonwealth and, therefore, cease to provide full benefit for all Australians.
The government has provided no new or compelling evidence that the full privatisation of Telstra will bring benefits for all Australians. The opposition remains strongly opposed to the sale of any further portion of Telstra. The opposition condemns the coalition government for its crude attempt to dupe the public and its own backbench and bypass the authority of the parliament by instituting a sham inquiry as the trigger for the disposal of the government's controlling equity in Telstra.
We have in this debate, and in the eventual vote, a clear choice between the corporation remaining 33 per cent in private hands and the corporation becoming 100 per cent in private hands. A shift to 49 per cent only—stage 1 of the two-stage process—will result at first only in partial privatisation. The board, as has already been indicated, will ignore government control, will ignore government directions and will make decisions solely on a commercial basis. So when we go from 33 to 49 per cent, the die is already cast. Any opportunity for further review, any further opportunity for restructuring by future govern 
 ment as to the nature and services provided or offered by Telstra to the marketplace, will be void and lost forever.
A vote for 16 per cent is a vote sometime in the future for the further 66 per cent. A vote for partial privatisation is a vote for the full privatisation of Telstra. This service provision is critical to all Australians. It is particularly important to those residents of rural and regional Australia. Telstra provides critical and important national infrastructure services to Australians. We should not delude ourselves that, when in due course we vote on the bill, a vote for another 16 per cent is not a vote for the entire sale of Telstra.

"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,1999-03-09,"—Mr Acting Deputy President, it is very pleasing to see you in the chair and listening to me again. What will be the implications of the privatisation of Telstra for the people of Australia? If the Senate allows this legislation to pass, we will see Telstra sold for a price far below its market value.
Telstra shares were listed on the market at $3.40 per share and are now listed at between $8.47 and $8.50—the most significant increase of all major listings on the Stock Exchange. It is not simply that the share price index has gone up since they were listed; it is that Telstra has increased much faster than the average increase in the share market index. Another way of expressing this is to say that the increase in the share price index has been dragged along by the increase in the Telstra share prices. It is one thing to say that it is impossible to predict movements in the share price index; it is another thing to witness an increase in Telstra shares which has set the trend for the index as a whole.
Since 15 November 1997, the share price has increased by $5.10 per share, an increase of 150 per cent. I will say that again: an increase of 150 per cent in the space of less than 16 months. At what point do we conclude that the shares were given away at the expense of the taxpayers of this country? The answer is: whenever the Hon. John Fahey has anything to do with a sale.
Mr Fahey has not conceded that the fire sale was a disaster. He has not acknowledged 
 that the sale price was too low. He has not acknowledged—and I am quoting at length from different pages of the Audit Office report—that `at the close of the first day of trading, Telstra instalment receipts stood at a premium of 67c, the largest initial premium of any Commonwealth public share offering'. That is in the Audit Office report at page 13. He has not accepted or acknowledged—and again I am quoting—`the trading price of Telstra instalment receipts has risen more than 160 times the increase in the Australian Stock Exchange all ordinaries index and more than 20 times the increase in the ASX's all industrial index'. That is from the Audit Office report at page 14.
At the price of $3.40 per share, the offer of one-third of Telstra's shares was more than four times subscribed. That is from the Audit Office report, page 14. The institutional offer was 6.2 times subscribed. That is from the Audit Office report, page 14. The sale costs were $35.6 million plus $4 million in reimbursed expenses. The global coordinator's project management fee comprised a base fee of $16 million and an additional success fee linked to the net present value of the proceeds received by the Commonwealth from the sale of the Telstra shares. The variable component of the fee was intended to encourage and reward the global coordinators for the achievement of increased offer proceeds. However, the benchmarks used were significantly below the September 1996 scoping study estimates of likely sale proceeds. Use of these latter benchmarks would have reduced sale costs by between $5.4 million and $10.3 million by reducing the success fee. Again, that is from the Audit Office report, page 15.
Payments made by the Office of Asset Sales and IT Outsourcing included project management fees for free shares for which the Commonwealth received no proceeds—fees of $458,492—and shares not actually sold—fees of $26,512. I will say that again: this is paying fees for shares for which there were no proceeds and shares that were not actually sold. The minister who has been party to this is sitting on the other side of the chamber, and he is silent on these issues, just like the Hon. John Fahey. He has nothing to say about 
 these issues. Where are they? They are looking after their mates in the markets. The minister has failed to deal with the criticisms outlined in the Audit Office report or to provide, more importantly, any reassurance that they will not be repeated. What is worse, they have appointed the same people to do the proposed next tranche and the one after that. We have a situation where these people who have made exorbitant fees and charges have been reappointed to finish the job.
Where is there in this legislation any sanction that ensures that there will be no repeat of the problems outlined by the Auditor-General? The Howard government is proceeding as if there was nothing untoward in the first sale and as if there is nothing further they have to do to protect the taxpayers' interests. Billions of dollars of taxpayers' funds have been lost by the first sale, and this has been confirmed by no less than the Auditor-General. The response of the Prime Minister is to put the same minister back in charge of the next sale, which is even more significant, with no safeguards or restrictions on his conduct. There will be no change to the team that ripped everybody off last time and we will see the same debacle. To let this minister loose is like allowing a child who has just given away all the goods in your shop back inside to do it again.
—He has only given away a third of the goods so far.
—I accept that interjection, Senator Quirke. It is only a third of the goods, but they are bringing them back to give away the other two-thirds. It is not theft we are witnessing; just massive incompetence by a minister who is being encouraged to do it again. On 3 March 1999 the Australian National Audit Office wrote to the Hon. Brian Gibson in his capacity as Chairman of the Finance and Public Administration Legislation Committee.
—That is the bloke they crucified.
—That is the one they crucified. I had been asking some questions of the Office of Asset Sales, and the Audit Office were so incensed by the replies I was given that they have written a three- or four- 
 page comprehensive response. It has been released today by Mr Tanner's office so that people can be absolutely clear about what the Audit Office think of what went on. They are not going to be whitewashed by the department or by the answers that I was given on the record during Senate estimates. This is the sort of thing that they had to say in these documents:
. . . the scale of the $35.6 million Project Management Fee paid by OASITO (Office of Asset Sales and IT Outsourcing) to the three Global Coordinators was unprecedented for a privatisation.
ANAO (Australian National Audit Office) examined the Project Management Fee against a number of benchmarks—
benchmarks which were comprehensive. It continues:
Previous Commonwealth public share offers, which had paid project management fees of between $1.25 million—
this is on page 38, figure 2.3 of the Audit Office's report. It further states:
The customary commercial practice in Australian global industrial offerings . . . that previous project management fees in Australian global industrial offerings have been in the range of $200,000 to $700,000 with the median being $500,000 per Global Coordinator.
Practice adopted in the United Kingdom . . . Project management fees were paid on three major offerings between 1991 and 1995, with amounts of . . . $5.6 million and $10.1 million (as per 1995 exchange rates).
Against these benchmarks, the $35.6 million Project Management Fee paid by OASITO was significantly above comparable offerings conducted in Australia and overseas . . .
I will read that again: $5.6 million and $10.1 million for comparable privatisations in the UK, considered to be the home of privatisation under Thatcher and the conservatives. What did we get for one-third of Telstra? We saw $35.6 million in fees off to their mates. No wonder the Financial Review  writes stories about it.
—Order! Senator Conroy, you have been sailing very close to the wind. I suggest you read standing order 193, which alleges improper motives. I ask you to be careful because you are sailing very close to the wind.
—I will heed your call.
—Read standing order 193.
—I will happily heed your call. I do not think I have imputed any motives to anybody. Looking after your mates is not imputing a motive.
—I have been listening very carefully, Senator Conroy. Read standing order 193.
—I appreciate your suggestion. Against these benchmarks, as I said, we paid $35.6 million. You could perhaps read my mind there, Senator Ferguson. Mr Hutchinson, who was giving evidence to me before the Senate estimates, stated—and this is in the Hansard  on page F&PA 236—that ANAO is wrong to indicate that the project management fee increased when sale proceeds increased above $8 billion. The following information was obtained from a 22 August 1997 letter signed by Mr Hutchinson and the global coordinators which clearly shows that the project management fee was set at a base of $16 million and increased as the level of proceeds received by the Commonwealth increased above $8 billion. This is a matter that we will be taking up with Mr Hutchinson, but that is what the Audit Office wrote back upon seeing Mr Hutchinson's evidence.
Legal advice obtained by ANAO from the office of the Australian Government Solicitor confirmed that the project management fee should be paid only on the proceeds actually received by the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth was not required to pay any project management fee on employee free shares, shares not sold or international underwriting discounts. Despite this, OASITO increased the project management fee paid to the global coordinators by $691,128.
You begin to think at some stage that the Telstra roadshow consisted of a whole lot of International Olympic Committee delegates from the sort of money that they were getting out of this and what it was costing the Australian taxpayer. You would think they were all on the IOC. The cost of the Telstra roadshow of $3.06 million was more than 
 eight times the cost incurred by the Commonwealth for an earlier roadshow, which was $359,000. Insufficient effort has been made by OASITO and the government to recover the amounts overpaid to the three global coordinators. The government has been incompetent in the management of the sale of Telstra to date and defrauded the taxpayer, as the Audit Office has disclosed—
—Order! Senator Conroy, you will withdraw that imputation of defrauding the taxpayer.
—I am confused—
—You will withdraw the words.
—On a point of order, Mr Acting Deputy President, just what has provoked that? Is there a point of order before the chair that we have not heard? And can you tell us on what grounds that ruling is made, please?
—There does not need to be a point of order before the chair, Senator Quirke. I warned Senator Conroy before about impugning improper motives and suggested to him that he should be very careful of what he is saying. To talk of defrauding, I think, is unparliamentary, and I suggest that it be withdrawn.
—In due deference to you, on that point of order which I have raised I do not believe that to be unparliamentary at all, so I would like you to seek advice on that please, because I do not think we are going to accept that.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, Senator Conroy a few moments ago accepted the proposition that there was not any fraud involved by saying that he attributed this action that he has obviously got himself worked up about as being incompetence. He did that for the very simple reason that he knows that he goes too far to allege anything beyond that. So what is happening now is that he is impugning the motives of all of those who are involved in this decision—`the government' can only be the ministers involved. It is an open and shut case, and 
 whether or not Senator Quirke is aware of the standing orders is irrelevant.
—Order! I ask both senators to resume their seats. I am about to rule on the point of order. Senator Conroy, I have taken advice and I am asking you to withdraw the word `defraud'.
—The problem I have in withdrawing that—if I could just explain, without being provocative—is that there is money missing that is owed to the government, and at the moment its being paid back is being investigated by the Government Solicitor.
—What entitles you to jump to the conclusion that fraud is involved?
—Order! Senator Conroy, resume your seat. To suggest that money is missing is different from suggesting that the government defrauded, and I am asking you to withdraw the word `defraud'.
—For the sake of sorting out the argument I withdraw.
—Thank you. Unreservedly you withdraw.
—I unreservedly withdraw.
—Mr Acting Deputy President—
—Have you got a point of order, Senator Quirke?
—Yes, it is a point of order. I believe that your ruling has gone too far on this point, and I again would like you to seek some advice. And, before my learned colleague over there gets up and says that I do not know the standing orders around here, I suspect that I am not Robinson Crusoe.
—Order! Senator Conroy, I am prepared to accept your withdrawal.
—Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. What all of this shows—and the sensitivity of the government and the sensitivity of the minister shows—is that they cannot be trusted to do it again. It is incomprehensible that they could ask this 
 parliament, this Senate chamber, to actually support their position when they allowed this to happen the first time and they are planning on allowing it to happen again.
Telstra is an important Australian asset with majority ownership still held by all the people of this country. The only protection they have to stop Minister Fahey repeating what he did before is to ask the Senate to stop him, and I believe this is what we should do. The implications of this sale are far greater than those of the first sale in November 1997. If this legislation is passed it will lead to the full privatisation of Telstra without reference back to the parliament.
A 100 per cent privatisation of Telstra will have significant implications for all of its customers far beyond existing practice. For example, there will be significant reductions in existing services to rural, regional and remote Australia because the existing services will be too expensive to maintain and the returns to shareholders on the assets too low. Access to up-to-date technology will simply not occur in rural, regional and remote Australia because it will be regarded as too expensive to provide and the return on new assets too low to meet the expectations of shareholders.
There will be additional charges for a range of services, as has already occurred with directory assistance calls since the partial sale of Telstra. The general level of service will diminish as priorities move from the needs of taxpayers to the demands of shareholders for higher returns. There is nothing in the legislation which protects existing levels of service or guarantees customers access to new technology.
Telstra's performance in clearing faults within one day will diminish, as is already beginning to occur since the partial privatisation. In December 1997 the percentage of faults cleared within one day was 61 per cent compared with 74 per cent in December 1996. The clearing of faults with public payphones will get worse, as has also been the case since partial privatisation. In December 1997 the percentage of faults on public payphones cleared within one day was 47 per cent compared with 67 per cent in 
 December 1996. The source for this is the Australian Communication Authority Performance Monitoring Bulletin March 1998.
The government should stand condemned for this. This minister, who has been responsible for driving this, stands condemned for it. Research and development will diminish, especially basic research. We have already seen this occur since the partial privatisation.
The legislation proposes the deletion from the Telstra Corporation Act of the capacity of the government of the day to instruct Telstra in accordance with the public interest. This power to instruct Telstra remains fundamental to ensuring that there is effective service delivery to regional Australia and that the response times of Telstra are acceptable to the community. It is now proposed that the performance criteria—which were to be inserted into the legislation—will be determined by regulation. If this remains the case, then they can be changed at the whim of the government at any time. As occurred on a previous occasion, the Senate again might not let this happen.
Sale costs or commissions from the next stage of the sale of Telstra will be $800 million to $1.1 billion. By comparison, the community dividend will be only $670 million. That is right: the dividend for the broader community is only $670 million but for all the government's mates there will be up to $1 billion in fees and commissions. It is outrageous, and the government is going to do nothing about it. So, as is the case with all the Howard initiatives, it is the fat cats who are fed first and the rest of the community receives a social bonus which, by comparison, is second-rate chook food.
What is surprising is that the National Party, who are renowned for negotiating on any matter—especially if it is a matter of principle—have sold out for a pittance. Where is Mr Katter when there is a fight to be had for regional Australia? Where is the member for Dawson, Mrs De-Anne Kelly, and her willingness to fight for the retention of public ownership of Telstra? Where is the Leader of the National Party in the Senate on the sale of Telstra, Senator Ron Boswell—known throughout Queensland on all matters of 
 principle as `Roll Over Ron'? And where are you, Senator O'Chee?
—On a point of order, Mr Acting Deputy President: the phrase that was used by Senator Conroy to refer to my colleague Senator Boswell was deliberately provocative. It is also quite unparliamentary to use epithets like that. It is contrary to the good running of the chamber. It is contrary to standing orders. It is not appropriate to refer to people with epithets and I ask for it to be withdrawn.
—I uphold the point of order. Senator Conroy, I ask you to withdraw.
—I withdraw. As I have indicated, the government is particularly sensitive and the National Party should be particularly sensitive, because that is what One Nation says to them. One Nation says, `We expect you to represent us.' That is what One Nation voters are saying. They have given up on the National Party.
Senator Alston interjecting—
—They have walked away because they have sold out. They have been rolled over by you, Senator Alston. You have been too successful.
—Order! Senator Conroy, address your remarks through the chair, please.
—I draw to your attention the interjections; but, seeing as you missed them, I am sure you will pick them up next time.
The government has an obligation to customers to demonstrate how they will be better off—that is, as opposed to being shareholders—by a privatised Telstra. The only way that the government could begin to give confidence to consumers of Telstra services is by enshrining within the legislation certain standards relating to cost and service delivery. This the government has failed to do. Everybody knows that if Telstra is privatised the Telstra Board will attempt to increase the return on shareholders' funds by reducing services, increasing service charges, delaying the repair of faults, applying pressure on government to introduce timed calls, reducing 
 the level of employment of maintenance staff, increasing rental charges, delaying and restricting the introduction of new technology, increasing charges for individual calls, STD calls, ISD calls and calls on mobile phones, reducing research and development activity and increasing directors' fees and senior management salaries to outrageous levels while cutting community benefits.
If the government is serious about protecting consumers' rights, it would incorporate within this legislation restrictions on the capacity of the board to make price increases for calls, staff reductions, increased service charges, reductions in the provision of services, increased fees for directors, increased salaries for senior managers and reduced research and development expenditure. This could be achieved by retaining the government's power to direct Telstra. It has chosen instead not to do so, which is why the Senate should reinstate this power. It could reassure Australians by refusing to sell more than 49 per cent. It has, instead, chosen not to do so and, in fact, if this bill is passed, will sell the rest of Telstra without further debate in the Senate.
Under this legislation there is no protection for customers. There is nothing to prevent a massive reduction in services and an increase in fees and charges. This is not an idle concern that I am expressing. We have watched the banking industry embark on a massive increase in shareholder funds over the past five years, financed largely by a reduction in services and an increase in fees and charges. The Howard government is now proposing that Telstra should be allowed to do the same, unfettered by government or the parliament. The consequences of this legislation, if it is allowed to pass, will be a disaster for regional Australia in the provision of telephone and telecommunications services, an increase in the cost of telephone services for every household and small business, the potential future loss of a successful and essential business owned by all Australians to foreign interests and no policy influence over the development of—(Time expired)",SENATE,<title>TELSTRA (TRANSITION TO FULL PRIVATE OWNERSHIP) BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,14,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1999-03-09,"—I rise today to speak on the 
 telecommunications legislation. The Greens (WA) have put our concerns regarding the privatisation of Telstra on the record during previous debates. The Greens (WA) are clearly opposed to the further sale of Telstra. The government cannot show that it is economically sensible to sell the taxpayers' share of Telstra and the government cannot assure access to affordable and up-to-date telecommunications for the bush; and a truly competitive telecommunications market is still, we all know, a long way away.
I would like to address some of the comments made by the government this week so far. The three main lines the government have been running in their spin are: (a) the Senate should pass the bills because the government have a mandate; (b) if the Senate does not pass the bills, the people in the bush will not get their bribes; and (c) if the Senate does not allow the sale, the mum and dad investors will lose out. Let us look at each of those.
The government is crying `mandate'—I believe that it is a very inappropriate expression in light of International Women's Day yesterday—and attempting to claim that any debate on or opposition to the sale of Telstra is an illegitimate use of the Senate's power. I must seriously question the integrity of the ethics of a government which constantly tries a political con using the rhetoric of a mandate. Quite obviously there is a whole range of reasons why people vote for a particular party in an election. Maybe they are registering a protest vote. Maybe they want to see some form of tax reform proceed in a certain way. Maybe they liked their local member or maybe they did not like their local member. Maybe it is just the way their parents have always voted or perhaps the opposite of the way their parents have always voted.
It is not only misleading but also downright wrong to suggest that the government suddenly has some kind of mandate to sell Telstra. It is absolutely invalid to assume that even half of the electorate was thinking of Telstra when their vote was cast. Of course we all know that less than half of the electorate voted for the coalition.
This kind of political rhetoric completely distorts concepts of legitimacy and democra 
 cy. It is a misleading and disruptive way to conduct important debates in Australia. Indeed, the polls have shown that a majority of Australians have no desire to see Telstra in private hands. This government is trying to usurp proper process and public opinion in one fell swoop using constantly the word `mandate'.
Let us look at the impact on the bush and the great pork-barrel. The best argument the Prime Minister and the Minister for Communications, the Information Economy and the Arts can come up with to sell Telstra is a scare campaign to the bush, telling them in an open letter that the Senate will be denying them $671 million in pure pork-barrelling.
Senator Alston assures us that these new projects for the bush are not a bribe but, rather, the government would have to slash a bit more off the education or health budget to pay for them if they did not sell Telstra. That is hardly a credible position. Considering the government feel that they are so rich with taxpayers' money that they can hand out $3.5 billion to diesel and petroleum fuel users through the cuts in diesel excise in the tax package, it would seem that there is some money they are prepared to throw around. It would seem that a mere $671 million compared with $3.5 billion plus annually would be a drop in the ocean. The budget could keep the current excise or even just a part of the current excise and they could come up with this measly crumb to the bush.
The people of regional and rural Australia are not fooled by these weak strategies by the government. They have seen Telstra's attitude to customer service in the bush since it has been partially privatised. The statistics do not look too crash hot. Let us look at services provided in country areas. In the December 1996 quarter, 74 faults were cleared within one working day. By June 1998, it was 62. In the December 1996 quarter, 90 faults were cleared within two working days. By June 1998, it was 81. In the December 1996 quarter, 67 payphone faults were cleared within one working day. In June 1998, it was 48. In the December 1996 quarter, 84 payphone faults were cleared within two working days. In June 1998, it was 68. These 
 figures come from the Australian Communications Authority Telecommunications Performance Bulletin, issue 5, June 1998 quarter.
People in the bush know they will be the last priority for a privatised Telstra which is focused solely on the bottom line and the profits for shareholders. There is no question that a fully privatised Telstra will have their eyes clearly focused on shareholder profits and will do whatever it takes to minimise their responsibilities for the provision of telecommunications services that are considered to be `uneconomic'—that is, will reduce the profits to shareholders.
The advocates of privatisation assume that the universal service obligations can be delivered just as easily under private ownership as long as there is a legislated obligation for their provision. However, that is taking a profit motivated enterprise to act contrary to its own self-interest and the pressure of its shareholders. The interests of the community and the interests of shareholders are often diametrically opposed.
For instance, during the committee hearings we heard evidence that telecommunications carriers may find it cheaper to pay the daily credit under the customer service guarantee than to provide the service, so they may actually hold off providing a service and pay the credit instead because it is cheaper. Even if that specific instance could be remedied by increased regulation, this is a perfect example of how Telstra's commitment to the provision of service in the bush is highly equivocal. That is so even now that they have partial private ownership.
Senator Alston remarked in the Australian last week on 4 March 1999, page 34, that the parliament can just `impose licence conditions' or `pass legislation setting and enforcing service levels'. It is worth remembering that a fully privatised Telstra will be fighting tooth and nail against any further regulation by parliament. We already know that Treasury have basically given a very strong argument as to why a further regulated environment should not be part of the package before they sell Telstra because it might inhibit the price for the sale of Telstra. We can see what the connections are.
In addition, the so-called `independent inquiry' proposed in the legislation is a weak attempt to assure that the customer service levels are adequate before the sale. For a start, we do not even know what criteria the inquiry will use. These will be left up to regulation, as is so often the case with important elements of legislation with this government. So the Senate has no way to judge whether this inquiry will be rigorous or even come close to accurately assessing whether customer service levels are adequate. In addition, the inquiry need only investigate customer service levels over a six-month period. This time frame is clearly too short to establish whether service standards are up to scratch. It would be possible for Telstra to pick up service standards for that short time for the purposes of the inquiry.
The critical importance of telecommunications to the bush cannot be underestimated. As people of rural and regional Australia are seeing banks, shops and people desert their towns, telecommunications become even more vital. Affordable quality telecommunications services provide a ray of hope for people in the bush as many other services abandon their communities. Telecommunications services can potentially fill the ever broadening abyss left in areas of finance, education, health, trade and commerce. Without access to up-to-date telecommunications services, people of rural and regional Australia cannot sustain a quality of life equal to that of their city cousins.
Let us look at the argument of the mum and dad investors. The Prime Minister continues to throw around the claim that the further sale of Telstra will allow all Australians to have a greater stake in one of the country's great enterprises. The propaganda-like claim that it is the mum and dad investors who will profit from the sale is at best misleading considering the so-called mum and dad investors have a stake in Telstra as taxpayers. It is also misleading in that the reality is that the sale will only be profitable for those with the means to take advantage of it. So we have another situation with the coalition's policies that those already advantaged get richer and most of Australia goes backwards.
The situation is summed up well by three esteemed academics who have been researching the ways in which several Australian public enterprises have been privatised. These are Roger Wettenhall, Fran Collyer and Jim McMaster. They say:
The `truth' of a share owning democracy is less sovereignty and more social inequality as the Australian people as a whole lose what they once owned through their own hard work and diligence.
That quote comes from the Current Affairs Bulletin  of June/July 1998 No. 21. The Prime Minister should take note of last week's Australian , which featured a range of articles over four days about Australia's growing underclass. There have been a number of studies recently coming up with the same answer—that is, the gap between the rich and the poor is ever increasing. The huge number of people living in poverty and the number of working poor are increasing while the people at the big end of town are cashing in.
The government's tax package is another blatant example of a policy that exacerbates this massive social problem. The reality is that the sale of Telstra will directly benefit those corporations and individuals with a disposable income to buy shares. The CEPU has outlined interesting figures regarding the windfall that Telstra board members gained during the one-third float—that is, over $1 million between an 11-member board. Let us not forget the stockbrokers who get yet another windfall, but the growing underclass will lose their stake in yet another national asset. I have mentioned previously that the government is unable to show that it is economically sensible to sell off Telstra. The government is trying to distract the community in the media by yelling mandate and using these bribes. The government knows that the sale of Telstra is on very economically shaky grounds.
Of course, it is in the interests of the government to flog off another 16 per cent of Telstra. It is in their interests now because they will get a nice little cosmetic effect on their budget sheet in a couple of months. A healthy bottom line on that budget sheet is an obvious benefit to the government as it will help in continuing to present them as good 
 economic managers despite the ballooning current account deficit and despite the social and environmental damage caused by their slash and burn mentality. So to ensure a nice bottom line they try to beef up the projected benefits to the community to prop up their image. This does not take note of the impact of the loss of revenue, the ongoing loss of revenue forever down the line.
Pretending that we can suddenly have more to spend on social programs is all smoke and mirrors. The accounting conventions belie the economic realities. Indeed, the Treasurer has previously correctly criticised the Labor Party for using asset sales to conceal budget deficits and has focused on the underlying budget deficit which excludes the proceeds of asset sales and repayments of state and government business enterprise debt. The bottom line is that the sale of Telstra will reduce public sector net worth in the long run and will stymie the government's ability to pay for the social and environmental programs and health programs that are needed in Australia.
Let us look at the government's claim that there would be an economic benefit. It assumes that the savings in interest through debt retirement will more than offset the loss in dividends. This claim has been seriously questioned. The first gap in the government's projection is the calculation in interest savings on government loans after the full sale. These estimations have been severely questioned as overestimated to the tune of in excess of $1.5 billion. According to Professor Quiggin, a more realistic estimate of the interest savings is $2.5 billion per annum. When you look at this interest saving against the ongoing losses, the hope of net economic benefits is not something to be enthusiastic about.

"Mackay, Sen Sue",ALP,1999-03-09,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document. 

Labor welcomes the tabling of the Skehill report. It has been some time coming. This is unfortunate because these sorts of delays do not promote confidence in what is a critical issue—that is, air safety. In fact, delays of this length have created suspicion as to what may well be contained in them. There are a number of other documents that we are waiting on. The regulation of air safety needs confidence and trust and we cannot afford any lack of transparency with regard to air safety.
There are, as I said before, a number of other documents that ought to be tabled. One return to order went through the Senate today in relation to the Hawke review into Airservices Australia. We are very happy that that has gone through. There is another document that we will be moving the return to order on in the next sitting week, and that is the Hawke review into Airservices Australia, BASI and CASA which was inaugurated by the minister in terms of the events of late last year. We will be moving the return to order in relation to that matter next week. As I said yesterday when we were dealing with the disallowance motion of the civil aviation regulations which would have meant the privatisation of air traffic control services in Australia—we are very pleased that that disallowance was knocked off—we do need transparency. We need a clear view of all the issues relating to air safety and we need to build and strengthen public confidence in air safety.
Coming specifically to the Skehill report itself, it is very clear from the report that South Pacific Seaplanes was a problem for CASA. There were `frequent and repeated breaches of various regulatory requirements' and `a failure to honour the numerous undertakings it gave to remedy perceived inadequacies in its methods of operation'. There was a significant turnover of chief pilots. Serious allegations were made against senior management and its attitude towards safety. CASA received at least 21 complaints against SPS and it issued 13 non-compliance notices and grounded SPS aircraft. SPS aircraft were involved in a number of the accidents or alleged near accidents over the five-year period covered by the Skehill report.
By April 1997 the situation was so serious that the CASA regional manager of the south-east region at the time, Mr Diamond, issued a notice to SPS requiring them to show why their air operator's certificate or their licence to operate should not be cancelled. Following an informal conference with the SPS management, no further action was taken on this matter. This decision was taken without meaningful consultation with the flying operations inspector that was assigned to SPS. Mr Skehill makes the comment in his report that the flying operations inspector that was assigned to SPS had the most intimate knowledge of the SPS operations and had been the one who had recommended the suspension or cancellation of the AOC.
Some senators may not be aware that flying operations inspectors are experienced professional pilots who are employed to regulate pilot standards in Australia. They are critical to the whole field of aviation safety. Flying is not like riding a bike: you do forget, you do fall behind if you do not retain your skills and knowledge, and obviously the best way to do this is to practise. However, the pilot community is greatly concerned that CASA has taken the decision to downgrade the ongoing skill maintenance program for flying operations inspectors. This has undermined their skills confidence and their credibility. And we are also obviously concerned about the major cost cutting measures that CASA has instituted.
I have a number of other remarks to make in relation to this report. I see that time is running out, so at the end of my remarks I will seek leave to continue my remarks later. Suffice to say that this report contains much that we are interested in—not only us but all members of the public, particularly those who regularly use planes. We welcome the government's somewhat tardy, but at least there, initiative in terms of the tabling of this report. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

"Watson, Sen John",LP,1999-03-09,"—Mr Acting Deputy President, as you would probably be personally aware, in the north-west of Tasmania, the Drug Education Network Incorporated, under the direction of Elvie Hales, conducted a survey during 1997 amongst young people aged 12 to 18 years to examine the knowledge, perceptions and beliefs surrounding the use of the drugs cannabis, alcohol and tobacco as well as the levels and patterns of use of those drugs. While some studies have been conducted in other areas of Australia, at that time there had been no comparable studies undertaken in Tasmania which would provide up-to-date and locally based information.
Fifteen schools, both government and non-government, participated, and a total of 1,264 students completed the specially designed questionnaire administered during normal school hours. Care was taken to ensure the uniformity of the environment during the administration of the questionnaire and variables were controlled as much as possible. The results of the study showed that participants' knowledge about drugs in general is varied.
While tobacco, cannabis and tranquillisers are acknowledged as drugs, 26 per cent thought that alcohol was not a drug. Some 32 per cent of participants reported they had tried 
 cannabis in the past and 28 per cent said that they use cannabis now. Males reported a higher percentage of use, both past and present, than females. Levels of use increased with age, and `occasional use' and `at parties' are the most common times reported. Some 73 per cent of cannabis users report that they do not want to quit using cannabis.
A high percentage of participants, 91 per cent, said that there were health problems in using cannabis. Brain damage and memory loss were strongly identified as risks from using cannabis. However, the benefits of using cannabis for general pain relief and in the treatment of pain in cancer patients were also strongly identified. Relaxation and maintaining calmness was another reason for using cannabis, which was reported by a high percentage of participants. Peer pressure to use cannabis or not to use cannabis was identified as an issue for many participants. This pressure came from within the group to which the person belonged and desired to be part of. The risk of becoming addicted to cannabis was also identified.
Reported alcohol use among participants was quite higher than that of other drugs. Alcohol, for example, is used on a regular basis and within a broad range of social settings. Some 74 per cent said that they had used alcohol at some time in the past and 56 per cent said that they use alcohol now. The majority of those who reported that they use alcohol do so on an occasional basis or at weekends only. There is a low reported incidence of daily alcohol use, with slightly more males than females reporting daily use.
Beer is the most common alcoholic drink, closely followed by spirits and wine, or a combination of both. Males choose to drink more beer and females more wine and spirits. Some 84 per cent of participants reported that they do not want to quit using alcohol. While a very high percentage of participants recognised a general health risk from using alcohol, the risk of addiction, along with personality changes, was also acknowledged.
The main problem identified in relation to alcohol is the violence associated with its use—this from 12- to 18-year-olds in our community who are still mostly living at 
 home. Of all the participants, 56 per cent said they have used tobacco in the past and 34 per cent said they use it now. Even though both males and females report the same percentages of having tried tobacco, the results indicate that more females than males say they use tobacco at present.
There is a marked difference in use levels between age groups, with an increasing usage trend reported as age actually increases. Of those currently smoking, 58 per cent report they would like to quit. General health issues, such as risk of cancer, heart disease and addiction, were identified.
Overwhelmingly, where participants reported a high level of use of a substance by family members and/or friends, they also reported using themselves. Conversely, where participants reported a low or nil level of use by family and/or friends, they reported a similar low level of their own use. Peer pressure does seem to play a part in influencing decisions about drug use and can help determine whether a person uses or not. The wish to be included in groups is an important component of this, and responses were consistent for all substances in the survey.
From the issues identified in the report, it was recommended that a working party be established to explore strategies and develop action plans and that the working party be made up of representatives from both government and non-government agencies, including the health and education sectors, police and local government. I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate Elvie Hales and her team from the Drug Education Network on such a comprehensive and enlightening report.
Research undertaken by my office indicates that people on the north-west coast of Tasmania are becoming more and more concerned about the increasing use of drugs and, alarmingly, we are told that the amount of drugs around is incredible. This has got to stop. Money is pouring into Tasmania for drug and alcohol problems, but we are told that a lot of it is wasted. It appears services are targeting the easy cases.
The crazed drug users are creating mayhem in our community. They are violent, out of 
 control and highly manipulative. We must focus on these people and look at why they are like they are. It is alarmingly obvious that more of the same is just not working. We need a variety of programs for different types of drug users.
I believe that every thinking person in Australia must be very alarmed at our increasing crime rates. Not only do we have increasing crime rates; we have increasing violence associated with those crimes. Drug users need access to cash. They commit crimes and, drug crazed, they use violence.
It is common knowledge throughout the police force and, indeed, the community on the north-west of Tasmania that most burglaries and home invasions are related to drugs. We also have handbag snatching in supermarkets, elderly women robbed in broad daylight in city areas, elderly people bashed and robbed in their homes by intruders, drugs stolen from ambulances and armed hold-ups. It concerns me greatly that we have a federal government fighting drugs and state governments, through local police forces, policing drug users and supply. There does need to be greater coordination.
I am also concerned that we have a huge problem with powder drugs on the north-west coast of Tasmania, yet seldom do we read of drug busts. I ask: why not? The drugs issue is bigger than any of us have contemplated, and every Australian wants us as politicians to face up to it and do something about it. Tasmania, being an island within Australia, could be used as a test area for all drug related experiments, and I recommend this action to all levels of government. Drug related problems mostly stem from drug addiction. Why we develop drug addictions is the issue we must address. Soft options, I believe, are not the answer, neither is more of the same.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Drugs: Tasmanian Questionnaire</title>,Adjournment,16,1
