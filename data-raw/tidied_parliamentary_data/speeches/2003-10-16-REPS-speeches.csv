"Macklin, Jenny, MP",ALP,2003-10-16,"—These amendments to the Higher Education Support Bill 2003, which we began debate on last night, give effect to the commitment that Labor gave in our higher education policy to abolish all fee paying places for Australian undergraduates. We have said in our policy that we understand the need for current students to complete their courses. These amendments would prevent any more full fee paying Australian undergraduates from 2004. These amendments also go to another issue which I did not get time to comment on last night. Not only do Labor fundamentally oppose the idea that university degrees are up for sale to the highest bidder; we also want to draw the attention of the House to the fact that this legislation does not implement the promise that the Minister for Education, Science and Training set out when he originally introduced this higher education package.
At the time, he said that the legislation would allow universities to only—only—increase the number of full fee paying students in particular courses from 25 per cent to 50 per cent. But there is not in the legislation a fundamental cap of 50 per cent on the number of full fee payers. In fact, the legislation allows the minister to exempt entire courses from the 50 per cent limit provision and to allow universities to enrol 100 per cent full fee paying students in any course. That could mean that not a single HECS place would be available for Australian students in some courses.
I am glad that the minister is now in the House, because I would appreciate a response on this particular amendment. I think it is important for him to clarify which particular courses, in his view, are not going to be in the public interest. He has said that courses which are in the public interest will have HECS places attached to them. I would appreciate it if he could indicate whether they will have 50 per cent or some other number of HECS places attached to them. It is important for him to let the public know what sorts of courses he has in mind that should be 100 per cent full fee paying. Minister, are you going to say something? You do not have to, but are you going to?
—Has the member for Jagajaga concluded her remarks? She still has time allocated.
—I thought the minister might appreciate the opportunity to answer.
—The member for Jagajaga would appreciate that I am the one who determines whether he might appreciate the opportunity or not.
—Mr Speaker, it seems that the minister does not want to indicate—
—I do not want to interfere in the debate, but I will recognise the minister, and what he does will be his business.
—Mr Speaker, you would know, and I am sure the minister knows as well, that the purpose of the consideration in detail of bills is that we debate these fundamental issues in this House. In his public comments, the minister said that he had intended to limit the number of full fee payers to 50 per cent of particular courses. It is now clear in the legislation that that is not the case and that he intends to allow universities to have 100 per cent full fee paying students in some courses. So we could have any particular course, in any university, simply not offering any HECS places. I think it is extraordinary that the minister is prepared to allow this to be the case. Outside parliament, he says that those particular areas of study which are in the national interest will not be affected, but it is the minister who decides which areas those are. I think it is extraordinary that we are expected to trust one man in Canberra to decide what is in the national interest. 
Not only are we being asked to trust him; we also are being asked to trust all of his successors to use this extraordinary power benevolently. That is not the sort of democracy most Australians want. I think it is extremely important that the minister indicates which courses will not have any HECS students in them and how he intends to determine which courses are in the national interest, because these issues are fundamental to the nature of our universities. That some students would not be able to get a HECS place in some courses is really a most extraordinary power contained in this legislation. I will leave it at that, on this matter, at the moment.",REPS,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Consideration in Detail</title>,Bills,5,1,speech
"Wilkie, Kim, MP",ALP,2003-10-16,"—Last night I was addressing the parliament regarding these amendments to the Higher Education Support Bill 2003, and I would now like to conclude those remarks. Under this government, since 1998, full fee payers have been able to buy a university place ahead of people with higher marks. This is absolutely unacceptable. Degrees costing as much as $150,000 are available to those who can afford to pay. At the University of Sydney a full fee law degree costs around $85,000. The University of Queensland offers a full fee veterinary science degree for $144,000. The vice-chancellor of Melbourne University has priced a full fee medical degree at $150,000. I do not think this is really a bargain. It is appalling that, at a price, a person can get preferential treatment over those who are infinitely more qualified. These amendments deal with that issue.
Australians should not have to pay exorbitant fees to buy a university place; they are already contributing to our tertiary education system through tax and other forms of support. All Australian citizens should have an equal opportunity to get into university, based on ability. No Australian should be given preference simply because they can afford to pay more. Access to university should be based on achievement and potential, not on how much you or your family can afford to pay. The Howard government is intent on increasing the number of full fee paying places so that half of all university places could go to people who buy their way in. This is absolutely unacceptable. It means that more university places would be reserved for the wealthy and that more $100,000-plus degrees will be bought.
The government defend this proposal by saying that it does not mean only the rich can participate. They magnanimously offer to introduce a loan scheme. A loan scheme for education is absolutely unacceptable. When you consider the amount of interest that people would have to pay, it is easy to appreciate that they could not afford to send their children to university. I advocate that there should be no full fee places for Australian undergraduates and I advocate the abolition of the real interest rate on postgraduate loans. 
To put that in perspective, my electorate of Swan is relatively wealthy, by many standards, but I would argue that more than 90 per cent of families in my electorate could not afford to pay $100,000 to get their children into university. They simply could not afford to take out that loan in addition to the loans they would probably have for their house and other things. It would place an incredible burden on those families. We are not talking about people who have a reasonable income and who could take out these loans to pay for the education of their children. People paying these amounts of money are very wealthy; they are not average Australians. We would be creating a system in which only the rich can get their children into university.
The minister obviously got his degree at a time when the state paid for his education. I wonder if the minister himself could have obtained his degree if he had had to borrow $150,000 to buy his way into university. I do not think he could have. I do not begrudge the minister his education; I think he deserves it—he fought his way through university and earnt that degree. But if he had had to pay for it himself, he probably would not have been able to afford it. So this is ridiculous.
I think the system where the minister has the discretion to say which courses will and which courses will not be covered is also absolutely unacceptable. I read in the paper how some of those courses that the minister believes should be cut—and the minister believes that the people who want to do them should have to pay—are not in the national interest. I think this system, where you have a minister determining what the situation is, is crazy. What happens in the future when another minister comes along? In one period you might have these courses not being open and then a few years later suddenly someone decides, `Oh no, there is a different minister with different ideas now. We will grant these courses access.' It is a ridiculous system that should be abolished. I wholeheartedly support the amendments proposed by the shadow minister.",REPS,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Consideration in Detail</title>,Bills,5,1,speech
"Ripoll, Bernie, MP",ALP,2003-10-16,"—What the Minister for Education, Science and Training and this government are asking us to do in the Higher Education Support Bill 2003 is to implicitly trust them—to trust the minister that he will always do the right thing. Some might say that we can trust this minister, but can we trust future ministers? We know that this minister will not always be the Minister for Education, Science and Training. Therefore when you put together legislation you have to make sure that it is robust enough, that it is rigorous enough, to withstand whoever might be in that position in the future and will have to administer these bills.
The legislation that the government is putting forward is completely unfair and completely at odds with what ordinary Australians and young people in this country need. It is completely at odds with what they want and with what they need. I do not know where the minister and the government have sought their advice—where they have consulted or where they have been able to divine that this is the sort of legislation that will bring forward an education system for the future and an education system that will actually provide for young people. How can providing zero per cent HECS places—none at all in any course—be good for young people or be good for the future of Australia? How can we trust the minister when he says that he wants us to give him the discretion to the decide which courses have no HECS places and which courses do have HECS places? I am not confident that we can trust the minister on this; I am not confident that we can trust the government on this; and I know that the universities are not confident that they can trust the minister or the government on this either. 
There is no way known that making courses cost around $150,000 is a good thing. There is no way that anybody—not even this government—can say that making courses cost $150,000 is a good thing for anybody. What it does is place an unbelievable burden on young people and their families. If they want to go forward in life, if they want to improve themselves, if they want to give themselves opportunities for the future then they will have to get themselves into great debt to do it or they will have to have the means to pay for these courses up-front. This is the sort of money that ordinary people do not have—$150,000 is a huge amount of money. In my electorate of Oxley $150,000 represents a home, an entire mortgage. It represents a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. I can understand the minister when he says that maybe that opportunity should go towards education—that somebody should educate themselves. I agree; they should. But they should not have to pay $150,000 to do it. 
People in this country have paid taxes, and their families have paid taxes, all their lives—and they will continue to pay taxes in the future. The courses that we provide now are an investment in this country, an investment in young people and an investment in the future. Excluding a certain class of person from having access to courses by making them out of reach excludes a whole range of young, smart, intelligent people who want the same opportunities as others. That is all I seek out of this.
The reason I am speaking on this bill today—and the reason I spoke yesterday and will continue to speak on these issues—is that I really believe that young people, no matter where they live, no matter what their background, no matter who they are, deserve the same opportunities. They deserve to have the same hope. Not everybody wants to go to university; it is not everybody's dream—people have different dreams, different aspirations, and different wants and needs—but they all deserve the same hope that if they want to do that then they can. This bill does not offer that. It does not give them that hope. This bill actually says to them, `We are going to make it more difficult for you.' The minister is shaking his head. He does not agree with what I am saying. But how can increasing HECS by 30 per cent—thus increasing a student's debt—make it easier for them? It does not. How can deregulating the cost of university courses and giving universities the capacity—or the minister the capacity—to charge $150,000 for courses make it easier for young people to get a start in life? It does not. 
This bill goes nowhere near making it easier for young people to attend university. It does not offer anything for the future of Australia. Instead of this being a bill about investing in education and investing in our young people, it is a bill that destroys their hopes. For me, that is something that we should all oppose and something that we should amend. Labor have moved these amendments because we believe in young people and we believe in giving them the same opportunities and the same hopes.",REPS,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Consideration in Detail</title>,Bills,5,1,speech
"Macklin, Jenny, MP",ALP,2003-10-16,"—I am very disappointed that the Minister for Education, Science and Training has not responded to the critical point that I have raised in the consideration in detail of this amendment. It is his legislation that is going to allow universities to have some courses where 100 per cent of the students are full fee paying students. He is going to be deciding that. He should tell the people, through this parliament, what he considers to be in the national interest and why he thinks that it is okay for one man in Canberra to decide that.

"Sidebottom, Sid, MP",ALP,2003-10-16,"—My question is to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. Can the minister confirm that the National Farmers Federation, the Cattle Council of Australia, the Sheepmeat Council of Australia, WoolProducers, the Australian Meat Industry Council, the Western Australian Meat Marketing Cooperative, the Sheep Breeders Association of Western Australia, the Western Australian Farmers Federation, the New South Wales Farmers Association, the Australian Veterinary Association plus 21 government backbenchers all oppose the return of the sheep laden MV Cormo Express on quarantine grounds? Why does the minister think only he is right and everyone else is wrong on the dangers of bringing the sheep back?",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Trade: Live Animal Exports</title>,Questions Without Notice,9,1,question
"Truss, Warren, MP",NP,2003-10-16,"—All honourable members have been following with concern the plight of the 52,000 or thereabouts sheep on board the Cormo Express. The vessel is in Kuwait and is about to leave for the return journey to Australia. The government have been involved in extensive negotiations with countries around the world. We have been supported in those negotiations by the industry itself to seek to find an alternative destination for the sheep. That remains our priority. Even if the vessel is most of the way home and we uncover a satisfactory destination, the vessel will be diverted to that destination. A second vessel is being prepared in Australia to take on additional feed and supplies because it is quite clear that, once the vessel leaves Kuwait, the next load of feed and provisions that it will require will have to come from Australia. So we are undertaking a lot of preparation work in that regard.
It would clearly be irresponsible for the government not to also be considering what options are available in the event that we are unable to find a destination for the sheep close to where they are. In that regard we have looked at a couple of options—slaughter at sea or some other location or the alternative of bringing them back to Australia. Those negotiations and those scientific studies are well advanced. You indicated that a number of industry bodies have expressed concern about the sheep coming back to Australia, including the Australian Veterinary Association. To be fair, you must also acknowledge that that association has issued a press release saying how unsatisfactory slaughter at sea would be. So I think the Veterinary Association's commentaries on the issue demonstrate how challenging and difficult this situation is. 
The government have no intention whatsoever of compromising Australia's enviable quarantine status. We will not in any way be putting at risk our clean and green image. The work that is being done would put in place a quarantine regime the like of which we have never seen in this country. It is not the kind of quarantine regime that you would have for a routine import. This is an emergency situation and it requires an emergency response and a tighter rein of quarantine than you would normally have. 
The industry associations have identified some of the disease and pest issues that have to be addressed. We are confident that those issues can be effectively addressed; indeed, the industry associations themselves have identified many of the ways that that risk can be reduced to the kinds of levels we would expect in relation to our trade with other parts of the world.
I would remind the House that these are Australian sheep and we are proposing to bring them back to Australia. They have not left the vessel and it is an enclosed vessel. So the risk of any kind of infection coming on board is quite low. Nonetheless, we are not prepared in any way to compromise our nation's clean and green image, and the quarantine plans put in place will take no shortcuts.
Finally, it is by far the best option for us to be able to unload these sheep in other parts of the world. That is still our primary objective and we are working to achieve that end. But if that cannot be achieved, then we have in place and will be able to put in place a satisfactory arrangement so these sheep can be brought home to their native country, Australia.",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Trade: Live Animal Exports</title>,Questions Without Notice,9,1,answer
"Thomson, Kelvin, MP",ALP,2003-10-16,"—My question is to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. I refer to the minister's claim yesterday that the scientific report released yesterday did not support the return of an additional 1,500 gigalitres to the Murray River, and I ask: doesn't the report conclude that substantial improvement to ecological habitat condition is largely achieved by the 1,500 gigalitres scenario and that 1,500 gigalitres would provide the greatest benefit to river red gums, the greatest reductions in salinity, substantial reductions in algal bloom risk, the greatest improvement to waterbird populations, the greatest improvement to floodplain vegetation, the greatest improvement to wetland vegetation and the best outcomes for the Coorong and the Murray mouth? Why didn't the minister tell the truth about this report?
—The member for Wills will reframe the latter part of his question; it ought not to contain an imputation. I am allowing the question to stand; I am merely asking him to rephrase the latter part of the question. 
—Mr Speaker, will the minister now tell the truth about this report?
—The member for Wills is aware of the fact that the implication is that the minister has not told the truth. Questions should not contain implications. I ask the member for Wills to rephrase the latter part of his question or I will rule the question out of order. The member for Wills might consider that, given my own interest in these matters, that would involve my taking quite a substantial step.
—Yes, Mr Speaker. I am happy to ask the minister the question which I asked him concerning the contents of the report and its impact in relation to salinity, algal bloom risk, waterbird populations, floodplain vegetation, wetland vegetation and the best outcomes for the Coorong and the Murray mouth.
—Mr Speaker, not only was the latter part of the question from the honourable member for Wills—which you rightly ruled out of order—inappropriate but also the earlier reference where he misrepresented what I said yesterday was inappropriate. The clear facts are that if you put water down the Murray River it can achieve ecological benefits and environmental benefits, and if you have got more water to use then you can achieve more. That is clearly self-evident and the report makes that clear as well. What the honourable member for Wills is trying to avoid is the embarrassment of the Labor Party's policy in relation to this matter, which is essentially to put 1,500 gigalitres down the River Murray—who knows where, who knows when, who knows why and who knows what it is going to achieve? Just take 1,500 gigalitres and put it down the river without any outcomes in mind, without any planned process and without any objectives to be achieved. What is very clear from the report is that carefully managed water for environmental purposes is able to achieve substantially more than just indiscriminate flows. That is the work that the government is doing in relation to the development of the first step proposal concerning the Living Murray, where we are identifying key icon sites and looking at ways of acquiring water to achieve the objectives that we have for those icon sites. So the clear emphasis in the report is that we need to manage our environmental flows just as much as we need to allocate various amounts of water.
Of course, the key alarm that everyone feels in the Murray-Darling Basin region, when it comes to the Labor Party policy concerning environmental flows, is that they are promising to put down 1,500 gigalitres for no identified purpose but they have allocated only $150 million for that purpose. That is a clear sign that Labor intend to just take this water off people without any compensation, without any consideration of the economies in regional areas and without any care for the people who will be adversely affected. So, not only is their policy ill designed and without clear direction; it is also one which will seriously damage regional New South Wales and indeed the whole of inland Australia, because they propose to take water off people without any compensation.",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Environment: Murray River</title>,Questions Without Notice,11,1,question

"Tanner, Lindsay, MP",ALP,2003-10-16,"—As we move towards the end of yet another fun sitting week, we look across at the benches of the National Party and see their faces turning glum. They are becoming sadder by the minute, as they realise they will soon have to crawl back yet again with their tails between their legs to their electorates and the people they are supposed to represent, to hide in their offices to try to minimise the degree of exposure they will have to people in country Australia—the people they are supposed to be representing in this parliament—because they do not want to have to explain to them why they support selling Telstra. Yet again they will crawl away from this place, where they have already voted to sell Telstra, and do everything they possibly can to avoid being held to account for it in country Australia. 
Mr Speaker, hasn't it been a fun couple of months for the National Party? They almost got a new leader—not quite, but almost. They have a new communications minister, and isn't he a beaut! He is sitting right here in front of me. And they have a new name. So they have had a really good couple of months. I am fascinated by this new name—I am genuinely fascinated by it. Some highly paid consultant has come to the National Party and given them this flash of inspiration. This would have to be the mother of all makeovers. They are changing their name from the National Party to the Nationals. Possibly the Australian Labor Party could change its name to Labor. Wouldn't that be an extraordinary revelation for the people who vote for us? There are thousands of wizened old farmers out there, west of Coonabarabran, with their feet on the barbed wire fence, chewing away, saying, `Did you know the National Party has just changed its name. Our party, the party that represented us for many years, has just changed its name.' And boy, are they excited about it!
I am trying to work out why they have done this; I have a few theories as to why they might have. Possibly they are going to have two separate legal entities; they are all going to be members of two separate parties. Up here, where they vote for the sale of Telstra, they are going to be members of the National Party; but back home, where they say they are opposed to the sale of Telstra, they are going to be members of the Nationals. Of course that is what they have already done. The federal conference of the Nationals said that they oppose the sale of Telstra until services in the bush are up to scratch; but the members of the National Party who were here voted in this very House only a few weeks ago in favour of the sale of Telstra.
Possibly it is a cunning plan to get members such as the member for New England and the member for Kennedy back in the fold. I can see that the member for New England is tempted. Possibly there is a cunning plan on the part of the National Party that, if they change their name to the Nationals and tell people they are actually opposing the National Party, they will get genuine country representatives like the member for New England back in the fold.
There is a third possibility though, and that is that the National Party are trying to make out that they have merged with One Nation and therefore will pick up all their votes. Think about it: One Nation plus one National Party. Put them together and you get two sorts of nationals, and you end up with the Nationals. One plus one equals two. That is the sort of mathematical precision that really appeals to people in the National Party—scientific politics that pick up all those votes that they have lost over the last few years to One Nation.
It is stretching things a bit, I admit, to say that the change of name is to welcome the new Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, who is sitting opposite me. I must confess that I am missing Dick Alston already. Digital Dick is dead, and I am missing him already. I apologise for not mentioning Peter and Lindy; I might get to them a bit later on. But I am missing digital Dick already; he is dead and we have a new incumbent. But, no sooner had we discovered that Dick was no longer the minister, it all started to come out. We found he had a family trust that actually had shares in Telstra—something like $70,000 worth. They are very big on family trusts on that side. They cannot understand why their public responsibilities should get in the way of managing their share portfolios in the most prudent and appropriate way. We have heard Senator Alston's defence: it was his mum. The Warney defence: it was his mum that did it. 
The only thing that puzzles me about Senator Alston's mum being his excuse here is why didn't he think of this earlier. Why didn't he realise that his mum was a very convenient scapegoat for one or two other things? We remember the plasma TV scandal. Technically speaking—and the minister has put forward some highly technical legal defences on this matter of the family trust—he could have said that his mother owned the plasma TV. She lent it to him; it is his mum's. According to my rough calculation, I think the minister's mum had about a one-millionth interest in that plasma TV. That is roughly about the shareholding in Telstra—about a one millionth interest. He could have technically claimed that it was his mum's TV, and the fact that he had it for months watching the football was really nobody's business.
—It was good enough for Shane Warne.
—He was watching Shane Warne as well. But now, as I have pointed out, we have a new minister. Didn't he have a great start the other day and didn't he follow it up brilliantly today? He has been out buying his akubra and getting the Drizabone bush gear out, ready to go out there and convince country people that Telstra ought to be sold. They have a new strategy: they are going to bore them to death. We have Daryl and John—Hall and Oates. They are going to bore country people to death; they are going to send them to sleep and slip through the Telstra sale while they are still asleep.
I am afraid that it is not going to work. That kind of strategy is pretty smart, but I do not think it will work, because country people know what privatising Telstra actually means. Country people know that a privatised Telstra will be a giant, private monopoly that will be too powerful for any government to effectively regulate and will leave town faster than the banks. There have been many surveys to show what country Australia thinks about the government's proposal to sell Telstra. The member for New England has done a survey, and he got a response of over 95 per cent saying `Don't sell Telstra'; the member for Calare had a similar response. But they are not the only ones doing surveys.
—What about Alby?
—As the member for Burke points out, the member for Hume did a survey and he discovered that the vast bulk of his constituents—his country constituents—opposed the sale. The member for Dawson did a survey and she discovered that her constituents, to the tune of 86 per cent, oppose a sale. But they are not the only ones doing surveys. The member for McEwen—Hyacinth Bucket, as we know her and love her—has recently put out a telecommunications survey, and it has the following questions: what telecommunications services do you most rely on in your home or in your business? How would you rate these services, from 1 to 10? Which of these services most needs improvement? How important is access to high-speed Internet—and so on. There is one big question missing: do you want to sell Telstra? I have not been able to find it. I am not quite sure why the member for McEwen has forgotten to put that on her survey. It could have slipped off at the printer's. That is an excuse that I am familiar with.
—Her mum took it off. 
—That is another good possibility. These surveys have provoked the National Party into action. They went en masse to the Prime Minister to complain about the fact that the member for Hume was doing surveys and criticising the National Party for supporting the sale of Telstra. This is monumental hypocrisy. The Nationals are out in their electorates saying, `We are opposed to selling Telstra. We want to make sure we get decent regional services.' At the same time they are going to the Prime Minister and formally complaining about the member for Hume for criticising them for supporting the sale. Almost every day we have new revelations about the fraud that this government is seeking to impose upon Australia and upon country Australia with respect to the privatisation of Telstra.
A couple of weeks ago, the chairman of their own inquiry, Dick Estens, admitted that services in regional Australia are not up to scratch. At their own conference the Deputy Prime Minister—the Leader of the Nationals or the National Party or whatever they are called—admitted that services are not up to scratch and effectively said, `Black is white. We are not going to support the sale of Telstra until services are up to scratch'—after having already supported the sale by voting for it in this very House. A few weeks ago, the CEO of Telstra, Ziggy Switkowski, was awarded a new contract which enables him to earn up to $7 million a year based on incentives. But what are those incentives connected to? Are they connected to regional services? Are they connected to the standard of Internet delivery in the bush? Are they connected to mobile phone coverage? No, they are not. They are connected to the share price, cash flow, financial incentives—nothing to do with services in regional Australia. 
Last week it was revealed that the figures The Nationals claim as the basis for their argument that country services are up to scratch are completely phoney. I described them some months ago as Saddam Hussein referendum figures, and I did not know how right I was. They were completely phoney; they were based on a dubious averaging of monthly figures to claim that, generally, about one per cent to two per cent of phones throughout Australia each year have a fault—when, in fact, the real figure is in the vicinity of 10 per cent, 15 per cent, 20 per cent or more. Telstra even admits that it is probably around 10 per cent or more. 
It was similarly exposed, through the same Senate inquiry process, that the Nationals' claims of future proofing Telstra and its network, and guaranteeing a standard of regional services into the future, are complete nonsense. There is absolutely nothing—not one clause, not one word in this legislation—which provides any guarantee whatsoever for people in country Australia with respect to future regional services. All it does is set up a framework which empowers a future minister to set requirements—but does not guarantee that any such requirements will be imposed—and a five-yearly review, appointed by the minister, where the government is under no obligation other than to table the outcome of the review. It was admitted in this inquiry that it is highly conceivable that a requirement such as that there is one Telstra shop in Gundagai and one technician in Kalgoorlie could be sufficient to satisfy a nominal requirement about Telstra's regional services.
We have discovered that Telstra are still installing pair gain systems, which inhibit dial-up Internet speeds—even though they claimed that they worked. We have discovered that Mr Estens has admitted that his recommended 19.2 kilobits per second data speed is inadequate, and we have discovered, only over the last 24 hours, that the way the government are proposing to implement this is a complete fraud. Rather than universal provision, which is what they said they were going to do, they are supposedly going to provide it `on demand', provided Telstra are not prevented from delivering it by circumstances beyond their control. That is code for, `When we get around to it, we might give it to a few people.' So even this totally inadequate and very basic level of Internet service is still going to be denied to many country people. 
Now, of course, we have got Telstra's BigPond email service in complete chaos, with speeds roughly the speed of carrier pigeon—with not quite the reliability—and all of this in a context where the government says that regional telecommunications services are up to scratch, everything is fine, everything is going well, Telstra is fine to be privatised. 
The National Party might change their name, they might pretend, out in the bush, that they are opposed to the sale of Telstra, and do something different here; they might claim to be the representative of country people; but nothing is going to save them from the wrath of people in their electorates on this issue. The National Party might be made up of people who are a bit silly, but the people who vote for them are not, and they are going to see absolutely, right up square, what this party are about. They are betraying their origins, they are betraying the people who have loyally voted for them for many years, they are betraying those constituents, those activists, those hardworking people who have handed out how-to-vote cards—and I was one of them many years ago, when I was 10, as people may remember. They are betraying all those people, because they have not got the guts to stand up to the Liberal Party and say, `Don't sell Telstra, because it is of fundamental importance to people in country Australia.'
People in country Australia know the reality of telecommunications services in Australia. They know the network is crumbling. They know that staff have been cut back dramatically by Telstra and that services are deteriorating. They have got huge problems with Internet drop-outs, email blackouts and mobile phone coverage, and the fact that these things are not reflected in the official statistics has now exposed the statistics as a lie. We have phoney statistics from the ACA, based on dubious methodology, that ultimately mean nothing.
People in country Australia know that prices and line rental fees are going up. Telstra is still effectively a monopoly in most parts of Australia, subject to inadequate competition. Broadband rollout has virtually stalled in many parts of Australia, and we are still nationally way behind the vast bulk of equivalent countries. People in rural Australia know what selling Telstra means: it will be a giant private monopoly, it will be too powerful for any government to effectively regulate, it will focus on the most lucrative markets in the bigger cities and it will leave town faster than the banks. That is what will happen. That is what people in country Australia know and that is why the National Party should be honourable. They should stick to representing their constituents; they should stick to their traditional position on these issues. It does not matter what they are called—
 (Hon. I.R. Causley)—The member for Swan has been warned already today.

"Williams, Daryl, MP",LP,2003-10-16,"—Isn't it a strange spectacle to see the member for Melbourne talking about country Australia?
—That is were I come from. 
—He revealed his attitude to it by referring then to thousands of wizened old farmers, as if wizened old farmers represent country Australia. I thank the opposition for providing this opportunity to bore the Labor Party to death with facts. The Labor Party is hell-bent on running a scare campaign and, not surprisingly, the scare campaign and the factual situation bear no similarity at all. The Howard government are proud of their record in providing telecommunications services to regional and remote areas, and we are continuing to work to improve telecommunications in these areas. The Labor Party asks the people to believe that it is concerned about their access to telecommunications services, but regional Australia knows better. 
The member for Melbourne repeatedly refers to his by-line that telecommunications services will leave the country faster than the banks. What he also ought to point out is that the Labor Party were responsible for the Commonwealth Bank leaving the country areas. The Labor Party privatised the Commonwealth Bank and did not do anything at all to protect the banking services in rural, regional and remote areas that had been provided by what was previously a wholly government-owned bank. 
Labor have really shown no genuine interest in the needs and concerns of regional Australia. The opposition can only dream of achieving the sort of record that the Howard government have established in improving telecommunications services. But this does not seem to stop the Labor Party from conducting an irresponsible campaign of scaremongering and misinformation. The glib warnings of the dire consequences for regional and remote Australia if Telstra should be fully privatised have no factual foundation. As long as they foster fear and uncertainty in the Australian community, they will be achieving what they set out to do. 
The opposition is seriously and deliberately ignoring the existence of guarantees for future regional telecommunications services. Let us look at just how misleading and irresponsible the opposition is on this point. Australian telecommunications consumers currently enjoy some of the world's strongest regulatory safeguards. These safeguards include the universal service obligation, the customer service guarantee, the right to untimed local calls, retail price controls on Telstra and the digital data service obligation. 
Through the universal service obligation, all Australians enjoy the right to receive a telephone service. This safeguard is not going to be weakened or removed. The customer service guarantee is a world leading initiative that establishes a regime whereby companies who fail to comply with set time lines for connection and repair of telephone services must pay a financial penalty to the customer. This safeguard is not going to be weakened or removed. The right to an untimed local call is enshrined in legislation, and the government has no intention of removing this right. The digital data service obligation provides all customers with a 64 kilobytes per second service on request. This means that all Australians have access to their dedicated high speed data services. All these consumer safeguards continue into the future. 
The introduction of full and open telecommunications competition in 1997 has brought benefits for all Australian consumers, not only those in rural and regional areas. As a result of full competition, the number of telecommunications companies has grown from three to 89, and 40 per cent of these companies offer services to regional Australia. Consumers have also enjoyed a real decrease in prices for telephone services. That decrease is a real 20.7 per cent since 1997. According to an independent report commissioned by the Australian Communications Authority, competition has led to consumer benefits of a value between $595 and $878 per household in 2001-02. It has led to increased profits of $900 million per year for small business.  
It is worth reflecting on the fact that the introduction of the customer service guarantee by the government has meant that, for the first, time companies had to comply with strict time frames for installation and repair of phone services or they would have to pay compensation to the customer. Before the CSG most remote customers in Australia used to wait for up to 27 months for a phone to be installed. Now customers can expect a service to be installed within 20 days. It is important to note that the guarantee applies to all telecommunications companies and not just Telstra.
The fact that this fundamental safeguard can be imposed across the board surely demonstrates the capacity of the government to protect consumers regardless of ownership arrangements. The opposition's scaremongering that a fully privatised Telstra will be beyond regulatory control shows little faith in the power of the government and of the parliament to regulate the telecommunications industry. Labor, by adopting that position, is demonstrating that it has little faith in its own ability to govern if it were to achieve government. Indeed, this seemed to be reflected in a joint media statement issued on 2 October by the member for Melbourne and the opposition Senate whip, Senator Mackay. This press release set out the opposition's great fear that Telstra would lobby for an end to the price control regime following its privatisation. Interestingly, it also pointed out that Telstra had refused to rule out political donations to political parties.
Is the member for Melbourne putting on the public record that future Labor governments would be too weak to resist lobbying attempts, regardless of their merit? Is the member for Melbourne telling us that, if the Australian Labor Party were to receive a political donation from Telstra, an elected Labor government would abandon its responsibilities to safeguard the interests of the Australian community? These are serious questions and we call on those opposite to tell the Australian community why they have no intention of acting any more responsibly in government than they do in opposition.
I have had drawn to my attention evidence given to a Senate committee by the ACCC commissioner Mr Ed Willet last Tuesday. He was asked if the ACCC's ability to effectively regulate the telecommunications industry relied on the government being part owner of Telstra. He said:
None of our role relies on partial ownership or on any ownership issue. Our role is a regulatory one and it relies on our powers under legislation.
In case there was any confusion on this point, Mr Willet went on to say:
It might be worth noting at this point that privatisation of Telstra or any other business enterprise does not go directly to our responsibilities. Our roles are indifferent as to ownership. They apply to all businesses and they rely on legislation.
Later, Mr Willet was asked by a Labor senator about the impact of Telstra's view that it should be regulated less. This is what he said in response:
... I am yet to meet a monopoly infrastructure owner who does not want to be regulated less. I do not find that surprising ... 
He then, importantly, said: 
I do not think it goes to what we do, or would go to how we treat or regulate Telstra, privatised or not.
Despite the opposition scaremongering, it is clear from Mr Willet's comments that regulation of the telecommunications industry and regulation of Telstra has nothing to do with ownership issues.
The opposition's insistence in this debate, and its misleading claims that a fully privatised Telstra will lead to a deterioration in services to remote and regional Australia, completely ignores the reality of the government's regulatory power and it completely ignores the government's longstanding commitment to a regime that protects regional telecommunications services. Looking to the future, the government appreciates the need to continue to support the often unique needs of regional Australia. The government has decided to accept all 39 recommendations of the Estens inquiry. This is another example of the government's commitment to regional Australia and also of its willingness to put in place measures to protect regional Australians into the future.
The inquiry recommended that Telstra be required to maintain an ongoing local presence in regional, rural and remote Australia into the future. In response, the government have announced that we will address this through a new licence condition. This licence condition will require Telstra to prepare a plan setting out the activities and strategies it will undertake to maintain its local presence in regional areas.
The Labor Party seems to have ignored the fact that the government has plainly stated that it accepts all the recommendations of the Estens inquiry. The Labor Party also fails to appreciate that there is a number of ways that this local presence plan recommendation can be implemented. In this case, the government will use its power to impose a licence condition. The government has introduced legislation requiring current and future governments to conduct regular independent reviews of the adequacy of regional communication services and to formally respond to the reviews. The government has introduced legislation that will for the first time require a strategic regional telecommunications plan to be put in place.
Other activities to improve the quality of services to remote and regional Australia include requirements that Telstra provide a formal undertaking to the government to raise the reliability of its worst performing exchange service areas, to improve underperforming pair gain systems and to upgrade older radio concentrator telephone systems. The government, as I said in question time, is also imposing a licence condition on Telstra to provide a minimum equivalent throughput speed of 19.2 kbps for dial-up Internet access over its fixed line network. The government is well aware of the future telecommunications challenges in regional Australia and this is clearly demonstrated by the $181 million it has committed in response to the Estens inquiry.
The major component of this is a more than $140 million commitment for a national broadband strategy to provide access to affordable broadband services in regional Australia. A higher bandwidth incentive scheme will provide financial incentive for service providers to offer services in rural and remote areas at prices broadly equivalent to those available in urban areas. Everyone recognises that broadband is the big future issue for regional Australia. This package demonstrates a real and genuine commitment to support the future telecommunications needs of regional Australia.
The fact is that there is an extensive regulatory regime safeguarding the interests of Australian consumers in relation to services provided by Telstra. This regime will remain in place after Telstra's full privatisation. In fact, not only will all the current safeguards remain; there will be additional safeguards for Australian consumers under the government's response to the Estens inquiry. The government will also retain its ability to regulate the telecommunications industry and if necessary introduce new regulatory safeguards in the future. 
The reality is that the power of government through parliament to regulate the telecommunications industry is entirely unrelated to the question of who owns Telstra. The government's pro-competition regulatory regime and the stringent consumer safeguards I have referred to will be totally unaffected by any change in the ownership of Telstra. It is these pro-competition rules and consumer safeguards, not the government's part ownership of Telstra, that ensure that phone services remain affordable and that phone companies have to abide by strict service standards. These rules and safeguards are contained in legislation and will continue to apply regardless of any change in Telstra's ownership. Telstra and other telephone companies will continue to be subject to all of these laws.
The government remain committed to maintaining, and improving where necessary, the standard of telecommunications service to remote and regional Australia. We have a substantial record of working to achieve this goal, and we are clearly committed to ensuring appropriate service delivery to remote and regional Australia in the future. The contrast with Labor could not be more stark. Labor failed to impose any requirements on the Commonwealth Bank to protect its services to regional communities before it was privatised. In his media release of 13 October the member for Melbourne displayed an astonishing memory lapse about Labor's failures. He said that the Telstra sale legislation `would allow Telstra to leave town faster than the banks'. I ask the member for Melbourne: who was responsible for the Commonwealth Bank leaving town?

"Evans, Martyn, MP",ALP,2003-10-16,"—This government has taken a great institution of Australia, the PMG—which under a former Labor government became Telstra, which became a very significant telecommunications provider in this country—and it has effectively turned that effective infrastructure provider, that effective institution builder, which provided telecommunications services in the Australian regional areas and innovative information technology services throughout the metropolitan area and the regional part of the Australian continent, into a private company.
That private company is now effectively a shareholder-dominated entity that is looking to provide profits and services that it can limit as much as possible in the interests of those shareholders; it is no longer about the interests of institution building in this country. Telstra is now very much dominated by the interests of its shareholders, by the company's future profits and by the ways it can reduce services in the bush and limit the future provision of services in regional Australia so it can maximise those profits, because that is the only way it can build shareholder wealth. Unfortunately, it will do so by reducing services to the customers who will not deliver it the maximum profit. Regrettably, that is not in the interests of regional Australia; it is not in the interests of consumers in Australia. And the minister's regime of regulation, the minister's regime of regulatory controls, will not answer that critical question.
The Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts says that he will impose additional controls if necessary, that we already have a substantial degree of regulation, and that his new and additional controls, which this government will impose as a result of the Estens inquiry, will be adequate to meet the needs of regional Australia—he did not mention metropolitan Australia; people living in metropolitan Australia also have significant needs in this era of communications, information technology and broadband services. Minister, if that were correct—if that were all true—then regional Australia would not be crying out and complaining about the service delivery they now have. They would not be saying that they do not have the broadband services that they need and that they are of an appalling standard, that their dial-up Internet lines constantly drop out, or that our service delivery needs to be significantly upgraded. 
Minister, if under the current regulatory regime you were able to deliver an adequate standard of service to regional Australia, then the regional areas of South Australia, represented as they are by the Local Government Association of South Australia, would not have carried a resolution at their conference only a few weeks ago that called on this government not to privatise Telstra until services have been upgraded. So what makes you think that a new regulatory regime would be able to deliver an adequate standard of service? If the regulatory regime that we already have could answer these questions right now, then why haven't you already done that? If your existing regulatory regime were able to answer those questions, you would have done so already.
This government has had this agenda on its books since it came to office some seven years ago. If the government had been able to deliver an answer to the needs of regional Australia—to the country towns and the electorate I hope to continue to represent after the next election, including Clare, Auburn and Saddleworth, in that significant area of South Australia, Wakefield-Bonython, which the Speaker and I currently share an interest in—then you would have done so in regulatory controls that you would have announced already. Why should we believe the minister about the proposals he has for the future if, in the seven years that it has had to deliver existing regulatory controls, the government has not been able to boost the broadband access of regional areas?
The government have not even been able to deliver an adequate dial-up Internet service for regional Australia; so why should we believe them about the future? They certainly cannot deliver adequate broadband Internet to regional Australian areas; so why should we believe them about the future? They cannot even deliver adequate broadband in the metropolitan half of my electorate now; so why should we believe them about the future? There are significant parts of the urban area of my electorate now which do not have appropriate access to ADSL, and I am sure there are many colleagues on both sides of this House whose urban electorates do not yet have full access to high-speed broadband now; so why should we believe the government about future accessibility to ADSL and broadband services?
Why is that important, Mr Deputy Speaker? Because Australia is now well down the list of OECD countries with broadband access. Australia, for example, has one-tenth the access to broadband services that Canada has and less than one-fifth of that of the United States. Australia is well below Korea—which is above even Canada and the US—Sweden, the Netherlands, Belgium, Iceland, Denmark, Finland, Japan and Switzerland. Those OECD countries and others have much higher levels of access to broadband services and take-up of broadband services than Australia.
That is particularly important in the 21st century, when broadband will be the conduit—the railroad, the highway—down which many services like banking and access to entertainment and government services will be delivered, and not only in metropolitan areas. Already many government services are available online which are very hard to access in a physical sense. Access to services like government publications, regulations, legal services and registration of your vehicle or dog is available online, and they are much more difficult to access in a physical sense. The convenience of consumer services online, whether they are government or private services, will be denied to people who do not have access to broadband. 
If you are a citizen of the 21st century and you want convenient, ready, cheap access to those services, especially in regional Australia, you will need access to broadband. If you want equitable access to education, you will need access to broadband services. If you want equitable, fair and reasonable access to your primary school, high school or tertiary education institution, you will need access to broadband. If your primary school in a regional town does not have access to high-speed broadband—and by that I do not just mean 256- or 512-kilobit access; I mean very high speed two- to 10-megabit access—then you will need access to very high-speed services, and in regional Australia that is simply and utterly impossible. In many parts of the metropolitan area it is impossible.
It will be very important for our educational institutions—even for high schools and primary schools—to have reasonable and fair access under this current regime of regulation, Minister, let alone under a fully privatised Telstra because they will have absolutely no incentive to deliver that in regional Australia. They will have limited incentive to deliver it to the less well-off and less socioeconomically fortunate areas of metropolitan Australia. But for the smaller country towns—those one classroom regional Australian primary schools—there will be zero incentive for a fully privatised Telstra to deliver.
When it comes to broadband access, Minister, you may well not have discovered that technology. I suspect that, in the case of this minister, radio is a newly discovered technology. That may be unkind—I do not know—but the reality is that, for the children of the 21st century, broadband is going to be a very important access commodity in our country and regional areas and certainly in our metropolitan areas. In terms of equity of access, why should we deny any Australian access to these technologies? As Estens himself agreed, 19.2 kilobits on a dial-up basis simply does not cut the standard in the 21st century. I abandoned dial-up access at 19.2 kilobits something like 12 years ago, although I regarded it as a great innovation 15 years ago. The reality is that it is no longer viable in country Australia but many country Australians regard it as a luxury now, and they should not have to do so in 2003. Minister, your regulatory access does not deliver it to them today. Why should we believe you when you say that it will deliver it to them in the future?",REPS,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Telstra: Regional Services</title>,Matters of Public Importance,18,1,speech
"Johnson, Michael, MP",LP,2003-10-16,"—I am delighted to speak on this MPI and respond to some of the absolute nonsense and hypocrisy that we have heard from the opposition. Before I continue, I take the opportunity to congratulate the new Minister for Communi-cations, Information Technology and the Arts on his appointment. He has already demonstrated why the Prime Minister appointed him to this important portfolio; he has already left the shadow minister in his wake. I am sure that the people of Australia will benefit tremendously from the new minister's stewardship of his portfolio.
Time is limited, so I want to make sure that I get on the record up front the examples of Labor's hypocrisy in relation to privatisation. Ten minutes go very quickly so, before I allow time to get away, I will mention some of the important Australian icons and institutions that Labor have privatised during their time in government. It is very important for the people of Australia to know exactly where the Labor opposition stand on these things. They might say one thing in opposition but when in government they do completely the opposite. For the benefit of the House and, indeed, the Australian people—and especially for the benefit of the constituents of my electorate of Ryan, who I know have a very strong interest in the privatisation of Telstra—the list is staggering. During its time in government the current opposition privatised the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation; the Moomba-Sydney pipeline; Aerospace Technologies of Australia Ltd; the Commonwealth uranium stockpile; CSL, formerly Commonwealth Serum Laboratories; Amdel; the Commonwealth Accommodation and Catering Services; the Defence Services Housing Corporation loan portfolio; the Defence Force home loan franchise; and the Commonwealth housing loan assistance schemes. 
These are just a handful of the many Australian institutions that were under government control, stewardship and management and that the opposition privatised during its time in government. Today in the debate we have heard the shadow minister, the Leader of the Opposition and all of those members opposite fail to be rigorous and complete in their presentation to the Australian people and say, `Yes, we also privatised. We were in the business of privatisation ourselves.' This MPI is just another example of Labor's misrepresentation and their mischief. It is an example of the fog of Labor's hypocrisy, policy incompetence and ineptitude. All they do is oppose; they do not propose.
I think the member for Melbourne—the shadow communications minister—is a reasonable sort of guy. He believes in fairness, I think. He balances his very committed socialist leanings of nationalisation with hanging around the corridors of Melbourne merchant banks. I want to applaud him for his fairness in giving equal time to both sides of political philosophy. As the minister very appropriately and skilfully alluded, the government's record on privatisation and of making it very clear to the Australian people where it stands has been excellent. It has been clear and coherent. The government has explained to the Australian people—and, for my part, the people of Ryan—that it supports privatisation. There has been no misrepresentation or mischief in the way that the shadow minister's MPI reflects on the opposition.
We have gone to the Australian people at three elections and said, `We support privatisation.' We have a genuine commitment to what privatisation will do in the interests of our country, in the interests of competition and in the interests of making sure that the consumers of Australia benefit from privatisation. One of the main points that the shadow minister and the opposition always fail to bring up is that the government has accepted all of the 39 recommendations of the Estens inquiry. The independent Regional Telecommunications Service Inquiry provided a very comprehensive assessment of telecommunications services in regional Australia. It made 39 recommendations to ensure that the government did not leave the people of Australia, including the bush, out of all the benefits of telecommunications and privatisation. The government accepted all of those recommendations.
I want to take the opportunity to mention two of the recommendations which are relevant to this particular MPI, which are recommendations in relation to service adequacy. Recommendation 2.9 was that regional, rural and remote Australia not be forgotten and that the worst affected parts of rural and remote Australia be given special or additional attention from the government. The government has responded completely to recommendation 2.9. The government's position is that the ACA will commence work immediately on identifying the worst performing ESAs using the network reliability framework, and Telstra will provide the government with a formal undertaking on a strategy to improve the performance of identified ESAs, with time frames and funding commitments. So why don't those opposite, including the shadow minister and the opposition leader, mention that the 39 recommendations of the Estens inquiry have been positively responded to by the government? 
Recommendation 4.1 deals with dial-up Internet speeds. The RT inquiry noted that the Internet Assistance Program is achieving its objectives of helping users achieve faster and better Internet browsing capabilities and email services but, of course, recommended that a licence condition be imposed on Telstra to ensure that the benefits provided under the program will be guaranteed into the future—and this MPI is about the future. What has the government done? The government has responded very positively. It has said, `Yes, we will support this recommendation. Recommendation 4.1, which is about benefits to rural and regional Australia, will be guaranteed.' The government will impose a licence condition on Telstra to provide a minimum dial-up network speed for all Australians over its fixed line network.
All this nonsense and hypocrisy that we hear from the opposition is just part of their policy ineptitude and incompetence. The Liberals and the Nationals stand very united on this. We are very strongly in support of privatisation, because it is in the national interest. I wonder if the handful of Labor members opposite who hold shares in Telstra—Graham Edwards, Sid Sidebottom's spouse, I believe, and Warren Snowdon, the member for Lingiari—
 (Mr Barresi)—The member will refer to members by their electorates.
—I just wonder if those members will actually support the government's position. They hold shares in Telstra and they benefit from Telstra, so I encourage them to support the government's position, because it is in the national interest.
It is a shame we are allowed only 10 minutes to speak on this, because more time could be used to point out to the Australian people the real and complete issues. The other important thing the shadow minister always fails to bring up is that it was the opposition, when they were in government, that put Telstra under the jurisdiction of the Corporations Act. 
—It's us again!
—I do not recall the shadow minister or any of his colleagues, including the Leader of the Opposition, ever saying to the Australian people, `Actually, it was us when we were in government. We ensured that the Corporations Act would govern Telstra.' That is a very important point that needs to be added to the story where we are concerned.
In the remaining seconds I have, I want to turn to what the then Treasurer of the previous Labor government said in his second reading speech in relation to the sale of the Commonwealth Bank. He said:
... in the budget deliberations we considered the clear budgetary advantages of selling the government's remaining 50.4 per cent stake. The sale will make a major contribution to the reduction of outstanding government debt, to the benefit of all Australians. 
So is there a difference between, on the one hand, the proceeds from the sale of the Commonwealth Bank going to pay off debt and, on the other hand, the proceeds from the sale of Telstra being allocated to pay off the massive Labor debt that the Howard government inherited when it came to office in 1996?

"Windsor, Antony, MP",IND,2003-10-16,"—I am pleased to speak on this MPI. Unlike some of the others, I welcome the new Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts and wish him well. Given his legal background, I hope that he will understand quite fully the uncertainty that a lot of country people feel in relation to this legislation and the great concern they have that one government, under our Constitution, cannot bind future governments to decisions that are made now—no doubt he would be fully aware of that. I refer him to statements made by Senator Nick Minchin, the Minister for Finance and Administration, after the sale of Kingsford Smith airport. Those fears I spoke of were vindicated by him only two days after the sale. Two days before the sale, he was saying, `Government can guarantee certain service levels through regulation and legislation. It will be provided into the future—don't worry about it.' Two days after the sale they started to talk about possible changes. A 747 had a brake problem and all of a sudden they were talking about possible changes within the term of the parliament—not to mention outside the term of the parliament, where it would be unconstitutional.
I am very disappointed that the National Party are not here today. The Leader of the National Party, John Anderson, at their recent conference, made the point that he was very happy, and would like, to have a full-blown debate on the future of Telstra—but he is not here. He did not speak when he voted for the sale of Telstra—he was not interested in a full-blown debate then—and there are no National Party people speaking today. It is an absolute disgrace, in my view. Here is an opportunity for the Leader of the National Party to come in and use the forum of parliament to have that full-blown debate that he is quite willing to have—because there has apparently been all this mischievous information about the sale spread by the Labor Party, scurrilous Independents and others in rural Australia—and where is he? He is not here. It is very disappointing.
At their recent conference, the National Party did change their name. They are now called the Nationals. They are the very party that say to Independents and others in rural Australia, `You've got to belong to a party to achieve anything. To achieve anything in the parliamentary system, you must belong to a party,' and they have suddenly removed `party' from their name. No wonder people are terribly confused about the direction that these people are going in and the contradictory messages that they are sending.
The National Party are the party that say they will listen to country people. They are always saying that they are going to listen. They introduced a new logo and said, `We're going out there to listen; we're looking for local champions; we are going to listen; and we will be spending much more on infrastructure.' They even suggested that they may use some of the proceeds of Telstra. Some hard bargaining was done behind the scenes, and the figure of $5 billion that was going to be spent on country infrastructure came down and suddenly became nothing. I believe the member for Cowper—the custodian of small business in this so-called party that is not a party—was the one who negotiated the figure down from $5 billion to nothing. So the resolution that came from the conference was that nothing would be spent from the sale of Telstra. There are absolutely no guarantees, but they are there to listen and they are going to spend more money on infrastructure. 
But listening becomes a real problem when the people they are supposed to represent say that they do not want Telstra sold. They do not listen to those people. `Those people are idiots; they are wizened up idiots and they do not really know—but we know,' is what they say. They say they want to listen, but they do not want to hear. That has always been a great problem. John Anderson, the leader of the party, said at the national conference that he wanted a full-blown debate, and where is he today? I challenge him to come in today and tell the people out there who are going to vote for this new party that are not a party that he is listening to them and he is voicing their concerns. As I said, this is the party that do not want to be called a party. They stated at their conference that they want to be represented and they have to go out into the marketplace and be represented—
—Here he is: the member for Cowper. I am delighted to see him here: the champion of the $5 billion drop-out. The National Party stated at their conference that they are a party who want to be represented by local people and that the way forward is to go and get local champions who are concerned about local issues. If that is not an endorsement of Independents in country areas, I do not know what is! The National Party are the party that say Telstra legislation guarantees a country presence for Telstra into the future and then admit to the Senate inquiry that a regional presence is at the discretion of the minister of the day and that, in theory, a regional presence for Telstra could mean as little as one regional shop in Gundagai and one technician in Kalgoorlie.
I would suggest that the new minister is serious about putting in place things that he believes are fair for country people—and I congratulate him for that and wish him well—but he cannot guarantee those things into the future. He made certain comments in relation to concerns about what the Labor Party may do in the future—well, a lot of people are. The way to overcome that, Minister, is to leave the ownership of Telstra in the hands of the people of Australia. As I mentioned earlier, no government can bind a future government—our Constitution does not allow that to happen. Governments can change their minds; they can change the rules.
A number of polls have been mentioned from time to time in the parliament. When the National Party say that they are out there listening to people, why aren't they listening to the polls? Polls have been done by a number of members. The poll done by the member for Hume showed that over 90 per cent of his people suggested that they do not want Telstra sold. The result of the poll in the electorate of Calare was 90 per cent. The result of the poll in New England, my seat, was over 90 per cent. The result of the poll in Kennedy was over 90 per cent. The result of the poll in McMillan, a Labor seat in Victoria, was over 80 per cent. Even in the electorate of the member for Dawson—and I congratulate the National Party member for Dawson for attempting to listen to her constituency—the poll showed that 81 per cent of her electorate do not want Telstra sold. Talk about the $5 billion drop; we got the big dollar pass there: to take her out of the game they have promoted her for not listening to her constituency. That is an absolutely appalling indictment of what has happened.
But I think there are some local champions on the horizon. I note with interest that, in today's The Land, Mark Vaile is quoted as saying after the conference that branding and logos were meaningless without the `heart and soul'— 
 (Mr Barresi)—The member will refer to other members by their correct titles.
—The Minister for Trade, a National Party member—or a member of the Nationals, the party that are not a party anymore—said that branding and logos were meaningless without the `heart and soul' provided by its greatest asset, the people. The party that are not a party are not going to listen to these people, and the Minister for Trade recognises that. He is quoted as saying:
Without the heart and soul, the words and pictures are comforting but meaningless.
The article in The Land goes on to say:
... he argued that it was people with passion and commitment in the local communities who would make the difference for the party.
I think that says it all. I also noticed an editorial in the Daily Examiner—which the member for Page and the member for Cowper would be fully aware of. Part of the editorial says:
Ian Causley, Luke Hartsuyker and Doug's son Larry—
that is, Larry Anthony—
amongst others, are quite shameless despite the utter contempt with which they have treated their Page, Cowper and Richmond constituents on this issue—
the issue of the sale of Telstra. The editorial continues:
They belong to a political party—
this is when they were a party; this was a few weeks ago—
which clearly has lost any real identity and the backbone to stand up for bush interests.
That editorial, coming from the area where these people say they represent the constituents, indicates the real feeling of country people out there. It is about time that country people in this parliament followed the Alby Schultzes of this world—the member for Hume—and the other country members who have identified and listened to their constituents, and started to translate those messages into legislation. This is nothing but a massive cop-out that will affect country people. I congratulate the new minister for being in the House. I hope that he will take the lead on this, because it is quite obvious that the Nationals and many country Liberals within his government are not prepared to do so.",REPS,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Telstra: Regional Services</title>,Matters of Public Importance,18,1,speech
"Causley, Ian, MP",NP,2003-10-16,"—I am pleased to make a contribution to the debate on the matter of public importance regarding Telstra after the non-contribution from the member for New England. I have listened to him for 10 minutes to get some insight into what his thinking is on Telstra, but he has none at all. I have also listened to the member for Melbourne state the fact that he does not want the sale of Telstra to go ahead, but he puts forward no alternative. He now walks from the chamber because he knows he does not want to listen to this. He has no intellectual rigour in this debate. He simply says, `We don't want to sell Telstra.' I put it to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that it was the Labor Party—in fact, I think it was the former member for Dobell—that deregulated telecommunications. From the day telecommunications were deregulated, those non-profitable services in rural and regional Australia were at risk. They were at risk for a simple reason: no company that is out there to make a profit can carry those unprofitable services.
I never heard anything from the member for New England as to what he proposes. He is just a populist. He is irrelevant; for 10 years he was irrelevant in the state parliament and now he is irrelevant in the federal parliament. He came in here on some populist ruse. I challenge him to go back to the Northern Daily Leader in his electorate and ask its readers if they want to go back to 1988 when they were paying full price for services. I bet you they do not, because they now get their services at probably 25 per cent less. The editorial that he read out was written a while ago and when I approached the editor about that and asked him if he wanted to go back, he replied, `No, I do want to go back.' 
Even these people are not thinking this issue through. If Telstra is not sold, then who is going to prop up those unserviceable areas out in the bush—the ones that are not paying at the present time? The only argument the member for New England puts up is that we cannot bind a future government. You do not have to be Einstein to know that. I challenge the member for New England and I challenge the Labor Party to guarantee that they will give those same guarantees to the people. They should say upfront—before the election, in fact—if they are not prepared to give those guarantees to regional and rural Australia. If they are not, then they should tell the people of Australia that they intend to change them.
Telstra is a great Australian company. It has the potential and technology to deliver services overseas and earn export dollars. It cannot go forward if we do not let it go free, because no private company can exist when it is hobbled by government. That is what Telstra is at the present time: it is hobbled by government.
I think the member for Bonython said that the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts cannot guarantee that broadband will be rolled out. He did not read the government's reply to the Estens report, did he? The government guaranteed $143 million in upgrading the broadband in the areas of concern in that report. It is fairly clear that a smokescreen is being put up here. It is a disgrace, actually. The Labor Party and the Independents are trying to scare country New South Wales into believing that the sale of Telstra is a threat to them. It does not matter who owns Telstra. The real issue is who is going to give the guarantees on service to these areas into the future. At this stage, the only guarantee that I have heard is coming from this side of politics; it is coming from the Liberal Party and the Nationals. We are not hearing those guarantees coming from anyone else. And as Telstra, if it is not privatised, goes down—as it loses its market share, as it slowly but surely goes broke—who is going to tell regional and rural Australia that it was the Labor Party and the Independents that condemned it by their opposition? I will be one that will be out there telling the community fairly quickly.
The member for New England also said that at the Nationals' conference on the weekend we removed any mention of $5 billion. That was for good reason: we do not want to limit ourselves to $5 billion, I can assure you. We want unlimited dollars for some of the works that we want done in the bush. We want money for roads; we want money for the infrastructure of irrigation; and we want money for health services and education services. But do not forget the states—they have got to put their share in as well. I can tell the member for New England that we will be fighting very hard for those services. We do have a plan and we know that, unless we do it this way, country services will be worse off.

"Slipper, Peter, MP",LP,2003-10-16,"—I move: 
That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: RAAF Base Richmond Reinvestment Project, Richmond, NSW.
The Department of Defence proposes to undertake a reinvestment project at the Royal Australian Air Force Base Richmond near Richmond, New South Wales. RAAF Base Richmond is a major operational base that supports the delivery of airlift capability for the Australian Defence Force. It is currently the home of the airlift group, incorporating three operational squadrons and one training squadron of Hercules and Boeing 707 aircraft. Army units that are integrally linked with the airlift capability are also based at or at times supported from RAAF Base Richmond. The base contains one of the major airfields of Defence and is manned by about 2,500 service and civilian personnel.
This project is not a base redevelopment but rather a limited capital reinvestment to protect Commonwealth assets and maintain existing operational capabilities until such time as a government decision is made about the longer term future of the base. The aim of the project is to ensure that RAAF Base Richmond can continue to deliver operational capability to meet government objectives. This project seeks to improve, as far as practicable, safety and amenity deficiencies to maintain existing capabilities for the medium term. The proposed works focus on certain deficiencies in facilities and infrastructure that support capability. The project seeks to address the critical aspects of the engineering services and working and training accommodation. The proposed facilities are necessary to enable RAAF Base Richmond to perform its role in an efficient and cost effective manner.
Over the envisaged construction period of three years, an average of about 50 personnel will be directly employed on construction activities. In addition, it is anticipated that construction will generate further job opportunities off site in the prefabrication of components and the manufacture and distribution of materials. In its report, the Public Works Committee has recommended that this project proceed. The estimated out-turn cost of the proposed works is $35 million. Subject to parliamentary approval, the construction will start mid-2004 and be completed by December 2006. On behalf of the government, I would like to thank the committee for its report, and I commend the motion to the House.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Public Works Committee</title>,Committees,19,1,speech
"Bartlett, Kerry, MP",LP,2003-10-16,"—I am very pleased to hear that the Public Works Committee has recommended the expenditure of $35 million for the reinvestment project at RAAF Base Richmond. I want to thank members of the committee and the chair for their visit to my electorate to look at Richmond RAAF Base and this proposal, and I appreciate their support for the work that is going on at RAAF Richmond.
This expenditure is well overdue. We have seen about $20 million spent on RAAF Base Richmond on a number of projects in recent years, but this much more substantial redevelopment is vital. RAAF Base Richmond is the home of the airlift group, and the men and women of RAAF Richmond do a fantastic job for this country. In recent years they have been involved in East Timor, Kyrgyzstan, Bali, Iraq and the Solomons, and they do an outstanding job.
This $35 million to be spent on much needed infrastructure maintenance and improvements will maximise their operational efficiency. Some aspects of current arrangements do hinder efficiency in some areas. This expenditure will also ensure that they work and live in satisfactory conditions, necessary to keep up the morale of these men and women. This schedule of works will greatly help in this regard. 
However, this expenditure and the ongoing maintenance issues on the base do raise questions about the long-term future of RAAF Richmond. For some 20 to 30 years there have been rumours regarding the closure of RAAF Base Richmond. In 1991, under the former government, the force structure review flagged the relocation of the C130s, the prime platform of the airlift group, to Amberley. As a result of that, there has been reduced maintenance spending on Richmond for a number of years, and this has led to a deterioration in some of the facilities. This $35 million will address that deterioration and provide for much needed maintenance.
The Prime Minister's commitment back in 1998, I think, to RAAF Base Richmond being there until at least 2010 warrants this expenditure for the wellbeing of the RAAF personnel for at least the next seven years. But the question of the long-term future of Richmond does need to be addressed. I do not have time to address it in detail, but I will make a few comments. Firstly, the changing defence paradigm since the 1991 review means there are changing strategic and operational imperatives. These imperatives make it, in my view, absolutely necessary to keep the airlift group at Richmond. Many factors relate to this, including the recent decision to locate a second tactical assault group and an incident response regiment at Holsworthy in addition to the 3RAR and 4RAR that are there. There has also been a recent decision to put the central Defence warehousing at Moorebank. Many other industrial, military and personnel suppliers—the airlift group's key customers for transportation—are located in Sydney. It is therefore just a matter of commonsense that the chief transport base for those customers would also be based near Sydney.
The second point, briefly, is that economic arguments put in the past in favour of relocation simply do not hold water. They have fundamental flaws. Many of the assumptions on which the JLW study was done in 1997 are fundamentally flawed. They indicated perhaps only a four per cent saving at the most. That may well evaporate, and in fact a lot of evidence indicates that there may be a cost increase for any relocation to Amberley. So on strategic and economic grounds there is no justification at all for relocation from Richmond.
The third point I want to make, briefly, is that RAAF Richmond is critical to the Hawkesbury economy. It puts some $106 million a year into the Hawkesbury economy. I am pleased that this $35 million will be spent. It will inject money and jobs into our local economy. I welcome the expenditure—the government's commitment of $35 million—and I want to see more in years to come.

"Quick, Harry, MP",ALP,2003-10-16,"—Last week was Mental Health Week and today I rise to pay tribute to the members, workers and staff at the Eureka Clubhouse in Hobart, Tasmania. The dedicated staff are the director, Michelle Fay, David Scott, and part-time support workers, Jo-Anne Littleford, Conchita Navarro, Bunty Target-Seamour and Linda Seamour. These are a fine group of people who work magnificently with those that need help and assistance in a world that is fast paced and unforgiving.
Eureka Clubhouse is a psychosocial rehabilitation service for clients with mental health problems. The clients volunteer their time to run the organisation with the support of staff. The program empowers members to achieve goals by building on their strengths, helping with their self-esteem and assisting to break down the isolation that many people with mental illnesses experience. Eureka Clubhouse currently works with 280 members, and 25 to 40 members are involved from two to eight hours daily. Eureka Clubhouse has embarked on a truly innovative and world-class program by setting up commercial businesses that employ its members. 
We all know how hard it is for able-bodied Australians to find work. It is much harder for people with disabilities. With TQM, a cleaning service, Eureka Clubhouse achieves commercial goals and has generated the funds with which they were able to purchase the Court Cafe in the Northgate Shopping Centre. TQM has gardening and cleaning contracts with Tasmania Police, Housing Tasmania, private hospitals, the women's health centre and Centrelink. These agencies are to be commended for their support of the Eureka Clubhouse members and their staff, while of course expecting quality work and value for their money.
The Monday before last, I was delighted to officially open Eureka's latest venture, Court Cafe. Court Cafe is in the food court at the Northgate Shopping Centre, Glenorchy—a suburb of Hobart. The cafe is right in the public eye and provides a diverse range of work for the Eureka Clubhouse clients. Court Cafe is a fantastic opportunity for members to gain experience, which hopefully will lead to longterm mainstream employment. Patrons expect and receive the best in friendly and efficient service while having a cuppa or a wonderful snack at the cafe. Court Cafe is also involved in outside catering on a regular basis.
Eureka Clubhouse is a specialised open employment service for people who have a mental illness. It helps with resumes, job hunting and interview techniques to assist its members. Twenty members now receive award wages, with 90 per cent of the people who are seeking employment in the program achieving some employment goals. Eureka's community input is to educate other organisations through the year by holding information sessions at their workplaces, having stalls at expos and taking part in Mental Health Week activities. Eureka Clubhouse is a valued service to the people of Hobart and of great benefit to the people with mental health problems. Tonight I would like to congratulate them all on their progress, achievements and outcomes for the people who really do need that extra assistance. Well done to everyone at the Eureka Clubhouse.
