Senator DUNIAM
 (Tasmania) (09:32):  Last night I was mid-flight, talking about the history of tobacco excise in Australia. Given that I was cut off midstream, I think it is a good opportunity for me to recap some of the statistics that—



Senator Ian Macdonald interjecting—




Senator DUNIAM:
  Yes, I thought that would be a good idea, Senator Macdonald—to recap on some of the statistics around the importance of dealing with tobacco related and cancer related diseases. I mentioned yesterday the fundamental fact that tobacco was responsible for about 7.8 per cent of the total burden of disease and injury in Australia, as reported in 2003, which I am told is the equivalent of 15,000 deaths per year. And, as was noted by a number of other speakers in the debate, it is responsible for a cost of around $31.5 billion in health, social and economic related costs in the years 2004-05. You have to wonder where that cost is at today. So this merely highlights the importance of this piece of legislation as one of the suite of measures that have been put in place by this government to deal with smoking and smoking related diseases. 


Some of the other statistics I went through yesterday related to our home state of Tasmania and where we stand with reference to the rest of the country. Some of those statistics were quite alarming. In terms of my own cohort, younger males in Tasmania between the ages of 25 and 34, about 40 per cent of that demographic are smokers. Then you move up to the 35- to 44-year-olds and it is not much lower—about 38.6 per cent—far too high, as I said yesterday. I think most senators in this chamber would agree. 


The one most concerning statistic about the health and wellbeing of younger Tasmanians, as I said yesterday, is that Tasmania continues to have the highest proportion of women who smoke during pregnancy. That is not just impacting the individual smoking, but the unborn child. The prevalence of young women smoking during pregnancy in Tasmania was 35.7 per cent for those under 20, and 30.8 per cent for those aged between 20 and 24. Amongst Indigenous Tasmanians it was found to be almost 50 per cent of the population in 2008—44.5 per cent. 


I touched on the problems related to minors smoking tobacco in our state. The 2011 Australian secondary school alcohol and drug survey showed that six per cent of 12- to 15-year-olds were smokers. I certainly was not smoking back then. I did not really even have a good understanding of what these sticks that people were putting in their mouths were. But to learn that five years ago—and I hope that number has gone down—six per cent of people in that age group, 12 to 15 years of age, were smoking is just incredibly alarming. Then you move to the slightly higher age group 16- and 17-year-olds—still under the legal age—16 per cent of them have taken up the habit. 


But the best statistic, I think, is in relation to how younger people have become aware over recent years—through various education campaigns, through the packaging legislation and the like, and various community attitudes which seem to be prevailing at the moment—about the impact that smoking has on one's health. The 2011 survey that I mentioned earlier on reported that 96 per cent of students agree that smoking causes lung cancer and harms unborn babies. So, while there are those alarming statistics, which I have recapped on now, I think it is great to know that young people, who have their whole lives ahead of them, are beginning to appreciate the damage they are doing to their bodies, and those around them, with reference to smoking. 


I was also speaking about the history of tobacco laws, particularly the excise tax situation in Australia, but one thing I want to touch on in Tasmania are smoke-free zones. Over the years, there have been a number of legislative measures put in place in the state of Tasmania regarding restrictions on smoking in certain areas. We all know you cannot smoke in planes, workplaces and other obvious locations, but in Tasmania in the year 2001 it became illegal to smoke in workplaces and in enclosed public places, such as shopping centres, restaurants, factories, hospitals, corridors and toilets. 


Further smoke-free areas were introduced in the state of Tasmania, including three metres outside entrances and exits of aforementioned locations; within 10 metres of ventilation equipment, air conditioning towers and things like that—which I think is a good move, because what is the point of restricting smoking inside if you are just going to blow it in through the air conditioning ducts; inside work vehicles and also in seating at cultural and sporting events and venues. 


Then you move through to 2005, where gaming areas and nightclubs were added to that list, and then a 50 per cent portion of outdoor dining areas. In 2006 pubs and clubs and hotels in Tasmania became smoke-free on the inside—completely smoke-free. Then, fast-forwarding to 2012, there were new smoke-free areas introduced, including playgrounds, patrolled beaches, pedestrian and bus malls and bus shelters. Then it was 100 per cent of outdoor dining areas, which is something I recall in the local media in Tasmania caused a great deal of consternation around people wanting to enjoy a cigarette while having their meal or their drink. But I think for the most part people welcomed the right to have a meal without having to inhale their neighbouring table's smoke. 


Then it was competition and seating areas at sporting events and other large public events. Later that year, carols by candlelight events were required to be smoke-free. The next year, 2013, selected markets and food and wine festivals and music festivals were added to the list. This was in addition to specific measures by the Hobart City Council and the Launceston City Council. And it is this combination of approaches to restricting where smoking can take place, and indeed measures like this—like the excise tax—which have helped Australia tackle the problem of smoking and the impact on health in our country. Thank you, Mr President.

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",NXT,2016-09-14,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (09:39):  I support the Excise Tariff Amendment (Tobacco) Bill 2016 and the Customs Tariff Amendment (Tobacco) Bill 2016. This is important legislation, given that each year smoking kills an estimated 15,000 Australians and costs Australians $31.5 billion in social—including health—and economic costs. These are statistics from the Department of Health; they are uncontroverted. We know the damage that smoking does. There are some aspects of this legislation that ought to be ventilated in the context of how it will operate. I also want to raise the issue of the paucity of anti-smoking measures and support for those that want to quit smoking.


Back in 2004, as a member of the South Australian Legislative Council, I moved an amendment to legislation that the South Australian Labor government introduced to ensure there was a trial of at least 1,000 places, 1,000 individuals, to get the benefit of free nicotine replacement therapy. It was something that the Labor government in South Australia inexplicably opposed. It was supported by the opposition and the crossbenchers, and at the end of the day it got up and the trial went ahead, as I understand it. 


The issue here is an important one. It is as relevant now as it was back in 2004—that is, governments seem to be willing to rake in massive amounts of revenue from tobacco excise. Let us put this in some perspective. In 2009-10, $5.6 billion was raised; in 2010-11, $6.3 billion; in 2011-12, $5.4 billion; in 2012-13, $5.8 billion; in 2013-14, when there was a jump in the excise, $8.4 billion; and, in 2014-15, the most recent year that I have details for, $8.8 billion. That works out to something like $40 billion over that period. How much did the federal government spend during that period on anti-smoking campaigns? The figure I have for that period is $135 million. When compared to something like $40 billion in revenue, that is a pretty poor effort. 


If we are serious about reducing the smoking rate as quickly as possible to reduce the impact of smoking on the community, to ensure that we do not have 15,000 Australians dying each year because of smoking and to ensure that it does not cost our nation $31½ billion a year in social, health and economic costs, then we need to be fair dinkum about providing more resources for anti-smoking campaigns. We need also to make it easier for people wanting to quit by giving them all the support they need, and we need to ensure that we do not demonise smokers. 


In relation to nicotine replacement therapy, an issue that I raised in the South Australian parliament back in 2004, the cost to government in repatriation, in PBS benefits for smoking cessation therapy, for 2014 was $47.8 million. There is a real issue as to whether nicotine replacement therapy ought be free or ought to be trialled on a free basis, rather than people having to put their hands in their pockets, to make it much easier for people to kick the habit. It is a very addictive habit. We need to assist people to kick the habit as soon as possible. 


I will be asking the government what commitments they will be making with the additional excise they will get from this legislation. What commitments will they be making to ensure that there will be more help for people to quit smoking? I note the objective of these bills is to improve the health of Australians by reducing their exposure to tobacco products. Under this legislation, increases in excise ensure that average cigarette prices are more closely aligned with the World Health Organization recommendation concerning the proportion that excise and excise-equivalent customs duty should comprise of the price of a cigarette.


I hope this legislation will be examined in a short committee stage. I ask the government what commitments there are to spend the massive increase in tobacco excise the Commonwealth has been getting in recent years on nicotine replacement therapy, on Quit campaigns and on funding organisations such as Action on Smoking and Health, which I worked with over the years and which did a terrific job of advocacy in the public health space in relation to this. These are important issues that much must be dealt with, in my view, for the government to tell us what is happening in relation to this matter.


There is also another issue that concerns me and, whether you support or oppose this legislation, it ought to concern all of us. It relates to the flaws in the collection of this excise. An article in The Australian FinancialReview on 30 May this year by Joanna Mather and Fleur Anderson states:


An audit report has identified serious shortcomings in the collection of taxes on imported tobacco products, which are worth about $8 billion a year.


That report, by the Auditor-General, headed Administration of tobacco excise equivalent goods, in respect of the Australian Taxation Office and the Department of Immigration and Border Protection, was transmitted to the Speaker and to you, Mr President, on 5 May this year and raised some very, very serious concerns.


The ANAO report found that there were few checks and balances in place when it comes to the administration of tobacco excise equivalent goods and that the collection of customs duty had fallen far short of effective practice. I repeat that: the Auditor-General, no less, said that the way we collect tobacco excise in this country has 'fallen far short of effective practice'. The report says that the risk of noncompliance was assessed by the ATO as ranging from moderate in 2011 to significant in 2015, when there was:


… an observed increase in the number of entities displaying non-compliant behaviour that are importing tobacco and/or storing imported tobacco.


The Auditor-General's report goes on to say:


The ATO advised that the reason for the changed risk ratings over the years is largely a consequence of shifts in focus brought by different ATO managers when scoping risk assessments.


The Auditor-General says that the fact that the risk was raised to 'significant':


… was driven by the reputational risk for the ATO and DIBP—


that is, the Department of Immigration and Border Protection—


as a result of large seizures of illicit tobacco … and a noted increase in the incidence of theft from smaller warehouses (that account for approximately two per cent of the revenue collected).


The government ought to tell us what it is doing in response to an Auditor-General's report of May of this year that was very critical about the lack of checks and balances in place when it comes to the collection of tobacco excise. These are issues that ought to be raised. I again put the government on notice, given that there are a number of other speakers on this debate. What will the government do in terms of increasing the amount available for Quit campaigns to make it easier for those people that want to quit to get the help and support they deserve so that we can make even greater inroads into reducing the awful death rate from tobacco products and the enormous cost—the $31½ billion cost—to our community as a result of the consumption of tobacco in this country?

"Hume, Sen Jane",LP,2016-09-14,"



Senator HUME
 (Victoria) (09:48):  I rise to speak on the Excise Tariff Amendment (Tobacco) Bill 2016 and the Customs Tariff Amendment (Tobacco) Bill 2016. The coalition is particularly proud of these bills, which will increase tobacco excise charged on domestic production and equivalent customs duties charged on imports by way of four annual increases of 12.5 per cent a year from 2017 to 2020. These increases will replicate the annual increases that were put in place by the former government and continued by this government from 2013 to 2016. In addition, adult average weekly ordinary time earnings based indexation of tobacco excise rates will continue. The next biannual indexation of tobacco excise will occur on 1 March 2017.


From 1 September this year, the excise and excise-equivalent duty rates on tobacco are just over 61c per stick and $763.20 per kilogram of tobacco content. This equates to $15.26 in excise on a packet of 25 cigarettes, which currently retails for approximately $25. Ignoring biannual indexation, the 12.5 per cent increases will increase excise per packet of 25 cigarettes by around $2 each year. This means that, after the final increase in 2020, the excise component of a packet of 25 cigarettes will be around $21.50. The increase in excise and duty will move Australia towards the World Health Organization's recommendation that excise should comprise around 70 per cent of the price of a cigarette. The precise impact on price is uncertain, because tobacco companies may alter their prices beyond that excise change, and that is something which is out of our control. 


A number of speakers have already mentioned that each year smoking kills an estimated 15,000 Australians and costs Australia $31.5 billion in social costs, including health costs. This bill particularly aims to reduce the prevalence of smoking in Australia and therefore to minimise the harm of cigarette smoking to the community. The Turnbull government is greatly concerned about the serious health risks of smoking and has continued the efforts of previous governments to support and build on Australia's great success in tobacco control. The excise increases announced in the 2015-16 budget are firmly based on the evidence that they will further help reduce smoking rates in Australia.


To give a brief history of tobacco control in Australia, in 1997 the government implemented a national tobacco campaign. In 2006, graphic health warnings were introduced on most tobacco packaging—and they still scare the bejesus out of most people on a daily basis. Some of those pictures are just terrifying. In 2010, there was a 25 per cent increase in tobacco excise. In 2011, tobacco plain packaging became law. There was some controversy surrounding that, but we believe that it has certainly had an impact. In 2012, all tobacco products sold in Australia were required to be in plain packaging, with updated and expanded health warnings. In 2013, we started seeing stepped tobacco excise increases, with 12½ per cent increases in 2013, 2014 and 2015. In 2016, a post-implementation review published on the Office of Best Practice Regulation website on 26 February found that tobacco plain packaging had begun to achieve its objectives. The last 12½ per cent increase in excise kicked in very recently in 2016. 


Increasing the price of tobacco products through taxes is widely recognised as an effective and cost-effective tobacco control intervention for reducing tobacco use, particularly among youth and people from lower socioeconomic groups—those disadvantaged communities where smoking is most prevalent. Increased prices may cause some financial stress; that is understood. However, we do believe that that is offset in Australia by the provision of accessible and affordable cessation treatment—something that Senator Xenophon recently spoke about—both in services and in therapies. In Australia, the 2010 post-implementation review, PIR, conducted by the Treasury, estimated that, of the 25 per cent tobacco excise increase, there was an 11 per cent decrease in tobacco consumption. That was based on import data. That was just over two years, which is a fairly significant impact. 


The guidelines that the World Health Organization issue recommend that excise account for at least 70 per cent of the retail price, and it has been very challenging for Australia to reach those World Health Organization targets. Tobacco manufacturers have taken the opportunity to increase the price of their product at the same time that excise increases, which is sort of muddying the waters. As reported in 2015 in the World Health Organization report on the global tobacco epidemic, as of mid-2014—and since then there have been already two more 12.5 per cent excise increases as well as biannual increases in excise in line with wage inflation—Australia's total taxes applied to cigarettes were the sixth highest among 106 countries who reported to the World Health Organization.


It also accounted for, at this stage, 47.67 per cent of the total retail price of the most popular brand of cigarettes, which was Winfield 20 packs. Goodness me, when did Winfields become the most popular brand? I speak as an ex-smoker. I was actually one of those smokers who gave up when they became pregnant. But I was a passionate smoker. In fact, I think I might have smoked for Australia at one stage; I was very good at it. 




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  A carton of Winfields.




Senator HUME:
  A carton—that is exactly right. It was not quite a carton of Winfields. I think I smoked something far more glamorous than that. I was one of the few people, I think, that made smoking look attractive and sexy. 




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  And you would have.




Senator HUME:
  Thank you.



An opposition senator interjecting—  




Senator HUME:
  No, I did not. It is a terrible habit. So, at that stage, those excises accounted for just over 47½ per cent of the total retail price of the most popular brand and gave Australia the seventh highest after-tax cigarette price in the world. 


Tobacco is one of the leading causes of preventable disease and premature death in Australia. The ABS data indicates that smoking rates in Australia dropped to 14.5 per cent among adults in 2014 and 2015, compared with 16.1 per cent in 2011 and 2012 and 22.3 per cent in 2001. The ABS data also demonstrated that significant gains have been made in reducing the prevalence of daily smoking in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people aged 15 and over, which is down to 39 per cent in 2014-15 from 45 per cent in 2008 and 49 per cent in 2002. So headway is certainly being made with this particular community where there is entrenched socioeconomic disadvantage.


Australia has a broad range of tobacco control measures in place already and has sustained a multifaceted approach over the past several decades, which has helped to achieve the decline in national smoking prevalence. Interventions include excise increases, very effective education programs and campaigns, plain packaging of tobacco products, large graphic health warnings, prohibiting tobacco advertising and promotion, and providing support for smokers to quit the habit.


Ongoing tobacco interventions, including excise increases, are critical to ensure that the prevalence of smoking in Australia continues to decline. It is incorrect to assume that the rate of reduction of smoking prevalence can be maintained without additional tobacco control efforts. Evidence from Australia and overseas shows that when tobacco control efforts stall so does the decline in smoking prevalence.


Increasing the price of cigarettes via taxation is one of the most effective ways of reducing tobacco consumption and preventing the uptake of smoking. Higher prices encourage smokers to quit or reduce their consumption, while also discouraging potential smokers, including young Australians, from taking up the habit.


The adult daily smoking rate was 14.5 per cent of the population in 2014-15. This measure—increasing the excise on tobacco—will assist the government to make progress on the Council of Australian Governments' target to reduce the adult daily smoking rate to 10 per cent of the population, and to halving the daily rate of smoking among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people by 2018. That is a target of the Council of Australian Governments.


Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians, people in remote areas and people on the lowest socioeconomic status all have higher rates of smoking compared to the general population. Although these groups will, undoubtedly, experience a decline in purchasing power if they keep smoking, they will also receive the income and health benefits from quitting.


This change sits alongside the numerous interventions that the Commonwealth has taken to reduce the prevalence of smoking, including a comprehensive ban on tobacco advertising and promotion, retail display bans, Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme subsidies for smoking cessation supports, and extensive and continuing public education campaigns.


These bills will raise $4.59 billion across the forward estimates period. Goods and Services Tax receipts are estimated to increase by $430 million over that same period. The revenue gained from higher tobacco excise will be used by the government to provide a range of services but, importantly, that range includes health services. It is a very important measure. It is an important part of the government's comprehensive tobacco control strategy, which includes investment in anti-smoking social marketing campaigns, subsidies for nicotine replacement therapies and the introduction of plain packaging for tobacco products.


The government announced in the budget that it will strengthen the penalties for illicit tobacco offences and will provide an additional $7.7 million for the Tobacco Strike Team to combat illicit tobacco activity. The primary responsibility for the illicit trade in tobacco rests with the DIBP and the Australian Taxation Office. The DIBP received funding in the 2016-17 budget to tackle illicit trade in tobacco. Currently, there is no reliable estimate of the size of the illicit tobacco trade in Australia. The DIBP and the ATO are working to develop a reliable estimate.


Some commentators suggest that tobacco control interventions, such as excise increases and tobacco plain packaging, increase this illicit trade. There is, in fact, no reliable evidence that this is the case. However, there is international evidence to suggest that illicit tobacco market size does tend to be driven more by supply factors, including the cost of supply to market, which is very high in Australia, and also the level of law enforcement activity, the presence of corruption, the likelihood of detection, and the scale of penalties. 


As such, tackling the illicit trade in tobacco should not involve weakening effective tobacco control measures; rather, it should be addressed by strong enforcement and compliance measures. Australia has a strong and active enforcement regime aimed at combating the illegal trade in tobacco products, and this is made stronger through the most recent budget allocations to Border Force. The trade in illicit tobacco attracts significant penalties under the Customs Act 1901 and the Excise Act 1901. Tobacco smuggling is punishable by fines and up to 10 years imprisonment.


Public health advocates say that the latest tax hike on cigarettes will cut smoking rates even further from the already steep falls that we have seen in recent years and could even lead to Australia becoming practically smoke free. The number of smokers in Australia has dwindled over recent decades. As I said, it was nearly one-quarter in the early 1990s and it is now closer to only 13 per cent. That is due to previous excise increases and public health measures like banning smoking in public areas and plain-packaging laws.


The chief executive of the Cancer Council of Australia, Professor Sanchia Aranda, said that price is an important factor in people's decision to smoke. She said:


Every time you increase the excise consumption goes down. We anticipate if there were four of these recurrent tobacco increases over time, that about 320,000 current smokers would attempt and be likely to quit as a result of all four increases, and about 40,000 teenagers would be deterred from taking up smoking. In the longer term that means tens of thousands of cancer deaths would be prevented.


Professor Aranda also that lung cancer was still the most significant preventable cancer in Australia.


But there is a view that increases in tobacco excise punishes those on low incomes. The reality is that tobacco tax increases are particularly effective in prompting people in those lower socioeconomic groups—those most disadvantaged in our society—to quit smoking. This is very important because disadvantaged groups tend to bear a disproportionately heavy tobacco death and disease burden.


There is also a claim that increasing tobacco excise would be a tax grab. But what does the community think? It is very hard to imagine any blatant tax grab being popular; however, the Newspoll research shows that 73 per cent of Australians support an increase in tobacco excise. That is not just the nonsmokers talking. Recently, Quit Victoria research showed that 60 per cent of smokers supported a tobacco tax increase—and why wouldn't they, when it can literally save their lives.


The tax grab theory has another major flaw: increasing tobacco excise is the most effective measure available to governments for reducing the social and economic costs of tobacco use. The World Bank and the World Health Organization say so, as do analyses of Australian trends in tobacco consumption done in the 1990s. So the health benefits of the tax are really what matter. The revenue should be seen as a fortuitous by-product, generating funds to reinvest in public health.


Some critics point to the tax increases potentially boosting the tobacco black market—and, yes, illegal tobacco is a very serious issue. But this can be addressed, and is being addressed, in this bill through tighter policing. Ultimately, as policy measures such as increased tobacco excise continue to denormalise smoking in our communities, the market itself will become far less lucrative.


Smoking is the leading cause of death and disability in Australia. If there were any other preventable cause of so many deaths—an infectious disease, terrorism or road trauma—the government would be expected to take action. This government is taking action. Quite frankly, the Australian people should expect nothing less of us.

"Paterson, Sen James",LP,2016-09-14,"



Senator PATERSON
 (Victoria) (10:08):  I warmly welcome the opportunity to contribute to this important debate on the Excise Tariff Amendment (Tobacco) Bill 2016 and the Customs Tariff Amendment (Tobacco) Bill 2016, which are being put forward by the Turnbull government. After decades of advertising, education and taxes, every Australian now knows that cigarettes are bad for your health. It would be hard not to realise that, given the mountain of effort being put in by governments around the world, particularly in Australia, on educating people about those risks. 


Personally, I have never been a fan of smoking, whether it is cigarettes, cigars, cigarillos, or any other smoking products. They just do not agree with me. I have never been able to bear smoking myself, but I do recognise that there are other people who do smoke and enjoy it—and I will come to that later.


My late nan was a very heavy smoker for many years, and late in her life she suffered emphysema as a result of her smoking. I have to say it was not a very pretty thing to watch—it was very sad to see her health decline as a direct result of decisions that she had made during her life.


So I am not sad, and I do not think anyone in Australia would be sad, to see the continuing decline of smoking as a habit. That is something I think we should all welcome. The adult daily smoking rate in 2014-15 was 14½ per cent. While that is still a high figure, it is certainly a dramatic improvement from the figures only a few decades ago. COAG has agreed to a bipartisan intergovernmental target of 10 per cent, and I think that is a reasonable target although I am sure all Australians would hope that in due course no Australians will be choosing to smoke.


The excise on a packet of cigarettes today is about two-thirds of the total value of a packet of cigarettes. Today a packet of 25 cigarettes retails for about $25, and about $15 of that $25 is excise which is collected by the government. This measure proposed by the government will only increase the proportion of a packet of cigarettes that is collected by the government. It is somewhat ironic that in many ways it could be argued that the government profits from the sale of cigarettes more than tobacco companies do. Given this, it is vitally important that the government should take complementary action at the same time to combat illicit tobacco. When we charge an extra dollar of excise we increase the incentive of people to buy, sell and traffic in illicit tobacco, which, by its very nature, avoids excise. 


Illicit tobacco is a serious problem around the world and it is a serious problem in Australia. A report by KPMG this year estimated that the revenue lost to government from the illicit trade is more than $1 billion a year. From a public policy standpoint that is obviously a very serious problem, but it is not the only problem from illicit tobacco. Illicit tobacco also fuels criminal behaviour, including organised crime, bikie gangs and international criminal syndicates. It hurts law-abiding small businesses, who find it very difficult to compete with people who are able to charge much lower prices for illegal products because they choose not to pay the excise they should. The quality of the illicit product, such as you can measure the quality of a tobacco product, is vastly inferior to the quality of a legal product and is even worse for human health than legal tobacco products.


Predominantly the illegal tobacco that we have in this country is now imported—it is mostly sourced from overseas and it is mostly smuggled into Australia using various means. However, there is still, as there has been for some time in this country, a domestic illegal tobacco growing industry. As reported by Rob Harris in the Herald Sun in April this year, the Australian Taxation Office conducted a raid and seized a record $15.4 million worth of illegal tobacco growing on a northern Victorian farm. A community tip-off led to the ATO raid on what they described as a large and sophisticated growing and processing operation near Kerang. This tobacco that was seized amounted to about 30 million cigarettes—and this is just from one farm in one area of northern Victoria. It demonstrates the strength of the illegal tobacco industry here in Australia and the importance of cracking down on it. 


This government takes the threat of illicit tobacco very seriously. That is why we established the Australian Border Force tobacco strike team—to crack down particularly on that imported tobacco—and that is why the ATO continues to investigate, raid and crack down on the domestic growing of illegal tobacco. In the latest budget, as a complementary measure to the legislation we are discussing today, the government announced that it would provide an extra $7.7 million for the tobacco strike team to help crack down on illicit tobacco.


I want to make two wider points about this debate and policy. Ultimately, tobacco is a legal product in Australia. Although I strongly disapprove of it and strongly encourage people to not start smoking in the first place—and if they are smoking today, I strongly encourage them to quit smoking—ultimately, I think we have to accept that there will be some people who, even understanding the very serious risks of smoking, will still choose to smoke. In a free society, people must be able to make decisions which we disapprove of, as much as we counsel them against it. While ever we decide that tobacco remains a legal product—and I am not aware of any proposals, at least before this chamber, to make it illegal—we have to accept that some people are going to smoke, and that is their choice.


There are people who still do choose to smoke. I have spoken to people who, understanding the risks, still think it is worthwhile and something that they enjoy or because they are addicted have difficulty giving it up. This ties into my second point: that there are two potential solutions to this problem. The first is the government driven approach. This is something which has been used quite effectively in Australia over the last 30 to 40 years to significantly reduce the rate of smoking. There is no doubt that there has been a great success in this area. We have used quite high levels of taxation, taxpayer funded advertising and education in the community, particularly through our schools, to educate people about the dangers of smoking and to encourage them to quit. The result of that has been a significant reduction in the rate of smoking.


What we have noticed though in recent years, particularly over the last decade, is that the rate of reduction of smoking has begun to plateau as we get down to the more hardcore smokers,—who are committed and understand the risks; who bear the cost and continue to smoke. That is why the government has, in a bipartisan way, considered some other, more exotic measures, to address this, such as plain packaging of tobacco products, as a way of getting through that barrier and further reducing smoking. That is why this government has decided to further increase excise. Excise has certainly been an effective approach and I will be supporting this bill for that reason.


However, I think it is important that, while we support these measures, we acknowledge that there are some drawbacks for these measures. I am concerned, as I know many Australians are generally, about property rights in this country and the need and importance of protecting those property rights. I think that property rights are not just confined to physical land and property and that the seizure of that by government should be protected by our Constitution and our courts; also that intellectual property is property and that it should also be protected. We should be aware that the plain packaging legislation and the High Court decision that followed effectively removed the ability for companies to use a property right which they created. We should be mindful of the limitations of that. We may still decide that it is a worthwhile thing, but we should be aware of the costs of that.


Another thing which I think we have to be particularly aware of in the taxation space is that excise taxes on products like tobacco—but not only tobacco; including alcohol as well—disproportionately affect lower income people. These are taxes which are not levied according to their ability to pay; not levied according to income, wealth or any other measure. They are levied according to a lifestyle choice which people make: to smoke or, in other cases, to drink. The evidence shows that lower income earners disproportionately still choose to smoke. When we increase these taxes, we are, in effect, increasing what is a regressive tax. I know, when we debate other taxation measures in this place, some people who favour an increase in the GST—I am not one of them, but some people do—have come up against resistance that it would be regressive and would impact the poor less. The GST, at least, applies relatively equally to everyone; tobacco excises apply disproportionately to the poor. That is something that I think we need to be very conscious of.


The second thing is that we are running into the limitations of the approach we have taken over the last 30 to 40 years. We have reduced it dramatically, but the rate of reduction has started to slow. I think that means we should start to look at wider measures and other measures to address this. One which I think we should consider is a more free market approach—that is using choices that people are already making in their lives, enabling them to make those choices that are healthier choices than smoking conventional cigarettes. In this area, we have a range of new products that technology has brought to us, including e-cigarettes and other forms of smoking, sometimes called reduced-risk products, which use technology to reduce the impact of tobacco smoke and particularly the burning of tobacco, which is very toxic to inhale. This is a free market approach because it does not rely on mandates or taxes; it relies on choices.


In Australia right now, it is not lawful to sell e-cigarette products, but there are many people who have chosen to take up these products because they prefer them to cigarettes or as a measure of reducing their reliance on cigarettes, or just as something which is more convenient than cigarettes. That is even with them not being lawful. I think we have to look very seriously at whether or not we should legalise these products, and there is an application, I understand, before the Therapeutic Goods Administration right now to legalise an e-cigarette style product as a tobacco cessation measure—as a measure to get people off tobacco. I think that would be a very good thing.


So I just want to summarise some of the research and views on this issue. It is fair to say that the public health lobby in Australia are not supportive of e-cigarettes. They are very sceptical about them. People such as Emeritus Professor Simon Chapman, a noted sociologist and advocate of tobacco control, have been very much opposed to allowing e-cigarettes to be legalised, as have bodies such as Quit Victoria, who last year called for e-cigarettes to be clarified to be illegal—for their retail sale to be banned in Victoria—and, interesting, for smoke-free laws to be extended to cover all e-cigarette use. That is an interesting one given that what is emitted from an e-cigarette is water vapour. We should be concerned about second-hand smoke. That is an issue. You can get cancer from second-hand smoke; that is what the science suggests. You cannot get cancer from e-cigarette water vapour, though. There is no evidence of that, so it does seem strange to me that we would apply laws designed to limit second-hand smoke cancer from conventional burning of tobacco to a water vapour which carries no tobacco at all. In fact, it only delivers nicotine to the user; it does not even deliver it into the atmosphere around them.


Thirdly, there are calls to ban advertising and promotion of e-cigarettes. Again, I understand what is perhaps the rationale behind this, but one of the limitations of banning advertising is that advertising is information. It allows people to learn about new products, and it would allow, for example, retailers of e-cigarettes to notify current smokers that they may be able to reduce the risk and harm to their health by switching from cigarettes to e-cigarettes. That is Quit Victoria's position.


The Heart Foundation in the ACT are also opposed. They have lobbied to make sure that e-cigarettes are more strictly banned than they are and to prevent them. I think that is broadly representative. The Cancer Council of Australia has issued concerns. Professor Ian Olver, writing for the Cancer Council's website, said that there is not sufficient evidence that electronic cigarettes would help smokers to quit, and there are also concerns that electronic cigarettes could keep smokers addicted to tobacco by providing a nicotine hit in smoke-free places. There are also concerns that e-cigarettes may, in the words of some, 'normalise' the use of cigarettes. I am not sure that there is sufficient evidence to back that up, but that is the view of some in the public health industry.


But I have to say one of the puzzling reasons for opposing the sale of e-cigarettes put forward by Professor Ian Olver is that it might allow tobacco companies to continue to be profitable and to continue to exist. I think that is a very strange reason when our focus should be on public health. I think, actually, it would be a good thing if cigarette companies got rid of their old products and moved towards newer products which are healthier and safer. They may still have some risk but, I think, certainly pose less of a risk than cigarettes. I think that would be a very welcome development, but some people are opposed to allowing these products to be legal because it would continue cigarette companies' profitability and allow them to continue to exist.


The Australian government, I think it is fair to say, has taken a generally sceptical approach to e-cigarettes. The TGA issued, in March last year, some preliminary commentary on e-cigarettes. They described them in the technical detail of how they work, and they said that at the moment there is not a great deal of evidence to support their use—certainly as a nicotine replacement therapy. But since the government issued that view I think there has been a development of the evidence base in this area, and I am encouraged by the developments. As the National Health and Medical Research Council in Australia has said, there is a widely held belief that e-cigarettes are likely to be less harmful than tobacco cigarettes because they expose users to fewer toxic chemicals. They say that there is some preliminary evidence which supports that view, so I think it would be fair to describe the NHMRC as cautiously open to the potential benefits of e-cigarettes, although, as I said, the Australian government's position is generally sceptical about the construction of e-cigarettes.


I want to refer to an excellent article written by my former colleague at the great organisation the Institute of Public Affairs Simon Breheny. It was in The Daily Telegraph in March last year. He reviewed some of the evidence available on this at that time. He cited one article published in August 2014 in the peer-reviewed Journal of Public Health. What the journal concluded was that the use of e-cigarettes can reduce the number of cigarettes smoked and the withdrawal symptoms. In an article for BMC Medicine last year, Peter Hajek of the Wolfson Institute of Preventive Medicine said:


Although there is no doubt that smokers switching to electronic cigarettes (EC) substantially reduce the risk to their health, some tobacco control activists and health organisations discourage smokers from using EC and lobby policy makers to reduce EC use by draconian regulation.


One thing which I think is becoming increasingly clear is that Australia is getting out of step with the rest of the world on this, and particularly the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom have been quite forward-looking on this issue and have been—and their public health community in particular—much more willing to contemplate this. Public Health England, which is a government body, has said:


In a nutshell, best estimates show e-cigarettes are 95% less harmful to your health than normal cigarettes, and when supported by a smoking cessation service, help most smokers to quit tobacco altogether.


The UK Royal College of Physicians have made a statement on this. They say:


The RCP recognises that electronic cigarettes and other novel nicotine devices can provide an effective, affordable and readily available retail alternative to conventional cigarettes. These innovations could make harm reduction a reality for smokers, as proposed in our 2007 report.


There are other reports on this, a lot of academic reports, that are now suggesting that, in the UK in particular, people have begun to take up e-cigarettes as an alternative to smoking and that they have reduced their reliance on conventional cigarettes, and I think that is a really good thing. Pleasingly, there is also now evidence in Australia that this may be the case. Even though in Australia it is not currently legal to smoke e-cigarettes, to sell or to buy them, some people have imported them from overseas in a personal capacity and smoked them here. As part of a joint research paper by the Australian Catholic University and the University of Melbourne in 2015, they did a survey of 1,242 smokers. Eighteen per cent of those smokers reported that they had already given up smoking by using e-cigarettes, and the report found that e-cigarettes were also helping those who continued to smoke to cut back on the number of cigarettes they smoked. As Dr Aziz Rahman, the lead researcher, said:


E-cigarettes are becoming an increasingly popular method of giving up smoking, especially for middle-aged smokers. As cigarettes contain more than 4,000 toxic chemicals and cancer causing agents, e-cigarettes are a better choice, in terms of a harm reduction strategy.


…   …   …


If the safety of e-cigarettes is proven in the long run, they may assist healthcare providers to address smoking cessation challenges more effectively.


I think this is a very encouraging area of development. I think we could in our lifetime see the end of conventional cigarette and tobacco smoking, and it could be replaced by a much safer alternative of e-cigarettes. I think that is a really welcome development and I hope that the government in Australia will be welcoming of that development and will help facilitate the development rather than block the development, as some in the public health community have lobbied for them to do.

"Reynolds, Sen Linda",LP,2016-09-14,"



Senator REYNOLDS
 (Western Australia) (10:28):  I too rise to speak in support of the Excise Tariff Amendment (Tobacco) Bill 2016 and the Customs Tariff Amendment (Tobacco) Bill 2016. These bills will increase tobacco excise charged on domestic production and customs duties charged on imports with four annual increases of 12.5 per cent a year from 2017 until 2020. There will be no direct impact on tobacco companies from the staged excise and customs duty increases—these will occur on the same day as the usual indexation changes.


In addition, adult average weekly ordinary time earnings based indexation of tobacco excise rates will continue. The next biannual indexation of tobacco excise will occur on 1 March 2017. From 1 September this year, the excise and excise equivalent duty rate on tobacco is around 61c per stick and $763.20 per kilogram of tobacco content. This equates to $15.26 in excise on a packet of 25 cigarettes, which currently retail for approximately $25. 


Together, these bills will raise $4.59 billion across the forward estimates period. Goods and services tax receipts are estimated to increase by $430 million over the same period. The excise increase announced in the 2015-16 budget are firmly based on the evidence that this will further help reduce smoking and will replicate the annual increases that were put in place from 2013 through to 2016. 


As my colleague Senator Paterson has noted, tobacco is a 'legal product' in Australia and people choose to smoke, noting that there are health consequences for both themselves and others around them. Smoking today is recognised as the largest single preventable cause of death and disease in Australia. It is associated with an increased risk of heart disease, stroke, cancer, emphysema, bronchitis, asthma, renal disease and eye disease. Tobacco contains the powerfully addictive stimulant nicotine, which can make smoking a regular and long-term habit that is pretty hard to quit. Each year in Australia, smoking kills an estimated 15,000 Australians and costs Australia $31.5 billion in social, health and economic costs. In Western Australia alone, own home state, over 1,500 people a year die from smoking-related illnesses. 


The Turnbull government is greatly concerned about the serious health risks of smoking and it has continued the efforts of previous governments to support and build on Australia's great success in tobacco control. In recent years, the negative effects of passive smoking have also received considerable attention; demonstrating that the risks of smoking affects more than just the individual smoker. Passive smoking increases the risk of heart disease, asthma and some types of cancers. It may also increase the risk of sudden infant death syndrome and may predispose children to allergic sensitisation. 


The increase in excise and duty will move Australia toward the World Health Organization's recommendation that excise should comprise 70 per cent of the price of a cigarette. Increasing the price of tobacco products through taxes is widely recognised as the most effective and the most cost-effective tobacco control intervention for reducing tobacco use, particularly amongst our young and those from lower socioeconomic communities. In Australia, the 2010 post-implementation review, conducted by The Treasury, for the 25 per cent tobacco excise increase estimated that an 11 per cent decrease in tobacco consumption over two years had resulted. The 25 per cent tobacco excise increase had resulted in an 11 per cent decrease in smoking in Australia.


As reported in the WHO report on theGlobal tobacco epidemic, 2015, as of mid-2014 there have been two 12.5 per cent excise increases as well as biannual increases in excise and Australia was ranked sixth highest for total taxes applied to cigarettes amongst 106 countries who reported to the World Health Organization. The taxes also accounted for 47.67 per cent of the total retail price of the most popular brands of cigarettes, which in Australia is a Winfield 20-pack. Also, Australia's taxes applied to cigarettes gave Australia the seventh highest after-tax cigarette price in the world. I think it is clear that it has been proved that higher prices encourage smokers to quit or, at least, reduce their consumption, while also discouraging potential smokers including in particular young Australians from taking up smoking. 


These two bills will support Australia's domestic and international commitments to reduce the prevalence of smoking in Australia and thus minimise the harm of smoking to the entire Australian community. These particular changes sit alongside numerous other interventions the Commonwealth has taken to reduce the prevalence of smoking. Firstly, the Commonwealth has adopted a comprehensive ban on tobacco advertising and promotion. They have also legislated for retail display bans, Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme subsidies for smoking cessation supports and have funded extensive and continuing public education campaigns here in Australia.


In any health-related campaign, it is always to helpful to review and understand the statistics, the context and the trends that they highlight. In Australia, the facts are as follows: in 2011-2012, the Australian Health Survey reported that approximately eight million Australian adults aged 18 years and over had smoked at least some time in their life. In 2011-2012, 3.1 million people were still current smokers, with the vast majority—90 per cent of that 3.1 million people—smoking daily. Between 2001 and 2011-12, the overall rates of smoking had decreased for both males and females. The age-standardised rate of current smokers for males aged 18 and over fell from 27 per cent in 2001 to 20 per cent in 2011-12. For women, it declined 21 per cent to 16 per cent. Those figures, over the course of a decade, are very significant decreases. During 2007-2008, 3.5 per cent of people who were not current smokers aged 15 years and over and 7.2 per cent of children aged under 15 years lived in a household where a daily smoker was reported to have smoked indoors. This exposes environmental tobacco smoke and passive smoking to a significant percentage of young Australians.


The Australian government's tobacco control strategies, such as mass media public education campaigns, high tobacco taxes, advertising bans and smoke-free environment legislation have helped with the steady decline in smoking rates over decades. I think the statistics on that are very clear. Between 1991 and 2010, the proportion of daily smokers aged 14 years and over decreased by almost 40 per cent. I will say that again, because that is a really significant statistic: between 1991 and 2010, the proportion of daily smokers aged 14 and over decreased by almost 40 per cent. In 2011 and 2012, five per cent of males and nine per cent of females aged 15 to 17 were current smokers. After 18 years, the legal age for purchasing tobacco products in Australia, the rate rose significantly for both men and women, reaching 22 per cent for men and 17 per cent for women aged 18 to 24 in 2011 and 2012.


Rates then remained steady for men up to around the age of 55 and for women up to 65; whereupon after those ages for both men and women the rates significantly declined. So eight per cent of men and seven per cent of women aged 65 years and over were smokers in that same period, 2011-12. There was little change in smoking rates for men and women aged 45 to 54 years and women aged over 55 years during this period. However, interestingly, for men, there were significant declines over this period in the 55- to 64- and 65 years and over- age groups respectively. Between 2007 and 2011, the rate of smoking among men, or boys, aged 15 to 17 decreased from nine per cent to five per cent, while the rate for females did the complete opposite; they increased from five per cent to nine per cent for young girls between 15 and 17.


For Indigenous Australians the smoking rate has consistently been higher than for the rest of the Australian population. In 2008, 49 per cent of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australian men aged 18 years and over were current smokers. So 49 per cent of men over 18 in Indigenous population were smokers. This was, for the time, significantly higher than the number of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women of the same age who were current smokers, which was 44 per cent—but still much higher than the national average. Between 2002 and 2008, the rate really had not changed at all. For both men and women, the proportion of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders who were current smokers between 2002 and 2008 was lowest in the 15- to 17-year age group. That is again very interesting. It was actually lowest in the 15- to 17-year age group, but it was still much higher than the national average. In the 15- to 17-year age group it had decreased from 33 per cent to 21 per cent—a very significant decrease.


While, as I said, tobacco is legal in Australia, it is important that the government continues to aid the reduction in smoking rates and it is equally important to ensure that we support and explore alternatives for smokers, and I believe today that includes looking much more closely at e-cigarettes. In April last year, on behalf of the Intergovernmental Committee on Drugs, the Australian government Department of Health engaged the University of Sydney, in partnership with the Cancer Council of New South Wales, to conduct a longitudinal project to explore options to minimise the risks associated with the marketing and use of electronic nicotine delivery systems, with or without nicotine, here in Australia. This project is due to culminate in the preparation of a national discussion paper this month. Public dissemination of this discussion paper will be a matter for federal, state and territory governments. I very much look forward to the release of that document and engaging in the debate and discussion on safer alternatives to smoking. I commend the government for taking steps to explore the use and safety of e-cigarettes. The Australian government Department of Health review will inform the development of regulatory and non-regulatory policy options for consideration by Commonwealth, state and territory governments in this nation.


To me, there is absolutely no doubt that the use of e-cigarettes is a healthier option for people looking to stop smoking, with nearly three million people in the UK alone now using e-cigarettes today. I think it is very instructive for us here, as we have a look at alternatives to cigarettes, to look at the experiences of other countries with alternatives such as e-cigarettes. A recent note by the UK parliament observed that there is evidence showing that the use of e-cigarettes can assist people to quit tobacco smoking. The first generation of e-cigarettes, which were called cig-a-likes, resembled tobacco cigarettes. They became widely available in the UK in the mid-2000s and were usually disposable. The second-generation products typically resemble fountain pens, and are rechargeable, with a replaceable cartridge or refillable tank. The most recent third-generation products are typically much more diverse in look and feel. These are also rechargeable and have a refillable tank. Users can modify power and resistance to adjust nicotine delivery and vapour density. Users can also download software to monitor their own personal usage patterns and can tailor the devices aesthetically for their own personal style and comfort. Later e-cigarette products offer more efficient nicotine delivery than first-generation products. Some are comparable to tobacco cigarettes in terms of the blood nicotine concentration that they deliver. However, nicotine delivery remains much, much slower than traditional tobacco cigarettes.


Public health concerns here and overseas around e-cigarettes have focused on vapers and the inhalation of vapour and bystanders' passive exposure to the vapours from e-cigarettes. The inhaled and exhaled vapour varies depending on device characteristics and user behaviour. But, again, as Senator Paterson has noted, the health impact is much less for people in the vicinity of those using e-cigarettes than for people in the vicinity of those using traditional cigarettes. There have also been concerns about possible adverse health effects for the user from inhaling vapour that can contain propylene glycol, glycerine, nicotine, flavourings, metallic elements and carcinogenic substances. Since 2014, there has been a great deal of research into vapour content. The amount of chemicals inhaled, rather than their presence alone, is an important determinant of toxicity, and current data suggests that the levels of toxins and contaminants in inhaled vapour do not pose significant health risks. The consensus is that long-term health risks to vapers require monitoring but are 'unlikely to exceed five per cent of the harm from smoking tobacco'. Passive smoking health risks to bystanders are much smaller again with the use of e-cigarettes, as current evidence shows that the levels of nicotine and contaminants released via exhaled vapour are negligible.


So I commend the Turnbull government for continuing to support the reduction measures for smoking. But it is also important that we continue to provide smokers with the support and motivation they need to kick the habit when they are ready to do so. I am pleased that the revenue gained from higher tobacco excise will be put to good use by the government to continue to fund and provide a range of services, including health and other support measures.


These measures support the national approach through the Council of Australian Governments to reduce the prevalence of smoking in Australia. The adult daily smoking rate was 14.5 per cent of the population in 2014-2015. I have gone through some of the statistics, and that is a very significant decrease over the last decade. In 2008, all states and territories, through COAG, committed to reducing the adult daily smoking rate to 10 per cent of our national population and to halving the daily rate of smoking amongst Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders by 2018.


Ongoing tobacco interventions, including these excise increases, are critical to ensuring that the prevalence of smoking in Australia continues to decline. It is incorrect to assume that the rate of reduction of smoking prevalence can be maintained without additional tobacco control efforts. Evidence from Australia and overseas shows that, when tobacco control efforts stall, so does the decline in smoking prevalence and there is an increase in health consequences.


So, for all of those reasons, I commend these bills to the Senate today.

"Smith, Sen Dean",LP,2016-09-14,"



Senator SMITH
 (Western Australia—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (10:47):  I also rise to speak this morning about the Excise Tariff Amendment (Tobacco) Bill 2016 and the Customs Tariff Amendment (Tobacco) Bill 2016, but I want to take a slightly different perspective—a slightly different angle.



Senator Jacinta Collins interjecting—




Senator SMITH:
  Just yesterday, Senator Collins would have seen on the Notice Paper that in the Senate was tabled the most recent report of the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, Australia's health 2016. It was quite a revealing report on a number of levels—not least because it did point to the facts that Australians are getting healthier and living longer but that there still exist, for some Australians in our community, significant risks to their enjoyment of that health, and it pointed to what that path to longer living might look like for them.


There were a number of interesting things in that report that I would just like to share with the Senate this morning before turning briefly to the contents of these bills, because senators would know that other government senators have illuminated the motivation—illuminated the positive benefits for smokers from reducing their smoking and the positive benefits for the economy from this particular legislative initiative. But there are a number of things in the Australia's health 2016report that are worth sharing with the Senate this morning. One is—and I will come to it in a brief moment—what is happening around death rates in our country. There is also what is happening as to the increasing numbers of risk factors for healthy Australians; and there is important information about the incidence of smoking amongst Australians generally but also across core communities.


Importantly, in the report at chapter 4 people will see a specific discussion about tobacco smoking trends in our country—information that fewer Australians are smoking, and information about the positive changes that are happening to smoking patterns across the Australian community—and then, immediately following that, some revealing or even alarming information about the health behaviours and biomedical risks for Indigenous Australians which focuses very heavily on the issue of the incidence of smoking across Indigenous communities. That is especially alarming for a regional senator like myself from Western Australia who spends a considerable amount of time in the Kimberley region of Western Australia, which has a very high proportion of Indigenous Australians who live in very remote communities, as the incidence of smoking is a significant impairment to the benefits that they can enjoy from a healthy lifestyle and the benefits that they should be able to enjoy through greater longevity.


The institute's report, not surprisingly, starts by sharing with us this very important fact: that good health, of course, is important. It is important to each of us. It influences not just how we feel but how we go about our everyday lives and how we might be able to utilise those rich opportunities that come to us as Australians. The report says that the vast majority of Australians aged 15 and over report that their health is 'good' or better, and that this can mean different things to different people. Of course, the starting position of your health is a key determinant in whether or not you can expect to enjoy much greater improvements in your health or marginal improvements. The report goes on to say:


It is now widely accepted that health is much more than the presence or absence of disease.


Importantly, 'good' or better health:


… reflects genetic, lifestyle and environmental factors; cultural influences; socioeconomic conditions; and the availability and quality of health care programs and services.


I think that what makes the tabling yesterday in the Senate of the Australia's health 2016 report important is the fact that it provides a very timely examination of the health of Australians from a variety of perspectives, including the leading types of ill health that affect us as a nation, the specific risks and health inequalities that are faced by different types of communities across our vast and varied nation, and of course what level of services are currently being provided and what level of services it is necessary to provide to prevent illness.


What is revealing in this report, perhaps even refreshing—it is quite illuminating, because the report is quite honest and transparent—comes at the end of each chapter, where the report points to future work that needs to be done if this picture of Australia's health is to be accurate and if Australia's health is to continue to be well serviced and provided for. The report also provides a refreshing account of some of the topical issues that face Australians when discussing the healthiness of their current and future lives—importantly, a discussion around chronic disease, the very important issue of mental health, the use and abuse of illicit drugs in our community, health spending across various health services, end-of-life care and trends in hospital care. So it is quite an important and revealing report.


But I want to turn in the first instance to what the report has to say about the experiences of Australians when it comes to death. In 2013 nearly 147,700 deaths were registered in Australia—about 600 more than in 2012 and nearly 15,400 more than in 2003. Since 2003 the number has risen by an average of one per cent per year for males and 1.2 per cent for females. Despite an increase in the absolute number of deaths, there has been a long and continuing fall in death rates per 100,000 population. From 1907 to 2013 the age-standardised death rate for males and females fell by a staggering 71 per cent and 76 per cent, respectively.


This is an important point, because when we talk about the tremendous amount of public money and the tremendous amount of energy that goes into our health programs, our health services and our hospitals, we are fundamentally seeking to do two things: to give the living a better quality of life and to ensure that people live longer, and that much of our energy, much of our innovation and much of our public spending go into the very important task of keeping people alive. When we look at those results from 1907 to 2013 that reveal that the age-standardised death rate for males and females fell by 71 per cent and 76 per cent, respectively, we get a very powerful and positive sign of the success of everything this country does—and not just what the public health system does, with public health programs, but also what the voluntary system does and what the private sector does to ensure that Australians live longer and enjoy all the benefits bestowed on them.


Before coming to the specific issue of tobacco smoking, let me reflect briefly on what the report had to say about other death rates in our country. In 2013 children aged five to nine years and 10 to 14 years had the lowest rates of death, at nine and 10 per cent, respectively, per 100,000 population. The rate gradually increased from the ages of 15 to 19 years, to 32 per 100,000 population. By the age of 60 to 64 the rate was 613 per 100,000 population. The highest death rate was for people aged 85 and over—not surprising. Death rates have remained higher for males than for females in all age groups.


So I thought this was a very important starting point for discussion not just about increasing taxes on tobacco but also about what we are doing to discourage people from smoking. We know about the side effects of smoking, the cumulative effects and its cost, not just to our healthcare system but also in terms of the distress it causes to families as a result of the illnesses arising from tobacco use.


Moving through the report, its second most revealing aspect—and I mean revealing in a constructive sense—is what it has to say about risk factors and about what we as a community are doing to reduce those risk factors. The report says that many chronic diseases share common lifestyle risk factors that are largely preventable—for example, tobacco smoking, excessive alcohol consumption and excessive body weight. According to the results of the Australian Burden of Disease Study in 2011, a large proportion of the burden of disease experienced by the population—31 per cent, or almost a third of the community—could be prevented by reducing exposure to modifiable risk factors. The five risk factors that caused the most burden were tobacco use, high body mass, high alcohol use, physical inactivity and high blood pressure.


Importantly, the report goes on to talk specifically about smoking rates in Australia and whether or not we have had a positive or a negative experience regarding smoking rates. I am pleased to share with the Senate that on page 16 of the report it says that smoking rates in our country are continuing to fall. It says that smoking rates in Australia are still falling, continuing a long-term downward trend over the past 50 years that the OECD has described as 'remarkable progress'. The OECD has described the downward fall in smoking rates in our country as a remarkable success.


In 2013, 13 per cent of people aged 14 or older smoked daily, compared with 15 per cent in 2010 and 24 per cent in 1991. That is worth reflecting on: in 1991, 24 per cent of people aged 14 or over smoked daily, and in 2013 just 13 per cent of people smoked daily. This was one of the lowest smoking rates in the world. The OECD average daily smoking rate for people aged 15 and older was 20 per cent. 


We can be confident that those legislative and other measures that governments—this government, previous governments—have been putting in place to reduce the incidence of smoking in our community have been successful. I think it is important to note that that success has come by not infringing on people's absolute liberty to smoke. If people want to smoke, that is their business. I am not a smoker; people in my family have previously been smokers. I think it is a powerful endorsement of the sorts of things that the community, supported by government, are doing that are leading to very tangible benefits in reducing the incidence of smoking in our community.


I could go on to talk about the positive benefits that are being achieved as a result of reductions in drinking levels et cetera, but that is not the purpose of my contribution today. I want to turn specifically to the issue of tobacco smoking and what the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare report had to say in regard to that. It has some positive news for those of us who care about the public health impost that happens as a result of an increase in smoking rates. Refreshingly, the report talks about the fact that fewer Australians are now smoking. It says: 


Fewer people, both proportionally and absolutely, are smoking daily and more people have never smoked, compared with 20 years ago. 


The report says:


In 2013, the proportion of people aged 14 and over smoking daily (13%) was lower than in 2010 (15%) …


As I have shared with you previously, in 1991 it was a staggering 21 per cent. Importantly, when we think about the impact of smoking on young people in our community, the report was positive. It says:


In 2014, the proportions of secondary school students aged 12-17 smoking in their lifetime, in the past 4 weeks, past week or on 3 days of the last 7, were significantly lower than in 2008 and 2011 …. 


That is a very positive outcome. It goes on to say:


Fewer people are being exposed to tobacco smoking, more people are delaying the uptake of smoking and smokers are smoking fewer cigarettes.


Dependent children were far less likely to be exposed to tobacco smoke inside the home in 2013 (3.7%) than in 1995 (31%).


Children being exposed to tobacco smoke in their home in 1995 was 31 per cent. Now, it is staggeringly low at 3.7 per cent. It goes on to say:


The average age at which young people aged 14-24 smoked their first cigarette has steadily risen since 2001 (15.9 years in 2013 compared with 14.3 in 2001), indicating a delay in uptake of smoking.


That has to be a positive outcome. Smokers smoked fewer cigarettes per week in 2013 than in 2001. In 2013, smokers smoked up to 96 cigarettes per week; in 2001, it was 113. The report goes on to say:


The proportion of women smoking at any time during pregnancy has steadily declined over time—


I am sure we are all pleased to hear that—


from 15% in 2009 to 12% in 2013.


So there is still some work to be done in regard to the incidence of smoking by pregnant women in our community. 


I think it is also interesting to be reminded that, for different parts of our population, the incidence of smoking is very variant. It is valuable to look at these statistics before I move to the detail of the bill. The likelihood of being a daily smoker is two times as high in remote or very remote areas; three times as high in the lowest socio-economic areas compared with the highest socio-economic areas; 1.7 times as high for unemployed people compared with people who are employed; 1.9 times as high for homosexual or bisexual people compared with heterosexual people—I did not know that; it is rather revealing; 2.7 times as high for single people with dependent children compared with couples with dependent children; and, finally, 5.7 times as high for prison entrants compared with the general population. People may not be surprised to hear that the likelihood of a being a daily smoker is 2.6 times as high for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians compared with non-Indigenous Australians.


As we have heard from previous coalition senators, the merits of the government's proposed reforms to the Excise Tariff Amendment (Tobacco) Bill 2016 and the Customs Tariff Amendment (Tobacco) Bill 2016 stand undisputed. They are positive and necessary reforms, from both a budget repair perspective and a public health perspective. I think the contributions of Senator Reynolds, Senator Paterson and Senator Hume were particularly revealing about the merits of the government's legislative initiative. 


Senator Fawcett is now in the chamber and about to make a contribution, so I might draw my contribution to an end now.

Senator FAWCETT
 (South Australia—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (11:05):  I too rise to make some contributions to this debate on the Excise Tariff Amendment (Tobacco) Bill 2016 and the Customs Tariff Amendment (Tobacco) Bill 2016. I wish to talk briefly about what the bills will do and, possibly more importantly, why the government is taking these steps. I would identify and congratulate the opposition: some of their policy positions have been very similar to this. Clearly, there is a bipartisan interest in supporting the health of Australians. I would like also to talk a little bit about what potential unintended consequences there could be and what measures the government is taking to make sure that they do not come into effect. They are things like the potential for increasing demand for and, therefore, trade in illicit tobacco and whether there are socio-economic impacts that are unfair or vary across our community.


I will start with what the Excise Tariff Amendment (Tobacco) Bill 2016 and the Customs Tariff Amendment (Tobacco) Bill 2016 will actually do. These bills, as previous speakers have highlighted, will increase the tobacco excise which is charged on domestic production and the equivalent customs duties charged on imports by way of four annual increases of 12.5 per cent a year from 2017 until 2020. It is not the first time this has happened; this legislation replicates the annual increases that were put in place from 2013 to 2016. In addition, the increases which were indexed to changes in the adult weekly average ordinary time earnings will continue, and the next increase under that scheme occurs in March of 2017. What that means is that from September this year, the excise and excise equivalent duty rates on tobacco are around $763 per kilogram of tobacco content. This equates to around $15 in excise on a pack of 25 cigarettes, which currently retails for approximately $25. Ignoring the biannual indexation, the 12 per cent increases will increase excise per pack of cigarettes by around $2 each year. 


So that is broadly what the bill is seeking to do. Why? There are a number of reasons. Partly that Australia is linked in with what people like the World Health Organization are doing. As they look at the damage that tobacco causes to individuals and communities around the nation, they have set a target recommending that excise should account for nearly 70 per cent of the retail price of a packet of cigarettes. Achieving that has been somewhat problematic for Australia because, in the past, when excise has increased the facts indicate that companies tend to also increase their prices at the same time—I am assuming in an attempt to shift the blame for that price increase onto the government's increase in excise as opposed to onto the fact that they are putting in an additional profit margin on top of that. So, because the price keeps going up in absolute terms, with retailers putting in extra margin, it is harder for us to reach that excise level of 70 per cent. But the target is there because of the damage that is done to health as a result of tobacco use. 


The use of tobacco is one of the leading causes of preventable death and disease here in Australia. When I think back to when I first enlisted in the Army in the early 1980s, we were in an environment where it was accepted that the use of alcohol and tobacco was a commonplace part of work. That was common in the military college. But even when I first qualified as a military pilot, aircraft were still provided with ashtrays. In fact, I do recall flying once in an aircraft with another crew member who was a heavy smoker. We have two sets of rules in flying. One is visual flight rules, where you can see. One is called instrument flight rules, which is when you use your instruments because you are in cloud and when you look out the windscreen and all you can see is grey and cloud. On that particular flight I basically had to revert to instrument flight rules techniques even though it was a blue sky day, because the smoke was so thick in the cockpit that it was actually difficult to see outside and see the horizon. I recall that because of its impact on my flying, but as I look back now I wonder what the impact was on my health, as studies have shown the impact of passive smoking. So in my own professional career I have seen the dramatic change that tobacco control measures have made in terms of curtailing the acceptance of the use of tobacco in the workplace because of the damaging effect that it has. 


Now ABS data indicates that daily smoking rates in 2014-15 have dropped to 14½ per cent amongst adults, compared to 16 per cent in 2011-12 and 22 per cent back in 2001. As I say, anecdotally, from my own experience, the numbers are far higher than that as you go back further in our history. I am very pleased to report now that not only is smoking banned in the back end of the Qantas planes and Virgin aircraft that we fly in regularly, but the crew also, even in military aircraft, no longer have the opportunity to smoke in that very confined workspace. 


So these tobacco control measures that Australia has brought in over several decades now have a multifaceted approach, but they have been broadly effective in seeing that decline in the prevalence of national smoking rates. Those interventions have included things like the increases in excise, the education programs and the campaigns, and most recently—again, credit to the opposition—plain packaging, which has enabled the prevalence of the fairly graphic health warnings, as opposed to the slick marketing, to be the thing that people see when they look at cigarettes. Those measures and the prohibition on tobacco advertising and promotion, particularly around sports and things, all work together to see smoking reduce. This is because reducing that preventable disease and preventable early death is important. So that is why we have brought in this legislation, and we have talked about the controls.


The other thing that I think is important to consider with each piece of legislation is the unintended consequences that could occur. One of the objections that has been raised around this whole topic of indexation is the impact on people in lower socioeconomic groupings. There is data to indicate that many of them smoke. Therefore, the argument goes that the burden of these measures will fall more harshly on people in lower socioeconomic groupings. 


I accept the fact that not everyone who smokes is necessarily going to be damaged by it. I have great memories as a young lad of being out in Kapunda, where my family were farmers, and sitting outside the kitchen window in the morning. The sun would come up, my grandfather would smoke his pipe and the magpies would be in the trees. They are really nice memories. He never suffered from cancer or any ill effects, but I have to say that, statistically, he is in the minority, as the vast majority of people do. And it has an impact not just on the individual—it has an impact on their family and on our society in terms of the cost burden of providing healthcare services to people who are struggling with cancer and the other problems that occur from smoking.


If we accept the fact that, as a society, these intervention measures are valid, warranted and desirable, then the impact on people in a lower socioeconomic grouping, in net terms, is positive. If something provides incentive for all of society to either not take up smoking or, indeed, to quit, then it will actually support people to make that decision earlier if their income is more limited. I do not say that from a position of being here in the parliament; I am referring here to studies, to journal articles from, for example, the Medical Journal of Australia. Dr Nathan Grills of the Nossal Institute for Global Health, based out of the University of Melbourne, has looked at excise and this aspect of the multifaceted intervention approach from a medical perspective. He specifically addresses the issue of people in lower income brackets, and the argument he puts forward is that tobacco excise is actually a pro-poor policy. Those are his words—that is the title of his article in the Medical Journal of Australia.


His reasoning goes that, because more poor people smoke, the 'tax increase targets the poor, as they end up paying more tax'. He is saying that is a short-sighted analysis because it does not demonstrate a good understanding of tobacco control intervention based on strong evidence. He argues that, in reality, the policy actually benefits the poor far more than the rich because it is a progressive tax in terms of public health and long-term economic benefit. He says:


This tax will reduce the long-term financial losses and payments more in lower than in higher socio-economic groups, by reducing medical expenses and protecting livelihoods especially in poorer groups. Ultimately it saves more lives in lower SES groups than in higher SES groups.


Professor Ian Olver, the CEO of the Cancer Council, also addresses this point. He makes the argument that, whilst there is a view that increased tobacco excise punishes those on lower incomes, tobacco taxes are particularly effective in prompting people in lower socioeconomic groups to quit smoking. He says that this is very important, because disadvantaged groups bear a disproportionately heavy tobacco death and disease burden.


The argument that both of these groups put forward is that if we, as a society, accept that intervention is warranted because of the effect on health of the individual and the family, and the cost to community, then if we have a system whereby people on higher incomes can choose to pay if they want to and suffer those consequences, but people on a lower income have a greater incentive to not start or to give up smoking and therefore will receive the greater health benefits for them and the family benefits of retaining that person as a productive and healthy member of the workforce, then in net terms this is a policy that is slanted towards advantaging those in lower socioeconomic groups. Whilst I understand the argument that is put forward, I think it is fair to say that there is an equally strong argument that this does actually work to the benefit of people who currently suffer the greatest burden of health disease from tobacco.


The other unintended consequence that is raised by people who are concerned about the increase in excise is whether or not there will be more illicit tobacco coming into the country because of the high prices. There will be more reward and, therefore, incentive and opportunity. The primary responsibility for dealing with the illicit trade in tobacco rests with Border Protection and the Australian Taxation Office. What this government has done to try and make sure that we have the resources that are required at our borders in a range of areas, but particularly here in tobacco, is provide additional funding in the 2016-17 budget to deal with tobacco. So $7.7 million over two years, the 2016-17 and 2017-18 period, has been specifically provided to expand the department's tobacco strike team. That will effectively triple the size of its workforce, allowing for three specialised investigative teams to work to detect, to disrupt and to deter the illicit trade in tobacco.


In this financial year to date the Australian Border Force has detected almost 30 tonnes in the equivalent weight of tobacco—tobacco leaf or cigarette sticks—and this equates to an evaded duty of nearly $20 million. Clearly there is already an illicit trade in existence, and we are putting resources in to make sure that we have effective measures to not allow that trade to increase but in fact to detect, to deter, to interrupt it and to close the trade down. But I would make the argument that, just because there is potential illegal activity, that should not deter us from taking steps that have the primary purpose of protecting people's health.


Just as we have border control methods for other prohibited imports, whether they be weapons, narcotics or in this case tobacco, the fact that criminal elements may wish to seek to profit from people in Australia should not sway us from putting in place policies that achieve the long-term health benefits that we are looking towards. We will take the steps necessary, and the government has made the investments necessary, to combat things such as illicit tobacco imports. We will continue to do that with not only tobacco but other areas with border control. I think one of the strong achievements of this government since 2013—and it will continue under the government recently elected—is that we will continue to make the investments and have the strength of our policy positions and convictions so that the men and women who serve in our Border Force units, as well as the Defence Force, AFP and other police units who support them, can make sure that our borders are secure. 


I have outlined what this bill will do in terms of the excise and imports. I have outlined why, and it is predominantly around health. These measures have proven, as I have seen in my own life experience from those early days in the military through to now, the significant impact they have had in Australia in terms of the prevalence of smoking. Given the impact on individuals, their families and the broader productive community, I support these measures. I believe we have taken the appropriate steps to make sure that any unintended consequences like illicit trade are dealt with. I do not support the argument that the burden falls unfairly on people in lower socioeconomic groups; in fact, as articles from the Medical Journal and the Cancer Council show, that group in our society in the medium to long term are actually the greatest beneficiaries of measures like this. I commend these measures to the Senate.

Senator O'SULLIVAN
 (Queensland) (11:24):  I too rise to make a contribution to the debate on the Excise Tariff Amendment (Tobacco) Bill 2016 and the Customs Tariff Amendment (Tobacco) Bill 2016. Let me open my contribution with a story—I know Senator Sterle will enjoy this story, being a man of the fifties. I recall, as a youngster aged 13, convalescing at the Rockhampton Base Hospital men's ward after some surgery. For those of us listening who sadly can remember the sixties, I found myself in a men's ward with the traditional old lime-green floors and walls. That seemed to be the colour of choice for hospitals back then. There were about 40 or 50 men, if my memory serves me correctly, who were convalescing in the ward with various injuries or recovering from surgeries, and the majority of them were lying there smoking with ashtrays on their chests. I can remember my physician—I cannot remember his name but I can remember quite distinctly him coming in with a very large bendy pipe in his mouth. I can remember the nurses—part of their duties was to come around and empty the ashtrays into old powdered milk tins then. 


I have often wondered since that time—these issues did not strike me at the time—what would have happened, if I had stood up on my bed and announced to those men in that ward that it would not be long before they would not be able to smoke in the hospital, on the verandah of the hospital, down in the car park, over at the racecourse, at railway workshops, in a car with their children, within 100 metres of a government building, in an aeroplane or at any of the other places that other people have reflected on in their contributions. 


I can say to you—more particularly, as I got involved in politics and now as a member of the Senate and a legislator—that it has always remained with me that the power of public policy and shifts in the culture of societies can over time make some very, very positive contributions to our amenity of life. Indeed we have seen a reduction in the use of tobacco and tobacco products—except for some age cohorts within society—and have also seen, I think, a much more responsible approach to the consumption of alcohol over that time. I think that that has come about through a range of initiatives, including public initiatives, but also through changes in culture in our society, as people become more aware of the potential negative impacts in certain circumstances of the consumption of the topic of choice today of tobacco—and indeed not just with tobacco but with alcohol and even the consumption of illicit drugs. It remains a challenge most certainly in this country, but I think a more educated society in part is what contributes to changes in cultural attitude to these things; however, as with everything in life, as our society goes forward, it can be given assistance in other forms. In this case, the introduction of this bill is a decision of the government of the day to use some fiscal measures to make a contribution to the ongoing battle—it is a long way from being completed—regarding the consumption of tobacco products. 


It would surprise me, if any senators making a contribution to this bill were to rail against the bill. In fact, the methodology of increasing the excise on tobacco is almost a bipartisan measure, because many of these measures were introduced of course under the Labor administration of Prime Minister Gillard. I have to say—and I do not do this very frequently—that the Labor Party need to be congratulated on leading in this way, because the reforms introduced under Labor—



Senator Jacinta Collins interjecting—




Senator O'SULLIVAN:
  Make note of it, Senator. I will send a highlighter pen around. You can highlight the Hansard and frame it. I am paying great tribute to the Australian Labor Party for their leadership in this space. The initiatives that they undertook—



Senator Whish-Wilson interjecting—




Senator O'SULLIVAN:
  All right, and the Greens perhaps may have been involved somewhere on the early initiatives. We will recognise them as well.


This introduction of an increase in the excise is not a new measure. This is a measure and a model that was adopted by the Australian Labor Party—and they provided leadership in this space—back when they reviewed the excise and increased it, from memory, by about 25 per cent. We need to look at, along with all of the other measures that exist in society to inhibit the consumption of tobacco products, the efficacy of measures such as increases in the excise. I heard the very valuable contribution by the previous speaker, reflecting on resistance to such measures as it heavily impacts on the lower socioeconomic strata within our society. That is following on from the evidence that people in lower socioeconomic stratas—in fact, people who live in my beloved regional and rural Australia—are more inclined to consume tobacco products per capita on average than others who live in more metropolitan and urban areas. There are any number of reasons for this. But going to the heart of the question of whether an increase in the excise impacting on them is a right and proper thing to do, I think one needs to consider the flip side of the coin and the impact it will have on their life for any person who consumes tobacco products.


I think that anything that government does with a pure heart is a good thing. I know there will be those who will suggest that this is simply a revenue grab and that it is not designed to do anything but increase the income in the coffers of the nation. I would say to them that I think it is a very genuine measure. I think it is a legitimate measure. In fact, there is evidence to suggest that this works.


What we have seen after a range of measures—including that one-off 25 per cent increase to the excise that I have attributed to the Australian Labor Party and, indeed, which I support conceptually—is a significant reduction in the consumption of tobacco products of some 11 per cent. Anything that we can do through a policy measure that increases, if that is the intention, or decreases a number into double digits falls into the success basket. It is not to be sneezed at that an 11 per cent reduction occurred as a result of the last increase in excise. I know this is not what will happen this time but, with these increases from 2017 onwards, if we are able to achieve double-digit decreases in the consumption of tobacco then we will be heading towards very, very acceptable rates of consumption. That is not to say that any consumption is supported, but it will get us down to much more manageable rates.


Initiatives such as the increase in the excise will not work simply in and of themselves. I think some of the credit for that decrease in consumption has to go to other initiatives that have taken place. Governments have played a part in some of them. These things help mould and shape people's culture and attitudes to these things. There have been measures such as the reduction in tobacco advertising. In fact, I do not think I can think of a circumstance now where tobacco can be advertised. But most of us are of an age that we will remember the advertisement of tobacco. As a young man I used to pretend I had a cigarette hanging out of my mouth when I pretended to be John Wayne while playing cowboys and Indians. You might remember that very prominent people in our communities—




Senator Whish-Wilson:
  Marlon Brando.




Senator O'SULLIVAN:
  Yes, Marlon Brando. I can remember the announcement of the assassination of John F Kennedy. Walter Cronkite paused before he came to the punchline to take a draw on his cigarette as he announced that that prominent American president had been assassinated.


But this 11 per cent reduction is not just due to excise increases, although evidence was given on this to public hearings held here in August 2011 by our House of Representatives Standing Committee on Health and Ageing as part of its inquiry into the plain packaging legislation. The then Chief Executive Officer of British American Tobacco Australia, a very, very large player in the field of tobacco products, gave evidence where—and I will quote him so that there is no chance of confusion—he said:


We understand that the price going up when the excise goes up reduces consumption.


That is worth repeating because you would think that the CEO of British American Tobacco Australia may well have been more inclined to try to diminish the impact of such a policy measure and, in fact, try to indicate to the government that it was not working so that it did not impact on them and their market share of tobacco. But he said:


We understand that the price going up when the excise goes up reduces consumption.


He went on to say—and this refers to the efficacy of the increase that occurred in 2010:


We saw that last year very effectively with the increase in excise.


So he attributed the double-digit reduction in consumption specifically to the introduction of the excise. He said:


There was a 25 per cent increase in the excise and we saw the volumes go down …


In his view, there was a 10.2 per cent reduction in the industry. That is not that inconsistent with the figures of the review that was eventually conducted consequent to that inquiry to determine just what impact the increase in excise had had.


The excise bill is quite specific. It is continuing a trend of governments and it does not matter what the persuasion of the governments are. What it has done is look back and seen a measure—in this case, a fiscal measure by a Labor government—that was successful. So the introduction of these increases, particularly after 2017 and onwards, I think, is based on sound thinking. As I said earlier in my contribution, I imagine that this measure will be supported by everyone here in the Senate because the results are in. The evidence that this works is in.


But, again, the measure needs to go hand-in-hand with an increase in advertising efforts to not only reduce tobacco consumption but create within society arrangements where people do not start smoking in the first place. They have to go to the key element, to the root source of this terrible addiction to try and help young people as they come through to avoid the pitfalls. 


We all need to recognise that this is a very significant addiction in society. Those who have smoked and who have been able to give smoking away will tell you it is a lifelong addiction. We have to increase measures by government in advertising and education not only to increase the awareness of the impacts the abuse of tobacco products have on individuals but also to try and prevent or dissuade young people from taking up the habit in the first instance.


Support services require funding, and I can say our government proudly continues in our tradition as set by former governments and Labor governments in making sure that we fund all sorts of support services in our community, where people can readily access information to help them to determine what potential impacts their behaviour may have, not just with tobacco but across the abuse of both legal and illicit products, including alcohol and drugs. The increase in support services has been on an appropriate trajectory for governments. That needs to remain on the current trajectory so that we can increase the places people can go to gather the awareness they need.


The previous speaker spoke about making sure that we clamp down on illicit tobacco trade. Up until the end of the last parliament, I was a member of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee that visited on this issue on a number of occasions. I think there were inquiries conducted but I did not participate in them. And I know there was a lot of time and energy expended on Border Force during estimates for us to track just what efforts they were putting in place to see that we do not have illicit, cheaper tobacco in Australia that would offset, I suppose, the benefits that we are seeing from measures such as these increases in excises.


Plain packaging had another impact. You could take the plain packaging and put it in the same category as a reduction in advertising. I think that took away a bit of a trendy attraction to cigarettes. For those who smoked in earlier days, you will remember you may have been Craven A man or a Rothmans man or a Camel-without-a-filter man. I still have not got over the first Camel I had without a filter—I think I am still suffering from that 30 years on. I thank the plain packaging initiative. Again, I want to pay credit to the Australian Labor Party, who led the way on this. It was a great initiative and there is evidence that it had a significant impact on the trade also.


Society is playing its bit, playing a very important role. I remember as a young fellow that if you wanted a breath of fresh air, you went outside and everyone stayed inside smoking but of course that is now reversed. Smokers are often very socially conscious, I am told, and will find themselves trying to find a quiet spot in the car park behind a bush to have a cigarette rather than be seen. Most people now accept it is not a very socially acceptable practice to smoke in or about someone's home or at sporting events, particularly the school sporting events that I often go to with my grandchildren. At a stadium or some other sporting event, there is nobody lighting up in the vicinity of thousands of people.


Socially smoking has become a less accepted practice to the point that where anyone can regulate where you can smoke, they have done that. I remember travelling a lot internationally some years ago with work and probably still within a decade of today—may be a little bit longer—if you were travelling particularly on an Asian airline, the practice was still available. Then they started to shift the smokers down the back—I do not know what they thought that was going to achieve. Indeed, socially, communities and societies have taken whatever steps they can to reduce the consumption of tobacco.



I want to commend this measure to the Senate. I think it is a good measure. I think it is a measure that can be supported by all sides of politics. I think it is important to remind people that when it was introduced by the Labor government, it had an immediate, within 12 months, reduction in the consumption of tobacco products by double digits. If we can achieve that sort of result from each of these excise increases, we will have done our duty for our society. (Time expired)

"Back, Sen Chris",LP,2016-09-14,"



Senator BACK
 (Western Australia) (11:44):  Today we are privileged to have, in the student galleries on three sides of this chamber, students who have the opportunity to witness what goes on in this chamber and in the parliament. Deputy President, through you I direct an urgent plea, a request, to each of the three groups of students: do not take up smoking. Do not smoke. During my contribution to the debate on the Excise Tariff Amendment (Tobacco) Bill 2016 and Customs Tariff Amendment (Tobacco) Bill 2016, I will give you a couple of reasons why you should not. I promise you that, by the time you are adults, either you will have saved sufficient money for a deposit on your own home or apartment, to get you started in real estate, or you will have saved enough to be able to go around the world every year on a holiday during your leave. As you become parents, you will have sufficient money to be able to put funds aside for the education of your children. How good is that? If you go away from this place this week with one lesson, with one thing to remember, I urge you: do not take up smoking. 


We all know that cancer is a scourge and a curse that affects every family. I had my experience in the last period of the 44th Parliament. It was just before two o'clock when my mobile phone rang. I realised it was my doctor and I stepped out. I had the first question for the government that day, and my doctor was telling me the bad news that a salivary gland problem I had was malignant. I did not really like that very much, and I said to him, 'Dale, I'm sorry I can't talk to you right now, because I have a question in question time.' He said to me, 'Chris, you're not taking this seriously. That huge growth on your thyroid is malignant.' I had had a chat with the surgeon. I am a veterinarian and I had seen the results. I was not quite as pessimistic as he was. Some people had noticed that I had lost weight, and I would very quietly say, 'Yes, I've been on an exercise program. I lost 14 kilos in about five weeks.' It was not an exercise program; it was this jolly cancer. Fortunately, I could hide it by wearing a suit and tie—nobody knew. Even more fortunately, when it was removed it was not malignant. I had that great news: no malignancy.


The message I want to give you is this: that was something over which I could have had no control, yet smoking is a practice that puts cancer-producing elements, called carcinogens, into your lungs, and that may well lead to you getting lung cancer, throat cancer or any of those cancers associated with your respiratory system, and then you will accelerate towards an early death. I say this to you whether you are a parent, a kid or—as is the case for some of us in this chamber—a grandparent. I have to say, when you become a grandparent, you have a really important cause to want to keep living for. 


A member of my family is also a veterinarian. He is eight years older than me. My earliest memories of him were as a smoker. And he fits the bill, as read out previously by Senator Smith: a remote area person who worked all his life in stockyards in the bush. Members of our profession saw the pathology in animals that is equivalent to the human pathology—in other words, the disease in the lungs in humans. I used to often say, 'For someone with his knowledge, why the billyo is he smoking?' He turned up to visit his young grandchild in a Western Australian town. They all got crook about three years ago—he did, the child did and the parents did. He came home and he has not smoked since. I see his improvement in health every day and I see the fact that we are going to have him for the next few years, whereas, five years ago, I feared he was not going to see his grandchildren grow up. 


The stats you have seen here today say it all. Low socioeconomic groups—in other words, people who cannot afford it—are three times more likely to smoke. If you come from a remote area, you have double the likelihood of smoking. Single parents—usually mums—with dependent children are nearly three times more likely to smoke, and are more likely to smoke than parents in homes where there are two parents. These are the stats. I ask the teachers to ask the children, 'Get your pens out.' And, if you do not, here is a bit of an exercise for when you are back at school. If you are able, have a look at the Hansard of speeches. It does not matter who is giving this one. Next week, go back and have a look at these figures. 


The price today of cigarettes is about $25 per packet. If you smoke a packet a day, that is going to cost you $9,000 a year. And to those of us who pay tax—because all of this is what is called after-tax money—if you apply 30 per cent tax, the real cost of that $9,000 is $12,000 a year. That is $1,000 a month. Many of you are probably 12, 13, 14 years of age, so by 24 years of age that 12 grand a year is the $120,000 I was telling you about that you will have as a deposit on a home. But it will not be $120,000. If you have your pens out: within four years the cost of a packet of smokes will go to about $40. At $40 a packet, if you have a packet a day, that is $15,000 a year. And, again, if you apply the 30 per cent tax rate—because all of this is after-tax money; you do not get a tax deduction for helping yourself die early—the actual cost is over $20,000 a year. If you multiply that by the 10 or 12 years, by the time you are young adults there you have $200,000 in the bank earning interest, probably up to about $240,000 or $250,000—if I had the financial capacity of the finance minister, he could probably tell me what the compound interest rate would be. There is the money you have, and you have your health.


The question is often asked: to what extent are we interfering in the privacy of people by imposing taxes that make smoking more difficult? Of itself, if somebody decides to smoke, you would say, 'Well, that's their business; let them do it; let them take on the financial burden,' as I have just suggested. But there is an analogy that has been mentioned by Senator Fawcett, in his experience, of being in the cockpit of an aircraft where he could not see because of his copilot, and so he had to go onto instrument rating. It is a question of the effect on other people, of course. It is the effect of passive smoking. It is the effect on children in a car. It is the effect on other people in a room. When it goes from being something to do with the person to others around that person who can have no influence on the behaviour of that person, it changes dramatically.


I want to give you an example away from smoking. I want to direct this to the experience recently we had as a result of Senator Whish-Wilson, who asked us to participate in a Senate inquiry into marine plastics. I was involved in the committee—not that I necessarily wanted to be, but I thought, 'That's fair enough.' I knew little about this. Probably one of the joys of our work in the Senate is that we are drawn into areas that we normally would not have the opportunity or excuse to examine. I was not aware that all plastics will eventually reduce to microplastics. I was not aware, particularly, that we already had microplastics in things like toothpaste and various other items.




Senator Whish-Wilson:
  Beauty products.




Senator BACK:
   Thank you for that, Senator Whish-Wilson. I probably do not use too many beauty products, as is evident. But, nevertheless, I should have known that. We learned in that inquiry, as Senator Whish-Wilson probably already knew, that plastics break down in the environment. They do not disappear; they do not dissipate; they become microplastics. Plankton take up the microplastics, little fish eat the plankton, big fish eat the little fish and we eat the big fish.


What really drew my attention particularly to this exercise, and why it is relevant to this discussion, is the fact that there is a growing body of evidence that those microplastics are getting into the cells of human beings. Of itself, that is important enough to protect the oceans from plastics. I accept that. But when we cross that boundary to the realisation that we may well be looking at a circumstance of adverse human health as a result of this, you can bet your life—through you, Madam Deputy President, to Senator Whish-Wilson—that my focus of attention elevated.


I come back now to that comment associated with privacy. Yes, it is an invasion of privacy to tax something to the level where it probably becomes unattainable for a lot of people. Again, if that is the decision of an adult—to place themselves at risk from a health point of view—one could say that the role of government and others is to warn them of that and to let them make their own decision. That is probably right. But when it comes to the health of other people, it is not right.


The statistic that Senator Fawcett gave to us in his contribution was interesting—that is, in 2001, 22 per cent of adults in Australia smoked. That had gone down to 16 per cent by 2010. It is now 14 per cent. I actually want to give credit to the then health minister, Mr Tony Abbott. If you look at that dramatic decline—of 22 per cent at the beginning of the decade, down to 16 per cent by the end of the decade—it was in his capacity as health minister that the placing of those offensive warnings on packets had the biggest effect on young people not smoking. Again, I do give credit, as others have done, to Ms Roxon in her move towards plain packaging. I did not like it very much, but, nevertheless, it is apparent that we have seen a further reduction in adult smoking levels. So I give her credit for that fact.


I also make mention of the illicit trade in cigarettes. I note that there are funds intended to be directed for border protection to control further this issue. I also do understand, through sources, that the import illegally of cigarettes into this country is so lucrative that, if a consignment is intercepted by border protection and is, therefore, removed, the suppliers will actually supply the illegal importer, free of charge, with replacements of that number of cigarettes. So it really does become an issue of enormous importance to us. Others have mentioned the loss of excise by illegal imports of tobacco and cigarettes. But I also say that it must be so lucrative and so pervasive if the suppliers of those illegal cigarettes are willing to actually replace the products free of charge.


I am also aware that there is technology available here in Australia which, I understand, electronically identifies and marks packets and individual sticks so that government regulators can actually identify whether a packet or a cigarette has been legally or illegally obtained prior to its purchase. I would urge government—the relevant ministers—to pursue this technology further. I know that in the last couple of years I have actually recommended that those who supply such products and services meet with relevant ministers. Anything that can be done to wipe out, diminish or minimise this illegal trade, in my view, should be undertaken.


I want to turn to the impact in financial terms. My understanding is that over the forward estimates this legislation will deliver some $4.6 billion to the overall revenue base. As I understand it, all sides in this chamber support the legislation—certainly, the Labor Party, the coalition and the Greens support the legislation.


I was loud in my praise of Ms Roxon a few minutes ago with regard to her move for plain packaging of cigarettes. On the other hand, I now want to draw the attention of the chamber to something that I think was a mistake Ms Roxon made in her earlier capacity. That was when she introduced the alcopops legislation, which was always about raising tax. The coalition had no difficulty with a proposition that was going to raise tax. She should have said that it was a tax measure and she would have received little if any criticism. The mistake actually was to try to tie it up not in terms of it being a tax measure but in terms of it being a health measure, because by increasing the tax significantly on alcopops young people would in some way stop consuming them. Well, they stopped consuming them all right. As we all said would happen, instead of buying a can of mixed drink that had vodka, whiskey, brandy or whatever it was in with a mixing soft drink—of course, that was taxed out of existence—the kids then all went and bought 750 millimetre bottles of the spirits and bought the mixes separately, whether it was Coke or dry ginger ale or whatever. So, instead of just drinking the smaller quantity of alcopops they ended up drinking a larger quantity, because, as we know, no-one of that age is likely to stop drinking until the bottle is empty.


So I applaud the government and everyone in the chamber for the decision to explain very bluntly what this is. And it is two-fold. First, it is to improve directly the health of the community itself and the health of those affected by smoking, whether they smoke or they are in a smoky environment. Second, it is a measure to make sure that we can repair some of the budget.


In support of those comments I want to applaud the finance minister, the Treasurer and the shadow financial portfolio of personnel for what I understand is a measure and a move to pass the omnibus bill, which will achieve some $6 billion in savings. There has never been a more important time in the modern history of this country for us to get our debt and our deficit under control. There are black clouds over the entire world economy, and we are not immune. The best way that we can guarantee to the Australian people that there is sufficient funding for education, for health, for the legendary NDIS program, for welfare generally, for pensions, for defence and for border protection—for all of those purposes that we, and the community, regard government as having a primary role in—is to have a strong budget and move towards a surplus. So, instead of wasting $12-$15 billion a year paying interest on our debt, the Treasurer and the finance minister can turn that $12-$15 billion into savings and into supporting the lifestyle that this country has come to expect.


For those who do not think there are black clouds hanging over the world economy, you need look no further than Western Europe, Eastern Europe, the Middle East, the United States and Asia. So I commend the legislation and I commend the chamber for its support.

"Seselja, Sen Zed",LP,2016-09-14,"



Senator SESELJA
 (Australian Capital Territory—Assistant Minister for Social Services and Multicultural Affairs) (12:04):  It is good to follow my good friend Senator Back in contributing to this debate. I might just pick up a little bit where Senator Back left off in terms of budget repair. I will go into some of the details on smoking rates and the like in a moment.


There is no doubt that budget repair is absolutely critically important. We have seen the announcement yesterday of over $6 billion in savings. That is very important. I commend Scott Morrison and Mathias Cormann for their work in continuing that work to find savings, because that is the main task. There is no doubt about it. When it comes to taxation, which I will move onto in a moment, we have rejected the Labor Party's approach in broad, which is to have a whole range of tax increases in a range of areas. If Labor had come into government they would have taxed a whole host of things more. One of those is, of course, investment in housing. The reason I make that point is that if you want people to do less of something you tax it more. That is what I am going to get into when discussing this bill. If you want people to invest less you tax it more. The Labor Party had that approach when it came to investment in housing and we see that as a shocking idea.


When it comes to taxing things like smoking, obviously there is a slightly different imperative, because we do actually want to see people smoking less—we do. We can put that into stark contrast with when there are tax grabs by the Labor Party on things like negative gearing and capital gains tax, because that is taxing investment and discouraging it. The government and I certainly want to see more investment in housing and in a whole range of other areas.


It is pleasing to be speaking to these bills, the Excise Tariff Amendment (Tobacco) Bill 2016 and the Customs Tariff Amendment (Tobacco) Bill 2016. As a senator for the ACT, I want to note the low rates of smoking we have here in the ACT—the lowest in the country. Figures from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare show that in 2013 in the ACT we had a daily smoking rate of 10 per cent—which, as I will discuss in due course, is the target for smoking rates Australia-wide. Furthermore, in the ACT, we had the highest rate of people who had never smoked—with 65 per cent of Canberrans having not taken up the habit. I can certainly attest—as many others can—that this has all sorts of benefits for individuals, but there are also benefits from living in a relatively smoke-free city. Despite the fact that we have the lowest rates in the country, we would of course like to see those rates continue to decline, as they have in recent years.


The sad reality is that each year smoking kills an estimated 15,000 Australians and costs Australia $31.5 billion in social—including health—and economic costs. Governments of both parties have long fought to decrease smoking rates and the various health impacts that come from smoking. A range of methods have been used over the years to get these rates down. We have seen awareness campaigns, with organisations such as Quit working hard to help people stop smoking. We have also used various economic mechanisms to get smoking rates down by helping people stop and discouraging smokers from taking up the habit in the first place. These bills are another element of ensuring our success in getting smoking rates down continues.


There has been a sustained, concerted effort by all levels of government since the 1970s to improve health outcomes when it comes to smoking. Since the first health warnings were mandated on cigarette packs in 1973, it has been a long road to get where we are today. Long gone are the days of smoking indoors, on planes, in workplaces and in restaurants. Particularly since the turn of the century, we have a good story to tell with getting smoking rates down. In 2001, 22.3 per cent of the population were smokers. In 2004-05 that had dropped by one per cent to 21.3 per cent. In 2007-08 we saw a further drop to 19.1 per cent. In 2011-12 we saw it drop to 16.3 per cent. And, most recently, in 2014-15 it has dropped even further to 14.7 per cent. So there has been great success here in getting good outcomes for smokers, with all of the flow-on health benefits for hundreds of thousands of people in our community.


Perhaps most impressively, amongst the most recent ABS figures there is a statistic that is very encouraging, which is that 52.6 per cent of Australians have never smoked. That means that we have a whole cohort of young people who have listened to the educational and awareness campaigns out there, know the health problems associated with smoking and are making the choice to not even try smoking in the first place. We know how addictive smoking can be. I have never been a smoker myself, but a number of family members have been and I have watched them try to quit, quit, take it up again and quit again. It is a very challenging addiction for many people to get over. So, of course, it is much better if our kids do not try it in the first place. I would emphasise that to young people. It is certainly a message I give my kids, and I hope that they take that advice. So far, so good—as far as I know. You never quite know what your kids are up to all the time, but I am pretty confident that none of them are smokers and I am very hopeful that none of them will be smokers. Certainly the message to them is not to engage in that habit. 


A 2014 study on school students' use of tobacco found that smoking among 12- to 15-year-olds is at its lowest since 1984 when studies of this type began. Even more encouraging, the study found that 94 per cent of 12-year-olds have never smoked and 61 per cent of 17-year-olds have not had a cigarette either. So I think we can say that what was once one of our greatest health challenges is becoming less of a challenge, though of course we know that there is more that needs to be done.


Through COAG, all Australian governments have committed to getting the smoking rate down to 10 per cent. As I noted earlier, that is the rate here in the ACT—and of course we would like to get it lower than that. We have still got some way to go and I think it would be a significant achievement to get the rate to 10 per cent nationally. With that in mind, these bills will increase tobacco excise charged on domestic production and equivalent customs duties charged on imports by way of four annual increases of 12.5 per cent a year from 2017 until 2020. This will replicate the annual increases that were put in place from 2013 to 2016. In addition, adult average weekly ordinary time earnings based indexation of tobacco excise rates will continue. The next biannual indexation of tobacco excise will occur on 1 March 2017.


From 1 September 2016 the excise and excise equivalent duty rates on tobacco is approximately 61c per stick and $763.20 per kilogram of tobacco content. This equates to $15.26 in excise on a packet of 25 cigarettes, which retails currently for approximately $25.00. Ignoring biannual indexation, the 12.5 per cent increases will increase excise per pack of 25 cigarettes by around $2 each year. This means that, after the final increase in 2020, the excise component of a pack of 25 cigarettes will be $21.50. The increase in excise and duty will move Australia towards the World Health Organization's recommendation that excise should comprise 70 per cent of the price of a cigarette. All that said, it is difficult to say how this will precisely affect prices as cigarette companies may change their prices in other ways. But the central point remains that these bills aim to reduce the prevalence of smoking in Australia and thus minimise the harm of cigarette smoking to the community.


It has been very clear for some time, as we have been on this journey to reduce smoking rates, that increasing the price of cigarettes via taxation is one of the most effective ways of reducing tobacco consumption and preventing the uptake of smoking. Higher prices encourage smokers to quit or reduce their consumption and discourage potential smokers, particularly young Australians, from taking up the habit. There have been a number of significant increases in the tobacco excise, particularly since 2010, and the lowering of smoking rates over that time clearly demonstrates how this has worked.


As I have mentioned, the Council of Australian Governments have set a target of reducing the daily adult smoking rate to 10 per cent of the population. This commitment sits alongside a similar commitment to halve the daily rate of smoking among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people by 2018. This measure will also assist the government to make further progress on these goals. It is one of the most unfortunate and troubling aspects of this discussion that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians, people in remote areas and people of the lowest socioeconomic status all have higher rates of smoking than the general population. Certainly I understand, as does the government, that this means that there are challenges when we increase the excise. We understand that, for those who feel unable to quit, this does create a financial burden. It can be very tough; I acknowledge that. And that is one of the challenging parts of dealing with this issue. Obviously, the hope is that people will not end up spending so much money on smoking. The hope is that they will spend, in future, no money on smoking, as it encourages them to quit. So they will not only save the money they are currently spending on cigarettes but also gain all of the health benefits that flow from quitting smoking. They will have more money in their pockets and, hopefully, a much healthier lifestyle and a longer life. Hopefully, they will avoid some of the worst things that come from long-term smoking and that are linked to long-term smoking—particularly things like lung cancer, which of course has such a devastating impact on those who suffer from it.


As has always been the case in our efforts to reduce smoking, this change sits alongside the numerous interventions the Commonwealth has made to reduce the prevalence of smoking, including a comprehensive ban on tobacco advertising and promotion, retail display bans, Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme subsidies for smoking-cessation supports, and extensive and continuing public education campaigns. As we have clearly established in this place during this debate, these efforts are working, so it is vital that we continue to make the changes we need to continue these great outcomes.


I note that of course these bills also play a broader role in this government's efforts to get the budget under control and to build a strong economic platform into the future. These bills will raise $4.59 billion across the forward estimates period. In comparison, goods and services tax receipts are estimated to increase by $430 million over the same period. The revenue gained from higher tobacco excise will be used by the government to provide a range of services, including health services. I know that in the other place they have been working through the Budget Savings (Omnibus) Bill 2016, and no doubt we will soon be debating it here. I particularly look forward to that debate. As I mentioned earlier, broadly, when it comes to issues around budget repair, our view in the coalition is that the primary way of getting the budget under control is to control spending—to limit spending growth and to find reasonable savings where we can find them. That is the best way to bring the budget back under control. As I also mentioned earlier, the exceptions to that are things like the tobacco tax, where we are taxing something that we would like to see less of, not taxing things like investment and economic growth and jobs, which, of course, we want to see more of. So there is a significantly different approach between the coalition and our opposition when it comes to taxation.


But, when it comes to these bills, of course, we are looking to see less tobacco consumed in this country. We are looking to see rates of smoking going down rather than coming back up again. These bills are an important part of that. This measure is an important part of the government's comprehensive tobacco control strategy, which includes investment in antismoking social marketing campaigns, subsidies for nicotine replacement therapies and the introduction of plain packaging for tobacco products.


The government also announced in the budget that it will strengthen the penalties for illicit tobacco offences and provide an additional $7.7 million for the tobacco strike team to combat illicit tobacco activity. This is a particularly important measure to ensure the effectiveness of the tobacco excise increase. I have heard from many here in my community in Canberra about the illegal importing of tobacco and the black market for cigarettes. Australia has a strong legislative and regulatory framework to control illicit trade in tobacco products. The Australian Taxation Office and the Australian Border Force will continue to have a strong ongoing role in monitoring and enforcement activity against illicit tobacco. This is an important fight, and we are going to continue to keep our borders secure and work against this illicit trade.


So it is clear that these bills are important for Australia's health and, of course, for our budget. The fact is that 15,000 people dying from smoking related illnesses is too many. Even though we have made great progress over the last few decades in getting smoking rates down, we certainly cannot be complacent. With a goal of reducing smoking to 10 per cent across all states and territories by 2018, we have a clear target to hit, and the entire suite of government efforts will continue.


History has shown that we need a range of policies to combat smoking. We need advertising campaigns and health awareness campaigns. We need to be in schools talking to young people and out in the community encouraging people to quit. But we also do need to combine these efforts with other measures, including the price signals contained in these bills. So that is what these bills do. Regular increases in the tobacco excise over the next four years will bring our policies into line with international standards. They will lift the price of cigarettes, which has been a proven way to get smoking rates down. Once again, I note that there are, obviously, impacts on those who struggle to quit smoking, and we will do what we can to encourage people and to assist people so that not only can their health improve as a result of quitting smoking but their bank balance can improve as well.


I would note once again, in closing, that I think we should be proud of the fact that here in the ACT we see the lowest rates of smoking in the country. We want to continue to bring those rates down, particularly for our young people, because it is such an addictive thing. Smoking is addictive. Nicotine is addictive. To avoid smoking in the first place, as a young person—to avoid being drawn into that—is a much better path than having the great challenges of quitting. We see it with family and friends; it is a tough habit to break. We commend those who do manage to do so. But I would advise people not to start smoking in the first place. That figure of 52 per cent of Australians now who have never smoked is good. We want to see that figure continue to go up, as we hopefully see a generation of young Australians for whom this is really not something that they do. I commend these bills to the Senate and look forward to their passage.

Senator SCULLION
 (Northern Territory—Minister for Indigenous Affairs and Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (12:22):  I rise in support of the Excise Tariff Amendment (Tobacco) Bill 2016 and the Customs Tariff Amendment (Tobacco) Bill 2016, and I have to say that this legislation is of special interest to me and to my portfolio of Indigenous Affairs. I have personally seen, as I am sure have many in the chamber, the devastating impact of smoking on far too many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. So, through my portfolio we have three priorities: getting kids to school, getting adults to work and ensuring that communities are safer. But we are not going to achieve this when our First Australians die 10.6 years earlier, for males—9.5 years earlier for females—and, generally speaking, enjoy far poorer health outcomes.


That is why the coalition government is committed to closing the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians across a whole range of measures. Madam Deputy President, I know you would be aware that the Closing the Gap measures started as a suite of health measures and have grown over time. Part of the motivation for those fundamental measures initially was to address the health gap. If you are not healthy it is very difficult to engage in education. If you are not healthy it is very difficult to engage in employment. If you are not healthy it is very difficult to engage in the sorts of opportunities that other Australians take for granted. So one of those Closing the Gap targets is to close the gap in life expectancy between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians by 2031.


Closing the gap is particularly challenging because it is not only about ensuring that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people live longer; it is also a matter of ensuring that they catch up with the remainder of the medical miracles that constantly make those in the mainstream live longer. So it is a very challenging gap but obviously one that is absolutely fundamental to the Closing the Gap process. If we are going to achieve this, then if there is any lever that is available to us we need to ensure that we can pull that lever. This legislation is one of those levers.


The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare report titled Australia's health 2016, which was released just this week, reinforces why we need to tackle smoking rates. Let me share with the Senate some of the report's key findings. Between one-third and one-half of the health gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians is associated with differences in socioeconomic position. Only 39 per cent of Indigenous Australians rated their health as 'excellent' or 'very good' in 2012-13, a decrease from 44 per cent in 2008 and 43 per cent in 2004 and 2005. A further 37 per cent of Indigenous Australians reported their health as 'good', 17 per cent as 'fair' and seven per cent as 'poor' in 2012-13. By comparison, more than half of Australians more generally—56 per cent—rated their health as 'excellent' or 'very good', only 10.4 per cent as 'fair' and 4.4 per cent as 'poor'. There is a stark contrast.


Chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease and cancer, are responsible for a majority of the life expectancy gap. Certainly it has been my observation that, particularly in very remote areas and very remote communities, the nature of the environment is a factor in chronic disease. Whilst smoking is a part of that, if a person has rheumatic heart disease, which is one of the largest killers in our communities—and I have to commend those who are working very stridently at the moment, particularly Menzies, to try to provide some respite via a vaccination or other processes in that regard—it is like an accumulation of things that can go wrong in that person's life, an accumulation of things that are negatively affecting their body and how it works.


Rheumatic heart disease, congestive heart failure, various types of lung disease—a lot of them are caused by the circumstances in the community. There may be a house that people do not themselves own, so it is very difficult to know who is responsible for it. People are coming and going, visiting the house, and it is not the normal circumstance of a house that someone is actually responsible for; it is a circumstance where a lot of people are responsible. I suppose it is a little like the 'tragedy of the commons': you cannot identify someone who is particularly responsible for this house in the way that you can in many normal households.


So the circumstance is that some of these houses are, as we would say, a bit dirty. Having many fingers at child level moving around the place makes it a bit grubby. But we are now starting to understand that such an environment has a direct impact on health. And when we see that some of these chronic disease presentations—cardiovascular diseases particularly—are being impacted by that, we have to ensure that we start to look after that environment, and that goes to how we can better manage some of our tenancies in this area and how we can assist those families, because it just gets on top of them. They have lots of visitors, lots of people going through, and they just do not have the capacity to ensure that the house does not have such a negative impact on people's health.


As I said, chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease and cancer are responsible for a majority of the life expectancy gap. We in this place would all know about the strong association between cancer and smoking. I have to confess that I have been a smoker during my life, and if I have one or two beers there is certainly that tendency to want to go and, in the vernacular, 'bot a durry' from someone. I think even the most chronic smokers—speaking of which, good to see you, Senator O'Sullivan!—know themselves that they would like to not be smokers. And it is really interesting in communities: it is not as though communities are not absolutely aware that smoking is bad for you. If I am in a community in north-east Arnhem Land and I see someone light up in a tree, people will yell out—it is a wonderful way that they have got in north-east Arnhem Land—'Quit smoking!' They will say, 'No durries.' They will do it in a likely place, but each time, as they would say, it provides a little shame for someone who is lighting up. The whole community give a bit of a yell out in that regard. 


So it is not as if people are not aware that smoking is bad for them. As I have heard from some other speakers this morning, it is, of course, the nature of addiction. The evidence is that nicotine is one of the most difficult drugs in your system to get rid of. It not only provides the circumstances where you are in a much more vulnerable demographic; also you are much more likely to develop cancer if you are a smoker. Obviously, there are a whole range of other issues. We still need to work very hard on exactly how we try to ensure that this is no longer cool in the community. There are demographics within a community that we can ensure are made aware in a way that appeals to them. It is that which this bill addresses. Whilst the smoking rate—that is, the daily and less-than-daily rate—for Indigenous Australians has declined somewhat, Indigenous Australians are still 2.6 times as likely to smoke daily as non-Indigenous Australians, whose rate is around 15 per cent.


In 2013, Indigenous mothers were 3.6 times as likely to smoke during pregnancy as non-Indigenous women. I have to say I despair sometimes because there are groups—sometimes very vulnerable groups—who do not have access to the same sort of constant education. If you go into any of the medical centres, for sure the walls are festooned with warnings about smoking during pregnancy and the negative effects it can have on your unborn child. But, given the numbers of people who still smoke when they are pregnant, clearly the message is not getting through to them. We need to do our very best to ensure that that is no longer the case.


We are not going to close the gap in life expectancy if we do not lower the rates of smoking among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians. Of course, the smoking rates are on top of a number of other startling facts in terms of that difference. For example, in 2015, the immunisation rate for one- and two-year-old Indigenous children was much lower than the rate of all children. It was 89 per cent compared with 92 per cent for one-year-olds and 86 per cent compared with 89 per cent for two-year-olds. The immunisation rate for Indigenous five-year-olds was higher than the rate for all children—that is, 94 per cent compared with 93 per cent. This is a startling difference. 


All of these statistics have a parallel. They are all connected and they are all contextualised around the actual gap that they create. If you cannot get immunisation processes right and if you cannot reduce the rates of smoking then life expectancy for our First Australians and the gap between the mainstream and our First Australians is going to close very slowly, if at all.


In 2012-13, after adjusting for the differences in the age structure, Indigenous adults living in non-remote areas were still more likely than non-Indigenous adults to not have undertaken the recommended level of physical activity in the past week. That is another 10 per cent difference. 


Whether it is smoking or whether it is immunisation, all of these matters need to be dealt with to ensure that that headline of life expectancy is actually dealt with. That is why it has been so important to ensure that we have a whole-of-government approach. I have to say it is so much easier, now that my portfolio is under Prime Minister and Cabinet, to deal with some of the structural matters that we have done. We now have a cabinet subcommittee with all the other ministers who are responsible. In this case, it is the minister for health, but it is the same with Employment, Environment or whatever the area is. For the very first time, we can have a far more structured approach to those matters.


Obesity was also more common amongst Indigenous Australian adults aged 18 and over. Between 2012 and 2013, after adjusting for differences in age structure, Indigenous adults were 1.6 times more likely to be obese than non-Indigenous—that is, 43 per cent compared with only 27 per cent for non-Indigenous adults.


In 2012-13, a high proportion—26 per cent—of Indigenous Australians aged 15 and over reported that they had not drunk any alcohol in the previous 12 months. After adjusting for age differences, this was 1.6 times the non-Indigenous rate. In some areas, quite clearly there is no grey area of every now and again. Those people who are prepared to go down the road of abstinence do so quite proudly and often as a family. It sometimes cannot be done community by community or area by area. But this indicates that, to be absolutely successful at this and to ensure that we can be successful at this, we need to recognise that a family group and the peers within that family group can lead a better behaviour, a different behaviour and, in this case, a healthier behaviour than any other process might actually deliver.


In 2012-13, Indigenous Australians aged 15 and over were 1.1 times as likely as non-Indigenous Australians to exceed the national alcohol guidelines for single-occasion risk—that is, 50 per cent and 44 per cent respectively. Amongst prison entrants, the use of methamphetamine was more common amongst non-Indigenous entrants than Indigenous entrants—54 per cent and 38 per cent respectively. Whilst we have a scourge that you would expect for those populations that have had difficulty in dealing with some other health issues that I have outlined, quite clearly there are some exceptions to that, and we need to drill into those demographics to find out why they have been more resilient. I have to say, though, that I have been nothing short of petrified when I have seen the scourge of ice and the vulnerability of my community, particularly in remote communities. Yet there seems to have been a line put down that, while there are some substances that are semitolerated in the  community, methamphetamine and its associated drugs are not. They have put a hard line down. People are as frightened as I am. I am delighted that these substances have not simply raged through these communities like a bushfire, as we were all so worried they would. Again, we need to tap into the leadership that can provide that sort of inoculation against those sorts of scourges. We need to ask the advice of that leadership about how we may improve the messaging, whether it is around obesity, whether it is around levels of exercise or whether it is around levels of smoking. They have shown leadership in a way that works, and we need to look very carefully at that leadership and how we might apply that particularly to smoking. 


I was just an hour ago at a meeting with Julie Tongs from Winnunga Nimmityjah Aboriginal Health Service here in Canberra. We were talking about a number of these issues. When talking to Aboriginal health services, it seems if someone is smoking it is generally an indicator—there are obviously other indicators—that they are suffering other poor health symptoms. I have yet to understand a little more about that, but it is still an issue to be highlighted. If you can get people into an Aboriginal medical service, invariably as part of a health check, whatever the presentation is, someone will ask you if you are a smoker. If you are, someone will invariably say to you, 'This is having an impact on your life, it is having an impact on your family and it is having an impact on your capacity to help your family out by providing leadership by being a nonsmoker yourself.' I would like to commend the AMSs not only for the education systems that they run but also for the very strong message that they provide.


Wherever I go around the country, and I have been to over 150 communities on over 200 occasions, I always see there is a culture of smoking in communities. These bills will increase tobacco excise, which is charged on domestic production, and equivalent customs duty, which is charged on imports, by way of four annual increases of 12.5 per cent a year from 2017 to 2020. In addition, the AWOTE—average weekly ordinary time earnings—based indexation of tobacco excise rates will continue. The next biannual indexation of tobacco excise will occur on 1 March 2017. 


The increase in excise and duty will move Australia towards the World Health Organization's recommendation that excise should comprise 70 per cent of the price of a cigarette. The World Health Organization have been around a very long time, and they understand that the price of cigarettes has a direct correlation to your capacity to make a decision to no longer be a smoker. It also has a direct correlation to how many cigarettes you get access to at any particular time. We have not reached a 70 per cent excise level, but I think we have certainly made a very serious move towards it. Each year smoking kills an estimated 15,000 Australians and costs Australia $31.5 billion in social costs—including health and economic costs. Increasing the price of cigarettes via taxation is one of the most effective ways of reducing tobacco consumption and preventing the uptake of smoking. 


The government announced in the budget that it will strengthen the penalties for illicit tobacco offences and provide an additional $7.7 million for the tobacco strike team to combat illicit tobacco activity. This is in recognition of the fact that there is no point saying, 'We are going to put an excise on it and we are going to make it more expensive,' without recognising it increases the attractiveness of criminal behaviour. We acknowledge that whatever you do there is a consequence. When you have a consequence, you have to be a sophisticated enough government to react to that. Australia has a strong legislative and regulatory framework to control illicit trade in tobacco products. The Australian Taxation Office and the Australian Border Force will continue to have a strong ongoing role in monitoring and enforcement activity against illicit tobacco. Again, that is a sophisticated approach, and it has to be. Every time we introduce legislation we know there is going to be a consequence and we have to be across that.


These bills are an important plank in helping to turn that culture and lower smoking rates, particularly in communities. We need to pull every lever against smoking, which is at 2.6 times the non-Indigenous rates. I commend these bills to the Senate.

Senator CASH
 (Western Australia—Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service, Minister for Employment and Minister for Women) (12:42):  I too rise to make a contribution to the debate on the Excise Tariff Amendment (Tobacco) Bill 2016 and the Customs Tariff Amendment (Tobacco) Bill 2016. These will increase tobacco excise charged on domestic production and equivalent customs duties, which are of course charged on imports, by way of four annual increases of 12.5 per cent a year from 2017 through to 2020. Certainly, in listening to the address that was just given by my colleague Senator Scullion, the Minister for Indigenous Affairs, I think one begins to understand very much the purpose and the reasons behind the government proceeding with these bills. 



The increase in excise and duty will move Australia towards the 
World Health Organiz
ation's recommendation that exc
ise should comprise 70 per cent
 of the price of a cigarette. There are very, very good evidentiary reasons for this. You see this in advertising and you see it on the cigarette packets themselves, but it is a fact that each year smoking kills an estimated 15,000 Australians. If that was not bad enough, you also have the cost to the Australian economy. Each year smoking costs the Australian economy approximately $31.5 billion in social costs, and economic costs. Those costs include the huge impact of smoking on our health system. So these bills are very much aimed at reducing the prevalence of smoking in society and thus, of course, minimising the harm to the Australian community of 
cigarette smoking. It is a fact that increasing the price of cigarettes via taxation is one of the most effective ways of reducing tobacco consumption.

Senator DUNIAM
 (Tasmania) (09:32):  Last night I was mid-flight, talking about the history of tobacco excise in Australia. Given that I was cut off midstream, I think it is a good opportunity for me to recap some of the statistics that—



Senator Ian Macdonald interjecting—




Senator DUNIAM:
  Yes, I thought that would be a good idea, Senator Macdonald—to recap on some of the statistics around the importance of dealing with tobacco related and cancer related diseases. I mentioned yesterday the fundamental fact that tobacco was responsible for about 7.8 per cent of the total burden of disease and injury in Australia, as reported in 2003, which I am told is the equivalent of 15,000 deaths per year. And, as was noted by a number of other speakers in the debate, it is responsible for a cost of around $31.5 billion in health, social and economic related costs in the years 2004-05. You have to wonder where that cost is at today. So this merely highlights the importance of this piece of legislation as one of the suite of measures that have been put in place by this government to deal with smoking and smoking related diseases. 


Some of the other statistics I went through yesterday related to our home state of Tasmania and where we stand with reference to the rest of the country. Some of those statistics were quite alarming. In terms of my own cohort, younger males in Tasmania between the ages of 25 and 34, about 40 per cent of that demographic are smokers. Then you move up to the 35- to 44-year-olds and it is not much lower—about 38.6 per cent—far too high, as I said yesterday. I think most senators in this chamber would agree. 


The one most concerning statistic about the health and wellbeing of younger Tasmanians, as I said yesterday, is that Tasmania continues to have the highest proportion of women who smoke during pregnancy. That is not just impacting the individual smoking, but the unborn child. The prevalence of young women smoking during pregnancy in Tasmania was 35.7 per cent for those under 20, and 30.8 per cent for those aged between 20 and 24. Amongst Indigenous Tasmanians it was found to be almost 50 per cent of the population in 2008—44.5 per cent. 


I touched on the problems related to minors smoking tobacco in our state. The 2011 Australian secondary school alcohol and drug survey showed that six per cent of 12- to 15-year-olds were smokers. I certainly was not smoking back then. I did not really even have a good understanding of what these sticks that people were putting in their mouths were. But to learn that five years ago—and I hope that number has gone down—six per cent of people in that age group, 12 to 15 years of age, were smoking is just incredibly alarming. Then you move to the slightly higher age group 16- and 17-year-olds—still under the legal age—16 per cent of them have taken up the habit. 


But the best statistic, I think, is in relation to how younger people have become aware over recent years—through various education campaigns, through the packaging legislation and the like, and various community attitudes which seem to be prevailing at the moment—about the impact that smoking has on one's health. The 2011 survey that I mentioned earlier on reported that 96 per cent of students agree that smoking causes lung cancer and harms unborn babies. So, while there are those alarming statistics, which I have recapped on now, I think it is great to know that young people, who have their whole lives ahead of them, are beginning to appreciate the damage they are doing to their bodies, and those around them, with reference to smoking. 


I was also speaking about the history of tobacco laws, particularly the excise tax situation in Australia, but one thing I want to touch on in Tasmania are smoke-free zones. Over the years, there have been a number of legislative measures put in place in the state of Tasmania regarding restrictions on smoking in certain areas. We all know you cannot smoke in planes, workplaces and other obvious locations, but in Tasmania in the year 2001 it became illegal to smoke in workplaces and in enclosed public places, such as shopping centres, restaurants, factories, hospitals, corridors and toilets. 


Further smoke-free areas were introduced in the state of Tasmania, including three metres outside entrances and exits of aforementioned locations; within 10 metres of ventilation equipment, air conditioning towers and things like that—which I think is a good move, because what is the point of restricting smoking inside if you are just going to blow it in through the air conditioning ducts; inside work vehicles and also in seating at cultural and sporting events and venues. 


Then you move through to 2005, where gaming areas and nightclubs were added to that list, and then a 50 per cent portion of outdoor dining areas. In 2006 pubs and clubs and hotels in Tasmania became smoke-free on the inside—completely smoke-free. Then, fast-forwarding to 2012, there were new smoke-free areas introduced, including playgrounds, patrolled beaches, pedestrian and bus malls and bus shelters. Then it was 100 per cent of outdoor dining areas, which is something I recall in the local media in Tasmania caused a great deal of consternation around people wanting to enjoy a cigarette while having their meal or their drink. But I think for the most part people welcomed the right to have a meal without having to inhale their neighbouring table's smoke. 


Then it was competition and seating areas at sporting events and other large public events. Later that year, carols by candlelight events were required to be smoke-free. The next year, 2013, selected markets and food and wine festivals and music festivals were added to the list. This was in addition to specific measures by the Hobart City Council and the Launceston City Council. And it is this combination of approaches to restricting where smoking can take place, and indeed measures like this—like the excise tax—which have helped Australia tackle the problem of smoking and the impact on health in our country. Thank you, Mr President.

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",NXT,2016-09-14,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (09:39):  I support the Excise Tariff Amendment (Tobacco) Bill 2016 and the Customs Tariff Amendment (Tobacco) Bill 2016. This is important legislation, given that each year smoking kills an estimated 15,000 Australians and costs Australians $31.5 billion in social—including health—and economic costs. These are statistics from the Department of Health; they are uncontroverted. We know the damage that smoking does. There are some aspects of this legislation that ought to be ventilated in the context of how it will operate. I also want to raise the issue of the paucity of anti-smoking measures and support for those that want to quit smoking.


Back in 2004, as a member of the South Australian Legislative Council, I moved an amendment to legislation that the South Australian Labor government introduced to ensure there was a trial of at least 1,000 places, 1,000 individuals, to get the benefit of free nicotine replacement therapy. It was something that the Labor government in South Australia inexplicably opposed. It was supported by the opposition and the crossbenchers, and at the end of the day it got up and the trial went ahead, as I understand it. 


The issue here is an important one. It is as relevant now as it was back in 2004—that is, governments seem to be willing to rake in massive amounts of revenue from tobacco excise. Let us put this in some perspective. In 2009-10, $5.6 billion was raised; in 2010-11, $6.3 billion; in 2011-12, $5.4 billion; in 2012-13, $5.8 billion; in 2013-14, when there was a jump in the excise, $8.4 billion; and, in 2014-15, the most recent year that I have details for, $8.8 billion. That works out to something like $40 billion over that period. How much did the federal government spend during that period on anti-smoking campaigns? The figure I have for that period is $135 million. When compared to something like $40 billion in revenue, that is a pretty poor effort. 


If we are serious about reducing the smoking rate as quickly as possible to reduce the impact of smoking on the community, to ensure that we do not have 15,000 Australians dying each year because of smoking and to ensure that it does not cost our nation $31½ billion a year in social, health and economic costs, then we need to be fair dinkum about providing more resources for anti-smoking campaigns. We need also to make it easier for people wanting to quit by giving them all the support they need, and we need to ensure that we do not demonise smokers. 


In relation to nicotine replacement therapy, an issue that I raised in the South Australian parliament back in 2004, the cost to government in repatriation, in PBS benefits for smoking cessation therapy, for 2014 was $47.8 million. There is a real issue as to whether nicotine replacement therapy ought be free or ought to be trialled on a free basis, rather than people having to put their hands in their pockets, to make it much easier for people to kick the habit. It is a very addictive habit. We need to assist people to kick the habit as soon as possible. 


I will be asking the government what commitments they will be making with the additional excise they will get from this legislation. What commitments will they be making to ensure that there will be more help for people to quit smoking? I note the objective of these bills is to improve the health of Australians by reducing their exposure to tobacco products. Under this legislation, increases in excise ensure that average cigarette prices are more closely aligned with the World Health Organization recommendation concerning the proportion that excise and excise-equivalent customs duty should comprise of the price of a cigarette.


I hope this legislation will be examined in a short committee stage. I ask the government what commitments there are to spend the massive increase in tobacco excise the Commonwealth has been getting in recent years on nicotine replacement therapy, on Quit campaigns and on funding organisations such as Action on Smoking and Health, which I worked with over the years and which did a terrific job of advocacy in the public health space in relation to this. These are important issues that much must be dealt with, in my view, for the government to tell us what is happening in relation to this matter.


There is also another issue that concerns me and, whether you support or oppose this legislation, it ought to concern all of us. It relates to the flaws in the collection of this excise. An article in The Australian FinancialReview on 30 May this year by Joanna Mather and Fleur Anderson states:


An audit report has identified serious shortcomings in the collection of taxes on imported tobacco products, which are worth about $8 billion a year.


That report, by the Auditor-General, headed Administration of tobacco excise equivalent goods, in respect of the Australian Taxation Office and the Department of Immigration and Border Protection, was transmitted to the Speaker and to you, Mr President, on 5 May this year and raised some very, very serious concerns.


The ANAO report found that there were few checks and balances in place when it comes to the administration of tobacco excise equivalent goods and that the collection of customs duty had fallen far short of effective practice. I repeat that: the Auditor-General, no less, said that the way we collect tobacco excise in this country has 'fallen far short of effective practice'. The report says that the risk of noncompliance was assessed by the ATO as ranging from moderate in 2011 to significant in 2015, when there was:


… an observed increase in the number of entities displaying non-compliant behaviour that are importing tobacco and/or storing imported tobacco.


The Auditor-General's report goes on to say:


The ATO advised that the reason for the changed risk ratings over the years is largely a consequence of shifts in focus brought by different ATO managers when scoping risk assessments.


The Auditor-General says that the fact that the risk was raised to 'significant':


… was driven by the reputational risk for the ATO and DIBP—


that is, the Department of Immigration and Border Protection—


as a result of large seizures of illicit tobacco … and a noted increase in the incidence of theft from smaller warehouses (that account for approximately two per cent of the revenue collected).


The government ought to tell us what it is doing in response to an Auditor-General's report of May of this year that was very critical about the lack of checks and balances in place when it comes to the collection of tobacco excise. These are issues that ought to be raised. I again put the government on notice, given that there are a number of other speakers on this debate. What will the government do in terms of increasing the amount available for Quit campaigns to make it easier for those people that want to quit to get the help and support they deserve so that we can make even greater inroads into reducing the awful death rate from tobacco products and the enormous cost—the $31½ billion cost—to our community as a result of the consumption of tobacco in this country?

"Hume, Sen Jane",LP,2016-09-14,"



Senator HUME
 (Victoria) (09:48):  I rise to speak on the Excise Tariff Amendment (Tobacco) Bill 2016 and the Customs Tariff Amendment (Tobacco) Bill 2016. The coalition is particularly proud of these bills, which will increase tobacco excise charged on domestic production and equivalent customs duties charged on imports by way of four annual increases of 12.5 per cent a year from 2017 to 2020. These increases will replicate the annual increases that were put in place by the former government and continued by this government from 2013 to 2016. In addition, adult average weekly ordinary time earnings based indexation of tobacco excise rates will continue. The next biannual indexation of tobacco excise will occur on 1 March 2017.


From 1 September this year, the excise and excise-equivalent duty rates on tobacco are just over 61c per stick and $763.20 per kilogram of tobacco content. This equates to $15.26 in excise on a packet of 25 cigarettes, which currently retails for approximately $25. Ignoring biannual indexation, the 12.5 per cent increases will increase excise per packet of 25 cigarettes by around $2 each year. This means that, after the final increase in 2020, the excise component of a packet of 25 cigarettes will be around $21.50. The increase in excise and duty will move Australia towards the World Health Organization's recommendation that excise should comprise around 70 per cent of the price of a cigarette. The precise impact on price is uncertain, because tobacco companies may alter their prices beyond that excise change, and that is something which is out of our control. 


A number of speakers have already mentioned that each year smoking kills an estimated 15,000 Australians and costs Australia $31.5 billion in social costs, including health costs. This bill particularly aims to reduce the prevalence of smoking in Australia and therefore to minimise the harm of cigarette smoking to the community. The Turnbull government is greatly concerned about the serious health risks of smoking and has continued the efforts of previous governments to support and build on Australia's great success in tobacco control. The excise increases announced in the 2015-16 budget are firmly based on the evidence that they will further help reduce smoking rates in Australia.


To give a brief history of tobacco control in Australia, in 1997 the government implemented a national tobacco campaign. In 2006, graphic health warnings were introduced on most tobacco packaging—and they still scare the bejesus out of most people on a daily basis. Some of those pictures are just terrifying. In 2010, there was a 25 per cent increase in tobacco excise. In 2011, tobacco plain packaging became law. There was some controversy surrounding that, but we believe that it has certainly had an impact. In 2012, all tobacco products sold in Australia were required to be in plain packaging, with updated and expanded health warnings. In 2013, we started seeing stepped tobacco excise increases, with 12½ per cent increases in 2013, 2014 and 2015. In 2016, a post-implementation review published on the Office of Best Practice Regulation website on 26 February found that tobacco plain packaging had begun to achieve its objectives. The last 12½ per cent increase in excise kicked in very recently in 2016. 


Increasing the price of tobacco products through taxes is widely recognised as an effective and cost-effective tobacco control intervention for reducing tobacco use, particularly among youth and people from lower socioeconomic groups—those disadvantaged communities where smoking is most prevalent. Increased prices may cause some financial stress; that is understood. However, we do believe that that is offset in Australia by the provision of accessible and affordable cessation treatment—something that Senator Xenophon recently spoke about—both in services and in therapies. In Australia, the 2010 post-implementation review, PIR, conducted by the Treasury, estimated that, of the 25 per cent tobacco excise increase, there was an 11 per cent decrease in tobacco consumption. That was based on import data. That was just over two years, which is a fairly significant impact. 


The guidelines that the World Health Organization issue recommend that excise account for at least 70 per cent of the retail price, and it has been very challenging for Australia to reach those World Health Organization targets. Tobacco manufacturers have taken the opportunity to increase the price of their product at the same time that excise increases, which is sort of muddying the waters. As reported in 2015 in the World Health Organization report on the global tobacco epidemic, as of mid-2014—and since then there have been already two more 12.5 per cent excise increases as well as biannual increases in excise in line with wage inflation—Australia's total taxes applied to cigarettes were the sixth highest among 106 countries who reported to the World Health Organization.


It also accounted for, at this stage, 47.67 per cent of the total retail price of the most popular brand of cigarettes, which was Winfield 20 packs. Goodness me, when did Winfields become the most popular brand? I speak as an ex-smoker. I was actually one of those smokers who gave up when they became pregnant. But I was a passionate smoker. In fact, I think I might have smoked for Australia at one stage; I was very good at it. 




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  A carton of Winfields.




Senator HUME:
  A carton—that is exactly right. It was not quite a carton of Winfields. I think I smoked something far more glamorous than that. I was one of the few people, I think, that made smoking look attractive and sexy. 




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  And you would have.




Senator HUME:
  Thank you.



An opposition senator interjecting—  




Senator HUME:
  No, I did not. It is a terrible habit. So, at that stage, those excises accounted for just over 47½ per cent of the total retail price of the most popular brand and gave Australia the seventh highest after-tax cigarette price in the world. 


Tobacco is one of the leading causes of preventable disease and premature death in Australia. The ABS data indicates that smoking rates in Australia dropped to 14.5 per cent among adults in 2014 and 2015, compared with 16.1 per cent in 2011 and 2012 and 22.3 per cent in 2001. The ABS data also demonstrated that significant gains have been made in reducing the prevalence of daily smoking in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people aged 15 and over, which is down to 39 per cent in 2014-15 from 45 per cent in 2008 and 49 per cent in 2002. So headway is certainly being made with this particular community where there is entrenched socioeconomic disadvantage.


Australia has a broad range of tobacco control measures in place already and has sustained a multifaceted approach over the past several decades, which has helped to achieve the decline in national smoking prevalence. Interventions include excise increases, very effective education programs and campaigns, plain packaging of tobacco products, large graphic health warnings, prohibiting tobacco advertising and promotion, and providing support for smokers to quit the habit.


Ongoing tobacco interventions, including excise increases, are critical to ensure that the prevalence of smoking in Australia continues to decline. It is incorrect to assume that the rate of reduction of smoking prevalence can be maintained without additional tobacco control efforts. Evidence from Australia and overseas shows that when tobacco control efforts stall so does the decline in smoking prevalence.


Increasing the price of cigarettes via taxation is one of the most effective ways of reducing tobacco consumption and preventing the uptake of smoking. Higher prices encourage smokers to quit or reduce their consumption, while also discouraging potential smokers, including young Australians, from taking up the habit.


The adult daily smoking rate was 14.5 per cent of the population in 2014-15. This measure—increasing the excise on tobacco—will assist the government to make progress on the Council of Australian Governments' target to reduce the adult daily smoking rate to 10 per cent of the population, and to halving the daily rate of smoking among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people by 2018. That is a target of the Council of Australian Governments.


Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians, people in remote areas and people on the lowest socioeconomic status all have higher rates of smoking compared to the general population. Although these groups will, undoubtedly, experience a decline in purchasing power if they keep smoking, they will also receive the income and health benefits from quitting.


This change sits alongside the numerous interventions that the Commonwealth has taken to reduce the prevalence of smoking, including a comprehensive ban on tobacco advertising and promotion, retail display bans, Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme subsidies for smoking cessation supports, and extensive and continuing public education campaigns.


These bills will raise $4.59 billion across the forward estimates period. Goods and Services Tax receipts are estimated to increase by $430 million over that same period. The revenue gained from higher tobacco excise will be used by the government to provide a range of services but, importantly, that range includes health services. It is a very important measure. It is an important part of the government's comprehensive tobacco control strategy, which includes investment in anti-smoking social marketing campaigns, subsidies for nicotine replacement therapies and the introduction of plain packaging for tobacco products.


The government announced in the budget that it will strengthen the penalties for illicit tobacco offences and will provide an additional $7.7 million for the Tobacco Strike Team to combat illicit tobacco activity. The primary responsibility for the illicit trade in tobacco rests with the DIBP and the Australian Taxation Office. The DIBP received funding in the 2016-17 budget to tackle illicit trade in tobacco. Currently, there is no reliable estimate of the size of the illicit tobacco trade in Australia. The DIBP and the ATO are working to develop a reliable estimate.


Some commentators suggest that tobacco control interventions, such as excise increases and tobacco plain packaging, increase this illicit trade. There is, in fact, no reliable evidence that this is the case. However, there is international evidence to suggest that illicit tobacco market size does tend to be driven more by supply factors, including the cost of supply to market, which is very high in Australia, and also the level of law enforcement activity, the presence of corruption, the likelihood of detection, and the scale of penalties. 


As such, tackling the illicit trade in tobacco should not involve weakening effective tobacco control measures; rather, it should be addressed by strong enforcement and compliance measures. Australia has a strong and active enforcement regime aimed at combating the illegal trade in tobacco products, and this is made stronger through the most recent budget allocations to Border Force. The trade in illicit tobacco attracts significant penalties under the Customs Act 1901 and the Excise Act 1901. Tobacco smuggling is punishable by fines and up to 10 years imprisonment.


Public health advocates say that the latest tax hike on cigarettes will cut smoking rates even further from the already steep falls that we have seen in recent years and could even lead to Australia becoming practically smoke free. The number of smokers in Australia has dwindled over recent decades. As I said, it was nearly one-quarter in the early 1990s and it is now closer to only 13 per cent. That is due to previous excise increases and public health measures like banning smoking in public areas and plain-packaging laws.


The chief executive of the Cancer Council of Australia, Professor Sanchia Aranda, said that price is an important factor in people's decision to smoke. She said:


Every time you increase the excise consumption goes down. We anticipate if there were four of these recurrent tobacco increases over time, that about 320,000 current smokers would attempt and be likely to quit as a result of all four increases, and about 40,000 teenagers would be deterred from taking up smoking. In the longer term that means tens of thousands of cancer deaths would be prevented.


Professor Aranda also that lung cancer was still the most significant preventable cancer in Australia.


But there is a view that increases in tobacco excise punishes those on low incomes. The reality is that tobacco tax increases are particularly effective in prompting people in those lower socioeconomic groups—those most disadvantaged in our society—to quit smoking. This is very important because disadvantaged groups tend to bear a disproportionately heavy tobacco death and disease burden.


There is also a claim that increasing tobacco excise would be a tax grab. But what does the community think? It is very hard to imagine any blatant tax grab being popular; however, the Newspoll research shows that 73 per cent of Australians support an increase in tobacco excise. That is not just the nonsmokers talking. Recently, Quit Victoria research showed that 60 per cent of smokers supported a tobacco tax increase—and why wouldn't they, when it can literally save their lives.


The tax grab theory has another major flaw: increasing tobacco excise is the most effective measure available to governments for reducing the social and economic costs of tobacco use. The World Bank and the World Health Organization say so, as do analyses of Australian trends in tobacco consumption done in the 1990s. So the health benefits of the tax are really what matter. The revenue should be seen as a fortuitous by-product, generating funds to reinvest in public health.


Some critics point to the tax increases potentially boosting the tobacco black market—and, yes, illegal tobacco is a very serious issue. But this can be addressed, and is being addressed, in this bill through tighter policing. Ultimately, as policy measures such as increased tobacco excise continue to denormalise smoking in our communities, the market itself will become far less lucrative.


Smoking is the leading cause of death and disability in Australia. If there were any other preventable cause of so many deaths—an infectious disease, terrorism or road trauma—the government would be expected to take action. This government is taking action. Quite frankly, the Australian people should expect nothing less of us.

"Paterson, Sen James",LP,2016-09-14,"



Senator PATERSON
 (Victoria) (10:08):  I warmly welcome the opportunity to contribute to this important debate on the Excise Tariff Amendment (Tobacco) Bill 2016 and the Customs Tariff Amendment (Tobacco) Bill 2016, which are being put forward by the Turnbull government. After decades of advertising, education and taxes, every Australian now knows that cigarettes are bad for your health. It would be hard not to realise that, given the mountain of effort being put in by governments around the world, particularly in Australia, on educating people about those risks. 


Personally, I have never been a fan of smoking, whether it is cigarettes, cigars, cigarillos, or any other smoking products. They just do not agree with me. I have never been able to bear smoking myself, but I do recognise that there are other people who do smoke and enjoy it—and I will come to that later.


My late nan was a very heavy smoker for many years, and late in her life she suffered emphysema as a result of her smoking. I have to say it was not a very pretty thing to watch—it was very sad to see her health decline as a direct result of decisions that she had made during her life.


So I am not sad, and I do not think anyone in Australia would be sad, to see the continuing decline of smoking as a habit. That is something I think we should all welcome. The adult daily smoking rate in 2014-15 was 14½ per cent. While that is still a high figure, it is certainly a dramatic improvement from the figures only a few decades ago. COAG has agreed to a bipartisan intergovernmental target of 10 per cent, and I think that is a reasonable target although I am sure all Australians would hope that in due course no Australians will be choosing to smoke.


The excise on a packet of cigarettes today is about two-thirds of the total value of a packet of cigarettes. Today a packet of 25 cigarettes retails for about $25, and about $15 of that $25 is excise which is collected by the government. This measure proposed by the government will only increase the proportion of a packet of cigarettes that is collected by the government. It is somewhat ironic that in many ways it could be argued that the government profits from the sale of cigarettes more than tobacco companies do. Given this, it is vitally important that the government should take complementary action at the same time to combat illicit tobacco. When we charge an extra dollar of excise we increase the incentive of people to buy, sell and traffic in illicit tobacco, which, by its very nature, avoids excise. 


Illicit tobacco is a serious problem around the world and it is a serious problem in Australia. A report by KPMG this year estimated that the revenue lost to government from the illicit trade is more than $1 billion a year. From a public policy standpoint that is obviously a very serious problem, but it is not the only problem from illicit tobacco. Illicit tobacco also fuels criminal behaviour, including organised crime, bikie gangs and international criminal syndicates. It hurts law-abiding small businesses, who find it very difficult to compete with people who are able to charge much lower prices for illegal products because they choose not to pay the excise they should. The quality of the illicit product, such as you can measure the quality of a tobacco product, is vastly inferior to the quality of a legal product and is even worse for human health than legal tobacco products.


Predominantly the illegal tobacco that we have in this country is now imported—it is mostly sourced from overseas and it is mostly smuggled into Australia using various means. However, there is still, as there has been for some time in this country, a domestic illegal tobacco growing industry. As reported by Rob Harris in the Herald Sun in April this year, the Australian Taxation Office conducted a raid and seized a record $15.4 million worth of illegal tobacco growing on a northern Victorian farm. A community tip-off led to the ATO raid on what they described as a large and sophisticated growing and processing operation near Kerang. This tobacco that was seized amounted to about 30 million cigarettes—and this is just from one farm in one area of northern Victoria. It demonstrates the strength of the illegal tobacco industry here in Australia and the importance of cracking down on it. 


This government takes the threat of illicit tobacco very seriously. That is why we established the Australian Border Force tobacco strike team—to crack down particularly on that imported tobacco—and that is why the ATO continues to investigate, raid and crack down on the domestic growing of illegal tobacco. In the latest budget, as a complementary measure to the legislation we are discussing today, the government announced that it would provide an extra $7.7 million for the tobacco strike team to help crack down on illicit tobacco.


I want to make two wider points about this debate and policy. Ultimately, tobacco is a legal product in Australia. Although I strongly disapprove of it and strongly encourage people to not start smoking in the first place—and if they are smoking today, I strongly encourage them to quit smoking—ultimately, I think we have to accept that there will be some people who, even understanding the very serious risks of smoking, will still choose to smoke. In a free society, people must be able to make decisions which we disapprove of, as much as we counsel them against it. While ever we decide that tobacco remains a legal product—and I am not aware of any proposals, at least before this chamber, to make it illegal—we have to accept that some people are going to smoke, and that is their choice.


There are people who still do choose to smoke. I have spoken to people who, understanding the risks, still think it is worthwhile and something that they enjoy or because they are addicted have difficulty giving it up. This ties into my second point: that there are two potential solutions to this problem. The first is the government driven approach. This is something which has been used quite effectively in Australia over the last 30 to 40 years to significantly reduce the rate of smoking. There is no doubt that there has been a great success in this area. We have used quite high levels of taxation, taxpayer funded advertising and education in the community, particularly through our schools, to educate people about the dangers of smoking and to encourage them to quit. The result of that has been a significant reduction in the rate of smoking.


What we have noticed though in recent years, particularly over the last decade, is that the rate of reduction of smoking has begun to plateau as we get down to the more hardcore smokers,—who are committed and understand the risks; who bear the cost and continue to smoke. That is why the government has, in a bipartisan way, considered some other, more exotic measures, to address this, such as plain packaging of tobacco products, as a way of getting through that barrier and further reducing smoking. That is why this government has decided to further increase excise. Excise has certainly been an effective approach and I will be supporting this bill for that reason.


However, I think it is important that, while we support these measures, we acknowledge that there are some drawbacks for these measures. I am concerned, as I know many Australians are generally, about property rights in this country and the need and importance of protecting those property rights. I think that property rights are not just confined to physical land and property and that the seizure of that by government should be protected by our Constitution and our courts; also that intellectual property is property and that it should also be protected. We should be aware that the plain packaging legislation and the High Court decision that followed effectively removed the ability for companies to use a property right which they created. We should be mindful of the limitations of that. We may still decide that it is a worthwhile thing, but we should be aware of the costs of that.


Another thing which I think we have to be particularly aware of in the taxation space is that excise taxes on products like tobacco—but not only tobacco; including alcohol as well—disproportionately affect lower income people. These are taxes which are not levied according to their ability to pay; not levied according to income, wealth or any other measure. They are levied according to a lifestyle choice which people make: to smoke or, in other cases, to drink. The evidence shows that lower income earners disproportionately still choose to smoke. When we increase these taxes, we are, in effect, increasing what is a regressive tax. I know, when we debate other taxation measures in this place, some people who favour an increase in the GST—I am not one of them, but some people do—have come up against resistance that it would be regressive and would impact the poor less. The GST, at least, applies relatively equally to everyone; tobacco excises apply disproportionately to the poor. That is something that I think we need to be very conscious of.


The second thing is that we are running into the limitations of the approach we have taken over the last 30 to 40 years. We have reduced it dramatically, but the rate of reduction has started to slow. I think that means we should start to look at wider measures and other measures to address this. One which I think we should consider is a more free market approach—that is using choices that people are already making in their lives, enabling them to make those choices that are healthier choices than smoking conventional cigarettes. In this area, we have a range of new products that technology has brought to us, including e-cigarettes and other forms of smoking, sometimes called reduced-risk products, which use technology to reduce the impact of tobacco smoke and particularly the burning of tobacco, which is very toxic to inhale. This is a free market approach because it does not rely on mandates or taxes; it relies on choices.


In Australia right now, it is not lawful to sell e-cigarette products, but there are many people who have chosen to take up these products because they prefer them to cigarettes or as a measure of reducing their reliance on cigarettes, or just as something which is more convenient than cigarettes. That is even with them not being lawful. I think we have to look very seriously at whether or not we should legalise these products, and there is an application, I understand, before the Therapeutic Goods Administration right now to legalise an e-cigarette style product as a tobacco cessation measure—as a measure to get people off tobacco. I think that would be a very good thing.


So I just want to summarise some of the research and views on this issue. It is fair to say that the public health lobby in Australia are not supportive of e-cigarettes. They are very sceptical about them. People such as Emeritus Professor Simon Chapman, a noted sociologist and advocate of tobacco control, have been very much opposed to allowing e-cigarettes to be legalised, as have bodies such as Quit Victoria, who last year called for e-cigarettes to be clarified to be illegal—for their retail sale to be banned in Victoria—and, interesting, for smoke-free laws to be extended to cover all e-cigarette use. That is an interesting one given that what is emitted from an e-cigarette is water vapour. We should be concerned about second-hand smoke. That is an issue. You can get cancer from second-hand smoke; that is what the science suggests. You cannot get cancer from e-cigarette water vapour, though. There is no evidence of that, so it does seem strange to me that we would apply laws designed to limit second-hand smoke cancer from conventional burning of tobacco to a water vapour which carries no tobacco at all. In fact, it only delivers nicotine to the user; it does not even deliver it into the atmosphere around them.


Thirdly, there are calls to ban advertising and promotion of e-cigarettes. Again, I understand what is perhaps the rationale behind this, but one of the limitations of banning advertising is that advertising is information. It allows people to learn about new products, and it would allow, for example, retailers of e-cigarettes to notify current smokers that they may be able to reduce the risk and harm to their health by switching from cigarettes to e-cigarettes. That is Quit Victoria's position.


The Heart Foundation in the ACT are also opposed. They have lobbied to make sure that e-cigarettes are more strictly banned than they are and to prevent them. I think that is broadly representative. The Cancer Council of Australia has issued concerns. Professor Ian Olver, writing for the Cancer Council's website, said that there is not sufficient evidence that electronic cigarettes would help smokers to quit, and there are also concerns that electronic cigarettes could keep smokers addicted to tobacco by providing a nicotine hit in smoke-free places. There are also concerns that e-cigarettes may, in the words of some, 'normalise' the use of cigarettes. I am not sure that there is sufficient evidence to back that up, but that is the view of some in the public health industry.


But I have to say one of the puzzling reasons for opposing the sale of e-cigarettes put forward by Professor Ian Olver is that it might allow tobacco companies to continue to be profitable and to continue to exist. I think that is a very strange reason when our focus should be on public health. I think, actually, it would be a good thing if cigarette companies got rid of their old products and moved towards newer products which are healthier and safer. They may still have some risk but, I think, certainly pose less of a risk than cigarettes. I think that would be a very welcome development, but some people are opposed to allowing these products to be legal because it would continue cigarette companies' profitability and allow them to continue to exist.


The Australian government, I think it is fair to say, has taken a generally sceptical approach to e-cigarettes. The TGA issued, in March last year, some preliminary commentary on e-cigarettes. They described them in the technical detail of how they work, and they said that at the moment there is not a great deal of evidence to support their use—certainly as a nicotine replacement therapy. But since the government issued that view I think there has been a development of the evidence base in this area, and I am encouraged by the developments. As the National Health and Medical Research Council in Australia has said, there is a widely held belief that e-cigarettes are likely to be less harmful than tobacco cigarettes because they expose users to fewer toxic chemicals. They say that there is some preliminary evidence which supports that view, so I think it would be fair to describe the NHMRC as cautiously open to the potential benefits of e-cigarettes, although, as I said, the Australian government's position is generally sceptical about the construction of e-cigarettes.


I want to refer to an excellent article written by my former colleague at the great organisation the Institute of Public Affairs Simon Breheny. It was in The Daily Telegraph in March last year. He reviewed some of the evidence available on this at that time. He cited one article published in August 2014 in the peer-reviewed Journal of Public Health. What the journal concluded was that the use of e-cigarettes can reduce the number of cigarettes smoked and the withdrawal symptoms. In an article for BMC Medicine last year, Peter Hajek of the Wolfson Institute of Preventive Medicine said:


Although there is no doubt that smokers switching to electronic cigarettes (EC) substantially reduce the risk to their health, some tobacco control activists and health organisations discourage smokers from using EC and lobby policy makers to reduce EC use by draconian regulation.


One thing which I think is becoming increasingly clear is that Australia is getting out of step with the rest of the world on this, and particularly the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom have been quite forward-looking on this issue and have been—and their public health community in particular—much more willing to contemplate this. Public Health England, which is a government body, has said:


In a nutshell, best estimates show e-cigarettes are 95% less harmful to your health than normal cigarettes, and when supported by a smoking cessation service, help most smokers to quit tobacco altogether.


The UK Royal College of Physicians have made a statement on this. They say:


The RCP recognises that electronic cigarettes and other novel nicotine devices can provide an effective, affordable and readily available retail alternative to conventional cigarettes. These innovations could make harm reduction a reality for smokers, as proposed in our 2007 report.


There are other reports on this, a lot of academic reports, that are now suggesting that, in the UK in particular, people have begun to take up e-cigarettes as an alternative to smoking and that they have reduced their reliance on conventional cigarettes, and I think that is a really good thing. Pleasingly, there is also now evidence in Australia that this may be the case. Even though in Australia it is not currently legal to smoke e-cigarettes, to sell or to buy them, some people have imported them from overseas in a personal capacity and smoked them here. As part of a joint research paper by the Australian Catholic University and the University of Melbourne in 2015, they did a survey of 1,242 smokers. Eighteen per cent of those smokers reported that they had already given up smoking by using e-cigarettes, and the report found that e-cigarettes were also helping those who continued to smoke to cut back on the number of cigarettes they smoked. As Dr Aziz Rahman, the lead researcher, said:


E-cigarettes are becoming an increasingly popular method of giving up smoking, especially for middle-aged smokers. As cigarettes contain more than 4,000 toxic chemicals and cancer causing agents, e-cigarettes are a better choice, in terms of a harm reduction strategy.


…   …   …


If the safety of e-cigarettes is proven in the long run, they may assist healthcare providers to address smoking cessation challenges more effectively.


I think this is a very encouraging area of development. I think we could in our lifetime see the end of conventional cigarette and tobacco smoking, and it could be replaced by a much safer alternative of e-cigarettes. I think that is a really welcome development and I hope that the government in Australia will be welcoming of that development and will help facilitate the development rather than block the development, as some in the public health community have lobbied for them to do.

"Reynolds, Sen Linda",LP,2016-09-14,"



Senator REYNOLDS
 (Western Australia) (10:28):  I too rise to speak in support of the Excise Tariff Amendment (Tobacco) Bill 2016 and the Customs Tariff Amendment (Tobacco) Bill 2016. These bills will increase tobacco excise charged on domestic production and customs duties charged on imports with four annual increases of 12.5 per cent a year from 2017 until 2020. There will be no direct impact on tobacco companies from the staged excise and customs duty increases—these will occur on the same day as the usual indexation changes.


In addition, adult average weekly ordinary time earnings based indexation of tobacco excise rates will continue. The next biannual indexation of tobacco excise will occur on 1 March 2017. From 1 September this year, the excise and excise equivalent duty rate on tobacco is around 61c per stick and $763.20 per kilogram of tobacco content. This equates to $15.26 in excise on a packet of 25 cigarettes, which currently retail for approximately $25. 


Together, these bills will raise $4.59 billion across the forward estimates period. Goods and services tax receipts are estimated to increase by $430 million over the same period. The excise increase announced in the 2015-16 budget are firmly based on the evidence that this will further help reduce smoking and will replicate the annual increases that were put in place from 2013 through to 2016. 


As my colleague Senator Paterson has noted, tobacco is a 'legal product' in Australia and people choose to smoke, noting that there are health consequences for both themselves and others around them. Smoking today is recognised as the largest single preventable cause of death and disease in Australia. It is associated with an increased risk of heart disease, stroke, cancer, emphysema, bronchitis, asthma, renal disease and eye disease. Tobacco contains the powerfully addictive stimulant nicotine, which can make smoking a regular and long-term habit that is pretty hard to quit. Each year in Australia, smoking kills an estimated 15,000 Australians and costs Australia $31.5 billion in social, health and economic costs. In Western Australia alone, own home state, over 1,500 people a year die from smoking-related illnesses. 


The Turnbull government is greatly concerned about the serious health risks of smoking and it has continued the efforts of previous governments to support and build on Australia's great success in tobacco control. In recent years, the negative effects of passive smoking have also received considerable attention; demonstrating that the risks of smoking affects more than just the individual smoker. Passive smoking increases the risk of heart disease, asthma and some types of cancers. It may also increase the risk of sudden infant death syndrome and may predispose children to allergic sensitisation. 


The increase in excise and duty will move Australia toward the World Health Organization's recommendation that excise should comprise 70 per cent of the price of a cigarette. Increasing the price of tobacco products through taxes is widely recognised as the most effective and the most cost-effective tobacco control intervention for reducing tobacco use, particularly amongst our young and those from lower socioeconomic communities. In Australia, the 2010 post-implementation review, conducted by The Treasury, for the 25 per cent tobacco excise increase estimated that an 11 per cent decrease in tobacco consumption over two years had resulted. The 25 per cent tobacco excise increase had resulted in an 11 per cent decrease in smoking in Australia.


As reported in the WHO report on theGlobal tobacco epidemic, 2015, as of mid-2014 there have been two 12.5 per cent excise increases as well as biannual increases in excise and Australia was ranked sixth highest for total taxes applied to cigarettes amongst 106 countries who reported to the World Health Organization. The taxes also accounted for 47.67 per cent of the total retail price of the most popular brands of cigarettes, which in Australia is a Winfield 20-pack. Also, Australia's taxes applied to cigarettes gave Australia the seventh highest after-tax cigarette price in the world. I think it is clear that it has been proved that higher prices encourage smokers to quit or, at least, reduce their consumption, while also discouraging potential smokers including in particular young Australians from taking up smoking. 


These two bills will support Australia's domestic and international commitments to reduce the prevalence of smoking in Australia and thus minimise the harm of smoking to the entire Australian community. These particular changes sit alongside numerous other interventions the Commonwealth has taken to reduce the prevalence of smoking. Firstly, the Commonwealth has adopted a comprehensive ban on tobacco advertising and promotion. They have also legislated for retail display bans, Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme subsidies for smoking cessation supports and have funded extensive and continuing public education campaigns here in Australia.


In any health-related campaign, it is always to helpful to review and understand the statistics, the context and the trends that they highlight. In Australia, the facts are as follows: in 2011-2012, the Australian Health Survey reported that approximately eight million Australian adults aged 18 years and over had smoked at least some time in their life. In 2011-2012, 3.1 million people were still current smokers, with the vast majority—90 per cent of that 3.1 million people—smoking daily. Between 2001 and 2011-12, the overall rates of smoking had decreased for both males and females. The age-standardised rate of current smokers for males aged 18 and over fell from 27 per cent in 2001 to 20 per cent in 2011-12. For women, it declined 21 per cent to 16 per cent. Those figures, over the course of a decade, are very significant decreases. During 2007-2008, 3.5 per cent of people who were not current smokers aged 15 years and over and 7.2 per cent of children aged under 15 years lived in a household where a daily smoker was reported to have smoked indoors. This exposes environmental tobacco smoke and passive smoking to a significant percentage of young Australians.


The Australian government's tobacco control strategies, such as mass media public education campaigns, high tobacco taxes, advertising bans and smoke-free environment legislation have helped with the steady decline in smoking rates over decades. I think the statistics on that are very clear. Between 1991 and 2010, the proportion of daily smokers aged 14 years and over decreased by almost 40 per cent. I will say that again, because that is a really significant statistic: between 1991 and 2010, the proportion of daily smokers aged 14 and over decreased by almost 40 per cent. In 2011 and 2012, five per cent of males and nine per cent of females aged 15 to 17 were current smokers. After 18 years, the legal age for purchasing tobacco products in Australia, the rate rose significantly for both men and women, reaching 22 per cent for men and 17 per cent for women aged 18 to 24 in 2011 and 2012.


Rates then remained steady for men up to around the age of 55 and for women up to 65; whereupon after those ages for both men and women the rates significantly declined. So eight per cent of men and seven per cent of women aged 65 years and over were smokers in that same period, 2011-12. There was little change in smoking rates for men and women aged 45 to 54 years and women aged over 55 years during this period. However, interestingly, for men, there were significant declines over this period in the 55- to 64- and 65 years and over- age groups respectively. Between 2007 and 2011, the rate of smoking among men, or boys, aged 15 to 17 decreased from nine per cent to five per cent, while the rate for females did the complete opposite; they increased from five per cent to nine per cent for young girls between 15 and 17.


For Indigenous Australians the smoking rate has consistently been higher than for the rest of the Australian population. In 2008, 49 per cent of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australian men aged 18 years and over were current smokers. So 49 per cent of men over 18 in Indigenous population were smokers. This was, for the time, significantly higher than the number of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women of the same age who were current smokers, which was 44 per cent—but still much higher than the national average. Between 2002 and 2008, the rate really had not changed at all. For both men and women, the proportion of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders who were current smokers between 2002 and 2008 was lowest in the 15- to 17-year age group. That is again very interesting. It was actually lowest in the 15- to 17-year age group, but it was still much higher than the national average. In the 15- to 17-year age group it had decreased from 33 per cent to 21 per cent—a very significant decrease.


While, as I said, tobacco is legal in Australia, it is important that the government continues to aid the reduction in smoking rates and it is equally important to ensure that we support and explore alternatives for smokers, and I believe today that includes looking much more closely at e-cigarettes. In April last year, on behalf of the Intergovernmental Committee on Drugs, the Australian government Department of Health engaged the University of Sydney, in partnership with the Cancer Council of New South Wales, to conduct a longitudinal project to explore options to minimise the risks associated with the marketing and use of electronic nicotine delivery systems, with or without nicotine, here in Australia. This project is due to culminate in the preparation of a national discussion paper this month. Public dissemination of this discussion paper will be a matter for federal, state and territory governments. I very much look forward to the release of that document and engaging in the debate and discussion on safer alternatives to smoking. I commend the government for taking steps to explore the use and safety of e-cigarettes. The Australian government Department of Health review will inform the development of regulatory and non-regulatory policy options for consideration by Commonwealth, state and territory governments in this nation.


To me, there is absolutely no doubt that the use of e-cigarettes is a healthier option for people looking to stop smoking, with nearly three million people in the UK alone now using e-cigarettes today. I think it is very instructive for us here, as we have a look at alternatives to cigarettes, to look at the experiences of other countries with alternatives such as e-cigarettes. A recent note by the UK parliament observed that there is evidence showing that the use of e-cigarettes can assist people to quit tobacco smoking. The first generation of e-cigarettes, which were called cig-a-likes, resembled tobacco cigarettes. They became widely available in the UK in the mid-2000s and were usually disposable. The second-generation products typically resemble fountain pens, and are rechargeable, with a replaceable cartridge or refillable tank. The most recent third-generation products are typically much more diverse in look and feel. These are also rechargeable and have a refillable tank. Users can modify power and resistance to adjust nicotine delivery and vapour density. Users can also download software to monitor their own personal usage patterns and can tailor the devices aesthetically for their own personal style and comfort. Later e-cigarette products offer more efficient nicotine delivery than first-generation products. Some are comparable to tobacco cigarettes in terms of the blood nicotine concentration that they deliver. However, nicotine delivery remains much, much slower than traditional tobacco cigarettes.


Public health concerns here and overseas around e-cigarettes have focused on vapers and the inhalation of vapour and bystanders' passive exposure to the vapours from e-cigarettes. The inhaled and exhaled vapour varies depending on device characteristics and user behaviour. But, again, as Senator Paterson has noted, the health impact is much less for people in the vicinity of those using e-cigarettes than for people in the vicinity of those using traditional cigarettes. There have also been concerns about possible adverse health effects for the user from inhaling vapour that can contain propylene glycol, glycerine, nicotine, flavourings, metallic elements and carcinogenic substances. Since 2014, there has been a great deal of research into vapour content. The amount of chemicals inhaled, rather than their presence alone, is an important determinant of toxicity, and current data suggests that the levels of toxins and contaminants in inhaled vapour do not pose significant health risks. The consensus is that long-term health risks to vapers require monitoring but are 'unlikely to exceed five per cent of the harm from smoking tobacco'. Passive smoking health risks to bystanders are much smaller again with the use of e-cigarettes, as current evidence shows that the levels of nicotine and contaminants released via exhaled vapour are negligible.


So I commend the Turnbull government for continuing to support the reduction measures for smoking. But it is also important that we continue to provide smokers with the support and motivation they need to kick the habit when they are ready to do so. I am pleased that the revenue gained from higher tobacco excise will be put to good use by the government to continue to fund and provide a range of services, including health and other support measures.


These measures support the national approach through the Council of Australian Governments to reduce the prevalence of smoking in Australia. The adult daily smoking rate was 14.5 per cent of the population in 2014-2015. I have gone through some of the statistics, and that is a very significant decrease over the last decade. In 2008, all states and territories, through COAG, committed to reducing the adult daily smoking rate to 10 per cent of our national population and to halving the daily rate of smoking amongst Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders by 2018.


Ongoing tobacco interventions, including these excise increases, are critical to ensuring that the prevalence of smoking in Australia continues to decline. It is incorrect to assume that the rate of reduction of smoking prevalence can be maintained without additional tobacco control efforts. Evidence from Australia and overseas shows that, when tobacco control efforts stall, so does the decline in smoking prevalence and there is an increase in health consequences.


So, for all of those reasons, I commend these bills to the Senate today.

 (Western Australia—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (10:47):  I also rise to speak this morning about the Excise Tariff Amendment (Tobacco) Bill 2016 and the Customs Tariff Amendment (Tobacco) Bill 2016, but I want to take a slightly different perspective—a slightly different angle.



Senator Jacinta Collins interjecting—




Senator SMITH:
  Just yesterday, Senator Collins would have seen on the Notice Paper that in the Senate was tabled the most recent report of the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, Australia's health 2016. It was quite a revealing report on a number of levels—not least because it did point to the facts that Australians are getting healthier and living longer but that there still exist, for some Australians in our community, significant risks to their enjoyment of that health, and it pointed to what that path to longer living might look like for them.


There were a number of interesting things in that report that I would just like to share with the Senate this morning before turning briefly to the contents of these bills, because senators would know that other government senators have illuminated the motivation—illuminated the positive benefits for smokers from reducing their smoking and the positive benefits for the economy from this particular legislative initiative. But there are a number of things in the Australia's health 2016report that are worth sharing with the Senate this morning. One is—and I will come to it in a brief moment—what is happening around death rates in our country. There is also what is happening as to the increasing numbers of risk factors for healthy Australians; and there is important information about the incidence of smoking amongst Australians generally but also across core communities.


Importantly, in the report at chapter 4 people will see a specific discussion about tobacco smoking trends in our country—information that fewer Australians are smoking, and information about the positive changes that are happening to smoking patterns across the Australian community—and then, immediately following that, some revealing or even alarming information about the health behaviours and biomedical risks for Indigenous Australians which focuses very heavily on the issue of the incidence of smoking across Indigenous communities. That is especially alarming for a regional senator like myself from Western Australia who spends a considerable amount of time in the Kimberley region of Western Australia, which has a very high proportion of Indigenous Australians who live in very remote communities, as the incidence of smoking is a significant impairment to the benefits that they can enjoy from a healthy lifestyle and the benefits that they should be able to enjoy through greater longevity.


The institute's report, not surprisingly, starts by sharing with us this very important fact: that good health, of course, is important. It is important to each of us. It influences not just how we feel but how we go about our everyday lives and how we might be able to utilise those rich opportunities that come to us as Australians. The report says that the vast majority of Australians aged 15 and over report that their health is 'good' or better, and that this can mean different things to different people. Of course, the starting position of your health is a key determinant in whether or not you can expect to enjoy much greater improvements in your health or marginal improvements. The report goes on to say:


It is now widely accepted that health is much more than the presence or absence of disease.


Importantly, 'good' or better health:


… reflects genetic, lifestyle and environmental factors; cultural influences; socioeconomic conditions; and the availability and quality of health care programs and services.


I think that what makes the tabling yesterday in the Senate of the Australia's health 2016 report important is the fact that it provides a very timely examination of the health of Australians from a variety of perspectives, including the leading types of ill health that affect us as a nation, the specific risks and health inequalities that are faced by different types of communities across our vast and varied nation, and of course what level of services are currently being provided and what level of services it is necessary to provide to prevent illness.


What is revealing in this report, perhaps even refreshing—it is quite illuminating, because the report is quite honest and transparent—comes at the end of each chapter, where the report points to future work that needs to be done if this picture of Australia's health is to be accurate and if Australia's health is to continue to be well serviced and provided for. The report also provides a refreshing account of some of the topical issues that face Australians when discussing the healthiness of their current and future lives—importantly, a discussion around chronic disease, the very important issue of mental health, the use and abuse of illicit drugs in our community, health spending across various health services, end-of-life care and trends in hospital care. So it is quite an important and revealing report.


But I want to turn in the first instance to what the report has to say about the experiences of Australians when it comes to death. In 2013 nearly 147,700 deaths were registered in Australia—about 600 more than in 2012 and nearly 15,400 more than in 2003. Since 2003 the number has risen by an average of one per cent per year for males and 1.2 per cent for females. Despite an increase in the absolute number of deaths, there has been a long and continuing fall in death rates per 100,000 population. From 1907 to 2013 the age-standardised death rate for males and females fell by a staggering 71 per cent and 76 per cent, respectively.


This is an important point, because when we talk about the tremendous amount of public money and the tremendous amount of energy that goes into our health programs, our health services and our hospitals, we are fundamentally seeking to do two things: to give the living a better quality of life and to ensure that people live longer, and that much of our energy, much of our innovation and much of our public spending go into the very important task of keeping people alive. When we look at those results from 1907 to 2013 that reveal that the age-standardised death rate for males and females fell by 71 per cent and 76 per cent, respectively, we get a very powerful and positive sign of the success of everything this country does—and not just what the public health system does, with public health programs, but also what the voluntary system does and what the private sector does to ensure that Australians live longer and enjoy all the benefits bestowed on them.


Before coming to the specific issue of tobacco smoking, let me reflect briefly on what the report had to say about other death rates in our country. In 2013 children aged five to nine years and 10 to 14 years had the lowest rates of death, at nine and 10 per cent, respectively, per 100,000 population. The rate gradually increased from the ages of 15 to 19 years, to 32 per 100,000 population. By the age of 60 to 64 the rate was 613 per 100,000 population. The highest death rate was for people aged 85 and over—not surprising. Death rates have remained higher for males than for females in all age groups.


So I thought this was a very important starting point for discussion not just about increasing taxes on tobacco but also about what we are doing to discourage people from smoking. We know about the side effects of smoking, the cumulative effects and its cost, not just to our healthcare system but also in terms of the distress it causes to families as a result of the illnesses arising from tobacco use.


Moving through the report, its second most revealing aspect—and I mean revealing in a constructive sense—is what it has to say about risk factors and about what we as a community are doing to reduce those risk factors. The report says that many chronic diseases share common lifestyle risk factors that are largely preventable—for example, tobacco smoking, excessive alcohol consumption and excessive body weight. According to the results of the Australian Burden of Disease Study in 2011, a large proportion of the burden of disease experienced by the population—31 per cent, or almost a third of the community—could be prevented by reducing exposure to modifiable risk factors. The five risk factors that caused the most burden were tobacco use, high body mass, high alcohol use, physical inactivity and high blood pressure.


Importantly, the report goes on to talk specifically about smoking rates in Australia and whether or not we have had a positive or a negative experience regarding smoking rates. I am pleased to share with the Senate that on page 16 of the report it says that smoking rates in our country are continuing to fall. It says that smoking rates in Australia are still falling, continuing a long-term downward trend over the past 50 years that the OECD has described as 'remarkable progress'. The OECD has described the downward fall in smoking rates in our country as a remarkable success.


In 2013, 13 per cent of people aged 14 or older smoked daily, compared with 15 per cent in 2010 and 24 per cent in 1991. That is worth reflecting on: in 1991, 24 per cent of people aged 14 or over smoked daily, and in 2013 just 13 per cent of people smoked daily. This was one of the lowest smoking rates in the world. The OECD average daily smoking rate for people aged 15 and older was 20 per cent. 


We can be confident that those legislative and other measures that governments—this government, previous governments—have been putting in place to reduce the incidence of smoking in our community have been successful. I think it is important to note that that success has come by not infringing on people's absolute liberty to smoke. If people want to smoke, that is their business. I am not a smoker; people in my family have previously been smokers. I think it is a powerful endorsement of the sorts of things that the community, supported by government, are doing that are leading to very tangible benefits in reducing the incidence of smoking in our community.


I could go on to talk about the positive benefits that are being achieved as a result of reductions in drinking levels et cetera, but that is not the purpose of my contribution today. I want to turn specifically to the issue of tobacco smoking and what the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare report had to say in regard to that. It has some positive news for those of us who care about the public health impost that happens as a result of an increase in smoking rates. Refreshingly, the report talks about the fact that fewer Australians are now smoking. It says: 


Fewer people, both proportionally and absolutely, are smoking daily and more people have never smoked, compared with 20 years ago. 


The report says:


In 2013, the proportion of people aged 14 and over smoking daily (13%) was lower than in 2010 (15%) …


As I have shared with you previously, in 1991 it was a staggering 21 per cent. Importantly, when we think about the impact of smoking on young people in our community, the report was positive. It says:


In 2014, the proportions of secondary school students aged 12-17 smoking in their lifetime, in the past 4 weeks, past week or on 3 days of the last 7, were significantly lower than in 2008 and 2011 …. 


That is a very positive outcome. It goes on to say:


Fewer people are being exposed to tobacco smoking, more people are delaying the uptake of smoking and smokers are smoking fewer cigarettes.


Dependent children were far less likely to be exposed to tobacco smoke inside the home in 2013 (3.7%) than in 1995 (31%).


Children being exposed to tobacco smoke in their home in 1995 was 31 per cent. Now, it is staggeringly low at 3.7 per cent. It goes on to say:


The average age at which young people aged 14-24 smoked their first cigarette has steadily risen since 2001 (15.9 years in 2013 compared with 14.3 in 2001), indicating a delay in uptake of smoking.


That has to be a positive outcome. Smokers smoked fewer cigarettes per week in 2013 than in 2001. In 2013, smokers smoked up to 96 cigarettes per week; in 2001, it was 113. The report goes on to say:


The proportion of women smoking at any time during pregnancy has steadily declined over time—


I am sure we are all pleased to hear that—


from 15% in 2009 to 12% in 2013.


So there is still some work to be done in regard to the incidence of smoking by pregnant women in our community. 


I think it is also interesting to be reminded that, for different parts of our population, the incidence of smoking is very variant. It is valuable to look at these statistics before I move to the detail of the bill. The likelihood of being a daily smoker is two times as high in remote or very remote areas; three times as high in the lowest socio-economic areas compared with the highest socio-economic areas; 1.7 times as high for unemployed people compared with people who are employed; 1.9 times as high for homosexual or bisexual people compared with heterosexual people—I did not know that; it is rather revealing; 2.7 times as high for single people with dependent children compared with couples with dependent children; and, finally, 5.7 times as high for prison entrants compared with the general population. People may not be surprised to hear that the likelihood of a being a daily smoker is 2.6 times as high for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians compared with non-Indigenous Australians.


As we have heard from previous coalition senators, the merits of the government's proposed reforms to the Excise Tariff Amendment (Tobacco) Bill 2016 and the Customs Tariff Amendment (Tobacco) Bill 2016 stand undisputed. They are positive and necessary reforms, from both a budget repair perspective and a public health perspective. I think the contributions of Senator Reynolds, Senator Paterson and Senator Hume were particularly revealing about the merits of the government's legislative initiative. 


Senator Fawcett is now in the chamber and about to make a contribution, so I might draw my contribution to an end now.

Senator FAWCETT
 (South Australia—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (11:05):  I too rise to make some contributions to this debate on the Excise Tariff Amendment (Tobacco) Bill 2016 and the Customs Tariff Amendment (Tobacco) Bill 2016. I wish to talk briefly about what the bills will do and, possibly more importantly, why the government is taking these steps. I would identify and congratulate the opposition: some of their policy positions have been very similar to this. Clearly, there is a bipartisan interest in supporting the health of Australians. I would like also to talk a little bit about what potential unintended consequences there could be and what measures the government is taking to make sure that they do not come into effect. They are things like the potential for increasing demand for and, therefore, trade in illicit tobacco and whether there are socio-economic impacts that are unfair or vary across our community.


I will start with what the Excise Tariff Amendment (Tobacco) Bill 2016 and the Customs Tariff Amendment (Tobacco) Bill 2016 will actually do. These bills, as previous speakers have highlighted, will increase the tobacco excise which is charged on domestic production and the equivalent customs duties charged on imports by way of four annual increases of 12.5 per cent a year from 2017 until 2020. It is not the first time this has happened; this legislation replicates the annual increases that were put in place from 2013 to 2016. In addition, the increases which were indexed to changes in the adult weekly average ordinary time earnings will continue, and the next increase under that scheme occurs in March of 2017. What that means is that from September this year, the excise and excise equivalent duty rates on tobacco are around $763 per kilogram of tobacco content. This equates to around $15 in excise on a pack of 25 cigarettes, which currently retails for approximately $25. Ignoring the biannual indexation, the 12 per cent increases will increase excise per pack of cigarettes by around $2 each year. 


So that is broadly what the bill is seeking to do. Why? There are a number of reasons. Partly that Australia is linked in with what people like the World Health Organization are doing. As they look at the damage that tobacco causes to individuals and communities around the nation, they have set a target recommending that excise should account for nearly 70 per cent of the retail price of a packet of cigarettes. Achieving that has been somewhat problematic for Australia because, in the past, when excise has increased the facts indicate that companies tend to also increase their prices at the same time—I am assuming in an attempt to shift the blame for that price increase onto the government's increase in excise as opposed to onto the fact that they are putting in an additional profit margin on top of that. So, because the price keeps going up in absolute terms, with retailers putting in extra margin, it is harder for us to reach that excise level of 70 per cent. But the target is there because of the damage that is done to health as a result of tobacco use. 


The use of tobacco is one of the leading causes of preventable death and disease here in Australia. When I think back to when I first enlisted in the Army in the early 1980s, we were in an environment where it was accepted that the use of alcohol and tobacco was a commonplace part of work. That was common in the military college. But even when I first qualified as a military pilot, aircraft were still provided with ashtrays. In fact, I do recall flying once in an aircraft with another crew member who was a heavy smoker. We have two sets of rules in flying. One is visual flight rules, where you can see. One is called instrument flight rules, which is when you use your instruments because you are in cloud and when you look out the windscreen and all you can see is grey and cloud. On that particular flight I basically had to revert to instrument flight rules techniques even though it was a blue sky day, because the smoke was so thick in the cockpit that it was actually difficult to see outside and see the horizon. I recall that because of its impact on my flying, but as I look back now I wonder what the impact was on my health, as studies have shown the impact of passive smoking. So in my own professional career I have seen the dramatic change that tobacco control measures have made in terms of curtailing the acceptance of the use of tobacco in the workplace because of the damaging effect that it has. 


Now ABS data indicates that daily smoking rates in 2014-15 have dropped to 14½ per cent amongst adults, compared to 16 per cent in 2011-12 and 22 per cent back in 2001. As I say, anecdotally, from my own experience, the numbers are far higher than that as you go back further in our history. I am very pleased to report now that not only is smoking banned in the back end of the Qantas planes and Virgin aircraft that we fly in regularly, but the crew also, even in military aircraft, no longer have the opportunity to smoke in that very confined workspace. 


So these tobacco control measures that Australia has brought in over several decades now have a multifaceted approach, but they have been broadly effective in seeing that decline in the prevalence of national smoking rates. Those interventions have included things like the increases in excise, the education programs and the campaigns, and most recently—again, credit to the opposition—plain packaging, which has enabled the prevalence of the fairly graphic health warnings, as opposed to the slick marketing, to be the thing that people see when they look at cigarettes. Those measures and the prohibition on tobacco advertising and promotion, particularly around sports and things, all work together to see smoking reduce. This is because reducing that preventable disease and preventable early death is important. So that is why we have brought in this legislation, and we have talked about the controls.


The other thing that I think is important to consider with each piece of legislation is the unintended consequences that could occur. One of the objections that has been raised around this whole topic of indexation is the impact on people in lower socioeconomic groupings. There is data to indicate that many of them smoke. Therefore, the argument goes that the burden of these measures will fall more harshly on people in lower socioeconomic groupings. 


I accept the fact that not everyone who smokes is necessarily going to be damaged by it. I have great memories as a young lad of being out in Kapunda, where my family were farmers, and sitting outside the kitchen window in the morning. The sun would come up, my grandfather would smoke his pipe and the magpies would be in the trees. They are really nice memories. He never suffered from cancer or any ill effects, but I have to say that, statistically, he is in the minority, as the vast majority of people do. And it has an impact not just on the individual—it has an impact on their family and on our society in terms of the cost burden of providing healthcare services to people who are struggling with cancer and the other problems that occur from smoking.


If we accept the fact that, as a society, these intervention measures are valid, warranted and desirable, then the impact on people in a lower socioeconomic grouping, in net terms, is positive. If something provides incentive for all of society to either not take up smoking or, indeed, to quit, then it will actually support people to make that decision earlier if their income is more limited. I do not say that from a position of being here in the parliament; I am referring here to studies, to journal articles from, for example, the Medical Journal of Australia. Dr Nathan Grills of the Nossal Institute for Global Health, based out of the University of Melbourne, has looked at excise and this aspect of the multifaceted intervention approach from a medical perspective. He specifically addresses the issue of people in lower income brackets, and the argument he puts forward is that tobacco excise is actually a pro-poor policy. Those are his words—that is the title of his article in the Medical Journal of Australia.


His reasoning goes that, because more poor people smoke, the 'tax increase targets the poor, as they end up paying more tax'. He is saying that is a short-sighted analysis because it does not demonstrate a good understanding of tobacco control intervention based on strong evidence. He argues that, in reality, the policy actually benefits the poor far more than the rich because it is a progressive tax in terms of public health and long-term economic benefit. He says:


This tax will reduce the long-term financial losses and payments more in lower than in higher socio-economic groups, by reducing medical expenses and protecting livelihoods especially in poorer groups. Ultimately it saves more lives in lower SES groups than in higher SES groups.


Professor Ian Olver, the CEO of the Cancer Council, also addresses this point. He makes the argument that, whilst there is a view that increased tobacco excise punishes those on lower incomes, tobacco taxes are particularly effective in prompting people in lower socioeconomic groups to quit smoking. He says that this is very important, because disadvantaged groups bear a disproportionately heavy tobacco death and disease burden.


The argument that both of these groups put forward is that if we, as a society, accept that intervention is warranted because of the effect on health of the individual and the family, and the cost to community, then if we have a system whereby people on higher incomes can choose to pay if they want to and suffer those consequences, but people on a lower income have a greater incentive to not start or to give up smoking and therefore will receive the greater health benefits for them and the family benefits of retaining that person as a productive and healthy member of the workforce, then in net terms this is a policy that is slanted towards advantaging those in lower socioeconomic groups. Whilst I understand the argument that is put forward, I think it is fair to say that there is an equally strong argument that this does actually work to the benefit of people who currently suffer the greatest burden of health disease from tobacco.


The other unintended consequence that is raised by people who are concerned about the increase in excise is whether or not there will be more illicit tobacco coming into the country because of the high prices. There will be more reward and, therefore, incentive and opportunity. The primary responsibility for dealing with the illicit trade in tobacco rests with Border Protection and the Australian Taxation Office. What this government has done to try and make sure that we have the resources that are required at our borders in a range of areas, but particularly here in tobacco, is provide additional funding in the 2016-17 budget to deal with tobacco. So $7.7 million over two years, the 2016-17 and 2017-18 period, has been specifically provided to expand the department's tobacco strike team. That will effectively triple the size of its workforce, allowing for three specialised investigative teams to work to detect, to disrupt and to deter the illicit trade in tobacco.


In this financial year to date the Australian Border Force has detected almost 30 tonnes in the equivalent weight of tobacco—tobacco leaf or cigarette sticks—and this equates to an evaded duty of nearly $20 million. Clearly there is already an illicit trade in existence, and we are putting resources in to make sure that we have effective measures to not allow that trade to increase but in fact to detect, to deter, to interrupt it and to close the trade down. But I would make the argument that, just because there is potential illegal activity, that should not deter us from taking steps that have the primary purpose of protecting people's health.


Just as we have border control methods for other prohibited imports, whether they be weapons, narcotics or in this case tobacco, the fact that criminal elements may wish to seek to profit from people in Australia should not sway us from putting in place policies that achieve the long-term health benefits that we are looking towards. We will take the steps necessary, and the government has made the investments necessary, to combat things such as illicit tobacco imports. We will continue to do that with not only tobacco but other areas with border control. I think one of the strong achievements of this government since 2013—and it will continue under the government recently elected—is that we will continue to make the investments and have the strength of our policy positions and convictions so that the men and women who serve in our Border Force units, as well as the Defence Force, AFP and other police units who support them, can make sure that our borders are secure. 


I have outlined what this bill will do in terms of the excise and imports. I have outlined why, and it is predominantly around health. These measures have proven, as I have seen in my own life experience from those early days in the military through to now, the significant impact they have had in Australia in terms of the prevalence of smoking. Given the impact on individuals, their families and the broader productive community, I support these measures. I believe we have taken the appropriate steps to make sure that any unintended consequences like illicit trade are dealt with. I do not support the argument that the burden falls unfairly on people in lower socioeconomic groups; in fact, as articles from the Medical Journal and the Cancer Council show, that group in our society in the medium to long term are actually the greatest beneficiaries of measures like this. I commend these measures to the Senate.

"O'Sullivan, Sen Barry",Nats,2016-09-14,"



Senator O'SULLIVAN
 (Queensland) (11:24):  I too rise to make a contribution to the debate on the Excise Tariff Amendment (Tobacco) Bill 2016 and the Customs Tariff Amendment (Tobacco) Bill 2016. Let me open my contribution with a story—I know Senator Sterle will enjoy this story, being a man of the fifties. I recall, as a youngster aged 13, convalescing at the Rockhampton Base Hospital men's ward after some surgery. For those of us listening who sadly can remember the sixties, I found myself in a men's ward with the traditional old lime-green floors and walls. That seemed to be the colour of choice for hospitals back then. There were about 40 or 50 men, if my memory serves me correctly, who were convalescing in the ward with various injuries or recovering from surgeries, and the majority of them were lying there smoking with ashtrays on their chests. I can remember my physician—I cannot remember his name but I can remember quite distinctly him coming in with a very large bendy pipe in his mouth. I can remember the nurses—part of their duties was to come around and empty the ashtrays into old powdered milk tins then. 


I have often wondered since that time—these issues did not strike me at the time—what would have happened, if I had stood up on my bed and announced to those men in that ward that it would not be long before they would not be able to smoke in the hospital, on the verandah of the hospital, down in the car park, over at the racecourse, at railway workshops, in a car with their children, within 100 metres of a government building, in an aeroplane or at any of the other places that other people have reflected on in their contributions. 


I can say to you—more particularly, as I got involved in politics and now as a member of the Senate and a legislator—that it has always remained with me that the power of public policy and shifts in the culture of societies can over time make some very, very positive contributions to our amenity of life. Indeed we have seen a reduction in the use of tobacco and tobacco products—except for some age cohorts within society—and have also seen, I think, a much more responsible approach to the consumption of alcohol over that time. I think that that has come about through a range of initiatives, including public initiatives, but also through changes in culture in our society, as people become more aware of the potential negative impacts in certain circumstances of the consumption of the topic of choice today of tobacco—and indeed not just with tobacco but with alcohol and even the consumption of illicit drugs. It remains a challenge most certainly in this country, but I think a more educated society in part is what contributes to changes in cultural attitude to these things; however, as with everything in life, as our society goes forward, it can be given assistance in other forms. In this case, the introduction of this bill is a decision of the government of the day to use some fiscal measures to make a contribution to the ongoing battle—it is a long way from being completed—regarding the consumption of tobacco products. 


It would surprise me, if any senators making a contribution to this bill were to rail against the bill. In fact, the methodology of increasing the excise on tobacco is almost a bipartisan measure, because many of these measures were introduced of course under the Labor administration of Prime Minister Gillard. I have to say—and I do not do this very frequently—that the Labor Party need to be congratulated on leading in this way, because the reforms introduced under Labor—



Senator Jacinta Collins interjecting—




Senator O'SULLIVAN:
  Make note of it, Senator. I will send a highlighter pen around. You can highlight the Hansard and frame it. I am paying great tribute to the Australian Labor Party for their leadership in this space. The initiatives that they undertook—



Senator Whish-Wilson interjecting—




Senator O'SULLIVAN:
  All right, and the Greens perhaps may have been involved somewhere on the early initiatives. We will recognise them as well.


This introduction of an increase in the excise is not a new measure. This is a measure and a model that was adopted by the Australian Labor Party—and they provided leadership in this space—back when they reviewed the excise and increased it, from memory, by about 25 per cent. We need to look at, along with all of the other measures that exist in society to inhibit the consumption of tobacco products, the efficacy of measures such as increases in the excise. I heard the very valuable contribution by the previous speaker, reflecting on resistance to such measures as it heavily impacts on the lower socioeconomic strata within our society. That is following on from the evidence that people in lower socioeconomic stratas—in fact, people who live in my beloved regional and rural Australia—are more inclined to consume tobacco products per capita on average than others who live in more metropolitan and urban areas. There are any number of reasons for this. But going to the heart of the question of whether an increase in the excise impacting on them is a right and proper thing to do, I think one needs to consider the flip side of the coin and the impact it will have on their life for any person who consumes tobacco products.


I think that anything that government does with a pure heart is a good thing. I know there will be those who will suggest that this is simply a revenue grab and that it is not designed to do anything but increase the income in the coffers of the nation. I would say to them that I think it is a very genuine measure. I think it is a legitimate measure. In fact, there is evidence to suggest that this works.


What we have seen after a range of measures—including that one-off 25 per cent increase to the excise that I have attributed to the Australian Labor Party and, indeed, which I support conceptually—is a significant reduction in the consumption of tobacco products of some 11 per cent. Anything that we can do through a policy measure that increases, if that is the intention, or decreases a number into double digits falls into the success basket. It is not to be sneezed at that an 11 per cent reduction occurred as a result of the last increase in excise. I know this is not what will happen this time but, with these increases from 2017 onwards, if we are able to achieve double-digit decreases in the consumption of tobacco then we will be heading towards very, very acceptable rates of consumption. That is not to say that any consumption is supported, but it will get us down to much more manageable rates.


Initiatives such as the increase in the excise will not work simply in and of themselves. I think some of the credit for that decrease in consumption has to go to other initiatives that have taken place. Governments have played a part in some of them. These things help mould and shape people's culture and attitudes to these things. There have been measures such as the reduction in tobacco advertising. In fact, I do not think I can think of a circumstance now where tobacco can be advertised. But most of us are of an age that we will remember the advertisement of tobacco. As a young man I used to pretend I had a cigarette hanging out of my mouth when I pretended to be John Wayne while playing cowboys and Indians. You might remember that very prominent people in our communities—




Senator Whish-Wilson:
  Marlon Brando.




Senator O'SULLIVAN:
  Yes, Marlon Brando. I can remember the announcement of the assassination of John F Kennedy. Walter Cronkite paused before he came to the punchline to take a draw on his cigarette as he announced that that prominent American president had been assassinated.


But this 11 per cent reduction is not just due to excise increases, although evidence was given on this to public hearings held here in August 2011 by our House of Representatives Standing Committee on Health and Ageing as part of its inquiry into the plain packaging legislation. The then Chief Executive Officer of British American Tobacco Australia, a very, very large player in the field of tobacco products, gave evidence where—and I will quote him so that there is no chance of confusion—he said:


We understand that the price going up when the excise goes up reduces consumption.


That is worth repeating because you would think that the CEO of British American Tobacco Australia may well have been more inclined to try to diminish the impact of such a policy measure and, in fact, try to indicate to the government that it was not working so that it did not impact on them and their market share of tobacco. But he said:


We understand that the price going up when the excise goes up reduces consumption.


He went on to say—and this refers to the efficacy of the increase that occurred in 2010:


We saw that last year very effectively with the increase in excise.


So he attributed the double-digit reduction in consumption specifically to the introduction of the excise. He said:


There was a 25 per cent increase in the excise and we saw the volumes go down …


In his view, there was a 10.2 per cent reduction in the industry. That is not that inconsistent with the figures of the review that was eventually conducted consequent to that inquiry to determine just what impact the increase in excise had had.


The excise bill is quite specific. It is continuing a trend of governments and it does not matter what the persuasion of the governments are. What it has done is look back and seen a measure—in this case, a fiscal measure by a Labor government—that was successful. So the introduction of these increases, particularly after 2017 and onwards, I think, is based on sound thinking. As I said earlier in my contribution, I imagine that this measure will be supported by everyone here in the Senate because the results are in. The evidence that this works is in.


But, again, the measure needs to go hand-in-hand with an increase in advertising efforts to not only reduce tobacco consumption but create within society arrangements where people do not start smoking in the first place. They have to go to the key element, to the root source of this terrible addiction to try and help young people as they come through to avoid the pitfalls. 


We all need to recognise that this is a very significant addiction in society. Those who have smoked and who have been able to give smoking away will tell you it is a lifelong addiction. We have to increase measures by government in advertising and education not only to increase the awareness of the impacts the abuse of tobacco products have on individuals but also to try and prevent or dissuade young people from taking up the habit in the first instance.


Support services require funding, and I can say our government proudly continues in our tradition as set by former governments and Labor governments in making sure that we fund all sorts of support services in our community, where people can readily access information to help them to determine what potential impacts their behaviour may have, not just with tobacco but across the abuse of both legal and illicit products, including alcohol and drugs. The increase in support services has been on an appropriate trajectory for governments. That needs to remain on the current trajectory so that we can increase the places people can go to gather the awareness they need.


The previous speaker spoke about making sure that we clamp down on illicit tobacco trade. Up until the end of the last parliament, I was a member of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee that visited on this issue on a number of occasions. I think there were inquiries conducted but I did not participate in them. And I know there was a lot of time and energy expended on Border Force during estimates for us to track just what efforts they were putting in place to see that we do not have illicit, cheaper tobacco in Australia that would offset, I suppose, the benefits that we are seeing from measures such as these increases in excises.


Plain packaging had another impact. You could take the plain packaging and put it in the same category as a reduction in advertising. I think that took away a bit of a trendy attraction to cigarettes. For those who smoked in earlier days, you will remember you may have been Craven A man or a Rothmans man or a Camel-without-a-filter man. I still have not got over the first Camel I had without a filter—I think I am still suffering from that 30 years on. I thank the plain packaging initiative. Again, I want to pay credit to the Australian Labor Party, who led the way on this. It was a great initiative and there is evidence that it had a significant impact on the trade also.


Society is playing its bit, playing a very important role. I remember as a young fellow that if you wanted a breath of fresh air, you went outside and everyone stayed inside smoking but of course that is now reversed. Smokers are often very socially conscious, I am told, and will find themselves trying to find a quiet spot in the car park behind a bush to have a cigarette rather than be seen. Most people now accept it is not a very socially acceptable practice to smoke in or about someone's home or at sporting events, particularly the school sporting events that I often go to with my grandchildren. At a stadium or some other sporting event, there is nobody lighting up in the vicinity of thousands of people.


Socially smoking has become a less accepted practice to the point that where anyone can regulate where you can smoke, they have done that. I remember travelling a lot internationally some years ago with work and probably still within a decade of today—may be a little bit longer—if you were travelling particularly on an Asian airline, the practice was still available. Then they started to shift the smokers down the back—I do not know what they thought that was going to achieve. Indeed, socially, communities and societies have taken whatever steps they can to reduce the consumption of tobacco.



I want to commend this measure to the Senate. I think it is a good measure. I think it is a measure that can be supported by all sides of politics. I think it is important to remind people that when it was introduced by the Labor government, it had an immediate, within 12 months, reduction in the consumption of tobacco products by double digits. If we can achieve that sort of result from each of these excise increases, we will have done our duty for our society. (Time expired)

"Back, Sen Chris",LP,2016-09-14,"



Senator BACK
 (Western Australia) (11:44):  Today we are privileged to have, in the student galleries on three sides of this chamber, students who have the opportunity to witness what goes on in this chamber and in the parliament. Deputy President, through you I direct an urgent plea, a request, to each of the three groups of students: do not take up smoking. Do not smoke. During my contribution to the debate on the Excise Tariff Amendment (Tobacco) Bill 2016 and Customs Tariff Amendment (Tobacco) Bill 2016, I will give you a couple of reasons why you should not. I promise you that, by the time you are adults, either you will have saved sufficient money for a deposit on your own home or apartment, to get you started in real estate, or you will have saved enough to be able to go around the world every year on a holiday during your leave. As you become parents, you will have sufficient money to be able to put funds aside for the education of your children. How good is that? If you go away from this place this week with one lesson, with one thing to remember, I urge you: do not take up smoking. 


We all know that cancer is a scourge and a curse that affects every family. I had my experience in the last period of the 44th Parliament. It was just before two o'clock when my mobile phone rang. I realised it was my doctor and I stepped out. I had the first question for the government that day, and my doctor was telling me the bad news that a salivary gland problem I had was malignant. I did not really like that very much, and I said to him, 'Dale, I'm sorry I can't talk to you right now, because I have a question in question time.' He said to me, 'Chris, you're not taking this seriously. That huge growth on your thyroid is malignant.' I had had a chat with the surgeon. I am a veterinarian and I had seen the results. I was not quite as pessimistic as he was. Some people had noticed that I had lost weight, and I would very quietly say, 'Yes, I've been on an exercise program. I lost 14 kilos in about five weeks.' It was not an exercise program; it was this jolly cancer. Fortunately, I could hide it by wearing a suit and tie—nobody knew. Even more fortunately, when it was removed it was not malignant. I had that great news: no malignancy.


The message I want to give you is this: that was something over which I could have had no control, yet smoking is a practice that puts cancer-producing elements, called carcinogens, into your lungs, and that may well lead to you getting lung cancer, throat cancer or any of those cancers associated with your respiratory system, and then you will accelerate towards an early death. I say this to you whether you are a parent, a kid or—as is the case for some of us in this chamber—a grandparent. I have to say, when you become a grandparent, you have a really important cause to want to keep living for. 


A member of my family is also a veterinarian. He is eight years older than me. My earliest memories of him were as a smoker. And he fits the bill, as read out previously by Senator Smith: a remote area person who worked all his life in stockyards in the bush. Members of our profession saw the pathology in animals that is equivalent to the human pathology—in other words, the disease in the lungs in humans. I used to often say, 'For someone with his knowledge, why the billyo is he smoking?' He turned up to visit his young grandchild in a Western Australian town. They all got crook about three years ago—he did, the child did and the parents did. He came home and he has not smoked since. I see his improvement in health every day and I see the fact that we are going to have him for the next few years, whereas, five years ago, I feared he was not going to see his grandchildren grow up. 


The stats you have seen here today say it all. Low socioeconomic groups—in other words, people who cannot afford it—are three times more likely to smoke. If you come from a remote area, you have double the likelihood of smoking. Single parents—usually mums—with dependent children are nearly three times more likely to smoke, and are more likely to smoke than parents in homes where there are two parents. These are the stats. I ask the teachers to ask the children, 'Get your pens out.' And, if you do not, here is a bit of an exercise for when you are back at school. If you are able, have a look at the Hansard of speeches. It does not matter who is giving this one. Next week, go back and have a look at these figures. 


The price today of cigarettes is about $25 per packet. If you smoke a packet a day, that is going to cost you $9,000 a year. And to those of us who pay tax—because all of this is what is called after-tax money—if you apply 30 per cent tax, the real cost of that $9,000 is $12,000 a year. That is $1,000 a month. Many of you are probably 12, 13, 14 years of age, so by 24 years of age that 12 grand a year is the $120,000 I was telling you about that you will have as a deposit on a home. But it will not be $120,000. If you have your pens out: within four years the cost of a packet of smokes will go to about $40. At $40 a packet, if you have a packet a day, that is $15,000 a year. And, again, if you apply the 30 per cent tax rate—because all of this is after-tax money; you do not get a tax deduction for helping yourself die early—the actual cost is over $20,000 a year. If you multiply that by the 10 or 12 years, by the time you are young adults there you have $200,000 in the bank earning interest, probably up to about $240,000 or $250,000—if I had the financial capacity of the finance minister, he could probably tell me what the compound interest rate would be. There is the money you have, and you have your health.


The question is often asked: to what extent are we interfering in the privacy of people by imposing taxes that make smoking more difficult? Of itself, if somebody decides to smoke, you would say, 'Well, that's their business; let them do it; let them take on the financial burden,' as I have just suggested. But there is an analogy that has been mentioned by Senator Fawcett, in his experience, of being in the cockpit of an aircraft where he could not see because of his copilot, and so he had to go onto instrument rating. It is a question of the effect on other people, of course. It is the effect of passive smoking. It is the effect on children in a car. It is the effect on other people in a room. When it goes from being something to do with the person to others around that person who can have no influence on the behaviour of that person, it changes dramatically.


I want to give you an example away from smoking. I want to direct this to the experience recently we had as a result of Senator Whish-Wilson, who asked us to participate in a Senate inquiry into marine plastics. I was involved in the committee—not that I necessarily wanted to be, but I thought, 'That's fair enough.' I knew little about this. Probably one of the joys of our work in the Senate is that we are drawn into areas that we normally would not have the opportunity or excuse to examine. I was not aware that all plastics will eventually reduce to microplastics. I was not aware, particularly, that we already had microplastics in things like toothpaste and various other items.




Senator Whish-Wilson:
  Beauty products.




Senator BACK:
   Thank you for that, Senator Whish-Wilson. I probably do not use too many beauty products, as is evident. But, nevertheless, I should have known that. We learned in that inquiry, as Senator Whish-Wilson probably already knew, that plastics break down in the environment. They do not disappear; they do not dissipate; they become microplastics. Plankton take up the microplastics, little fish eat the plankton, big fish eat the little fish and we eat the big fish.


What really drew my attention particularly to this exercise, and why it is relevant to this discussion, is the fact that there is a growing body of evidence that those microplastics are getting into the cells of human beings. Of itself, that is important enough to protect the oceans from plastics. I accept that. But when we cross that boundary to the realisation that we may well be looking at a circumstance of adverse human health as a result of this, you can bet your life—through you, Madam Deputy President, to Senator Whish-Wilson—that my focus of attention elevated.


I come back now to that comment associated with privacy. Yes, it is an invasion of privacy to tax something to the level where it probably becomes unattainable for a lot of people. Again, if that is the decision of an adult—to place themselves at risk from a health point of view—one could say that the role of government and others is to warn them of that and to let them make their own decision. That is probably right. But when it comes to the health of other people, it is not right.


The statistic that Senator Fawcett gave to us in his contribution was interesting—that is, in 2001, 22 per cent of adults in Australia smoked. That had gone down to 16 per cent by 2010. It is now 14 per cent. I actually want to give credit to the then health minister, Mr Tony Abbott. If you look at that dramatic decline—of 22 per cent at the beginning of the decade, down to 16 per cent by the end of the decade—it was in his capacity as health minister that the placing of those offensive warnings on packets had the biggest effect on young people not smoking. Again, I do give credit, as others have done, to Ms Roxon in her move towards plain packaging. I did not like it very much, but, nevertheless, it is apparent that we have seen a further reduction in adult smoking levels. So I give her credit for that fact.


I also make mention of the illicit trade in cigarettes. I note that there are funds intended to be directed for border protection to control further this issue. I also do understand, through sources, that the import illegally of cigarettes into this country is so lucrative that, if a consignment is intercepted by border protection and is, therefore, removed, the suppliers will actually supply the illegal importer, free of charge, with replacements of that number of cigarettes. So it really does become an issue of enormous importance to us. Others have mentioned the loss of excise by illegal imports of tobacco and cigarettes. But I also say that it must be so lucrative and so pervasive if the suppliers of those illegal cigarettes are willing to actually replace the products free of charge.


I am also aware that there is technology available here in Australia which, I understand, electronically identifies and marks packets and individual sticks so that government regulators can actually identify whether a packet or a cigarette has been legally or illegally obtained prior to its purchase. I would urge government—the relevant ministers—to pursue this technology further. I know that in the last couple of years I have actually recommended that those who supply such products and services meet with relevant ministers. Anything that can be done to wipe out, diminish or minimise this illegal trade, in my view, should be undertaken.


I want to turn to the impact in financial terms. My understanding is that over the forward estimates this legislation will deliver some $4.6 billion to the overall revenue base. As I understand it, all sides in this chamber support the legislation—certainly, the Labor Party, the coalition and the Greens support the legislation.


I was loud in my praise of Ms Roxon a few minutes ago with regard to her move for plain packaging of cigarettes. On the other hand, I now want to draw the attention of the chamber to something that I think was a mistake Ms Roxon made in her earlier capacity. That was when she introduced the alcopops legislation, which was always about raising tax. The coalition had no difficulty with a proposition that was going to raise tax. She should have said that it was a tax measure and she would have received little if any criticism. The mistake actually was to try to tie it up not in terms of it being a tax measure but in terms of it being a health measure, because by increasing the tax significantly on alcopops young people would in some way stop consuming them. Well, they stopped consuming them all right. As we all said would happen, instead of buying a can of mixed drink that had vodka, whiskey, brandy or whatever it was in with a mixing soft drink—of course, that was taxed out of existence—the kids then all went and bought 750 millimetre bottles of the spirits and bought the mixes separately, whether it was Coke or dry ginger ale or whatever. So, instead of just drinking the smaller quantity of alcopops they ended up drinking a larger quantity, because, as we know, no-one of that age is likely to stop drinking until the bottle is empty.


So I applaud the government and everyone in the chamber for the decision to explain very bluntly what this is. And it is two-fold. First, it is to improve directly the health of the community itself and the health of those affected by smoking, whether they smoke or they are in a smoky environment. Second, it is a measure to make sure that we can repair some of the budget.


In support of those comments I want to applaud the finance minister, the Treasurer and the shadow financial portfolio of personnel for what I understand is a measure and a move to pass the omnibus bill, which will achieve some $6 billion in savings. There has never been a more important time in the modern history of this country for us to get our debt and our deficit under control. There are black clouds over the entire world economy, and we are not immune. The best way that we can guarantee to the Australian people that there is sufficient funding for education, for health, for the legendary NDIS program, for welfare generally, for pensions, for defence and for border protection—for all of those purposes that we, and the community, regard government as having a primary role in—is to have a strong budget and move towards a surplus. So, instead of wasting $12-$15 billion a year paying interest on our debt, the Treasurer and the finance minister can turn that $12-$15 billion into savings and into supporting the lifestyle that this country has come to expect.


For those who do not think there are black clouds hanging over the world economy, you need look no further than Western Europe, Eastern Europe, the Middle East, the United States and Asia. So I commend the legislation and I commend the chamber for its support.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,2,2,speech
"Seselja, Sen Zed",LP,2016-09-14,"



Senator SESELJA
 (Australian Capital Territory—Assistant Minister for Social Services and Multicultural Affairs) (12:04):  It is good to follow my good friend Senator Back in contributing to this debate. I might just pick up a little bit where Senator Back left off in terms of budget repair. I will go into some of the details on smoking rates and the like in a moment.


There is no doubt that budget repair is absolutely critically important. We have seen the announcement yesterday of over $6 billion in savings. That is very important. I commend Scott Morrison and Mathias Cormann for their work in continuing that work to find savings, because that is the main task. There is no doubt about it. When it comes to taxation, which I will move onto in a moment, we have rejected the Labor Party's approach in broad, which is to have a whole range of tax increases in a range of areas. If Labor had come into government they would have taxed a whole host of things more. One of those is, of course, investment in housing. The reason I make that point is that if you want people to do less of something you tax it more. That is what I am going to get into when discussing this bill. If you want people to invest less you tax it more. The Labor Party had that approach when it came to investment in housing and we see that as a shocking idea.


When it comes to taxing things like smoking, obviously there is a slightly different imperative, because we do actually want to see people smoking less—we do. We can put that into stark contrast with when there are tax grabs by the Labor Party on things like negative gearing and capital gains tax, because that is taxing investment and discouraging it. The government and I certainly want to see more investment in housing and in a whole range of other areas.


It is pleasing to be speaking to these bills, the Excise Tariff Amendment (Tobacco) Bill 2016 and the Customs Tariff Amendment (Tobacco) Bill 2016. As a senator for the ACT, I want to note the low rates of smoking we have here in the ACT—the lowest in the country. Figures from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare show that in 2013 in the ACT we had a daily smoking rate of 10 per cent—which, as I will discuss in due course, is the target for smoking rates Australia-wide. Furthermore, in the ACT, we had the highest rate of people who had never smoked—with 65 per cent of Canberrans having not taken up the habit. I can certainly attest—as many others can—that this has all sorts of benefits for individuals, but there are also benefits from living in a relatively smoke-free city. Despite the fact that we have the lowest rates in the country, we would of course like to see those rates continue to decline, as they have in recent years.


The sad reality is that each year smoking kills an estimated 15,000 Australians and costs Australia $31.5 billion in social—including health—and economic costs. Governments of both parties have long fought to decrease smoking rates and the various health impacts that come from smoking. A range of methods have been used over the years to get these rates down. We have seen awareness campaigns, with organisations such as Quit working hard to help people stop smoking. We have also used various economic mechanisms to get smoking rates down by helping people stop and discouraging smokers from taking up the habit in the first place. These bills are another element of ensuring our success in getting smoking rates down continues.


There has been a sustained, concerted effort by all levels of government since the 1970s to improve health outcomes when it comes to smoking. Since the first health warnings were mandated on cigarette packs in 1973, it has been a long road to get where we are today. Long gone are the days of smoking indoors, on planes, in workplaces and in restaurants. Particularly since the turn of the century, we have a good story to tell with getting smoking rates down. In 2001, 22.3 per cent of the population were smokers. In 2004-05 that had dropped by one per cent to 21.3 per cent. In 2007-08 we saw a further drop to 19.1 per cent. In 2011-12 we saw it drop to 16.3 per cent. And, most recently, in 2014-15 it has dropped even further to 14.7 per cent. So there has been great success here in getting good outcomes for smokers, with all of the flow-on health benefits for hundreds of thousands of people in our community.


Perhaps most impressively, amongst the most recent ABS figures there is a statistic that is very encouraging, which is that 52.6 per cent of Australians have never smoked. That means that we have a whole cohort of young people who have listened to the educational and awareness campaigns out there, know the health problems associated with smoking and are making the choice to not even try smoking in the first place. We know how addictive smoking can be. I have never been a smoker myself, but a number of family members have been and I have watched them try to quit, quit, take it up again and quit again. It is a very challenging addiction for many people to get over. So, of course, it is much better if our kids do not try it in the first place. I would emphasise that to young people. It is certainly a message I give my kids, and I hope that they take that advice. So far, so good—as far as I know. You never quite know what your kids are up to all the time, but I am pretty confident that none of them are smokers and I am very hopeful that none of them will be smokers. Certainly the message to them is not to engage in that habit. 


A 2014 study on school students' use of tobacco found that smoking among 12- to 15-year-olds is at its lowest since 1984 when studies of this type began. Even more encouraging, the study found that 94 per cent of 12-year-olds have never smoked and 61 per cent of 17-year-olds have not had a cigarette either. So I think we can say that what was once one of our greatest health challenges is becoming less of a challenge, though of course we know that there is more that needs to be done.


Through COAG, all Australian governments have committed to getting the smoking rate down to 10 per cent. As I noted earlier, that is the rate here in the ACT—and of course we would like to get it lower than that. We have still got some way to go and I think it would be a significant achievement to get the rate to 10 per cent nationally. With that in mind, these bills will increase tobacco excise charged on domestic production and equivalent customs duties charged on imports by way of four annual increases of 12.5 per cent a year from 2017 until 2020. This will replicate the annual increases that were put in place from 2013 to 2016. In addition, adult average weekly ordinary time earnings based indexation of tobacco excise rates will continue. The next biannual indexation of tobacco excise will occur on 1 March 2017.


From 1 September 2016 the excise and excise equivalent duty rates on tobacco is approximately 61c per stick and $763.20 per kilogram of tobacco content. This equates to $15.26 in excise on a packet of 25 cigarettes, which retails currently for approximately $25.00. Ignoring biannual indexation, the 12.5 per cent increases will increase excise per pack of 25 cigarettes by around $2 each year. This means that, after the final increase in 2020, the excise component of a pack of 25 cigarettes will be $21.50. The increase in excise and duty will move Australia towards the World Health Organization's recommendation that excise should comprise 70 per cent of the price of a cigarette. All that said, it is difficult to say how this will precisely affect prices as cigarette companies may change their prices in other ways. But the central point remains that these bills aim to reduce the prevalence of smoking in Australia and thus minimise the harm of cigarette smoking to the community.


It has been very clear for some time, as we have been on this journey to reduce smoking rates, that increasing the price of cigarettes via taxation is one of the most effective ways of reducing tobacco consumption and preventing the uptake of smoking. Higher prices encourage smokers to quit or reduce their consumption and discourage potential smokers, particularly young Australians, from taking up the habit. There have been a number of significant increases in the tobacco excise, particularly since 2010, and the lowering of smoking rates over that time clearly demonstrates how this has worked.


As I have mentioned, the Council of Australian Governments have set a target of reducing the daily adult smoking rate to 10 per cent of the population. This commitment sits alongside a similar commitment to halve the daily rate of smoking among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people by 2018. This measure will also assist the government to make further progress on these goals. It is one of the most unfortunate and troubling aspects of this discussion that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians, people in remote areas and people of the lowest socioeconomic status all have higher rates of smoking than the general population. Certainly I understand, as does the government, that this means that there are challenges when we increase the excise. We understand that, for those who feel unable to quit, this does create a financial burden. It can be very tough; I acknowledge that. And that is one of the challenging parts of dealing with this issue. Obviously, the hope is that people will not end up spending so much money on smoking. The hope is that they will spend, in future, no money on smoking, as it encourages them to quit. So they will not only save the money they are currently spending on cigarettes but also gain all of the health benefits that flow from quitting smoking. They will have more money in their pockets and, hopefully, a much healthier lifestyle and a longer life. Hopefully, they will avoid some of the worst things that come from long-term smoking and that are linked to long-term smoking—particularly things like lung cancer, which of course has such a devastating impact on those who suffer from it.


As has always been the case in our efforts to reduce smoking, this change sits alongside the numerous interventions the Commonwealth has made to reduce the prevalence of smoking, including a comprehensive ban on tobacco advertising and promotion, retail display bans, Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme subsidies for smoking-cessation supports, and extensive and continuing public education campaigns. As we have clearly established in this place during this debate, these efforts are working, so it is vital that we continue to make the changes we need to continue these great outcomes.


I note that of course these bills also play a broader role in this government's efforts to get the budget under control and to build a strong economic platform into the future. These bills will raise $4.59 billion across the forward estimates period. In comparison, goods and services tax receipts are estimated to increase by $430 million over the same period. The revenue gained from higher tobacco excise will be used by the government to provide a range of services, including health services. I know that in the other place they have been working through the Budget Savings (Omnibus) Bill 2016, and no doubt we will soon be debating it here. I particularly look forward to that debate. As I mentioned earlier, broadly, when it comes to issues around budget repair, our view in the coalition is that the primary way of getting the budget under control is to control spending—to limit spending growth and to find reasonable savings where we can find them. That is the best way to bring the budget back under control. As I also mentioned earlier, the exceptions to that are things like the tobacco tax, where we are taxing something that we would like to see less of, not taxing things like investment and economic growth and jobs, which, of course, we want to see more of. So there is a significantly different approach between the coalition and our opposition when it comes to taxation.


But, when it comes to these bills, of course, we are looking to see less tobacco consumed in this country. We are looking to see rates of smoking going down rather than coming back up again. These bills are an important part of that. This measure is an important part of the government's comprehensive tobacco control strategy, which includes investment in antismoking social marketing campaigns, subsidies for nicotine replacement therapies and the introduction of plain packaging for tobacco products.


The government also announced in the budget that it will strengthen the penalties for illicit tobacco offences and provide an additional $7.7 million for the tobacco strike team to combat illicit tobacco activity. This is a particularly important measure to ensure the effectiveness of the tobacco excise increase. I have heard from many here in my community in Canberra about the illegal importing of tobacco and the black market for cigarettes. Australia has a strong legislative and regulatory framework to control illicit trade in tobacco products. The Australian Taxation Office and the Australian Border Force will continue to have a strong ongoing role in monitoring and enforcement activity against illicit tobacco. This is an important fight, and we are going to continue to keep our borders secure and work against this illicit trade.


So it is clear that these bills are important for Australia's health and, of course, for our budget. The fact is that 15,000 people dying from smoking related illnesses is too many. Even though we have made great progress over the last few decades in getting smoking rates down, we certainly cannot be complacent. With a goal of reducing smoking to 10 per cent across all states and territories by 2018, we have a clear target to hit, and the entire suite of government efforts will continue.


History has shown that we need a range of policies to combat smoking. We need advertising campaigns and health awareness campaigns. We need to be in schools talking to young people and out in the community encouraging people to quit. But we also do need to combine these efforts with other measures, including the price signals contained in these bills. So that is what these bills do. Regular increases in the tobacco excise over the next four years will bring our policies into line with international standards. They will lift the price of cigarettes, which has been a proven way to get smoking rates down. Once again, I note that there are, obviously, impacts on those who struggle to quit smoking, and we will do what we can to encourage people and to assist people so that not only can their health improve as a result of quitting smoking but their bank balance can improve as well.


I would note once again, in closing, that I think we should be proud of the fact that here in the ACT we see the lowest rates of smoking in the country. We want to continue to bring those rates down, particularly for our young people, because it is such an addictive thing. Smoking is addictive. Nicotine is addictive. To avoid smoking in the first place, as a young person—to avoid being drawn into that—is a much better path than having the great challenges of quitting. We see it with family and friends; it is a tough habit to break. We commend those who do manage to do so. But I would advise people not to start smoking in the first place. That figure of 52 per cent of Australians now who have never smoked is good. We want to see that figure continue to go up, as we hopefully see a generation of young Australians for whom this is really not something that they do. I commend these bills to the Senate and look forward to their passage.

"Scullion, Sen Nigel",CLP,2016-09-14,"



Senator SCULLION
 (Northern Territory—Minister for Indigenous Affairs and Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (12:22):  I rise in support of the Excise Tariff Amendment (Tobacco) Bill 2016 and the Customs Tariff Amendment (Tobacco) Bill 2016, and I have to say that this legislation is of special interest to me and to my portfolio of Indigenous Affairs. I have personally seen, as I am sure have many in the chamber, the devastating impact of smoking on far too many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. So, through my portfolio we have three priorities: getting kids to school, getting adults to work and ensuring that communities are safer. But we are not going to achieve this when our First Australians die 10.6 years earlier, for males—9.5 years earlier for females—and, generally speaking, enjoy far poorer health outcomes.


That is why the coalition government is committed to closing the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians across a whole range of measures. Madam Deputy President, I know you would be aware that the Closing the Gap measures started as a suite of health measures and have grown over time. Part of the motivation for those fundamental measures initially was to address the health gap. If you are not healthy it is very difficult to engage in education. If you are not healthy it is very difficult to engage in employment. If you are not healthy it is very difficult to engage in the sorts of opportunities that other Australians take for granted. So one of those Closing the Gap targets is to close the gap in life expectancy between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians by 2031.


Closing the gap is particularly challenging because it is not only about ensuring that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people live longer; it is also a matter of ensuring that they catch up with the remainder of the medical miracles that constantly make those in the mainstream live longer. So it is a very challenging gap but obviously one that is absolutely fundamental to the Closing the Gap process. If we are going to achieve this, then if there is any lever that is available to us we need to ensure that we can pull that lever. This legislation is one of those levers.


The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare report titled Australia's health 2016, which was released just this week, reinforces why we need to tackle smoking rates. Let me share with the Senate some of the report's key findings. Between one-third and one-half of the health gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians is associated with differences in socioeconomic position. Only 39 per cent of Indigenous Australians rated their health as 'excellent' or 'very good' in 2012-13, a decrease from 44 per cent in 2008 and 43 per cent in 2004 and 2005. A further 37 per cent of Indigenous Australians reported their health as 'good', 17 per cent as 'fair' and seven per cent as 'poor' in 2012-13. By comparison, more than half of Australians more generally—56 per cent—rated their health as 'excellent' or 'very good', only 10.4 per cent as 'fair' and 4.4 per cent as 'poor'. There is a stark contrast.


Chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease and cancer, are responsible for a majority of the life expectancy gap. Certainly it has been my observation that, particularly in very remote areas and very remote communities, the nature of the environment is a factor in chronic disease. Whilst smoking is a part of that, if a person has rheumatic heart disease, which is one of the largest killers in our communities—and I have to commend those who are working very stridently at the moment, particularly Menzies, to try to provide some respite via a vaccination or other processes in that regard—it is like an accumulation of things that can go wrong in that person's life, an accumulation of things that are negatively affecting their body and how it works.


Rheumatic heart disease, congestive heart failure, various types of lung disease—a lot of them are caused by the circumstances in the community. There may be a house that people do not themselves own, so it is very difficult to know who is responsible for it. People are coming and going, visiting the house, and it is not the normal circumstance of a house that someone is actually responsible for; it is a circumstance where a lot of people are responsible. I suppose it is a little like the 'tragedy of the commons': you cannot identify someone who is particularly responsible for this house in the way that you can in many normal households.


So the circumstance is that some of these houses are, as we would say, a bit dirty. Having many fingers at child level moving around the place makes it a bit grubby. But we are now starting to understand that such an environment has a direct impact on health. And when we see that some of these chronic disease presentations—cardiovascular diseases particularly—are being impacted by that, we have to ensure that we start to look after that environment, and that goes to how we can better manage some of our tenancies in this area and how we can assist those families, because it just gets on top of them. They have lots of visitors, lots of people going through, and they just do not have the capacity to ensure that the house does not have such a negative impact on people's health.


As I said, chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease and cancer are responsible for a majority of the life expectancy gap. We in this place would all know about the strong association between cancer and smoking. I have to confess that I have been a smoker during my life, and if I have one or two beers there is certainly that tendency to want to go and, in the vernacular, 'bot a durry' from someone. I think even the most chronic smokers—speaking of which, good to see you, Senator O'Sullivan!—know themselves that they would like to not be smokers. And it is really interesting in communities: it is not as though communities are not absolutely aware that smoking is bad for you. If I am in a community in north-east Arnhem Land and I see someone light up in a tree, people will yell out—it is a wonderful way that they have got in north-east Arnhem Land—'Quit smoking!' They will say, 'No durries.' They will do it in a likely place, but each time, as they would say, it provides a little shame for someone who is lighting up. The whole community give a bit of a yell out in that regard. 


So it is not as if people are not aware that smoking is bad for them. As I have heard from some other speakers this morning, it is, of course, the nature of addiction. The evidence is that nicotine is one of the most difficult drugs in your system to get rid of. It not only provides the circumstances where you are in a much more vulnerable demographic; also you are much more likely to develop cancer if you are a smoker. Obviously, there are a whole range of other issues. We still need to work very hard on exactly how we try to ensure that this is no longer cool in the community. There are demographics within a community that we can ensure are made aware in a way that appeals to them. It is that which this bill addresses. Whilst the smoking rate—that is, the daily and less-than-daily rate—for Indigenous Australians has declined somewhat, Indigenous Australians are still 2.6 times as likely to smoke daily as non-Indigenous Australians, whose rate is around 15 per cent.


In 2013, Indigenous mothers were 3.6 times as likely to smoke during pregnancy as non-Indigenous women. I have to say I despair sometimes because there are groups—sometimes very vulnerable groups—who do not have access to the same sort of constant education. If you go into any of the medical centres, for sure the walls are festooned with warnings about smoking during pregnancy and the negative effects it can have on your unborn child. But, given the numbers of people who still smoke when they are pregnant, clearly the message is not getting through to them. We need to do our very best to ensure that that is no longer the case.


We are not going to close the gap in life expectancy if we do not lower the rates of smoking among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians. Of course, the smoking rates are on top of a number of other startling facts in terms of that difference. For example, in 2015, the immunisation rate for one- and two-year-old Indigenous children was much lower than the rate of all children. It was 89 per cent compared with 92 per cent for one-year-olds and 86 per cent compared with 89 per cent for two-year-olds. The immunisation rate for Indigenous five-year-olds was higher than the rate for all children—that is, 94 per cent compared with 93 per cent. This is a startling difference. 


All of these statistics have a parallel. They are all connected and they are all contextualised around the actual gap that they create. If you cannot get immunisation processes right and if you cannot reduce the rates of smoking then life expectancy for our First Australians and the gap between the mainstream and our First Australians is going to close very slowly, if at all.


In 2012-13, after adjusting for the differences in the age structure, Indigenous adults living in non-remote areas were still more likely than non-Indigenous adults to not have undertaken the recommended level of physical activity in the past week. That is another 10 per cent difference. 


Whether it is smoking or whether it is immunisation, all of these matters need to be dealt with to ensure that that headline of life expectancy is actually dealt with. That is why it has been so important to ensure that we have a whole-of-government approach. I have to say it is so much easier, now that my portfolio is under Prime Minister and Cabinet, to deal with some of the structural matters that we have done. We now have a cabinet subcommittee with all the other ministers who are responsible. In this case, it is the minister for health, but it is the same with Employment, Environment or whatever the area is. For the very first time, we can have a far more structured approach to those matters.


Obesity was also more common amongst Indigenous Australian adults aged 18 and over. Between 2012 and 2013, after adjusting for differences in age structure, Indigenous adults were 1.6 times more likely to be obese than non-Indigenous—that is, 43 per cent compared with only 27 per cent for non-Indigenous adults.


In 2012-13, a high proportion—26 per cent—of Indigenous Australians aged 15 and over reported that they had not drunk any alcohol in the previous 12 months. After adjusting for age differences, this was 1.6 times the non-Indigenous rate. In some areas, quite clearly there is no grey area of every now and again. Those people who are prepared to go down the road of abstinence do so quite proudly and often as a family. It sometimes cannot be done community by community or area by area. But this indicates that, to be absolutely successful at this and to ensure that we can be successful at this, we need to recognise that a family group and the peers within that family group can lead a better behaviour, a different behaviour and, in this case, a healthier behaviour than any other process might actually deliver.


In 2012-13, Indigenous Australians aged 15 and over were 1.1 times as likely as non-Indigenous Australians to exceed the national alcohol guidelines for single-occasion risk—that is, 50 per cent and 44 per cent respectively. Amongst prison entrants, the use of methamphetamine was more common amongst non-Indigenous entrants than Indigenous entrants—54 per cent and 38 per cent respectively. Whilst we have a scourge that you would expect for those populations that have had difficulty in dealing with some other health issues that I have outlined, quite clearly there are some exceptions to that, and we need to drill into those demographics to find out why they have been more resilient. I have to say, though, that I have been nothing short of petrified when I have seen the scourge of ice and the vulnerability of my community, particularly in remote communities. Yet there seems to have been a line put down that, while there are some substances that are semitolerated in the  community, methamphetamine and its associated drugs are not. They have put a hard line down. People are as frightened as I am. I am delighted that these substances have not simply raged through these communities like a bushfire, as we were all so worried they would. Again, we need to tap into the leadership that can provide that sort of inoculation against those sorts of scourges. We need to ask the advice of that leadership about how we may improve the messaging, whether it is around obesity, whether it is around levels of exercise or whether it is around levels of smoking. They have shown leadership in a way that works, and we need to look very carefully at that leadership and how we might apply that particularly to smoking. 


I was just an hour ago at a meeting with Julie Tongs from Winnunga Nimmityjah Aboriginal Health Service here in Canberra. We were talking about a number of these issues. When talking to Aboriginal health services, it seems if someone is smoking it is generally an indicator—there are obviously other indicators—that they are suffering other poor health symptoms. I have yet to understand a little more about that, but it is still an issue to be highlighted. If you can get people into an Aboriginal medical service, invariably as part of a health check, whatever the presentation is, someone will ask you if you are a smoker. If you are, someone will invariably say to you, 'This is having an impact on your life, it is having an impact on your family and it is having an impact on your capacity to help your family out by providing leadership by being a nonsmoker yourself.' I would like to commend the AMSs not only for the education systems that they run but also for the very strong message that they provide.


Wherever I go around the country, and I have been to over 150 communities on over 200 occasions, I always see there is a culture of smoking in communities. These bills will increase tobacco excise, which is charged on domestic production, and equivalent customs duty, which is charged on imports, by way of four annual increases of 12.5 per cent a year from 2017 to 2020. In addition, the AWOTE—average weekly ordinary time earnings—based indexation of tobacco excise rates will continue. The next biannual indexation of tobacco excise will occur on 1 March 2017. 


The increase in excise and duty will move Australia towards the World Health Organization's recommendation that excise should comprise 70 per cent of the price of a cigarette. The World Health Organization have been around a very long time, and they understand that the price of cigarettes has a direct correlation to your capacity to make a decision to no longer be a smoker. It also has a direct correlation to how many cigarettes you get access to at any particular time. We have not reached a 70 per cent excise level, but I think we have certainly made a very serious move towards it. Each year smoking kills an estimated 15,000 Australians and costs Australia $31.5 billion in social costs—including health and economic costs. Increasing the price of cigarettes via taxation is one of the most effective ways of reducing tobacco consumption and preventing the uptake of smoking. 


The government announced in the budget that it will strengthen the penalties for illicit tobacco offences and provide an additional $7.7 million for the tobacco strike team to combat illicit tobacco activity. This is in recognition of the fact that there is no point saying, 'We are going to put an excise on it and we are going to make it more expensive,' without recognising it increases the attractiveness of criminal behaviour. We acknowledge that whatever you do there is a consequence. When you have a consequence, you have to be a sophisticated enough government to react to that. Australia has a strong legislative and regulatory framework to control illicit trade in tobacco products. The Australian Taxation Office and the Australian Border Force will continue to have a strong ongoing role in monitoring and enforcement activity against illicit tobacco. Again, that is a sophisticated approach, and it has to be. Every time we introduce legislation we know there is going to be a consequence and we have to be across that.


These bills are an important plank in helping to turn that culture and lower smoking rates, particularly in communities. We need to pull every lever against smoking, which is at 2.6 times the non-Indigenous rates. I commend these bills to the Senate.

"Cash, Sen Michaelia",LP,2016-09-14,"




Senator CASH
 (Western Australia—Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service, Minister for Employment and Minister for Women) (12:42):  I too rise to make a contribution to the debate on the Excise Tariff Amendment (Tobacco) Bill 2016 and the Customs Tariff Amendment (Tobacco) Bill 2016. These will increase tobacco excise charged on domestic production and equivalent customs duties, which are of course charged on imports, by way of four annual increases of 12.5 per cent a year from 2017 through to 2020. Certainly, in listening to the address that was just given by my colleague Senator Scullion, the Minister for Indigenous Affairs, I think one begins to understand very much the purpose and the reasons behind the government proceeding with these bills. 



The increase in excise and duty will move Australia towards the 
World Health Organiz
ation's recommendation that exc
ise should comprise 70 per cent
 of the price of a cigarette. There are very, very good evidentiary reasons for this. You see this in advertising and you see it on the cigarette packets themselves, but it is a fact that each year smoking kills an estimated 15,000 Australians. If that was not bad enough, you also have the cost to the Australian economy. Each year smoking costs the Australian economy approximately $31.5 billion in social costs, and economic costs. Those costs include the huge impact of smoking on our health system. So these bills are very much aimed at reducing the prevalence of smoking in society and thus, of course, minimising the harm to the Australian community of 
cigarette smoking. It is a fact that increasing the price of cigarettes via taxation is one of the most effective ways of reducing tobacco consumption.

"Back, Sen Chris",LP,2016-09-14,"



Senator BACK
 (Western Australia) (12:45):  In five weeks time, on 23 October, a group of us will meet at Denham, near Shark Bay, in Western Australia to celebrate the 400th anniversary of the first known European landing on Australian soil—that being Dirk Hartog in 1616. We do not know whether Hartog made an investment, but we do know that he left a pewter plate that is now in the museum in Amsterdam. I have just learnt from my good colleague Senator Scullion that the Macassar community of Indonesia are known to have traded with our Arnhem Land Aboriginals well back into history. Again, we do not really know whether they made a foreign investment, but we do know that 172 years after Hartog, in 1788, Governor Phillip, on board the HMS Sirius, came into Port Botany and then Sydney Cove, and from there commenced foreign investment in Australian agricultural land. And what a wonderful investment it has been and continues to be. Much of the wealth and wellbeing of our country today has been dependent on agricultural investment. For how long did Australia live and grow on the sheep's back, from the wool industry?


It was in 2010-11 that then senators Heffernan, Mary Jo Fisher and I, in a rural and regional affairs committee, urged the then government for the first time ever to start recording foreign investment in Australian agricultural land. That led, by 2012, to the Gillard government trying to commence that process. I remember initially having Foreign Investment Review Board personnel—I think Treasury personnel, tax office personnel—come to visit us, and we needed to define what agricultural land is. For example, I remember asking them, 'Have you included leased land?' and they looked at me blankly and said, 'Why would we include leased land in agricultural land?' I have a couple of statistics that will interest you: in Western Australia there is about 80 million hectares of freehold land and 800 million hectares of leasehold land. As we know—and as you, as a Queenslander, well know, Mr Acting Deputy President O'Sullivan—right across the north of the country, most of the land is leasehold. In the Northern Territory only 46,000 hectares is freehold, whereas 15 million hectares is leasehold. That was the first issue they had to deal with.


The second was that we asked them, 'What if land now used for agriculture was purchased by an overseas buyer for the purpose of something other than agriculture—for example, mining?' That had not been addressed either. The last one was: 'What would happen if, let's say, a Chinese sovereign wealth fund operating through a Hong Kong bank engaged the services of two fine Australians, Cash and Back, and Cash-Back Enterprises was the Australian entity? How would you then establish any foreign ownership? I just use those two names hypothetically, of course. I am very pleased to say that, as we all now know, there was an overhaul of the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act 1975 in 2015, and we now have an accurate set of figures based on hectares rather than on value of land, which gives us an idea of who owns land in this country.


I want to put into perspective, for anyone who might be interested, what the proportion of overall overseas investment into Australia is in agriculture. In 2011-12 it represented only 2.1 per cent—$3.6 billion of the $170 billion was in agriculture. I am indebted to the library, who, in only the last few minutes, have given me the figure for 2014-15, and that figure has only jumped up from 2.1 per cent to 2.7 per cent, being $5.3 billion of $194 billion. You would be interested to know that, in fact, that most significant investors in this recent time in agricultural land in Australia have been the Canadians, including the Canadian teachers' superannuation funds. It remains a mystery and a disappointment to me that most of our superannuation funds—which are moving now to $2 trillion of funds—have not seen their way clear to invest in Australian agricultural land. We know that the UK and the US are not all that far behind them.


So who has got what in this country? We have this xenophobic view about the Chinese, but I can tell you that, of the top 10 foreign countries that invest in agricultural land in this country, first is Britain at 60 per cent and second is the United States at 16½ per cent. The Netherlands—maybe somebody listened to Dirk Hartog back in 1616!—are third at 6½ per cent. They are followed by Singapore. Fifth of the top 10 overseas investment countries is China at 1.46 thousand hectares, or 3.25 per cent. I want to put those figures, if I may, into perspective.


Do we have a concern? We have relied on foreign investment in agriculture in this country for an aeon. I am going to conclude with the experience in Esperance, where the Esperance Land and Development Company, amongst others, were the significant American investors in opening up what has become probably one of our most successful agricultural areas. I want to make this point, and I want to make a recommendation to this parliament and to government: in the past all of the investors—the British, American, whoever—have only ever wanted to invest in our supply chain and for the product to remain within the Australian supply chain, whether it has been grain or milk, or wool or horticultural products. There is a risk. What happens if a sovereign wealth fund from overseas—China is an inclusion; Qatar is another; the Qataris own more land in Western Australia than they own in Qatar—own Australian agricultural land, they grow grain, they take the grain offshore and they do not sell it?


What if they actually philanthropically put it through the mills and produce flour, which they give to their poor citizens? There is no price so therefore there is no transfer price and therefore there is no tax payable back to the Australian government.


My plea is this: it is well within the right of a sovereign wealth fund from overseas to grow produce in our country, use our land, use our water, use our expertise and our supply chain logistics. I also have to say that, in that case, the Australian taxpayer does have a right to a return. My solution simply is up-front in advance to say to other countries: 'If you engage in that activity, which is fine, we will impose the equivalent of a royalty'—which, as Senator Cash and I know only too well, is what we do in the minerals industry—so that the day that grain goes across the wharf onto a ship and on its way to that country, a royalty equivalent to the value of grain in the market that day is payable back to Australia. I think that would satisfy a lot of people who have concerns. 


Let me finish with Esperance, because it gives you a fine example of the capacity of overseas investors, technological expertise and money. The Americans came into Esperance—light country, trace element deficiencies et cetera—in the early 1950s and they brought their own expertise and they failed. They came back in the sixties through the agency of Chase Manhattan Bank. Their entity was American factors, Amfac, and they established Esperance Land and Development Company. In an agreement with the Western Australian government, they would develop 100,000 acres a year of which 50,000 remained with ELD and 50,000 were broken up into 2,000-acre, what were called, conditional purchase blocks. An enormous number of young eastern and Western Australian farmers got their start in agriculture in Esperance as a result of that. ELD, because of the company philosophy, gave a lot of the work—the fencing, the dam construction, the original early clearing work—to the CP block owners, who were living in machinery sheds on the property, and in fact it was the work they did for ELD that gave them the cash flow very often to continue. 


ELD became an outstanding success—eight stations, a flock of 250,000 sheep and 50,000 Hereford cattle, the biggest Hereford herd in the world. Over time they sold out, they left and what did they take with them? Did they take the soil? Did they take the fence lines? Did they take the water points? In fact, Benno Schmidt, the chairman of the company, left probably the finest Aboriginal art collection ever assembled as a gift to the people of Australia. I have got to say to you: foreign investment, the value of it—Esperance would have to be its finest example.

The Australian Bureau of Statistics most recent Wage Price Index shows the total hourly rates of pay, excluding bonuses, grew by only 2.1 per cent in the year to June.

  The question, Senator Carr, was about the government's economic performance, so let me tell you, Senator—



The PRESIDENT:  Pause the clock. Senator Wong, a point of order?

  I rise on a point of order going to relevance. The question was one question: is this the slowest rate of wages growth in the 20 years the ABS has been tracking the measure? That is the only question that was asked.



The PRESIDENT:  That is correct. That is the question. The minister had only just commenced his answer.




Senator BRANDIS:
  I am going to address your question, Senator Ketter, but I think I am at liberty, Mr President, to give some context to my answer. Senator Ketter, we learned recently that economic growth in this country has risen to 3.3 per cent—one of the strongest economic growth figures this country has enjoyed for years and an exceptionally strong figure by international comparisons. Senator Ketter, during the last year of the government of which you were a member, economic growth languished at 1.9 per cent. Exports today are 9.6 per cent higher than they were 12 months ago—the strongest growth of exports in 16 years. Jobs growth in the last year of the government of which you were a member, Senator Ketter, was 86,000 additional jobs in that year. In the past year, it was nearly 220,000—2½ times the rate of growth in the last year of the government of which you were a member. Senator Ketter, you asked me—



Senator Gallagher interjecting—



The PRESIDENT:  I think, Senator Gallagher, the minister was coming to the question. 



Honourable senators interjecting—



The PRESIDENT:  Order! Could I just indicate, both to people asking questions and to people responding to questions, the chair does need some comfort to know the question will be addressed. That comfort was given after the first point of order. I am taking the Attorney-General at his word. It would assist if the question was addressed early on in the answer, but the Attorney-General was right; he has the right to have context around the question. 




Senator BRANDIS:
  Thank you very much, Mr President. You have the wisdom of Solomon, as always.



The PRESIDENT:  Senator Farrell, a point of order?




Senator Farrell:
  Senator Brandis is misleading the Senate. Senator Ketter was not a member of the former parliament—



The PRESIDENT:  That is not a point of order. That is a debating point. There are other opportunities to raise those matters, Senator Farrell. 




Senator BRANDIS:
  Senator Farrell, you rightly chastise me. I should not blame poor Senator Ketter for the performance of the previous government. The ABS Wage Price Index tells us that wages growth was 2.1 per cent over the year to June 2016. That is more than twice the rate of inflation and faster than the wages growth— (Time expired)

 (Queensland—Attorney-General, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (14:07):  Let me just finish the point I was making in answer to your first supplementary question, Senator Ketter. That is also a higher rate of wages growth than the OECD average. Now in relation to Mr Akerman's observations, I have not read Mr Akerman's observations, but I am sure as an honest person and as a good Villanova man, Senator Ketter, you would not misrepresent the position. I disagree entirely, if Mr Akerman had that to say.


Now this evening there is a great event in this Parliament House—a great event. It is the launch of John Howard's series on the great Robert Menzies. I believe, Senator Ketter, that history will show that Mr Turnbull will rank with Sir Robert Menzies and the great John Howard as one of the great Australian prime ministers.

Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (14:42):  My question is to Senator Cormann, as the Minister representing the Minister for Revenue and Financial Services. When introducing the budget on 12 May 2015, the former Treasurer Mr Hockey said, 'There will be no new taxes on superannuation under this government.' A year later, the Prime Minister says the government 'must live within its means', yet you have announced new taxes on superannuation. This is obviously to cover up your inability to live within your means. So now you have developed a taste for other people's superannuation, will you admit that you may dip into this once again, or can you commit that the superannuation taxation changes announced in the budget will be the only changes this parliamentary term?

Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (14:45):  You will index the $1.6 million cap on pension phase superannuation by the CPI, and the age pension by the higher of CPI and wages growth. This will lift the number of age pension recipients compared to Australians in self-funded, tax-free retirement and narrow the gap between the pension and the income of self-funded retirees. Minister, why are you promoting dependence over independence in this way?

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (14:43):  I thank Senator Leyonhjelm for that question. Firstly, the coalition, going into the 2013 election, did make a commitment not to make any unexpected adverse changes to superannuation in our first term, and we delivered on that commitment. The honourable thing to do is to flag the intention to pursue reforms prior to an election and that is of course what we did in the 2016-17 budget. None of these changes have yet been legislated. We announced them as part of the budget just before the election. We took them to the election. They are reforms designed to make the superannuation tax concession framework fairer, more sustainable and fit for purpose. We put them in front of the Australian people seeking their endorsement, seeking their mandate. We were successful at the election and, as such, we not only have a mandate to implement the reforms that we took to the election but also have a responsibility to the Australian people to deliver on what we said we would deliver. We also said, before the election, that we would conduct a process of consultation in relation to the implementation arrangements for these reforms. That is a process that the Treasurer, together with the Minister for Revenue and Financial Services, has been conducting over the past few months. As soon as that process has come to a conclusion, relevant announcements on next steps and timings for the introduction of legislation will be made.

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (14:45):  I do not accept the characterisation that that is what the government is doing. I want to remind everyone that, as a result of our reforms, the proposal is for earnings from capital of up to $1.6 million of savings—and that is right: that cap is indexed—will be completely tax free. Earnings on capital above $1.6 million would attract the still concessional tax of 15 per cent. The structural problem that we have in Australia is that when you have a growing proportion of income generated in Australia completely tax free—zero per cent income tax—it means that every other Australian, every working Australian, has to pay more tax than they otherwise would have to in order to fund the necessary services of government. That is why we are pursuing the reforms that we are pursuing.

I refer to the Prime Minister's statement when deposing the former Prime Minister, that Australia needed 'a style of leadership that respects the people's intelligence, that explains these complex issues and then sets out the course of action we believe we should take and makes a case for it'. Given that the Prime Minister has been unable to make the case for his increase to the GST, his plan to allow state income tax, his proposal to cut all federal funding to public schools and his own budget plans for superannuation reform, hasn't the Prime Minister spectacularly failed his own test?

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Attorney-General, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (14:48):  Senator Watt, that is a very disappointing question, I am bound to say. Senator Watt, I do not know what it is about you Labor Party people; you cannot get above the idea of playing politics rather than engaging in policy. As I said to your colleague Senator Gallagher, give us a debate about public policy, because nobody is pretending there are not hard issues for this country. 


You raised four issues, and every one of them was a falsehood—every single one of them. There is no proposal to raise the GST. The only proposal to raise the GST came from the Premier of South Australia, Mr Weatherill, and the Premier of New South Wales, Mr Baird. So that was wrong. You said that there was a proposal for state taxes. That was wrong. You said that there was a proposal to eliminate aid to public schools. That was wrong. You said that the government was not prosecuting its superannuation changes, and that was wrong too. Every single particular that you gave, Senator Watt, in criticism of the Turnbull government was wrong. Maybe that is the answer to why the Labor Party does not want to engage in an honest debate about public policy—because you cannot even address the issues without engaging in either mistaken or deliberate falsehoods. Senator Watt, as a result of the Turnbull government's economic leadership, Australia now has a growth rate of 3.3 per cent—one of the highest rates of growth in the world. It is a rate of growth higher than that of any G7 nation.

"Ketter, Sen Christopher",ALP,2016-09-14,"



Senator KETTER
 (Queensland) (15:06):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Attorney-General (Senator Brandis) to questions without notice asked by Opposition senators today.


It is quite clear, following question time today, that we are seeing a government bereft of any evidence of economic achievements to speak of. The responses from Senator Brandis today illustrated the discomfort of this government when the microscope is held to them in terms of what they have actually achieved over the 12 months.


We have sought to focus on the measure of success which this Prime Minister imposed upon himself. Twelve months ago, prior to going into the party room to argue for the deposing of the former Prime Minister, Mr Turnbull said:


It is clear enough that the government is not successful in providing the economic leadership that we need … Ultimately, the Prime Minister has not been capable of providing the economic leadership our nation needs. He has not been capable of providing the economic confidence that business needs.


If we look at the objective facts that are before us now, we see that full-time employment is down by 64,000 since the beginning of this year. We see that we have the lowest wage growth in 20 years. That is a stark fact which is not to the credit of this government. We see debt and deficit ballooning. We see that our AAA credit rating, a very precious asset, is under threat at the moment. When we are talking about economic confidence and the future, we need to see how that translates. What is the evidence for that? I will talk a bit further about this. If there is business confidence, as Senator Brandis indicated, one would expect to see business investment rising. What we see is the very opposite—total investment has fallen by 10 per cent since September 2015.


I was particularly disappointed with some of the responses by Senator Brandis today when he referred to the fact that the opposition, in his words, was seeking to play 'trivial political games'. It is not trivial or political to seek to hold the government to account for what it has done over the past 12 months. That is precisely what opposition senators have sought to do during the course of today's question time. When it comes to having a responsible approach, the opposition cannot be accused of being irresponsible, because over the past 24 to 48 hours we have seen the culmination of work done by the shadow Treasurer's office and Senator Cormann's office in coming up with an agreed arrangement in respect of the omnibus bill which we will be looking at later. That outcome has seen a greater amount of budget repair than what was originally proposed by the government, is fairer for more vulnerable Australians and addresses the issue of jobs for the future with the preservation of funding for ARENA.


When it comes to business confidence, contrary to what Senator Brandis indicated in his responses, one looks at Roy Morgan Research. We find that in August business confidence fell by 7.5 points—6½ per cent—to 108.6. It is now at its lowest since Mr Turnbull became Prime Minister almost exactly a year ago. The CEO of Roy Morgan Research, Michele Levine, says that 'in early September the LNP became the first Australian government to lose votes on the floor of the House of Representatives in over 50 years'. This is having an impact on confidence. We see that various indices fell in August and now only 48.5 per cent of Australian businesses, which is down 5.8 percentage points, believe that the next 12 months will be a good time to invest in growing the business. That is the lowest this indicator has been for some years. In addition, only a bare majority of Australian businesses, 52.7 per cent, now expect good times for the Australian economy over the next five years. This is a new record low for this indicator.


There is one area where this government has performed at an A+ level in my view, and that is in defending the banks from a royal commission. There has been ducking and weaving on this, and it is greatly disappointing to me, as a former member of the inquiry that looked into the performance of the banks, that this government refuses to show leadership in this area. This is an area where the victims of banking malpractice need to be vindicated. (Time expired)

"Back, Sen Chris",LP,2016-09-14,"



Senator BACK
 (Western Australia) (15:11):  I am delighted to support the wonderful comments of the Attorney-General in responding to the questions from the opposition today. I was thinking to myself: is there a PFZ going on over the other side—a policy free zone? I hope it was not specifically Queensland, but it seemed to be mainly Queensland Senate colleagues. I can only reflect, as my good colleague, Senator Reynolds, would do, on what is happening in our own home state of Western Australia at the moment. Rio Tinto, in the month of June, shipped 42 million tonnes of iron ore out of Port Hedland. That is better than a million tonnes per day. We see mining exploration in Western Australia absolutely starting to lift again, not only domestically but also from an export point of view.


I have been in the United States and Europe during this year, and if anyone thinks things are bad around the world, they are the two Western countries where we see Britain has exited Europe, we see the EU in turmoil, we see Russia in turmoil and we see that most EU countries are probably in recession. We heard the Attorney-General responding to the questions with statistics like these: the economy growing 3.3 per cent. How many countries around the world would dream of that sort of activity? Of course, that is in contrast to less than two per cent during the Labor years. Let me remind the chamber that that was when there was a mining boom. That was when iron ore prices were $150 per tonne. That was when the price of oil was $150 to $160 per barrel. They are now down to $45 and less. This is what Australia is achieving. The other interesting thing for you all to reflect on is that this government, in the budget before us at the moment, wants to further reduce the company tax for small companies with up to $10 million of turnover. And who are the biggest employers in this country? Not government, not the big businesses: it is the engine room, the room that the other crowd over there know nothing about—small business.


Let me reflect on the Attorney-General's figures in the response that he gave to the Labor senators. In 2013, Labor's last year in government, there were 86,000 lousy new jobs, but in this year just finished, under the coalition government, there are 220,000 new jobs—almost three times as many. What the Attorney did not say, because of his modesty, was that the overwhelming proportion of those jobs have gone to women. So we now see an almost 60 per cent increase in the proportion of jobs for women.


Let me talk a little about that wages growth of 2.1 per cent that the Attorney-General mentioned in response to Senator Ketter's question. As the Attorney said—and I know this to be a fact; I have been in Texas and Louisiana recently—at least one member of every family in the city of Lafayette, Louisiana, is out of work, and in many cases both of them are out of work because of the downturn in the economy. But we have wages growth that is higher than in the United States, higher than in Europe and higher—I think the Attorney-General said—than the OECD average. What an enviable reputation we have in this country, despite the black clouds over the world economy about which I speak so often in this place. And the opposition is to be complimented if indeed there is going to be agreement on the omnibus bill that will allow us to get this budget on the road to recovery.


But I remind those here in the chamber that it was in 2013, leading up to that election, that our opponents said that if they won the election they would bring in $5 billion of savings. We said, 'Yes; if you are in government, we will support them.' We won the 2013 election. We brought those savings into this place no fewer than three times. But what happened to the $5 billion of Labor savings on every one of those occasions? Three times they opposed their own savings. So I will not hear lectures from Senator Ketter; or from Senator Watt, who I have not met before; or indeed from Senator Gallagher, the new Manager of Opposition Business; or from Senator Cameron. I will not be lectured by them. 


Let me finish on Senator Cameron in particular, who tried to criticise the Attorney-General about the cash rate being at 1½ per cent and it being low. Let me remind you all that when Labor came into government the cash rate was 7.6 per cent—and what happened? Fortunately, Mr Stevens, in trying to control Labor's profligate spending, had the capacity to get it down from 7½ to three per cent, when other countries around the world were already down at zero or one per cent. I congratulate the Attorney-General and our government on our achievements.

"Bilyk, Sen Catryna",ALP,2016-09-14,"



Senator BILYK
 (Tasmania—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (15:16):  I too rise to take note of and respond to the bizarre answers that we keep getting. It is interesting, isn't it? Twelve months—allegedly a celebration—but what a year the government has had! What a year!




Senator Reynolds:
  Achievement after achievement.




Senator BILYK:
  Well, if you could stand up and list those achievements, I would be very surprised. Once again, Senator Brandis gave extremely disappointing answers to all our questions today regarding the Turnbull government's achievements, probably because there are not many achievements for him to mention—although I will point out one later on in my contribution.


But he is not alone, of course, in being unable to explain any real achievements of this government. He is joining other senior Liberal figures like Peta Credlin and Jeff Kennett. Then we have the members of the media, people that are normally so supportive of the government, like Piers Akerman, who said:


Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull may well be the most over-qualified underachiever ever to occupy the Lodge. 


Well, that is a good sign of the good year that the government has had, isn't it!


We have seen, as I said, a year of failure from Mr Turnbull and his underachieving government. No wonder Mr Joyce is poised, ready to roll him. And didn't Senator Nash let the cat out of the bag today when she started talking about the Joyce-Turnbull government? Absolutely. So we will be watching that to see what happens.


This is a government in chaos. It is dysfunctional. It is not working. It is not able to work together. There are so many divisions within its party room and within its party that it is not funny. It has been not working for so long that in Tasmania it lost three out of five seats. It lost three seats! The 'three amigos' were categorically kicked out and told 'go away', and that is because this government has failed to achieve any successes—certainly from the Tasmanian people's point of view—in any way, shape or form.


There seems to be a continuous struggle within the Turnbull government, and that means that they are failing to address any of the needs of the people of Australia. It has been a year of huge disappointment. We have had the deficit and net debt both continue to balloon on this Prime Minister's watch. Mr Turnbull came to government, if you remember, claiming that he was going to deliver economic leadership. Well, that has not happened. But, also, his big claim was that he was going to lead and unite his party. Well, we are still waiting to see that happen. He has failed spectacularly.




Senator Brandis:
  We won the election. That is a good start.




Senator BILYK:
  Only just. He was going to lead us into the new era. He was going to have this huge mandate. But it has not happened. He has compounded the coalition's abysmal fiscal record, which has seen the deficit triple, net debt blow out by well over $100 billion and the AAA credit rating put at risk. When it comes to the budget, this government stumbles from one stuff-up to the next, to be quite frank.


The government's omnibus savings bill was a shambles even before Labor did the sums and found an embarrassing $107 million black hole and came up with fairer ways to save money. The government's superannuation policy has been shredded by its backbench, highlighting the disunity and dysfunction within its ranks. The Prime Minister lectures about the moral responsibility of budget repair, but at the same time he wants to gift a $50 billion tax cut to big business, when that money could go to schools and education and hospitals.


Mr Turnbull and his government have shown that they do not have any idea how to fix the budget in a fair way. Labor has led on this debate and will continue to provide the economic leadership the Prime Minister has proven so incapable of.


The Prime Minister keeps raising issues, but then he fails to follow through on them. He wears the suit, he talks the talk but he does not walk the walk. He is really unable to walk the walk. He is someone that is scared of his own shadow—or of the shadows that stalk him, just waiting to pull off another coup.


We had the Prime Minister's move to hike the GST, a move that he dumped at the first sign of trouble—although I am sure he would raise it again, should an opportunity arise and should he get any control of his party room, which we do not hold out much hope of him doing. But there is one thing that Mr Turnbull has achieved. His achievement is he has helped people forget how bad Mr Abbott was. (Time expired)

Senator REYNOLDS
 (Western Australia) (15:21):  I too rise in very strong support of the Attorney-General and his responses to what I have to say were probably the worst questions I have heard from the Labor Party—and that is saying something—in their desperate attempt to find absolutely anything they can to try and criticise this government about. Again, we have just heard from Senator Bilyk half-truths and complete, bold-faced lies about the government's record.


Now, after the last six years in government, I am not surprised that those opposite really cannot recognise what success in government policy looks like, because it was a complete and utter failure of government policy and implementation. All they were good at was raising more money, spending the money that we had, and leaving a legacy of intergenerational debt. 


So, if those opposite really have not got any idea what good policy and good policy achievement and implementation looks like—if you slept through the last three years in this chamber and all the legislation that has gone through, and the stuff that you have blocked—you can either google some of it or I will just give you some idea of what we on this side think good government policy looks like. 


First of all, in the last 12 months alone, 220,000 new jobs were created in this country and around about 60 per cent of those were women. You might not like that fact but it is great for this country. On this side, new jobs are absolutely a success. Consumer confidence—



Senator Bilyk interjecting—




Senator REYNOLDS:
  If you do not recognise success, let's have a look at others in the community and other indices that clearly do recognise success. For example, consumer confidence is eight per cent higher than in September last year. Exports rose 1.3 per cent, to be nearly 10 per cent higher over the last 12 months. In fact, exports are now the strongest in 16 years in this nation. That is good news and that is success. What else have we got? Household consumption is up 2.9 per cent, which is the same time as last year. Housing dwelling investments are up 8.3 per cent over the past year. Business conditions and business confidence is up seven points, which is well over the long-term average. Business confidence is back to the long-run average of plus-six points. And, as the Attorney rightly pointed out, our real GDP is 3.3 per cent higher than 12 months ago. 


Growth is faster than every G7 country.



Senator Bilyk interjecting—




Senator REYNOLDS:
  You might hate it and you might sit there and argue—as you did in some of your questions—about semantics, but it does not change that real GDP, which is something most other nations, and particularly most OECD nations, can only dream of at the moment. So, for me and for people on this side of politics, that is what success looks like. It looks like implementing policies that grow the economy and that actually create new jobs.


So what else has this government done that those opposite seem to be blind to over the last 12 months and in fact the last three years? We have created an innovation and science agenda to help create the jobs of the future, and clearly that is already working. That is absolutely—



Senator Bilyk interjecting—




Senator REYNOLDS:
  Senator Bilyk, just come to Western Australia and see the new innovation and the new industries that we are creating. That means jobs, and more money for states like Tasmania, which seems to think that it needs much more share of the GST than we do—and when we generate the money. So come to Western Australia and see what the new Defence policy, the Defence white paper and the Defence industry program are delivering for Australia. Those on the opposite side built not a single ship in six years. You did not commission a single domestic-built ship. We are now completely rebuilding our fleet, and we are doing so many other things for Defence industry. 


Again, Senator Bilyk, if you want to see what actual hard work looks like in innovation and industry, take it back to Tasmania, come to Western Australia and see what we are doing. That is great news. 



Senator Bilyk interjecting—




Senator REYNOLDS:
  We—unlike you, who put over 2,000 children into detention, under your border protection policies—have released every single one of them. Under you, 1,200-plus or more people died at sea. Under us, it has stopped, and not a single person is dying anymore at sea; 50,000 people flooded our borders illegally, not by boat—no more, Senator Bilyk. 


We have also signed the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement, which is already showing great results in increasing trade, which means more money and more jobs for Australians all around the country. That is success. (Time expired)

Senator WATT
 (Queensland) (15:26):  One of my favourite TV shows of all time—and I suspect I am not alone—is the American show Seinfeld. And of course one of the most famous Seinfeld episodes is the story about nothing. Unfortunately, after 12 months it has become very clear that the Australian people have something very much in common with that episode of Seinfeld, because what we have now is a government that is about nothing. 


It has been 12 months since Malcolm Turnbull took control of the coalition, ousted Tony Abbott, promised the world, and it has been 12 months of nada, nothing, zilch. This government has achieved—



Senator Bilyk interjecting—




Senator WATT:
  I take the interjection. Lots of 'yabber, yabber, yabber' but no actual real action to do anything. This government has achieved so little that, just this week in parliament, coalition senators were left with no legislation to debate and nothing to say. We had this embarrassing series of coalition senators on their feet, jabbering on about rubbish, rather than actually having anything substantial to offer the Australian people. 


This is not really a surprise, because, as I said, this government has had 12 months to do something—to do anything. It has done nothing, not one single achievement. Some may say that I am just launching a partisan attack as a Labor senator. But of course there are many Liberals who agree with that assessment of this government. 


When Andrew Bolt asked Liberal and former Premier of Victoria Jeff Kennett to name just one achievement of the 12-month Turnbull Prime Ministership, Mr Kennett was stumped. Bolt went on to say: 'Can you name one? And I'm not asking it as a trick question. Can you name one?' Kennett replied, 'I want him desperately to succeed'. 'I know. But can you name one?' Bolt persisted. 'No, not at the moment,' Kennett said. And of course that view of this government has been backed in by other Liberals, including the former Prime Minister's chief of staff Peta Credlin. 


Yesterday when I made my first speech to this parliament, I talked about the fact that probably my highest priority was working towards greater economic security, particularly for Queenslanders, and 12 months ago the Prime Minister offered a lot in this regard. He said:


In terms of talking about the economy, talking about business, a key element is confidence and you build confidence by explaining as I said earlier, explaining what the problem is, making sure people understand it and then setting out the options for dealing with it.


Let's explain, then, just what the problem is under this government. Let's talk about what is happening to workers in this country and in my home state.


Full-time job numbers have fallen under this government—the most recent statistics show that. Wages growth is the lowest on record. Senator Brandis very much enjoyed reeling off statistic after statistic in question time, which he claimed demonstrated how well this government is doing. The one that he missed out, the one that he omitted to mention, was wages growth—and it is no real surprise, because wages growth is at its lowest on record. That is what actually really matters to people, the money in their pockets, and this government has failed. It has not achieved anything in terms of wages growth. Under this government, unemployment continues to be at crisis levels in many parts of Queensland. The Prime Minister can explain this away all that he wants, but Australian workers know that all of these statistics mean less money in their pockets, less secure work and more unemployment.


What kind of confidence can workers have in this government to deliver jobs when this government has no plan for jobs, particularly in Queensland? One of Queensland's most important industries, in terms of both dollars brought in and employment, is tourism, yet this government has no plan for tourism after 12 months. It has nothing to say about the future of tourism. No plan for tourism means no plan for tourism in Queensland, and that means no plan for the Queensland economy: no plan to boost tourism on the Great Barrier Reef, no plan to boost tourism in Central Queensland and no plan for tourism in Queensland's south-east corner. Even in the Gold Coast, one of Australia's tourism capitals, is left out again, despite our having a tourism minister from the Gold Coast.


This government has no plan for Northern Australia. Tony Abbott established the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility, but what has this government actually done? What have they delivered for Northern Australia? Not one cent has been spent from that fund, despite it having been up and running for some time now.


This government has no plan to tackle the big banks. There will be no royal commission into banks for Queensland farmers, despite lots of threats having been made before the election by various Queensland LNP members.


This is a government that has failed to turn up. This is a government that has failed to achieve anything in 12 months, and everything the Prime Minister believes in, everything he does try to achieve, is blocked by his extreme right-wing. This government has failed. (Time expired)

There was no assistance under Labor in 2009, when farm gate milk prices were lower. The ACCC is currently investigating the farm gate milk-pricing decisions of Murray Goulburn and Fonterra.

  We do not need an inquiry established every time Senator Whish-Wilson reads an article or meets a stakeholder. The government takes advice from leading Australian and global scientific institutions, including the Bureau of Meteorology and CSIRO, on the impacts of climate change, including on the marine environment, fisheries and recreational users. Australia has some of the most sustainably managed, low impact fisheries in the world, underpinned by world-class scientific research. A well-managed fisheries system ensures a more resilient marine environment in the face of climate change. Australia's climate change policies are strong and in place and we are playing our part internationally by signing the Paris agreement and commencing domestic ratification.

  I was not planning to make a short statement, but given that that was a very personal response by the government I will respond. Mr President, off the coast of Tasmania, where we are both from, we have seen unprecedented warming of waters and we have seen severe damage to our aquaculture industry, to scallops, to abalone and to the oyster industry, not to mention the damage to some of the beautiful, ancient kelp forests. Right around the country we are seeing the ocean go haywire from warming waters. We are seeing marine protected area protections that the Labor Party brought in being wound back, especially in the Coral Sea, very close to an area where we are seeing unprecedented bleaching of the Great Barrier Reef. The government clearly have something to hide. They do not want an inquiry into this. I would say to the One Nation senators and others here who do not believe in climate change that this is a good opportunity to come along and ask hard questions to the experts. This is an inquiry we need to have. The ocean is being ignored in the climate change debate. It is a great opportunity— (Time expired)

The PRESIDENT:  Leave is granted for one minute.




Senator McGRATH:
  We do not need an inquiry established every time Senator Whish-Wilson reads an article or meets a stakeholder. The government takes advice from leading Australian and global scientific institutions, including the Bureau of Meteorology and CSIRO, on the impacts of climate change, including on the marine environment, fisheries and recreational users. Australia has some of the most sustainably managed, low impact fisheries in the world, underpinned by world-class scientific research. A well-managed fisheries system ensures a more resilient marine environment in the face of climate change. Australia's climate change policies are strong and in place and we are playing our part internationally by signing the Paris agreement and commencing domestic ratification. The government will be happy to facilitate a briefing for Senator Whish-Wilson by relevant officials to canvass these issues, rather than tie up hundreds of hours of resources through an inquiry.

Senator WHISH-WILSON:
  I was not planning to make a short statement, but given that that was a very personal response by the government I will respond. Mr President, off the coast of Tasmania, where we are both from, we have seen unprecedented warming of waters and we have seen severe damage to our aquaculture industry, to scallops, to abalone and to the oyster industry, not to mention the damage to some of the beautiful, ancient kelp forests. Right around the country we are seeing the ocean go haywire from warming waters. We are seeing marine protected area protections that the Labor Party brought in being wound back, especially in the Coral Sea, very close to an area where we are seeing unprecedented bleaching of the Great Barrier Reef. The government clearly have something to hide. They do not want an inquiry into this. I would say to the One Nation senators and others here who do not believe in climate change that this is a good opportunity to come along and ask hard questions to the experts. This is an inquiry we need to have. The ocean is being ignored in the climate change debate. It is a great opportunity— (Time expired)

The PRESIDENT:  Leave is granted for one minute, Senator McGrath.




Senator McGRATH:
  The government is committed to ensuring redress is provided for survivors of institutional child sexual abuse by the responsible institutions. Survivors have waited for many years for the justice so wrongly denied them by their abusers. The royal commission expressly acknowledged that its preferred option for delivering that justice, a single national scheme, might not be achievable in the time frame acceptable to survivors or indeed to all Australians who have been outraged by the heinous abuse inflicted on children. Discussions which the Commonwealth has led with states and territories have shown that national consistency can only be achieved sufficiently swiftly through a nationally consistent approach. This aligns with the commission's alternative recommendation. The Commonwealth will therefore continue to work towards agreement on a nationally consistent approach to redress.

"Leyonhjelm, Sen David",LDP,2016-09-14,"



Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (16:04):  As chair of the nanny state inquiry in the previous parliament, and as somebody who despises government restrictions on individual liberties, I note the recommendations by Justice Callinan to relax some of the draconian lockout laws in Sydney. I say I 'note' the recommendations because 'welcome' would be too strong a word. Even if the Callinan recommendations are adopted in full, Kings Cross will never be the same.


Easing last-drinks restrictions by half an hour will not return Kings Cross to its former glory. Talking about late night entertainment at the Cross without alcohol will not make much difference either. It is already allowed. Inviting international visitors to choose between Fanta and Passiona while watching bands in our premier red-light district will make us a laughing stock. And Callinan's recommendations will not return the hundreds of jobs to young people who lost them in the hospitality, entertainment and tourism industries either.


It is pathetic to see people who have forgotten the last time they ever had a good time endorsing lockout laws—as if there is an exact time in the evening when revelry must cease before everyone turns into a pumpkin. It makes no sense. Why is it that Sydneysiders cannot be trusted to go out after 1.30 am? Is there something in the water that means Melburnians can choose when and where to go late at night, but not Sydney people? And why can Sydney people be trusted to visit Melbourne and stay out late, but not vice versa? Are Sydney lockout laws a reflection of Sydney police not doing their job properly, and Sydney doctors forgetting they chose a vocation involving surgery in a hospital rather than preaching in a pulpit?


Or does all of this have more to do with that creeping madness where governments believe that they must act as our de facto parents?


Sydney used to be—and should still be—Australia's most vibrant city. It has a glorious history of naughtiness that dates back to when the convicts were first unloaded onto the shores of Port Jackson in 1788. These events were first frowned upon in the journal of the First Fleet surgeon, Arthur Bowes Smyth, who said it was beyond his 'abilities to give a just description of the scene of debauchery and riot that ensued'. He appears to be a worthy predecessor of the doctors' associations. What's the difference between a doctor and God? God doesn't think he's a doctor.


Recently one of these doctors' unions successfully convinced the Northern Territory government to reimpose speed limits on remote roads. This is despite the fact that there is no case to impose limits in the Territory, where road fatalities have been falling for years. Chalk that up as another victory for the modern equivalents of Dr Bowes Smyth—those people who constantly worry about the fact that everybody but them is having a good time. As for the Darlinghurst Resident Action Group, who have been prominent in the media today, I have one thing to say: put a sock in it, or go and live somewhere else. Moving to Kings Cross and complaining about the night-life is like coming to Parliament House and complaining about boring speeches, or to Port Kembla and complaining about smokestacks, or to Mount Panorama and complaining about car races.


To the doctors' unions, I say: I won't pretend to be an expert about treating bunions or indigestion if you stop pretending to be experts about nights out in Kings Cross or speed limits in the Northern Territory. The doctors' and residents' associations have a right to their opinions on these matters, similar to the rights of anyone else . But there must be a place in Sydney where people can have a long night out, and as long as they are not impinging on anyone else we should leave them alone. I welcome any moves to relax current restrictions in Kings Cross, but I caution anyone against thinking that the Callinan recommendations will revive the night-life of Sydney. The control freaks are still very much in charge of New South Wales. They shut down the greyhound industry. They are telling us when we can have a drink in Kings Cross and when we can go home.


Finally, let me reiterate some comments from the interim report on this matter from the Senate Economics References Committee. The Sydney lockout laws did lead to a net reduction in reports of alcohol fuelled violence, with reductions in the lockout areas exceeding increases in violence elsewhere. However, the reductions in reported violence were outstripped by the reduction in foot traffic. Reduced reports of violence are to be expected when you convert an entertainment district to a ghost town. Businesses have closed down, jobs have gone and the cultural heritage and bustle of the district has been lost. Some local residents have cheered this change, and perhaps there are more of them than the hospitality workers and musicians who have lost their jobs. But the day we justify laws because of a crude 'greatest good for the greatest number' is the day we lose our moral compass. The idea that we deal with the problem behaviour of individuals by imposing collective punishment is beneath us. The earlier we return to a focus on individuals the better we will be as a society.

"Paterson, Sen James",LP,2016-09-14,"



Senator PATERSON
 (Victoria) (16:10):  I will begin by thanking Senator Leyonhjelm for putting this important issue—restrictions on the sale and service of alcohol at licensed venues—on the Senate's agenda today. It is one that I welcome the opportunity to discuss, and it is one on which I recognise the senator's very principled advocacy for many years—in particular, in the most recent parliament, the excellent initiative of a Senate inquiry into personal choice and the way in which modern governments tend to favour paternalism as a way of limiting it. So, I thank Senator Leyonhjelm for putting this on the record and I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate today.


Although I am a Liberal, I have to say that I have great concerns about the New South Wales government's lockout policies. Of course, the federal government does not have the capacity to regulate trading hours or liquor licensing, and nor should we. But that does not stop us from having a healthy interest in the night-time economy of Australia and the freedoms of our constituents to enjoy that night-time economy. I am proud to be speaking on this topic as a Victorian Liberal, as we opposed and successfully defeated the then Victorian Labor government's disastrous 2008 trial of a 2 am lockout in the Melbourne CBD. One notable campaigner against the lockout was our new colleague in the lower house, the member for Goldstein, Tim Wilson, from his position then at the Institute of Public Affairs. That campaign culminated in a public protest attended by 10,000 Victorians in May 2008. That was the first and will probably be the last time the member for Goldstein will be spotted at the head of a protest rally with a megaphone.


The Melbourne 2 am lockout was rightly abandoned after it spectacularly failed during a three-month trial. It did nothing to prevent late-night violence in the Melbourne CBD and it hurt many innocent law-abiding Victorians. Opponents of lockouts have made very good points about why that lockout would not succeed, and they were proven right. Firstly, they argued that it was wrong to punish all citizens for the crimes of a few. The vast majority of young or even old people who like to go out in the city late at night do so completely lawfully and without harming anyone else. A small percentage of offenders do cause problems, and they deserve to be firmly dealt with for doing so. But collective punishment of all people is not right.


Secondly, law-abiding businesses were and will be hurt by these types of laws. Some licensed venues may not have complied with the conditions of their licence. They may have even served intoxicated patrons more drinks. But that is a problem of enforcement of an existing law. Failure to enforce a law does not justify shutting down all legitimate businesses, most of which do comply with the law. Thirdly, geographic lockout zones typically just push the activity—and often also the violence—elsewhere. Fourthly, exemptions were, and typically are, unfairly granted to some areas and some businesses over others. I do not blame these businesses for seeking an exemption; any business in its right mind would not want to be bound by these laws. But it is not right for some to suffer while others prosper under these laws.


Finally, the international reputation of our cities suffers when we fail to provide a decent, safe late-night entertainment offering to tourists and international visitors. The great cities of the world are, in part, defined by their round-the-clock entertainment and service. Unless we actually want Australia to be a sleepy backwater, we cannot keep these sorts of absurd restrictions. 


I am sorry that the New South Wales government evidently has not learned from the failure of the Victorian government in this area. They have persisted with their own lockouts, and we are now very clearly seeing again the flaws of this approach. 


One person who deserves a great deal of credit for powerfully demonstrating the failings of this policy is a Sydney businessman, Matt Barrie.    He wrote a searing critique of the policy, and it is well worth reading for all policymakers. Published on LinkedIn in February 2016, Mr Barrie wrote:


A special little person has decided that there is a certain time at night when we are all allowed to go out, and there is a certain time that we are allowed into an establishment and a certain time that we are all supposed to be tucked into bed. There is a certain time we are allowed to buy some drinks, and over the course of the night the amount of drinks we are allowed to buy will change. The drinks we buy must be in a special cup made of a special material, and that special material will change over the course of the night at certain times. The cup has to be a certain size. It cannot be too big, because someone might die. Over the course of the night, this special little person will tell you what you can and cannot put into your cup because someone might die.


He goes on to point out: 


It is now illegal to buy a bottle of wine after 10pm in the City of Sydney because not a single one of us is to be trusted with any level of personal responsibility. Apparently there is an epidemic of people being bashed to death over dinner with a bottle of Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc that we have all been blissfully unaware of.


Mr Barrie is absolutely right. 


The City of Sydney itself found, in a report in September 2015, that foot traffic and, therefore, also patronage in the Kings Cross area had been smashed by the introduction of these laws. Measured at 11 pm, between 2012 and 2015, it fell by 58 per cent. Measured at l am, it fell by 84 per cent. This has had the entirely predictable result on the businesses in the area.


I will return to Mr Barrie and his very vivid description of the effect it has had on some businesses. I do not know the venues which he talks about, but I trust his judgement on what is a good and a bad late-night venue in Sydney. He writes:


Hugo's Lounge closing, which was the swankiest bar in Sydney for fifteen years and voted Australia's best nightclub five years running, was the last nail in the coffin for the area.


The venue also housed the 130-seat Hugo's Pizza, which had not just won Best Pizza Restaurant in Australia at the Australian Restaurant & Catering Awards, but was also named the World's Best Pizza in the American Pizza Challenge in New York.


 …   …   …


Down the road, Jimmy Liks, an upmarket and seductively lit Southeast Asian eatery, wine bar and cocktail bar is likewise bust. A sign hangs out the front ""Thank you Sydney for an amazing 14 year journey. NSW Lockout Laws cost good people their jobs and decimated a once great and vibrant suburb!""


Hours have been cut. Staff have been let go. Businesses have closed their doors. People's livelihoods have been destroyed. According to the Kings Cross Liquor Accord, 16 licensed venues have closed since 2014, and 35 shops in the area have also shut their doors. There has been a 40 per cent drop in revenue for Sydney live performance venues alone. 


Defenders of the law point out that violence has fallen too. As Senator Leyonhjelm and I have acknowledged, that is true. But it has fallen far less than patronage has. If we reduced foot traffic even further to nothing then of course violence would fall to nothing as well. But this does not justify the policy. Locking everyone in their homes might stop violence, but it should never be acceptable in a free and open society. 


A report for the New South Wales government which was released today by the former High Court Justice Ian Callinan recommends that the New South Wales government water down the lockout law modestly. He has proposed, for example, extending some of the times of the lockouts and a few other modifications of some of the restrictions. I think they are modest, sensible recommendations and, at the very least, the New South Wales government should take up these very modest, sensible suggestions. 


But my preference, of course, is that they go much further. This sort of nanny state, one-size-fits-all approach is wrong, and it comes at too high a cost. Instead of this nanny state approach, which unfairly punishes law-abiding citizens and businesses, we should instead deal firmly with those who are directly responsible for the violence with sufficient police resources, tough laws for offenders and punishment of rogue venues that flout the law and cause the problems. They are the ones who deserve to be punished, not law-abiding people who choose to go out and have a good night out and not law-abiding businesses who just want to employ people and prosper. They do not deserve to be punished for this. It is the individual perpetrators of these crimes who deserve to be punished. Unfortunately, that is not the approach that was taken by the New South Wales government.


I hope that this report is an opportunity for them to reconsider their policies, because it is having a terrible effect on people's lives. It has had a terrible effect already on the livelihood of these small business operators, which my party, the Liberal Party, says they—and they truly should—always stand up for. We should not be there to give any advantage to bigger businesses, more established businesses, who have the opportunity to lobby for exemptions to the law. We should be there to stand up for these small business people who want to do nothing other than run their late-night venues.

Senator KETTER
 (Queensland) (16:20):  I rise to make a contribution in respect of the matter of public importance that has been raised by Senator Leyonhjelm today. I commence my contribution by referring to the tragic death of a young Brisbane athlete, Cole Miller. He died tragically, following the delivery of a single fatal blow. He was a talented water polo player. This terrible tragedy occurred as he was walking through the Brisbane entertainment precinct in the early hours of 3 January. He was set upon by another person in what can only be considered an unprovoked attack as they walked through the mall to catch a taxi. Mr Miller died as a result of a solitary punch to the head, which caused him to fall on the ground and rendered him unconscious. He died in hospital the next day, of massive head injuries, without ever regaining consciousness. This is a matter that has been before the courts, and the tragedy here is that the person who inflicted the solitary punch on Mr Miller is alleged to have said to a group of other people that he was with at the time, 'Do you want to see something funny?' before he picked a fight with the young person.


I refer to this death because, as I said, Mr Miller, a young athlete, was involved in water polo. My own children have been involved in the sport of water polo. On the many occasions that I have attended water polo games in Brisbane I probably came across this young fellow, who tragically died as the result of a senseless act of violence.


So this issue of the restriction of the sale of alcohol is something that I feel very strongly about. I am not standing here saying that I have all the answers as to how we address this issue, but it has been a vexed issue in my home state and there have been attempts to try to protect members of the community from this terrible tragedy. I know that this has been a problem in the state of New South Wales as well.


I want to point out that, on 12 November last year, the Hon. Yvette D'Ath, the Attorney-General and Minister for Justice and Minister for Training and Skills in Queensland, introduced the Tackling Alcohol-Fuelled Violence Legislation Amendment Bill 2015 into the Queensland parliament. On 20 December last year, a committee visited Brisbane's Fortitude Valley precinct, the Roma Street police watch house and the emergency department of the Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital between midnight and 5 am.


Now, I understand and respect Senator Leyonhjelm's passion for campaigning for civil freedoms and liberty, and he has a right to his opinion. But I would say to him that, if he were to walk a day in the shoes of a surgeon, a paramedic, a nurse or a police officer, we would probably not be having this debate. We see newspaper articles and we see the cooked-up statistics from the various alcohol lobbying groups, and we are obliged to look at those. But I also note there has been inquiry by the Economics References Committee of this place, and Senator Leyonhjelm has been instrumental in that particular inquiry into this matter. I note that the Australian Medical Association made a submission to that particular inquiry. They have called on the government to do something about the effects of alcohol on our community, be they from alcohol fuelled violence or excessive alcohol consumption. It is time for something to be done.


Every single day we see kids walking through the emergency departments and being pushed into an operating theatre. I want to look at the medical specialty of my friend and Queensland Minister for State Development Dr Anthony Lynham. Before entering parliament as the member for the Brisbane seat of Stafford in 2014, Dr Lynham worked as a maxillofacial surgeon. Upon his election in July 2014, he served as shadow minister for education, innovation, science and information technology; shadow minister for primary industries and fisheries; and shadow spokesman for the public service, assisting the leader. Dr Lynham is an adjunct professor at QUT and an associate professor at the University of Queensland School of Medicine. He graduated in medicine from the University of Newcastle and completed his maxillofacial surgery training in Queensland. He is a fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh. He worked most of his medical career at the Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital and is part of a research team at Prince Charles Hospital. 


There is a very important lesson here, which he mentioned in his speech to parliament that resulted in tighter controls on the trading hours of venues serving alcohol. In the late 1990s, Queensland had one maxillofacial surgeon on the Gold Coast, two on the south side of Brisbane and four at the Royal Brisbane Hospital. We had one in Townsville and we had one in Toowoomba. Now the number of this type of surgeon has at least tripled all over Queensland and it is growing. Why? Because young people are being assaulted in our nightclub districts and our precincts, due to alcohol.


What is our solution to this problem? Do we have one? The Queensland solution is working. I would ask Senator Leyonhjelm: is his solution to simply throw ineffective measures at this problem or simply to ignore it? Do we need to throw more surgeons at the problem? Do we need more operating theatres? The new laws in Queensland are more important, more powerful than any operation that any doctor or surgeon could ever conduct. They are powerful because they prevent harm. By creating these types of laws and coupling them with the right types of education programs, we can prevent alcohol related death and injury.


I know you can speak of the economic damage these laws do to regions. But I would like to address that issue. In Newcastle, another place where these types of rules have been applied, there has been a doubling in the number of bars and restaurants, and increased employment. In Queensland, we have over 7,000 licensed venues; the new laws only affect 99 of them, or less than two per cent, and by only one to two hours—a couple of rounds of drinks. That is all these laws do, but they have the maximum effect of one-third fewer young people being harmed. The initial economic impact is small, but the gains are immense both in long-term economic growth and in a reduction in social harm. These measures are not a magic bullet. If we had a drug that could cure 30 per cent of cancers, we would use it every day. It works because of its simplicity. Reductions in trading hours give people less opportunity to preload, as they have to get to the club before it closes. These measures create a vibrant night-time economy that is safe and simply peaks earlier, and an environment that is more attractive for residents and tourists alike.


It is not about restricting our freedoms and our leisure. It is about keeping our kids and our young people safe. It is about ensuring that visitors to our great cities and regions feel safe. As a parent of four, I feel very strongly about this issue. If these small compromises in terms of our personal freedoms result in one less person being tragically killed, then I think that is a price to pay.

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2016-09-14,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (16:30):  I too rise to speak on this matter of public importance: restrictions on the sale and service of alcohol at licensed venues and their impact on crime, health and enjoyment. I want to take a bit of a different perspective here and look at where I would argue the most restrictions have been placed on alcohol use: in Aboriginal communities. This has been much debated, including, of course, the bans that were introduced along with the Northern Territory intervention. I would like to look at what role restrictions have played, their appropriateness and what else we should be doing.


If you look at what the World Health Organization has outlined around the social determinants leading to greater risk of harms from alcohol, you will see that they list wealth; education attainment—the level of education people are able to access; housing—whether people are able to access stable and affordable housing; and racism and discrimination that people experience. I would argue that if you address the systemic causes of alcohol abuse—in fact, substance abuse—you would have a much better chance of tackling alcohol harms.


I am very aware of the reality that alcohol and substance abuse can and does cause harm in our community, which is why we all work so hard to try and find solutions. The impacts of alcohol on our community do need to be addressed. I think it is an absolutely critical issue and, in fact, so did the committee in the House of Representatives. In the other place in June last year a report was tabled on an inquiry into the harmful use of alcohol in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. I would like to quote one of the key findings from the inquiry in the other place:


Alcohol is the fifth leading cause of disease among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. The burden of disease attributable to alcohol among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people is twice the level of non-Indigenous people.


This is a shocking and tragic statement to have to read out. The simple fact is that we need to be addressing the issues around alcohol abuse across Australia. Given that I am the Greens spokesperson for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander issues, including health, I thought it was particularly important—if we are talking about restrictions and what we do to address alcohol abuse—that we focus on where restrictions have been applied the most.


We have just heard, in some of the debate, about the devastating impact alcohol-related harms can have. We know alcohol can lead to increased violence, including family violence. The inquiry in the other place also heard evidence that alcohol can have an impact on the transfer of cultural knowledge between generations, and that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities bear historic burdens from colonisation, stolen wages, systemic racism and other challenges that continue to the present day. In other words, we need to be addressing those systemic issues which are related to what the World Health Organization has outlined in the social determinants of health.


This is a serious issue that we need to address, but in doing so we need to ensure that the measures are driven by the community and are for the community rather than being paternalistic, top-down interventions which only serve to disempower. My argument here would be that paternalistic, top-down approaches have been taken in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities, there being no better example than the bans that were introduced during the Northern Territory intervention. Solutions must be driven within the community, not from outside. For far too long Aboriginal communities have had policies imposed on them from the outside. As I said, we saw this during the Northern Territory intervention, and we are again seeing it with the cashless welfare card. Governments keep doing things to Aboriginal communities, rather than with them. It is interesting that Senator Leyonhjelm has introduced this MPI around restrictions yet he seems to support imposing other top-down measures on communities.


Community led solutions make a real difference. I would like to point to the example of Fitzroy Crossing in my home state of Western Australia—one that you, Mr Acting Deputy President Sterle, also know very well. With people like June Oscar and other women from that community as community leaders, they drove a campaign for alcohol restrictions that called strongly for self-managed alcohol accords. As part of that process, research was conducted into what effect these measures would have, and it showed a reduction in domestic violence, in general violence and in stress for service providers. It also showed increases in food and clothing purchases and care for children. This community pushed for accurate measurement of the alcohol measures that were put in place in that community. The researchers specifically wanted to make sure that they could measure any difference that was applied. This is a clear community led initiative and it shows that measures, such as alcohol restrictions, if the senator wants to call them restrictions, can make a difference, if they are community driven.


One of the key issues the community is focused on is the impact of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. FASD, as it is commonly known, is associated with, obviously, alcohol abuse. FASD can have a devastating impact over a person's lifetime, and we need coordinated, effective strategies to reduce the prevalence of FASD through effective prevention programs and education of mothers. I will just make a comment here that people talk about FASD in Aboriginal communities, but it is not just in Aboriginal communities; it is in communities throughout Australia. 


We need to have community led solutions, and important work has also been done in the Northern Territory, despite my criticisms of the bans when they were first introduced. There is an attempt now for a more sensitive approach. Strategies need to be targeted and culturally appropriate so that they reflect the needs and context of local communities. This works best when communities are empowered to make decisions about their own systems and, most importantly, they must be supported by the community and must empower community members to help manage the systems and ensure that they are working properly.


The point I am trying to make is that we need to consider this issue in the context of the harm we are trying to address. In this context I would argue that alcohol restriction measures do need to be put in place. They need to be community driven and focused on outcomes. We cannot ignore the fact that alcohol does cause harm in communities across Australia. Therefore it is not as simple as arguing that we should not have restrictions, but they need to be community driven and evidence based, which is why it was so important to look at whether we could achieve change through the alcohol measures that were put in place in Fitzroy community; whereas, when you look at the bans that were put in place in the Northern Territory, they did not actually address the issue of alcohol abuse. 


There were a number of people who were very disappointed when the banned drinkers register in the Northern Territory was withdrawn by the then CLP government. There was evidence that it was starting to have an impact, so we need to make sure that we have a rational, sensible debate about how we address alcohol related harm and alcohol abuse.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Sterle
):  Before I call Senator Macdonald, I would just ask visitors in the President's gallery—I know it is exciting and there is a first speech or two today, but your voices are carrying—if you could just have a little whisper, it would be greatly appreciated so we can hear the contribution of the senators. Thank you very much.

Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (16:40):  Thanks to Senator Leyonhjelm for initiating this debate on lockout laws. I must say that I agree with Senator Leyonhjelm's comments about the nanny state and the propensity, particularly of Labor governments, to try and protect people from themselves on the basis that they, as Labor Party politicians, know better about how people should act and how they should conduct themselves than people themselves do. Of course I always smile at that, because Labor Party politicians, who are always trying to introduce these laws to regulate the habits and actions of others, usually come from a very limited background with not a lot of understanding of real life—that is, real life outside the union movement or the ALP political party. So I agree with Senator Leyonhjelm that we should be encouraging people to be responsible for their own actions. They should be able to be self-reliant and be helped to understand those responsibilities that they, as young adults—and older adults, I might say—would be expected to abide by. 


In this debate, you have heard from my colleague Senator Paterson, who is much closer in age to that cohort of our society who is vitally interested in these lockout laws in the various states. You should take notice of what Senator Paterson has said. Of course his comments about supporting small business as opposed to big business—again, part of the coalition's philosophy these days—seems to be contrary to the Labor Party's philosophy, which seems to be more interested in supporting big business and those very wealthy people who run casinos around the country. 


Having confessed to my limited personal knowledge of the lockout laws, I say that I am very close to the Young Liberal National Party of Queensland and I interact often with those young people. I employ some of them, and you can be assured that I understand this particular issue from talking to them. 


Others have spoken about other states—although Senator Ketter spoke about my home state of Queensland—but in Queensland, the Labor Party in its wisdom has again sought to impose the view of Labor Party politicians on young people rather than helping young people to understand their own sense of responsibility and individual worth. What has happened in Queensland is that the Labor Party has introduced these new laws where you cannot serve high-alcohol drinks after midnight and, after 1 am, you can be in a club, so I am told but, once you are there at 1 am, you cannot leave and go to another club until 3 am when the whole industry is shut down. 


This never seems to worry Labor politicians, particularly in Queensland, but it is impacting very heavily on unemployment and youth unemployment in Queensland and particularly in Townsville, which has a real problem with youth unemployment, where a lot of young people are employed responsibly in the club industry. A lot of them are still going to university and they cover living costs to attend university by working at night in these pubs and clubs. 


The result of this new action by the Queensland Labor government is that there is going to be quite substantial loss of employment for young people in the Townsville region and in Cairns. I am also advised by the Cairns branch of the Young Liberal National Party of the impact that this new action of the Queensland Labor government is having on employment opportunities in the Cairns region. In fact, I am told that the changes—these new ideas and new legislation—could cost that city more than 240 jobs and $25 million in revenue.


In Townsville, the James Cook University student union has also condemned the state Labor government for these job-killing, nanny-state lockout laws. They have done that in the strongest possible terms. In a media release issued earlier this year by the student association president, Mr Edward Harridge, he said:


Many of our members work in the Hospitality industry to support their studies and face losing their jobs as a result of the proposed laws.


He went on to say:


In Townsville, the 80 licensed venues which employed more than 300 people were worried about their staff and businesses.


This is the result of action taken by the state Labor government, which really is clueless in Queensland about anything but particularly when it comes to employment creation for young people.


By contrast, the Liberal National Party of Queensland has a positive plan to address issues relating to alcohol related violence. I do not have time to go through them all, but one of the key elements of the LNP's strategy on the drug and alcohol problem at night-time amongst young people was compulsory drug and alcohol education in Queensland schools from years 7 to 12. That seems to me to be a pretty good idea. They were also going to establish 15 safe night precincts across Queensland to ensure that popular nightspots had coordinated prevention and support initiatives in place to keep patrons safe. Other elements were: a new offence of unlawful striking causing death, carrying a very severe penalty; increased penalties for other violent and antisocial offences; empowering police to issue banning orders; ensuring police have resources to have a presence and ability to respond quickly to alcohol and drug related violence; stronger and better coordinated action to ensure licensees provide safe environments and comply with the code licensing rules; and an awareness campaign, including advertising, to promote clear standards for responsible behaviour for patrons, licensees and the police.


A common-sense thought is that we should not be banning young people from having a night out. Why you would want to stay out until 5 am I cannot quite understand. It is a bit foreign to me at my age, but apparently that is what the young people like to do today. But no longer is this possible in Queensland. The evidence has already shown that this great new nanny-state regulation by the Queensland state Labor government has not made any difference to the amount of violence on the streets at night. What I would like to see is a greater police presence, not just for enforcement but for support and help.


Remember, most young people who go out for a night on the town are non-violent people. They go out to have a good time. There are one or two bad eggs. They should be addressed. Those troublemakers should be targeted by the authorities, rather than stopping everybody's enjoyment and their good times at night because of the issues of one or two who should be dealt with in other ways.


I thank Senator Leyonhjelm for raising this important issue. I make a plea on behalf of young people in Queensland that the Queensland government might reassess and re-evaluate their nanny-state proposals and try to encourage in young people the self-reliance and self-respect to look after themselves rather than introducing these silly laws which, as I say, benefit only the multinational owners of the casinos and the big establishments around Queensland. It would be good if the Labor Party could acknowledge and recognise that they have made a mistake and do something serious to address the issue, but in a way that is appropriate and does not cost the jobs of young people.

"McAllister, Sen Jenny",ALP,2016-09-14,"



Senator McALLISTER
 (New South Wales—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (16:50):  It is curious that in the contribution from Senator Macdonald—and I am not unsympathetic to aspects of it—he confined his empathy to the young people of Queensland. As it happens, almost exactly the same set of laws that Senator Macdonald has objected to so vehemently apply in the state of New South Wales, where they were implemented by the Baird Liberal government. So I think if we are to be consistent in our treatment of what is actually quite a serious issue, we probably need to examine how it applies in places other than Queensland. But I appreciate Senator Macdonald's contribution.


The lockout laws in New South Wales were put in place in 2014. They have three elements: 1.30 am lockouts; a 3 am cessation of liquor sales; and a 10 pm cap on takeaway of alcohol. Today the New South Wales government has actually released publicly former High Court Justice Ian Callinan's independent review of those liquor laws. That is very welcome. The review was very welcome. I think, two and a bit years on, it is a good time to stop and have the opportunity to think about how this particular policy response has worked and what have been its strengths and weaknesses.


I am not going to stand up in this chamber and put the simple view that these laws are good or bad, because the truth is that how we manage our public spaces, how we manage alcohol and how we balance the risks attendant with alcohol related violence with the freedoms we like to imagine might be available in our most cosmopolitan cities are complex questions. People who say they have straightforward answers are almost certainly having us on. The truth is we do have a problem with alcohol related violence in this country. Before the lockout laws, a significant percentage of assaults being recorded were alcohol fuelled—27 per cent of all assaults in Kings Cross; 22 per cent, in the CBD; 25 per cent, in the suburbs that surround the CBD; 29 per cent, in Newtown, Bondi, Coogee and Double Bay; and 23 per cent, in Pyrmont. Some of these assaults represent quite serious injury and some of them even represent lives lost. People will recall that loss of life was the impetus for the review of these laws some years ago. The liquor law review has found that the lockout laws have had an impact: they actually have helped reduce alcohol fuelled assaults.


But I do want to use my time this afternoon to think a little bit and reflect on some of the unintended consequences of these laws. I want to talk particularly about live music, because the truth is that the lockout laws have had a real and very substantial impact on the live music industry in Sydney. The report actually acknowledged this. Justice Callinan said:


I am concerned that live entertainment and those employed in it (including sound and light technicians etc) have lost opportunities of employment.


The way to deal with this, in my view, is to sit down with the stakeholders and have a sensible discussion about what we can do to protect the important contribution that is made by live music. Unfortunately, what we often get from the Baird government in New South Wales is very much a top-down approach that very infrequently involves genuine consultation with the community or genuine consultation with the economic stakeholders.


Live music is an economic issue. It is fun and I like it, but it is also an increasingly valuable part of the Australian economy. Research shows that live music spending in Australia delivers at least a three-to-one benefit-to-cost ratio. That means, for every dollar that is spent on live music in Australia, three dollars worth of benefits are returned to the wider Australian community. It was estimated that in 2014 the live music industry contributed around $15.7 billion to the Australian economy, and the lockout laws in New South Wales have taken a fair chunk out of that.


APRA/AMCOS is the industry body for live music. It released figures in February this year that set out just how much licensing revenue fell in the period from 1 February 2013 to 31 January 2015. Of venues with a live artist performance licence, all premises experienced, on average, a 40 per cent overall decline in the value of door charge receipts and a 15 per cent overall decrease in the value of venue expenditure on live artist performers. Venues with a live artist performance licence—hotels, bars and nightclubs specifically—actually experienced a 32 per cent decrease in the value of door charge receipts. Venues with a recorded music for dance use licence—you can see that the licensing laws are complex, and I have every respect for the people that navigate the system—experienced a 19 per cent decrease in attendance figures across all venues.


The consequence of this is not that these venues are just making a little bit less money. The consequence of this is that that they are shutting down and it is changing the fabric of Sydney's cultural scene. I think it is easy for people who are a little bit older, who do not go out very much, to think that this is not something that affects them. But it ignores the fact that Australian artists do not produce music in isolation; they are part of an ecosystem. Artists develop and are recognised by audiences, by labels and by their peers by playing at live music venues all throughout Australia. 


I want to tell a little story. Every so often, the White House releases President Barack Obama's Spotify playlist. The latest one has a song on it by Australian singer-songwriter Courtney Barnett, and that is a fantastic achievement. We congratulate Courtney. But Courtney and artists like her do not emerge fully formed, ready to just claim a spot on the presidential mixtape. Australian artists do their gigs in pubs and clubs and small performance spaces. That is where they start, and they grow in ability and recognition as they do so. I was reminded of this on Saturday night when I went to see Flight Facilities play—and, before people get too excited about my night-life, I will explain that they were playing with the Sydney Symphony Orchestra. It was a pretty amazing mix of families and young people listening to really wonderful Australian music. But as the Sydney based music critic Jonno Seidler wrote: 'What many people forget, or perhaps are not aware of, is that James and Hugo—the members of Flight Facilities—met each other, held a longstanding residency, developed their sound and found guest vocalists in various Sydney clubs. All of them have now shut down.' He continued:


What that really means is that if Flight Facilities had started in 2015, they'd never be able to get to the point where they sold out a 15,000 capacity venue with a live orchestra, because the only place they—


and other merging artists like them—


could train under Mike Baird's cultural policy is in their bedrooms.

The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  And you too, Senator Cormann.




Senator McALLISTER:
  I will conclude the quote: 'The music that you love cannot be divorced from the context out of which it grows. We do need live venues more than ever.'


I will wrap up now—I am conscious that we have a first speech on its way—but we do need policies to make our cities safer and more liveable. I started my remarks by explaining that I am not one-sided about this. I think we do have some genuine challenges to address about alcohol fuelled violence. But I want to say that, when we do so, we need to make sure that we do not snuff out the soundtrack to our cities. Music should have a place in our bars and in our clubs, not just on our iPhones.

Senator ROBERTS
 (Queensland) (16:59):  I thank Senator Leyonhjelm for his matter of public importance: restrictions on the sale and service of alcohol at licensed venues and their impact on crime, health and enjoyment. I echo and appreciate Senator McAllister's comments about the complexity of the circumstances and Senator Ketter's comment about the tragic deaths that we need to avoid. I also want to say that I am, yet again, not surprised that a Greens speaker is supporting a view that wants to kill jobs and control people's lives. But, in deference to Senator Pauline Hanson's presentation of her first speech, I would like to make just two comments—firstly, that police powers, if enforced, are sufficient to protect life, property and freedom; and, secondly, that these laws are leading to gross abuses of power, and we simply need to get back to enforcing the laws through appropriate judicial responses and police enforcement.

Senator RHIANNON
 (New South Wales) (18:05):  In respect of the government's response to the report of the Education and Employment References Committee on long service standards, I move:


That the Senate take note of the document.


The response from the government is highly inadequate. We really see a government that does not care about working people. We know that the nature of work is changing enormously: there are high levels of casualisation; people are moving in and out of different jobs; people may have many different careers over even a 10-year period. What we are seeing here again is the Liberal-National government looking after their constituencies. Their constituencies are big companies that want to make money, want to make profits. They do not want to have to manage the situation where people are having to change their work and should be compensated for that. Long service leave is part of that. We know that workers had to fight hard for long service leave in the first place, and here we are seeing a government, with these recommendations, wanting to limit the requirement—a real requirement of today—to bring long service leave into the 21st century.


You would have to say that this government is only interested in the profits of their coalition donors That might outrage people, but why wouldn't you do the right thing by working people on the basic standards of how their work plays out? So many people do not get the benefits of long service leave at the moment, and who does that benefit? It benefits the companies that they work for, so I find the way the government has brought this forward quite contemptuous. In some ways, it reminds me of the feudal lord on top of the hill who thinks that they can get away with treating people abominably. For a while that works, but people will organise and fight back. 


It is an issue that the Greens feel very strongly about, and I congratulate Greens state MPs around the country. Two years ago they came together to bring in a portable long service leave scheme for all employees. That is what the government should have done. That is the recommendation that the government should have backed with the report before us today. It certainly is what the Greens are working for, and I know are many in the union movement and the organised workforce. 


Because, again, to remind ourselves: after 10 years of work, people deserve a break. That is all we are talking about. Whether it is one job or many jobs, people deserve a break. We get a break. People who are working in all sorts of jobs also deserve those basic conditions. Traditionally, most Australian employees would get that break when they take long service leave after 10 years continuous work with one employer, and that is what needs to change. Such a simple, decent requirement should be in place. It should have been enacted long ago. The call has been in now for many years but, again, this government is showing where its real interests lie. 


Industry-specific, portable long service leave schemes currently operate in most states for specific classes of workers. This means that workers retain their rights to leave even when they move between different employers in the same industry. A limited form of portable long service leave also applies in many states and some federal Public Service jobs, so the move is on. It is happening. It is already in law—particularly in the public sector we are seeing that shift. Here we see the government just not wanting to know. They should be working with industry and different employers to introduce what is fair and so urgently needed. 


What happened in 2014, as I mentioned, is that my state colleagues, Greens MPs, in the various parliaments—and we have Greens MPs in Western Australia, South Australia, Victoria, New South Wales and Tasmania—came together with a commitment to deliver portable long service leave for workers in all industries. Yes, there may be some complexities in getting it organised, but that is what the law is for. Our job is to use the law—you would hope—for progressive change, change that will make life better for the majority of people, make a fairer society. 


Again, let's remember, what we are dealing with here is a report that shows how mean this government is and how they will not do the right thing. It is not some new scheme; it is just tweaking the long service leave scheme to adapt to current working conditions. The Greens are calling governments across the country to support workers in their states by modernising this basic entitlement—an entitlement that needs some modernising—and here we have the Turnbull government dragging the chain. The Liberals and Nationals are so out of touch—out of touch with a lot of their own voters for that matter. Again, their constituency is delivering for corporate Australia, and they do that in spades. 


More than 90 per cent of employment growth over the past 20 years has been in casual and contract work, where long service leave is unavailable. So, if you go down the path that the government clearly wants to take us with no changes to long service leave, fewer people will receive this benefit, because work is fundamentally changing. It is not just that people end up having many jobs; many of them, as I just said, will be in contract work, casual work and they will not receive this benefit. 


As we know, workplaces are modernising. Work is becoming intensified, and it is also very important that we address the need for work-life balance and, again, long service leave is part of achieving that. That is why it was introduced in the first place. It was not something that one day people turned up in parliament and thought: 'That's a good idea. Let's give workers long service leave.' It wasn't that employers suddenly thought: 'Let's give workers long service leave.' Another important campaign by the organised workforce and of unions struggling, campaigning and going on strike was how we won long service leave. 


But now we know the benefits of it—and I would argue that most companies would benefit from long service leave when their workforce has the opportunity to address their work-life balance; however, we have this mean government, a government that really is very short term: short term in vision, possibly short term in how long they last. We need to remember that long service leave makes it possible for workers to take that much-needed break after 10 years. I cannot emphasise this enough. We all know how important it is to have a break with our family and loved ones. Think of this place on Thursday at the end of a sitting week: people are busting to get out of the place. We all share stories of how much we are looking forward to getting home. I emphasise that to reflect on the importance of having time out of one's work. After 10 years, workers deserve it, and this government is stealing that opportunity from the workers of this country and an increasing number of the workers, as the nature of work and the nature of employment changes. 


The increasing movement between employers and the casualisation of the workforce makes portable long service leave an absolute necessity. I would say it is a necessity for the modernisation of society because, if we end up allowing our workforce to become so alienated from work because of the hardship of trying to manage, it is actually not good for business. It is not good for governments. It is not good for the wider society, because you need that cohesion, and cohesion comes with decent working conditions. 


As I said, portable long service leave already applies in a number of select industries, so it is not as though what the Greens are recommending is some incredibly radical new proposal; it is happening but far too slowly. These recommendations were to get on with it, and we are seeing the government really dragging the chain.


So reading this report was deeply disappointing. It was probably not surprising, but it was deeply disappointing. But it will be revisited. We will win this change, because the organised workforce—the unions in this country—while certainly diminished in numbers, is growing in strength. I am very confident that we will win this one day.


Question agreed to.

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (18:17):  I table a revised explanatory memorandum relating to the bill and I move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard.


Leave granted.




The speech read as follows—



This Bill contains measures totalling approximately $6 billion in savings as part of a suite of budget improvement measures. 


As a Government we inherited $240 billion in accumulated deficits and a debt of $317 billion projected to increase to $667 billion within the next ten years. 


Our gross debt is increasing by $6 billion a month or $1.4 billion per week in 2016/17, that's $72 billion for a year.


Since MYEFO 2013–14, we have implemented measures to improve the budget bottom line which has reduced projected debt by $55 billion, however our debt still stands at $430 billion. 


The interest payments on our debt total $16 billion this year, it is one of the largest line items in the budget and it is still growing. 


To arrest our debt we must restore the budget to balance. 


It is clear that a stronger budget not only supports jobs and growth, but also instils confidence as the economy transitions.


Working towards balancing the budget will help restore the buffers that protect Australia against economic shocks and uncertainties, as well as safeguard against events that could threaten our future success.


Repairing the budget means we can begin to pay down debt and reduce the fiscal burden on future generations. 


As we make crucial repairs to fix the budget, we will create headroom to further ease the tax burden and invest in new priorities. 


In order to repair the budget and arrest growth in public debt, you must get expenditure under control. 


Ratings agencies have all warned that they want to see budget measures passed or this will increase the risk of a rating downgrade. They have expressed serious doubt about whether this Parliament will be up to the task. 


This Bill is part of a concerted strategy to make immediate and tangible headway towards balancing the budget. 


Let me go through each of the measures contained in this Bill. 




Higher education 



On higher education, we are introducing a new minimum repayment threshold for all HELP debts from 1 July 2018. 


We are replacing the Higher Education Grants Index (HEGI) with the Consumer Price Index (CPI) in order to streamline and simplify indexation rates for Government programs. 


And we will remove the HECS-HELP benefit from 1 July next year.




Health 



Health is also an area of rapidly growing expenditure. 


In order to restrain this spending growth we are extending the pause on indexing the income thresholds for the Medicare Levy Surcharge and Private Health Insurance Rebate for a further three years — from 1 July 2018 to 30 June 2021.


We are abolishing the National Health Performance Authority.


A measure to improve compliance in aged care providers will amend the Aged Care Act 1997 to strengthen compliance powers and implement deregulation measures.


The Government will continue to provide record levels of investment in Medicare and hospitals, whilst targeting health expenditure to where it is needed and most effective.




Welfare



One of the most difficult challenges facing the Budget is reining in growth in welfare expenditure. Welfare makes up a third of outlays in the Budget. So the largest share of these savings measures is in welfare spending. 


We are removing the grandfathering arrangements for student payment recipients of the Student Start-up Scholarship, from 1 July 2017.


We are removing the family member exemption to the Newly Arrived Residents Waiting Period for access to social security payments and concession cards. It is important to note that the Special Benefit will still be available to all newly arrived residents in financial hardship who have suffered a substantial change of circumstances beyond their control after they have first entered Australia. 


The financial implications of this measure include a contingency to reflect higher payments of Special Benefit. It is estimated that 20 per cent of those who will no longer be exempt from the newly arrived residents waiting period will be granted a Special Benefit during the waiting period.


We will cease the Job Commitment Bonus for long-term unemployed youth.


We are introducing an interest charge on the debts of former recipients of social welfare payments who are unwilling to enter repayment arrangements.


We are bringing in Departure Prohibition Orders for people who are not in repayment arrangements for their social welfare debts, and removing the six-year limitation on debt recovery for all social welfare debt.


We will include income from Parental Leave Pay and Dad and Partner Pay when calculating income support payments for children born or adopted from 1 October this year. 


We are changing the way fringe benefits are treated under income tests for family assistance and youth income support payments.


These measures will help ensure that the Welfare system is fair and people in similar financial circumstances receive similar welfare benefits.


From January next year, new claims for Carer Allowance will not be backdated up to 12 weeks. 


We are maintaining the Higher Income Free Threshold of Family Tax Benefit Part A for a further two years to make sure family payments are targeted and sustainable.


We will align the pension means testing arrangements with residential aged care arrangements. This measure removes poorly targeted exemptions that are associated with the pensioner's former home, and are only available to pensioners who pay their aged care accommodation costs in periodic payments.


We will remove current income test exemptions for parents in employment nil-rate periods. This makes the payments system fairer and more sustainable.


We have abolished the Carbon Tax and as a result we are closing Carbon Tax compensation to new Family Tax Benefit A and B and Commonwealth Seniors Health Card holders. We also remain committed to closing Carbon Tax compensation for all new welfare payment recipients and will continue to negotiate its passage through Parliament in order to pay for the National Disability Insurance Scheme.


The Family Tax Benefit (FTB) supplement from families with income greater than $80,000 are being removed from the 2016-17 financial year and we will continue to pursue the phasing out of the FTB Part A and Part B supplements for all recipients in order to fund our Childcare Reforms.


Further savings will also be created through an agreement to no longer proceed with the 2015-16 MYEFO measure that provided an additional payment of Family Tax Benefit B to families of children under one year of age.


This Government is committed to ensuring the welfare system continues to provide a safety net for Australia's most vulnerable people and families.




Other measures



Finally, other measures include savings from the Australian Renewable Energy Agency which restores funding of $800 million over the next five years to 2021-22 relative to the government's earlier announcement; and reducing the rates of tax offsets — refundable and non-refundable — for research and development, intended to incentivise research in Australia that would not otherwise be conducted. 


The Single Touch Payroll reporting measure creates a new modern regime for reporting payroll and superannuation information to the ATO. Employers will automatically report PAYG Withholding and superannuation guarantee contributions at the time these amounts are paid through SBR-enabled software.


Under the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 2004 we are creating a single appeal path that will simplify and streamline the appeal process.




Concluding remarks



Of course, there is much more work to do. The Bill is just the first step for the Parliament, to demonstrate our collective resolve to arrest the debt. 


That's why the Government is continuing to implement the measures that improve the budget bottom line that it took to the election. 


Full details of the measures are contained in the explanatory memorandum. 


I commend the Bill to the Senate. 


Debate adjourned.


Ordered that the resumption of the debate be made an order of the day for a later hour.

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (18:18):  I move:


That the Social Security (Administration) (Trial Area—East Kimberley) Determination 2016, made under the Social Security (Administration) Act 1999, be disallowed.


The reason I am doing this—and if the government attempts to bring in a third trial I will be doing the same thing—is that we think this measure is deeply flawed. Just to be clear: this process is about disallowing the application of the so-called cashless welfare card and the so-called cashless debit card in the East Kimberley. This is the second trial site. The first one was Ceduna and started a bit earlier than the one in the East Kimberley.


I will be very clear. We have been opposing this measure from the start, the same way as we opposed income management when it was introduced into the Northern Territory via the Northern Territory intervention. The comments that we made when that bill was being debated in this place all those years ago in 2007 have, unfortunately, been proven to be correct. The Northern Territory intervention has failed. The final evaluation clearly shows that. It clearly shows the issues that we highlighted during the debate about the potential failures of a flawed system of income management where you take top-down, punitive approaches to try to achieve the social change that the then government said they were trying to achieve. We very carefully evaluated at that time in 2007 the global evidence that showed that these types of income-quarantining measures do not work. The limited evidence that was available in Australia also indicated that these sorts of punitive, top-down approaches do not work. Of course, with the intervention, there was no consultation on the way it was put in place.


We opposed the cashless welfare card legislation when it was introduced into this place, and we voted to disallow the Ceduna trial. The same sort of regulation was being put in place that we are now debating here. But every time we have sought to draw attention to the evidence that shows that this sort of approach is flawed and does not work—for example, the final evaluation of the intervention and its income management has shown that it was flawed and did not meet its objectives—the old parties have voted together to impose this or a similar cruel and harsh measure.


We oppose this policy because this approach is flawed. We do not believe it will meet its stated objectives. This is about the coalition's constant decision to take a punitive approach to serious entrenched issues. They prefer to take a punitive approach than one that is subject to full consultation, that works for the community, that is community driven and that includes wraparound support. I am not denying that there are serious issues that need to be addressed. In fact earlier today, I was talking about alcohol and substance abuse in the debate of the MPI, acknowledging that these issues are very serious. I urge the ALP to change their mind on this, to support this disallowance, to listen to the evidence, to look at where the coalition has been going with this—because this has been their consistent approach—and to actually then look at what measures will in fact help to address this sort of entrenched disadvantage and also to address substance and alcohol abuse.


I was speaking in the chamber earlier today about what are the issues that lead to alcohol and substance abuse. I talked about the measures that the World Health Organization has listed that can lead to and add to alcohol abuse, and about the social determinants of health. Wealth, housing, racism and discrimination all come in to it. These are all the sorts of social determinants of health that we should be addressing as pointed out by the World Health Organization. We have been having a debate on the social determinants of health in Australia and have been hearing the talks by Professor Marmot, who led the debate on this issue.


The scheme does not address the social determinants of health or the systemic issues. It tries to take a top-down flawed approach that cuts off people's access to cash, that determines the way they can spend their money, that puts stigma on people, that takes away people's dignity—these are all things that I have been told by community members—and it makes them feel ashamed when they go shopping with that 'white card', as people call it.


This scheme was rushed through without adequate consultation. People in communities were not properly consulted. This is very evident from the approach that we saw when the government was trying to drive this particular measure into Geraldton. The government were not going to consult. In fact they have not consulted widely. They have consulted with the people they felt they should consult with, their determination of who community leaders were. They were not actually going out to talk to the people that were going to be affected by this card. Remember this card applies to everybody on working-age income support payments in a community, not just the people that the government thinks are abusing alcohol and substances, and gambling.


This card applies to everybody in these communities. Were the government going to talk to people in the Geraldton community? No they certainly were not. I did. I held a public meeting. I fed back to this chamber what those community members felt and they overwhelmingly rejected the Healthy Welfare Card. Not only that but the combined Aboriginal organisations in Geraldton very clearly looked at the evidence, talked about it and decided they would not support a so-called trial of the cashless welfare card in Geraldton. They rejected it. The government then started to talk about Laverton and Leonora and said the communities there supported it. But there are voices there that do not support it.


In the media last night there was an article saying the government may not be going ahead with the third trial and I for one say: good because it is not a trial. When they say they are trialling it, they are not evaluating it properly or comparing it to alternative approaches so how could they call it a trial? Geraldton said no. Other communities have said no. We have heard that that is why the government came to Western Australia, to look for a second site in Western Australia, because they could not con the communities in the eastern states into doing it. Geraldton really clearly demonstrated that the government did not consult them. That is the same thing they did in the other communities; they consulted people they thought were leaders in the community but not everybody and they did not consult the people that were going to be affected.


In the same way, in the Northern Territory, they did not consult. When they rammed through income management and when they rammed through the intervention, there was no consultation there. The evaluation shows that in fact there did not prove to be any significant change in the very issues the government talked about wanting to address. In fact, the evaluation talks about entrenching some dependency on income management and on income support. They did not build people's decision making capacity on how to manage their money, which was one of the things that government said they were trying to do.


This reflects the coalition's agenda to take a punitive approach to some of the most vulnerable members of our community. Since entering into government, this coalition has constantly been subjecting the most vulnerable members of our community, many of whom are on income support, to constant cuts, to constant changes. They are trying to keep young people off income support. First they were trying for six months and now they are trying for five weeks. They are constantly trying to save money on the most vulnerable members of our community. You have to look no further than the omnibus bill that is going to be debated in this chamber in the not too distant future. They are cutting Newstart to some of the most vulnerable people in our community and trying to take DSP off people that are in psychiatric confinement. They are trying to take money from carers. They are trying to make changes around interest and debt recovery for debts that people on income support may have accumulated—and many of these debts are caused not by the people themselves but by the failures in the system. 


It is very clear that they are continuing this punitive approach with the cashless welfare card. They have made cuts to social services and income support. They brought out the disastrous Indigenous Advancement Strategy and, during the process, ripped over half a billion dollars of funding out of services and support to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. 


The government say this is a trial, that they are imposing this card for 12 months and that they will look at the impacts of the card. However, the government are also funding some additional services. Not for one minute am I rejecting the additional services that are being offered to these communities. I would go so far as to say that, if these communities had had these services in the first place, they might not be in the situations that they are in now. It makes you wonder how the government do not get that they should not be ripping over half a billion dollars out of Aboriginal funding and that these services are vital. They have obviously realised they are vital, because they are providing them in some of these trial areas. But what they are not doing is then evaluating what happens in a community when you have only got the card, so how can they tell the difference between the impact of the card and the impact of the services? You cannot. In fact, when we were debating the bill that brought this legislation in in the first place, I had this debate in the chamber with Senator Fifield. He acknowledged that that was going to be difficult. But have they looked for an alternative community to evaluate, a community that is getting just additional services, so they could make a true comparison? No, they are not doing that. 


In estimates, it has been extremely difficult to find out what method of evaluation they were going to be undertaking and who was going to be undertaking the evaluation. I understand, through contacts in communities, that some evaluation has started and that there has been a survey put out to participants, who get a voucher as a reward for participating in the survey. This is hearsay evidence being collected—not appropriate, scientific, rigorous, data driven evidence. But we have had the minister, who has been behind this whole time, talking about anecdotal evidence that crime has been reduced and that there have been reductions in poker machine use. 


I will stop for a minute here and interject on myself and remind the chamber that this is exactly what happened with the Northern Territory intervention. When it was first rolled out in the Northern Territory, you had ministers and the Prime Minister up there claiming there had been so much change in the way people bought fresh fruit and vegetables, as well as other changes. They trumpeted this as a wild success. In fact, it was not a success—as the evaluations, including the interim evaluations, clearly showed. I will also acknowledge that some of the evaluations of the place-based income management show that voluntary income management, in some situations, can be beneficial. But that, of course, is because people have chosen to make that decision themselves. 


Going back to the issues around the hearsay and anecdotal evidence, I would like to read a quote from Adelaide's The Advertiser from just last month:


But the State Government has warned that figures used by Mr Tudge should be treated with caution because they are volatile and cover towns and councils hundreds of kilometres away from Ceduna, potentially skewing results.


So the coalition minister is struggling to find facts to support this ideological agenda. From the same article in The Advertiser, the South Australia Police say that they could not provide data in relation to Ceduna specifically:


A spokesman for SAPOL said that figures were only provided at the Service Area level and the database could not provide figures for Ceduna specifically.


Again, we have data being used by the government to try to say that there have been some improvements. We do not know, because we have not yet seen the specific data for Ceduna. 


Most importantly, we need to be listening to the people in the community. That is what I have been saying all along. I have heard from members of the affected communities about this card—their concerns when it first started about not being able to pay bills, having to borrow money to pay bills, and the shame of having what some people call the white card or the Indue card. Just last week Mr Abbott, who is a strong supporter of this card, said, 'This card has no stigma. It's just like a normal Visa card.' Well, it does have stigma. Just talk to the people in Ceduna who have been telling me about that. The card is clearly different from a normal Visa card; it says 'Indue' on it. It is a different type of card, and everybody knows what that Indue card means.


Just last week—and it is of major concern—there were issues with power supply. I understand that the power outage extended into Ceduna and there were people on the cashless welfare card who were trying to buy things when the electricity ran out and they could not buy things. I heard a response implying that they should be able to get credit. That is not what I heard from community members themselves. Being able to access only 20 per cent of their payments in cash means that people have very little cash, because 20 per cent of the Newstart allowance is a very small amount of money. So they were not able to use cash. I had an email today saying that in some places the power was out for a substantial period of time, meaning that for a substantial period of time people were not able to buy things. 


In the East Kimberley trial we have heard, already, of a black market operating. There have been some reports in the media about that—in terms of the use of the card and swapping it for cash. Now, it is my turn for anecdotal evidence, and I will say it is anecdotal evidence in the same way as the government's anecdotal evidence. So I do not put a lot of credence on it. The other thing we have heard is that there has been an increase in burglaries in the East Kimberley trial area. I will say right now I do not know if that is true—in the same way the government does not know whether their claims are true. They are taking information over a wide area and are trying to say that applies to Ceduna. This is a flawed approach. We should be coming from an approach that is community driven, that is genuinely consultative, that provides those wraparound supports, that addresses the systemic disadvantage that I addressed earlier in terms of those social determinants of health.


We do not support this punitive approach that does not work from a strength-based approach. Please, support this disallowance and let us move on to measures that genuinely work—measures that do not punish people, that do not cause people to have a sense of loss of dignity and that do not stigmatise people, and that work with their strengths.

Senator GALLAGHER
 (Australian Capital Territory) (18:38):  That was briefer than I thought across the chamber. You did say you would be brief.


Labor will not be supporting this disallowance motion, either. I would just like to briefly outline our position on why we will not be supporting the disallowance motion. Labor does not believe in a blanket approach to welfare quarantining. We do not believe the debit card on welfare payment should be rolled out nationally. We understand that the vast majority of people on income support are more than capable of managing their own finances, but the level of alcohol abuse in communities like Ceduna and Kununurra cannot be ignored.


Labor supports community-driven initiatives designed to tackle alcohol abuse. That is why we offered support for the 12-month debit card trial in both Ceduna and Kununurra. We want to see the results of these trials. Trial participants include people who receive Newstart allowance, parenting payment, disability support pension and carer payments. It is important to note that new debit card arrangements are very different from income management. Unlike income management, participants on the new debit card will not receive assistance from Centrelink workers to assist in budgeting or to ensure that income support payments are directed at life's essentials, such as food, rent and clothing. The intent of the new debit card is to ensure that the majority of income support payments cannot be spent on alcohol or gambling products.


Labor does not see this card as a panacea for all the problems in these communities. We believe that the card must come accompanied by appropriate wraparound support services if it is to be successful in tackling complex, multidimensional and intergenerational social problems, which is something Labor argued successfully for in the legislation that passed the parliament last year.


As was pointed out during the debate of this legislation, Labor do support the quarantining of income support payments to ensure that money is spent in the best interests of children and families, and the most vulnerable people in the community. It means that more money will go to providing food, clothes and rent, and that less money will go to alcohol and gambling. Labor also believe that quarantining of income support payments can be a useful tool to help stabilise people's circumstances and to ease immediate financial stress. In finalising our position, Labor listened to people living in the possible trial locations and heard that they were desperate for action to assist in tackling the harm that is being caused by alcohol in their communities. Community leaders in the area have said they wanted to take part in the trial.


It is for these reasons that Labor will not be supporting this disallowance and will be waiting and watching to see how the first 12 months of this trial have gone. We will be talking with community leaders in these trial towns to get their firsthand experiences from the trials. Labor's Jenny Macklin has requested a briefing from the department to update the opposition on the progress of the trial at Ceduna and Kununurra. We look forward to that briefing and to finding out more about how the trial is progressing. As such, we will not be supporting the disallowance motion today.

The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Gallacher
):  A right of reply?




Senator SIEWERT:
  Yes—well, wrapping up the debate. The government cannot even justify why they are continuing this trial, or why this chamber should not support my motion. I realise they are trying to ram through the budget omnibus bill, but at least they could do East Kimberley the dignity of actually responding to this debate. So I am greatly disappointed about that.


Also, Senator Gallagher, with all due respect, you just repeated what the ALP said in the debate—flawed, though it be, in terms of lack of consultation. There was not adequate consultation in Ceduna or in East Kimberley, in the same way that there has not been in Geraldton. I am extremely disappointed that you continue with the myth that this is not income management and that it is not different to what happened in the Northern Territory. It is different in that it is 80 per cent, not 50 per cent, that is being quarantined. And there was budget help for people in the Northern Territory—supposedly—when the NT intervention rolled out. So that is not a difference to what this particular trial is, compared to the approach on income management.


The ALP and the government, into the future, will be held accountable by the community for their flawed approach that they are taking to income support. If the ALP think that it is not on the government's agenda, it is certainly on the agenda of Andrew Forrest, who recommended this in his report in the first place. The recommendation there was to roll it out across Australia, and coalition members continue to talk about it. So wake up. That is their agenda—to roll this card out across Australia to people on income support. When the member for Durack was trying to convince the community in Geraldton about accepting this card, she was sort of saying, 'We won't apply it to people that are on the disability support pension or carers; we'll just apply it to people on Newstart or Youth Allowance. So we'll just try to change the facts.' But the facts are in the legislation there.


It is very clear that the government want to roll this out wherever they can—or certain members. To be fair, maybe it is not all coalition members, but there are a number who do. There are a number who want to see this approach taken to supporting the most vulnerable in our community. Please say no to this flawed approach, because it is punitive and does not help people in the long term, just as the Northern Territory intervention did not help people in the long term. We still have the entrenched issues of disadvantage in the Northern Territory in the same way that we will continue to have those entrenched issues of disadvantage in the East Kimberley and in Ceduna in the long term, until we start addressing the underlying causes of disadvantage, those systemic underlying causes that have clearly been identified.

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (18:18):  I move:


That the Social Security (Administration) (Trial Area—East Kimberley) Determination 2016, made under the Social Security (Administration) Act 1999, be disallowed.


The reason I am doing this—and if the government attempts to bring in a third trial I will be doing the same thing—is that we think this measure is deeply flawed. Just to be clear: this process is about disallowing the application of the so-called cashless welfare card and the so-called cashless debit card in the East Kimberley. This is the second trial site. The first one was Ceduna and started a bit earlier than the one in the East Kimberley.


I will be very clear. We have been opposing this measure from the start, the same way as we opposed income management when it was introduced into the Northern Territory via the Northern Territory intervention. The comments that we made when that bill was being debated in this place all those years ago in 2007 have, unfortunately, been proven to be correct. The Northern Territory intervention has failed. The final evaluation clearly shows that. It clearly shows the issues that we highlighted during the debate about the potential failures of a flawed system of income management where you take top-down, punitive approaches to try to achieve the social change that the then government said they were trying to achieve. We very carefully evaluated at that time in 2007 the global evidence that showed that these types of income-quarantining measures do not work. The limited evidence that was available in Australia also indicated that these sorts of punitive, top-down approaches do not work. Of course, with the intervention, there was no consultation on the way it was put in place.


We opposed the cashless welfare card legislation when it was introduced into this place, and we voted to disallow the Ceduna trial. The same sort of regulation was being put in place that we are now debating here. But every time we have sought to draw attention to the evidence that shows that this sort of approach is flawed and does not work—for example, the final evaluation of the intervention and its income management has shown that it was flawed and did not meet its objectives—the old parties have voted together to impose this or a similar cruel and harsh measure.


We oppose this policy because this approach is flawed. We do not believe it will meet its stated objectives. This is about the coalition's constant decision to take a punitive approach to serious entrenched issues. They prefer to take a punitive approach than one that is subject to full consultation, that works for the community, that is community driven and that includes wraparound support. I am not denying that there are serious issues that need to be addressed. In fact earlier today, I was talking about alcohol and substance abuse in the debate of the MPI, acknowledging that these issues are very serious. I urge the ALP to change their mind on this, to support this disallowance, to listen to the evidence, to look at where the coalition has been going with this—because this has been their consistent approach—and to actually then look at what measures will in fact help to address this sort of entrenched disadvantage and also to address substance and alcohol abuse.


I was speaking in the chamber earlier today about what are the issues that lead to alcohol and substance abuse. I talked about the measures that the World Health Organization has listed that can lead to and add to alcohol abuse, and about the social determinants of health. Wealth, housing, racism and discrimination all come in to it. These are all the sorts of social determinants of health that we should be addressing as pointed out by the World Health Organization. We have been having a debate on the social determinants of health in Australia and have been hearing the talks by Professor Marmot, who led the debate on this issue.


The scheme does not address the social determinants of health or the systemic issues. It tries to take a top-down flawed approach that cuts off people's access to cash, that determines the way they can spend their money, that puts stigma on people, that takes away people's dignity—these are all things that I have been told by community members—and it makes them feel ashamed when they go shopping with that 'white card', as people call it.


This scheme was rushed through without adequate consultation. People in communities were not properly consulted. This is very evident from the approach that we saw when the government was trying to drive this particular measure into Geraldton. The government were not going to consult. In fact they have not consulted widely. They have consulted with the people they felt they should consult with, their determination of who community leaders were. They were not actually going out to talk to the people that were going to be affected by this card. Remember this card applies to everybody on working-age income support payments in a community, not just the people that the government thinks are abusing alcohol and substances, and gambling.


This card applies to everybody in these communities. Were the government going to talk to people in the Geraldton community? No they certainly were not. I did. I held a public meeting. I fed back to this chamber what those community members felt and they overwhelmingly rejected the Healthy Welfare Card. Not only that but the combined Aboriginal organisations in Geraldton very clearly looked at the evidence, talked about it and decided they would not support a so-called trial of the cashless welfare card in Geraldton. They rejected it. The government then started to talk about Laverton and Leonora and said the communities there supported it. But there are voices there that do not support it.


In the media last night there was an article saying the government may not be going ahead with the third trial and I for one say: good because it is not a trial. When they say they are trialling it, they are not evaluating it properly or comparing it to alternative approaches so how could they call it a trial? Geraldton said no. Other communities have said no. We have heard that that is why the government came to Western Australia, to look for a second site in Western Australia, because they could not con the communities in the eastern states into doing it. Geraldton really clearly demonstrated that the government did not consult them. That is the same thing they did in the other communities; they consulted people they thought were leaders in the community but not everybody and they did not consult the people that were going to be affected.


In the same way, in the Northern Territory, they did not consult. When they rammed through income management and when they rammed through the intervention, there was no consultation there. The evaluation shows that in fact there did not prove to be any significant change in the very issues the government talked about wanting to address. In fact, the evaluation talks about entrenching some dependency on income management and on income support. They did not build people's decision making capacity on how to manage their money, which was one of the things that government said they were trying to do.


This reflects the coalition's agenda to take a punitive approach to some of the most vulnerable members of our community. Since entering into government, this coalition has constantly been subjecting the most vulnerable members of our community, many of whom are on income support, to constant cuts, to constant changes. They are trying to keep young people off income support. First they were trying for six months and now they are trying for five weeks. They are constantly trying to save money on the most vulnerable members of our community. You have to look no further than the omnibus bill that is going to be debated in this chamber in the not too distant future. They are cutting Newstart to some of the most vulnerable people in our community and trying to take DSP off people that are in psychiatric confinement. They are trying to take money from carers. They are trying to make changes around interest and debt recovery for debts that people on income support may have accumulated—and many of these debts are caused not by the people themselves but by the failures in the system. 


It is very clear that they are continuing this punitive approach with the cashless welfare card. They have made cuts to social services and income support. They brought out the disastrous Indigenous Advancement Strategy and, during the process, ripped over half a billion dollars of funding out of services and support to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. 


The government say this is a trial, that they are imposing this card for 12 months and that they will look at the impacts of the card. However, the government are also funding some additional services. Not for one minute am I rejecting the additional services that are being offered to these communities. I would go so far as to say that, if these communities had had these services in the first place, they might not be in the situations that they are in now. It makes you wonder how the government do not get that they should not be ripping over half a billion dollars out of Aboriginal funding and that these services are vital. They have obviously realised they are vital, because they are providing them in some of these trial areas. But what they are not doing is then evaluating what happens in a community when you have only got the card, so how can they tell the difference between the impact of the card and the impact of the services? You cannot. In fact, when we were debating the bill that brought this legislation in in the first place, I had this debate in the chamber with Senator Fifield. He acknowledged that that was going to be difficult. But have they looked for an alternative community to evaluate, a community that is getting just additional services, so they could make a true comparison? No, they are not doing that. 


In estimates, it has been extremely difficult to find out what method of evaluation they were going to be undertaking and who was going to be undertaking the evaluation. I understand, through contacts in communities, that some evaluation has started and that there has been a survey put out to participants, who get a voucher as a reward for participating in the survey. This is hearsay evidence being collected—not appropriate, scientific, rigorous, data driven evidence. But we have had the minister, who has been behind this whole time, talking about anecdotal evidence that crime has been reduced and that there have been reductions in poker machine use. 


I will stop for a minute here and interject on myself and remind the chamber that this is exactly what happened with the Northern Territory intervention. When it was first rolled out in the Northern Territory, you had ministers and the Prime Minister up there claiming there had been so much change in the way people bought fresh fruit and vegetables, as well as other changes. They trumpeted this as a wild success. In fact, it was not a success—as the evaluations, including the interim evaluations, clearly showed. I will also acknowledge that some of the evaluations of the place-based income management show that voluntary income management, in some situations, can be beneficial. But that, of course, is because people have chosen to make that decision themselves. 


Going back to the issues around the hearsay and anecdotal evidence, I would like to read a quote from Adelaide's The Advertiser from just last month:


But the State Government has warned that figures used by Mr Tudge should be treated with caution because they are volatile and cover towns and councils hundreds of kilometres away from Ceduna, potentially skewing results.


So the coalition minister is struggling to find facts to support this ideological agenda. From the same article in The Advertiser, the South Australia Police say that they could not provide data in relation to Ceduna specifically:


A spokesman for SAPOL said that figures were only provided at the Service Area level and the database could not provide figures for Ceduna specifically.


Again, we have data being used by the government to try to say that there have been some improvements. We do not know, because we have not yet seen the specific data for Ceduna. 


Most importantly, we need to be listening to the people in the community. That is what I have been saying all along. I have heard from members of the affected communities about this card—their concerns when it first started about not being able to pay bills, having to borrow money to pay bills, and the shame of having what some people call the white card or the Indue card. Just last week Mr Abbott, who is a strong supporter of this card, said, 'This card has no stigma. It's just like a normal Visa card.' Well, it does have stigma. Just talk to the people in Ceduna who have been telling me about that. The card is clearly different from a normal Visa card; it says 'Indue' on it. It is a different type of card, and everybody knows what that Indue card means.


Just last week—and it is of major concern—there were issues with power supply. I understand that the power outage extended into Ceduna and there were people on the cashless welfare card who were trying to buy things when the electricity ran out and they could not buy things. I heard a response implying that they should be able to get credit. That is not what I heard from community members themselves. Being able to access only 20 per cent of their payments in cash means that people have very little cash, because 20 per cent of the Newstart allowance is a very small amount of money. So they were not able to use cash. I had an email today saying that in some places the power was out for a substantial period of time, meaning that for a substantial period of time people were not able to buy things. 


In the East Kimberley trial we have heard, already, of a black market operating. There have been some reports in the media about that—in terms of the use of the card and swapping it for cash. Now, it is my turn for anecdotal evidence, and I will say it is anecdotal evidence in the same way as the government's anecdotal evidence. So I do not put a lot of credence on it. The other thing we have heard is that there has been an increase in burglaries in the East Kimberley trial area. I will say right now I do not know if that is true—in the same way the government does not know whether their claims are true. They are taking information over a wide area and are trying to say that applies to Ceduna. This is a flawed approach. We should be coming from an approach that is community driven, that is genuinely consultative, that provides those wraparound supports, that addresses the systemic disadvantage that I addressed earlier in terms of those social determinants of health.


We do not support this punitive approach that does not work from a strength-based approach. Please, support this disallowance and let us move on to measures that genuinely work—measures that do not punish people, that do not cause people to have a sense of loss of dignity and that do not stigmatise people, and that work with their strengths.

Senator GALLAGHER
 (Australian Capital Territory) (18:38):  That was briefer than I thought across the chamber. You did say you would be brief.


Labor will not be supporting this disallowance motion, either. I would just like to briefly outline our position on why we will not be supporting the disallowance motion. Labor does not believe in a blanket approach to welfare quarantining. We do not believe the debit card on welfare payment should be rolled out nationally. We understand that the vast majority of people on income support are more than capable of managing their own finances, but the level of alcohol abuse in communities like Ceduna and Kununurra cannot be ignored.


Labor supports community-driven initiatives designed to tackle alcohol abuse. That is why we offered support for the 12-month debit card trial in both Ceduna and Kununurra. We want to see the results of these trials. Trial participants include people who receive Newstart allowance, parenting payment, disability support pension and carer payments. It is important to note that new debit card arrangements are very different from income management. Unlike income management, participants on the new debit card will not receive assistance from Centrelink workers to assist in budgeting or to ensure that income support payments are directed at life's essentials, such as food, rent and clothing. The intent of the new debit card is to ensure that the majority of income support payments cannot be spent on alcohol or gambling products.


Labor does not see this card as a panacea for all the problems in these communities. We believe that the card must come accompanied by appropriate wraparound support services if it is to be successful in tackling complex, multidimensional and intergenerational social problems, which is something Labor argued successfully for in the legislation that passed the parliament last year.


As was pointed out during the debate of this legislation, Labor do support the quarantining of income support payments to ensure that money is spent in the best interests of children and families, and the most vulnerable people in the community. It means that more money will go to providing food, clothes and rent, and that less money will go to alcohol and gambling. Labor also believe that quarantining of income support payments can be a useful tool to help stabilise people's circumstances and to ease immediate financial stress. In finalising our position, Labor listened to people living in the possible trial locations and heard that they were desperate for action to assist in tackling the harm that is being caused by alcohol in their communities. Community leaders in the area have said they wanted to take part in the trial.


It is for these reasons that Labor will not be supporting this disallowance and will be waiting and watching to see how the first 12 months of this trial have gone. We will be talking with community leaders in these trial towns to get their firsthand experiences from the trials. Labor's Jenny Macklin has requested a briefing from the department to update the opposition on the progress of the trial at Ceduna and Kununurra. We look forward to that briefing and to finding out more about how the trial is progressing. As such, we will not be supporting the disallowance motion today.

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2016-09-14,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (18:42):  It seems that nobody else wants to contribute to the debate, so I will—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Gallacher
):  A right of reply?




Senator SIEWERT:
  Yes—well, wrapping up the debate. The government cannot even justify why they are continuing this trial, or why this chamber should not support my motion. I realise they are trying to ram through the budget omnibus bill, but at least they could do East Kimberley the dignity of actually responding to this debate. So I am greatly disappointed about that.


Also, Senator Gallagher, with all due respect, you just repeated what the ALP said in the debate—flawed, though it be, in terms of lack of consultation. There was not adequate consultation in Ceduna or in East Kimberley, in the same way that there has not been in Geraldton. I am extremely disappointed that you continue with the myth that this is not income management and that it is not different to what happened in the Northern Territory. It is different in that it is 80 per cent, not 50 per cent, that is being quarantined. And there was budget help for people in the Northern Territory—supposedly—when the NT intervention rolled out. So that is not a difference to what this particular trial is, compared to the approach on income management.


The ALP and the government, into the future, will be held accountable by the community for their flawed approach that they are taking to income support. If the ALP think that it is not on the government's agenda, it is certainly on the agenda of Andrew Forrest, who recommended this in his report in the first place. The recommendation there was to roll it out across Australia, and coalition members continue to talk about it. So wake up. That is their agenda—to roll this card out across Australia to people on income support. When the member for Durack was trying to convince the community in Geraldton about accepting this card, she was sort of saying, 'We won't apply it to people that are on the disability support pension or carers; we'll just apply it to people on Newstart or Youth Allowance. So we'll just try to change the facts.' But the facts are in the legislation there.


It is very clear that the government want to roll this out wherever they can—or certain members. To be fair, maybe it is not all coalition members, but there are a number who do. There are a number who want to see this approach taken to supporting the most vulnerable in our community. Please say no to this flawed approach, because it is punitive and does not help people in the long term, just as the Northern Territory intervention did not help people in the long term. We still have the entrenched issues of disadvantage in the Northern Territory in the same way that we will continue to have those entrenched issues of disadvantage in the East Kimberley and in Ceduna in the long term, until we start addressing the underlying causes of disadvantage, those systemic underlying causes that have clearly been identified.

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (18:54):  I thank all senators who have contributed to this debate. The Excise Tariff Amendment (Tobacco) Bill 2016 is an important bill that increases the rate of excise duty on tobacco by way of four annual increases of 12.5 per cent a year. The first of these changes will occur on 1 September 2017. There is also a related bill, the Customs Tariff Amendment (Tobacco) Bill 2016, which will make the equivalent increase to customs duty on tobacco by way of four equivalent annual increases. Overall, this will raise more than $5 billion, which of course will help to get the budget back into balance in the expected trajectory as outlined in the budget. But, of course, this is also a very important public health measure because, as the evidence clearly indicates, increased taxes on tobacco are a very effective way to reduce consumption. On that basis, I commend these bills to the Senate.

 (South Australia) (18:57):  I have some questions to ask which I raised in my speech in the second reading debate. I will be as quick as I can. These issues were raised in an Australian National Audit Office report in May this year. Concerns were raised about the whole issue of the collection of the excise. The Australian National Audit Office, the Auditor-General, raised a number of concerns in relation to the rigorousness, if you like, of the collection of these taxes. These concerns were effectively expressed in the context of the Australian Taxation Office. I think these are legitimate matters of public concern.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (18:59):  I do not want to slow this down, but I very quickly want to raise an issue. The point is that, in terms of the revenue that has been reaped from tobacco excise—and I am not arguing about the revenue; cigarettes are more expensive to discourage consumption—it seems that, over the years, the amount of revenue was something like $40 billion from 2009 to 2014-15 but the amount that was spent on antismoking campaigns, according to the information I have, for that same period was about $135 million. Also, with respect to nicotine replacement therapies: it still costs people money to try and quit. Is the government considering expanding the Quitlines and the funding to education campaigns, and also to make it easier for people to quit smoking by making nicotine replacement therapies either free or even cheaper?

"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2016-09-14,"



Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (19:00):  I thank Senator Xenophon for those further questions. It is true that these bills contribute to budget repair, but it is also true that increasing the price of cigarettes via taxation has proven to be one of the most effective ways of reducing tobacco consumption and preventing the uptake of smoking. Each year smoking kills an estimated 15,000 Australians. It costs Australia about $31.5 billion in social and economic costs. While smoking rates have been decreasing, about 2.6 million Australians still smoke. We do require further action to decrease smoking rates and to consolidate the gains that have been made.


As I indicated earlier, the government recognises that quitting smoking is difficult, and there are a range of programs provided by the government, including the Quitline telephone information and counselling service for people who want to quit smoking, and subsidies for nicotine replacement therapies. The government is also addressing high smoking rates in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities through the Tackling Indigenous Smoking program. In the 2016-17 to 2017-18 years, up to $81.5 million has been allocated to achieve a variety of tobacco reduction outcomes. These bills are important pieces of legislation that contribute to the overall effort to reduce the rate of smoking in Australia and also help to repair the budget.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (19:01):  I thank the minister for his answer. But the fact is: over the period from 2009-10 to 2014-15, the revenue from tobacco excise was in the order of $40 billion but, for that same period, it seems that the federal government spent $135 million in antismoking campaigns and, for PBS benefits for smoking cessation therapy, in one year, 2014, $47.8 million. All I wish to ask is this. Has the government done any modelling on this: if nicotine replacement therapy were cheaper, or free, and if there were more money spent on tobacco cessation campaigns—out of the $40 billion that the government got in that period or the $8 billion plus it gets each year, another $50 million, $100 million or $200 million a year—what difference would that make in terms of reducing smoking rates? Has there been any modelling done of that? Some cynics have put to me that the government does not want these antismoking campaigns to be too successful because they will actually lose revenue, because if people ultimately stopped smoking then there would not be any excise, but of course there would be an enormous health and social dividend.

Senator GALLAGHER
 (Australian Capital Territory) (19:15):  I rise to speak in support of the Budget Savings (Omnibus) Bill 2016. Labor has reached agreement with the government on a package of fairer alternative savings measures relating to the omnibus bill and other savings measures that total $6.3 billion over the forward estimates. Importantly, this is more than what the government originally put forward in the omnibus bill, all the while protecting the most vulnerable in society as well as ensuring ongoing important investments in early-stage renewable projects. 


However, before I turn to the specific measures in the bill before us, I would like to remind all of us here today how critical it is to ensure that we repair the budget but do it in a fair and sustainable manner. Despite all the rhetoric and all the bluster about belt-tightening and living within our means, the facts speak for themselves. Under this government, we have seen a tripling of the deficit, net debt increasing by $100 million and the Treasurer having to admit last year that nearly all of their savings measures put forward have been spent. 


Despite all of this, we saw the breathtaking $50 billion promise to deliver tax cuts to big business, including $7 billion to the big banks, all of which will only see a growth dividend of one per cent in 20 years time. This is a $50 billion tax cut that Labor simply will not support. Labor understand how critical it is that Australia maintains its AAA credit rating—the same rating that the government has put in jeopardy. It is why we put forward $130 billion worth of budget improvements in the election, including structural reforms that would see the budget improve over the medium term. It is why the opposition leader outlined a package of reforms that would improve the budget by $80 billion and that, if adopted by the government, would have our immediate support. It is also why Labor have developed a fair alternative to the government's superannuation package, which would deliver $1.5 billion more to the budget without resorting to retrospective legislation. The offer is still there on superannuation. Come and talk and be prepared to be constructive, as we have already shown ourselves to be in our negotiations over these budget measures. 


In respect to the detail of Labor's position in regard to the detail of these bills, firstly, we agree to support 20 of the 24 measures in the original bill, as proposed by the government. Some of those measures—in particular, the minimum repayment income for HELP debts, the indexation of higher education support amounts, the removal of HECS-HELP benefit and the rates of R&D tax offset—we specifically said we would support during the election campaign. We also see that the government has now amended the bill to protect the most vulnerable such as those on Newstart, as well as securing the future of the Australian Renewable Energy Agency, also known as ARENA. 


Prior to the election, Labor made it clear that we had not been given the opportunity to properly scrutinise the government's proposal to change the energy supplement measure for new recipients or seek advice from the Department of Social Services on its effects. The clean energy supplement was introduced by the Gillard government in 2012 as part of the clean energy package. Prime Minister Tony Abbott took to the 2013 election a promise to retain the payment. The Turnbull government took the decision to break this promise in the 2016 budget by proposing to stop payment of the energy supplement to new social security recipients from 20 September 2016.


Labor's analysis of the impact of these proposed changes indicate that a single mum on Newstart would be $4.40 a week or $220 a year worse off. A pensioner couple would be around $8 a week or $550 a year worse off. Labor would not support removing $220 a year from someone who is unemployed or taking $550 a year from an old age pensioner. Let us not forget that the most vulnerable Australians are those living on Newstart. Labor have made it clear that we believe Newstart payments are already too low. Many Newstart recipients are living in poverty. As at June 2015, there were about 748,000 Australians receiving the Newstart allowance. Some 550,000 are on the full rate, meaning they have no other source of income.


It is clear that the government was proposing a cut in real terms to Newstart. Cutting the energy supplement from Newstart would have made an already unreasonable level of support even more unconscionable. Labor will now support the negotiated changes to the energy supplement measure so that all existing categories of recipients, including those on Newstart and pensions, will continue to receive this modest supplement— (Time expired)


Debate interrupted.

"Sterle, Sen Glenn",ALP,2016-09-14,"



Senator STERLE
 (Western Australia) (19:20):  In the 10 minutes that I have, I will try to be brief, but I am going to read the words of a very dear friend of mine, one John Leonard Davis—our mate JD, or the fat fella from Forrestfield. JD says:


Many Vietnam Veterans after their discharge from the army became truck drivers and worked in the transport industry. I had the honour of working with quite a few and found many had mixed emotions about their experiences, and who wouldn't they with what they had been through?


Many were only teenagers and in their early twenties. In civilian life, many were not allowed to drink in Hotels or vote as the drinking age was 21, as was the right to vote. Ironically however, even though they weren't allowed to drink or vote for the people who made decisions for them in Government, they were prepared to give their lives for their country.


I had many friends who served in Vietnam, and no greater mates could you wish for. I respect and am eternally grateful to any man or woman who has served Australia. That respect, of course, is extended to those who continue to protect us to this day. If it were not for them, Australia would not be the magnificent place it is today.


Many veterans travel to the dark side; many fortunately return. But sadly, many do not. Not only can a veteran travel there alone, on many occasions they take their families with them. However, I do not think for one moment that this happens intentionally. The dark side I am talking about has also been referred to as a journey to hell. I had a good work mate who was a veteran. However, I did not notice any signs which indicated that he was making that journey. One day, he insisted that I spend a Saturday afternoon drinking his favourite, Fosters, with him. We talked and he cried as he reminisced about personal events in Vietnam. A week later my mate was no longer with us. RIP, mate. You were a good digger and did your country proud. 


This is just one example of thousands of people who come back from war with undetected cases of post-traumatic stress. More has to be done to support those who put their lives on the line for us. I now would like to ask for your help to support a digger that has experienced the dark side that I mentioned before. It is a comfort to say that he has overcome that journey and is now enjoying life with his family. I am campaigning for my very, very good mate Bill, who has been served a great injustice, and there are many more veterans who are in the same situation as him. The following is Bill's Story:


I first met my mate Bill 60 years ago when we were six years old. We went to a school called Forest Grove, about 15 kilometres south of Margaret River. The first day we met we shook our hands and, as any six year old would do, we cut our fingers and swore to be blood brothers and best mates for the rest of our lives. Up to this day, we are still the best of mates and enjoy a beer with each other. Bill's grandfather fought on the Western Front in World War I. He rose to the rank of lieutenant colonel and received the Distinguished Service Medal for gallantry in action. He returned to Australia after the war had finished. Not long after his return, Bill's grandfather left his family, moved interstate and, unfortunately, became an alcoholic. He died with nothing and as a recluse. In those days, we called it shell shock and many a good soldier and man succumbed to it. These days, it is called post-traumatic stress syndrome and there are many good organisations out there willing to help those who suffer from it. 


Bill's father served in the Second World War and was wounded in action. After recovering from his injuries, he was discharged and took up farming. Bill had four sisters, three of which served in the RAAF. The fourth sister was much too young and still in school at the time. In 1967, the Vietnam War was going strong, and, at the age of 17½, Bill decided to follow in the footsteps of his three sisters, his father, his uncle and his grandfather, who all served their country, and enlist to go to war. Bill tried to enlist for national service with the intention of serving two years including a one-year deployment in Vietnam. When he went to enlist, he was told he was too young for national service. As he was keen to do his bit, he enlisted in the regular army—still only in his 17th year. 


Approximately six weeks after his 19th birthday, Bill commenced his 12-month tour of Vietnam as a rifleman and frontline soldier. Bill was selected as a forward scout, and any soldier who has had that task will tell you that that is not an enviable position to have been in. What my mate and many thousands of brave soldiers experienced over their tours of duty was nerve-racking, with many not knowing if their next step through the jungle would be their last. Vietnam was different to previous wars, where when you were fighting the enemy, most if not all of the time, you knew who you were fighting because you could distinguish them by uniform. In Vietnam, a lot of the time you did not know who or where the enemy was until they tried to kill you. Age or gender did not matter. Many terrible things that happened to our soldiers cannot always be imagined through conversation; however, when you see graphic images of the conditions our soldiers fought in, one can understand why so many Veterans suffered, and continue to suffer, from post-traumatic stress.


The reason why Bill volunteered to go to war before he was eligible was that he knew his father was on limited time with his health. Bill wanted to serve his country and then return to take over the running of the family farm after active duty in Vietnam. On his return from Vietnam, Bill requested an honourable discharge to return to the farm so he could run it. Bill was granted an honourable discharge with the condition that he be on active 24-hour stand-by for the following five years, should his services be required on the front. Many years passed following Bill's return to Australia and he like many others began to suffer from post-traumatic stress following his experiences in Vietnam as a frontline soldier. Bill was treated accordingly and, as I mentioned earlier, is still with us today. 


Bill applied for the Australian Defence Force Medal, which is awarded to personnel in recognition of their service to their country. This medal, however, is awarded with certain conditions. Bill has tried and appealed twice to receive this medal—one of the more recognised of service medals—but has been told that he does not qualify for it as he came out of the army approximately seven months before his three-year enlistment period was completed.


Ironically, he would have received the Australian Defence Force Medal if: (1) he waited to be called up for national service, served less time and had not gone to Vietnam; or (2) he waited in the army for seven months to complete his three-year enlistment, which would have meant his father would have had to sell the family farm as he would not have been able to manage it due to his Second World War injuries.


Bill, having been rejected for this medal, which is awarded not for bravery or outstanding service but simply for service as Defence Force personnel to your country, has been told that he does not have the right to stand by his fellow veterans, many of whom he fought with, wearing a medal that says he is a credit to his country. The fact that he was prepared to sacrifice his own life in a combat zone for a period of 12 months does not matter. I have attended many war services with my good mate Bill and his wife, and we both feel for him and understand how much it must hurt seeing other veterans wearing a medal he should be entitled to as well, because of some rule that could be changed.


Bill has been told by the government, however, that if he is not satisfied with their decision to not award him the medal that he should take them to court. This is a very gracious suggestion from the powers that be, who would use taxpayers' money to prevent Bill from receiving the Australian Defence Force Medal that he and others who are in the same predicament should be entitled to without doubt!


Bill, with the help of the good people of Australia, I will continue this campaign so that on Anzac Days to come and on other commemorative days, you can stand with pride wearing the Australian Defence Force Medal in recognition of your service to our country.


I encourage you to sign my petition for Bill so that he and the many others who served our country overseas but who are not eligible to receive the Australian Defence Force Medal get the adequate and distinguished recognition they deserve. We will present the petition to the House of Representatives in the new year, where it is hoped we can get justice for those who deserve our thanks and recognition. My mate Bill is a third generation soldier. He was only 19.


On that, I am disgusted that one of our brave soldiers is treated in that way. To those that make the decision that Bill cannot have the medal that he so only rightfully earned and deserved: you should hang your heads in shame. If we are prepared to send our boys off to fight and die for our country, but we are not prepared to stand up for them and look after them when they come back, what a disgrace! I urge everyone to sign JD's petition. Bill, I will stand beside you as well, mate.
