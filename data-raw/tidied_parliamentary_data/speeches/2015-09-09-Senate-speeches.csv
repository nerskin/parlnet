Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Assistant Minister for Social Services) (09:32):  There was a late flurry of interest towards the end of yesterday in relation to this bill, but it would seem that the interest has been satisfied. As no other colleagues wish to speak, I will sum up the debate. I thank colleagues for their contribution to the debate.


In 2012 the previous government reduced the required period of inactivity to three years before funds in bank accounts and life insurance policies could be transferred to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission. As a result the value of unclaimed money transferred to ASIC grew more than eightfold in a single year. Much of this money, however, was not what you might call 'truly unclaimed' and the previous government's changes left many Australian families in a position of financial distress. It also imposed a large red-tape cost on industry, which had to transfer accounts to and then reclaim them from ASIC on behalf of their customers, often in the same year. The government is strongly of the belief, as evidenced by this legislation, that this situation must not continue.


The policy is a personal legacy of the Leader of the Opposition Bill Shorten who was the financial services minister at the time of the change. At the time Mr Shorten pretended that he was doing a favour to people who had forgotten the existence of their saving accounts, and he perversely described the seizures as a 'windfall' for anyone who might later recover their lost money and go looking for their misplaced money. I will just remind you, Mr President, in case you have forgotten, of what he said:


It's actually surprisingly easy to misplace money, through a simple mistake like forgetting to update your address when you move.


And he added:


It's likely that some proportion of that windfall belongs to people living in Melbourne's western suburbs, and my electorate of Maribyrnong.


The reality was that Mr Shorten's bank account seizure legislation was blind as to the memory or intentions of people who held the accounts that were being confiscated. It is quite normal for people to deliberately hold over savings undisturbed, whether for a rainy day or for a major expense like a house deposit or as an inheritance for their children. There are thousands of Australians who were horrified to find that their accounts had been emptied out by Mr Shorten at the very time that they needed to access their funds. To recover their funds, they had to pass through red tape, as I have mentioned, and delay. This red tape was particularly difficult in some family situations where the account holder had moved overseas or where they had passed away and willed their money to relatives and other beneficiaries of their estate. 


But why did Labor really change the law in 2012? It is not really a rhetorical question—I am not expecting a response from you, Mr President—but let me answer. Immediately before Labor imposed the three-year rule, they were claiming that they would deliver a $1.5 billion surplus for 2012-13, but they knew—I think we all knew—that they were in serious trouble to achieve that target. It is no coincidence that Labor came up with the cash grab after they had pinned their reputations on a surplus. The panicked cash grab was just about stringing out an illusion of a surplus, an illusion that ultimately proved to be false by a very long way. The Labor measure was a cash grab conceived purely for political reasons rather than sincere policy reasons. When the coalition government announced that we would scrap this Labor policy, Mr Shorten stood by his policy on unclaimed savings, pitching it as a consumer protection measure. He argued at the time, 'This is about protecting people's savings to ensure it's not eroded by bank fees and charges.' Several Labor Party members told The Sydney Morning Herald that they were privately embarrassed about the policy.


This bill sets things right. In order to protect account holders and industry, this bill returns the required period of inactivity before funds can be transferred from bank accounts or life insurance policies to seven years—that is, once they are truly unclaimed. This bill further bolsters the government's commitment to only receiving truly unclaimed accounts by also making changes to the notification requirements to ensure that, even after seven years of inactivity, if an account holder lets their financial institution know that they are aware of those funds in any way prior to their transfer to ASIC, such as by checking the balance online, they will remain in the control of the account holder. 


In recognition of how Australians use different financial products, this bill will also exempt children's accounts and foreign currency accounts from the unclaimed moneys provisions entirely. Foreign currency accounts are primarily used by sophisticated consumers to settle complex business transactions. However, transferring foreign currency accounts to ASIC not only risks disrupting these processes but also risks exposing the account holder to a loss, as their funds must be converted to Australian dollars at the prevailing exchange rate before they can be transferred. In line with the government's commitment to protect Australian businesses from excessive red tape, these types of products should rightfully be exempt from the unclaimed moneys provisions. In addition, many Australians set money aside for their children's future and they trust that this money will continue to grow in value and be available for their children when they are ready. In line with how the community uses these products and to ensure that parents can be sure that their investment in their family's future remains safe, children's accounts will never again be transferred to ASIC. 


Finally, this bill introduces new privacy protections for those Australians with unclaimed accounts. To protect account holders from exploitation or even identity theft, this bill introduces secrecy provisions to restrict freedom of information requests generally to an individual's own details and removes the requirement for ASIC to publish an unclaimed moneys gazette. This bill contributes to the government's promise to reform the unclaimed moneys provisions and the government's promise to reduce red tape by a billion dollars each and every year.


It was only this week, when the bill was debated in the House of Representatives, that Labor recanted its position and admitted that it had got things wrong. Dr Leigh, the shadow assistant Treasurer, said:


It is important to get the balance right, …


…   …   …


… what we are debating here is the correct duration after which unclaimed money should be moved into ASIC.


Dr Leigh sought to make it sound like a minor clerical error, that Labor had more than halved the period before the government seizes the hard-earned earned savings of its citizens. He ignores the other safeguards that we have added into this bill, which I have outlined. These reforms are about much more than lengthening time frames.


This is not the first Labor assault on the savings of Australians that we have overturned. Last week the Prime Minister and Treasurer also confirmed that we will be dumping Labor's bank deposit tax. This decision not to proceed with implementing the bank deposit tax adopts a key recommendation of the financial system inquiry and comes after extensive consultations with stakeholders and the community. Labor's proposed bank deposit tax would have imposed costs of $1.5 billion on Australians with bank savings. It would have damaged competition in the banking sector by putting regional and community banks at a disadvantage relative to the big four banks and further disadvantage hardworking Australians.


The Labor Party announced the bank deposit tax on the eve of the last election. Then Treasurer, Chris Bowen, booked the revenue with a start date of 1 January 2016 but failed to legislate the change. Labor's bank deposit tax would have been yet another cash grab that penalised Australians for being financially responsible. I think we know on this side of the chamber that these sorts of Labor habits do die hard.


Our action in today's bill and in the announcement of last week reflects the government's determination to deliver lower, simpler and fairer taxes. We have scrapped the carbon tax—I think that bears repeating; we have scrapped the mining tax—I think that bears repeating; and we have delivered the biggest tax cut ever to small business, which was extremely well received after the last budget. The government has also dumped Mr Shorten's raid on inactive bank accounts, the matter we are discussing today. In total we have reduced the overall tax burden on Australians by nearly $7 billion since coming to office.


A stable, well-regulated financial system is critical to our economic confidence and prosperity. The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority is taking steps to strengthen the Australian banking sector by bolstering bank capital levels, reducing the risk of failure and mitigating the costs if a failure does occur. I think we can and should be very proud of the prudential arrangements that we do have in Australia. The government remains committed to guaranteeing deposits up to $250,000 per account holder per financial institution as well.


This bill is an important reform. It is fair and it is responsible. It reverses a cash grab by the opposition that was done purely for cosmetic purposes, to help Labor claim that it was heading towards a fictional surplus. The bill, as I have outlined, provides for red-tape savings for business of $36 million by extending the period of inactivity to seven years. In addition, there will be red-tape savings for an estimated 19,982 account holders each year. There are countless stories of how Labor's legislation left many Australians financially stressed. As a result of today's changes, many Australians will no longer have to come cap in hand to the government and fill out onerous paperwork to reclaim what was theirs in the first place.


This bill puts an end to bad policy and adds important safeguards into the unclaimed money laws. This is an important piece of legislation and I commend it to the Senate.

"McGrath, Sen James",LP,2015-09-09,"



Senator McGRATH
 (Queensland) (12:45):  Today I wish to talk about a recent trip to the Middle East, but more importantly I wish to revisit the issue of an Australian Defence Force covenant. The memory of the Gallipoli landings 100 years ago and the ongoing commemorations of the Anzac spirit have brought the valour and service of the Australian Defence Force to the forefront of our national consciousness. The Australian Defence Force is a contribution, like no other, by brave men and women charged with defending the freedom and liberties that Australians enjoy and take for granted, be that at home or much further abroad. I have spoken previously in this place about the establishment of an Australian Defence Force covenant to recognise and to support the contribution that Defence Force personnel and their families make to our nation.


Before I focus on the covenant, I want to talk about my experiences in July when I travelled to the Middle East with fellow Queenslanders, Senator Barry O'Sullivan and Warren Entsch, the member for Leichhardt, as part of the Australian Defence Force Parliamentary Program. The opportunity to witness and experience the work of our Australian Defence Force personnel has reinforced to me the need for a Defence Force covenant in Australia. Our visit to the Middle East permitted us the opportunity to meet and speak with men and women serving overseas from the Navy, Army and Air Force. We were very fortunate to visit the Newcastle along with the Al Minhad and Al Dhafra air bases.


I do not think I can name names, but I say to all those that helped organise the trip and look after us in Australia and in the Middle East and who showed us how they served our country, that I am both thankful and humbled by what you do and how you do it. We sleep soundly in our beds because of you and your service. Everything that my colleagues and I saw clearly demonstrated the focus of the Australian Defence Force in fulfilling their obligations to all Australians by their defence of Australia and its interests. Whatever your views on the world at large, you should be proud of the character of the men and women who serve and have served our country in the Australian Defence Force.


Being nosey-parker politicians, we spent our time asking members of the ADF while overseas about their service, what we should know and what we could do to help them. To a man and to a woman, none complained about their living conditions or the toughness and isolation of family separation, but all focused on what tools or resources would help them to do their job better. To me, what stood out was that the sailors, soldiers, airmen and airwomen who serve in the ADF are deserving of formal recognition by the Australian parliament on behalf of the Australians that we represent.


Since I last spoke on this issue, I have continued to liaise with defence and ex-service organisations and government and other stakeholders on a pathway towards an Australian Defence Force covenant. As a reminder, in October last year I went to Brisbane and convened a round table of ex-service organisations including Legacy, the RSL, the Defence Force Welfare Association, the Queensland Veterans' Advisory Council, the Royal United Services Institute, the Partners of Veterans Association, and Mates4Mates. There was unanimous in-principle support for a Defence Force covenant, although the RSL did reserve its position. The consensus agreed upon was that any covenant should be a statement of principle rather than a statement of benefits, acknowledge the sacrifice of those who serve and have served in the Australian Defence Force in peace and war, and outline the obligations that the Australian government and the Australian nation have to this unique group of citizens and their families. The National President of the Defence Force Welfare Association, David Jamison, said today:


The time for adopting an Australian Military Covenant has now arrived. It flows from an understanding of the unique nature of military service, a concept now widely accepted in the wider community and universally by all sides of politics.


Shortly after last year's meeting I wrote to all senators and members, regardless of political persuasion, outlining the views expressed and seeking their support. I thank the Prime Minister and all those who responded—including you, Mr Acting Deputy President, in terms of your support—noting the ongoing work being done on this initiative to support our Defence Force personnel and their families.


In March this year, I met with Defence Minister Andrews to discuss the proposal. It was a constructive meeting and I thank the minister for the good work he is doing. The minister has since advised that the government is disinclined to adopt a formal covenant at this stage. I disagree and intend to continue to push the covenant as I believe it is in the best interest of this country. The concern that some have raised has been about the financial implications of a covenant. By way of comparison, the United Kingdom Armed Forces Covenant recognises that the UK government and nation have an obligation to the armed forces community and establishes how they should expect to be treated. It does this through a differentiated approach based on personal circumstances. The UK covenant provides for support to families and reservists, personnel and veterans, and injured personnel and veterans which ranges from recognition and gratitude through positive measures to prevent disadvantage to financial support and special treatment.


The preliminary consensus expressed at the meeting I held last year was that an Australian covenant should first and foremost be about respect and acknowledgment. Given this, and the higher standard of the Australian system compared to that in the UK, there is no need for any covenant to become a document of financial benefits. There is some local precedent in this space. The Australian Defence Force Family Covenant was first launched in May 2009 and re-signed in May this year by the Chief of Defence Force, Air Chief Marshal Mark Binskin AC. It articulates to families how highly their contributions are valued by Defence and it also outlines mutual expectations.


This is a start, a good base from which to continue to work towards an Australian Defence Force covenant, but I think we can do more. As such, today I am launching a petition at www.defencecovenant.com to engage with the broader Australian community on this issue. Please visit and sign this petition so that we can build support for the Australian Defence Force covenant.


Defence Force personnel and their families make and have made a unique contribution to the nation, a contribution that needs formal support and recognition by Australia's parliament. The men and women of Australia's Defence Force make a contribution like no other, defending our freedoms and liberties at home and abroad so we can all sleep safely in our beds. Whether it is leading a multinational humanitarian task force in East Timor, fighting militant jihadists in Afghanistan, being part of other operations in the Middle East region or responding to disasters like the Black Saturday bushfires, the Australian Defence Force serves our nation valiantly.


The idea of an Australian Defence Force covenant is essentially based upon the notion that the entire country has a moral obligation to the men and women who serve and have served in our armed forces, and to their families. I will continue to work with stakeholders and the government to support the hard work and sacrifice of our Defence Force personnel and their families.


I would like to place on the record my appreciation to Graeme Mickelberg, from the Sunshine Coast; Colonel David Jamison and Alf Jaugietis from the Defence Force Welfare Association; and the many others who have helped bring this petition to fruition. I acknowledge Alf, as well as Les Bienkiewicz—also from the Defence Force Welfare Association—who are in the gallery today.


I remain committed to working with ex-service organisations, who represent hundreds of thousands of Australians, to secure formal recognition of the unique nature of military service. Please sign the petition at defencecovenant.com and send the link on to your friends and families.

Senator ABETZ
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Government in the Senate, Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service and Minister for Employment) (14:00):  by leave—When the Australian Constitution was established on 1 January 1901 it described the parliament as comprising three parts: the Queen, the Senate and the House of Representatives. The Queen referred to was, of course, Queen Victoria who was, until today, the longest reigning British monarch. The Queen we all know so well and admire is her great, great granddaughter, Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II. Later today, London time, her Majesty will pass the historical record for the longest reign. I note that today stamps and coins are being issued to commemorate this occasion. Precisely when this longest reign commenced we cannot know because her father, King George VI, died in his sleep in the early hours of 6 February 1952. Princess Elizabeth, with her husband the Duke of Edinburgh, heard the sad news on her way to Australia. It is characteristic that the very first act that the new Queen did after being advised of the death of her beloved father was to write letters of apology to Australia and New Zealand that their imminent visit would now have to be postponed. This sense of duty above self has been the hallmark of the Queen's reign, and in that she has been ably supported at every step by Prince Philip.


For the first decade of her life there was little prospect that her Majesty would be our sovereign. She had a happy childhood and was instilled early with the principles of duty, hard work and Christian faith which have guided her in all her conduct. She has been our monarch for all of the lives of most of us in this country. She has known and advised 12 Australian Prime Ministers from Sir Robert Menzies to the present day. The Queen and Prince Philip have visited Australia many times in her long reign and have always been received with enormous affection and respect. For 364 days in each year her Majesty has dutifully dealt with official papers from the British government and from the governments of Australia and 14 other countries. She only gives herself Christmas Day off. Today, without fuss, she will be undertaking a routine royal engagement in Scotland. Some years ago a study on the modern monarchy was titled Dignified and Efficient. These words encapsulate the approach the Queen and Prince Philip have applied to their responsibilities of the almost 63 years. A few days ago her grandson, Prince William, the Duke of Cambridge, wrote:


I think I speak for my generation when I say that the example and continuity provided by the Queen is not only very rare among leaders but a great source of pride and reassurance. Time and again, quietly and modestly, the Queen has shown us all that we can confidently embrace the future without compromising the things that are important.


Today we pay tribute to the Queen of Australia and we respectfully thank Her Majesty for her wonderful service. God save the Queen, the longest to reign over us.

 (South Australia—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (14:04):  by leave—I join Senator Abetz in acknowledging the long and meritorious service of the Queen. It is the first and almost certainly the last time the Australian Senate will mark such a milestone in relation to the monarch. Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II is, of course, the Queen of Australia. In fact, that has only been her title since 1973, and that is obviously not the only thing that has changed during her reign. So too has Australia's relationship to the United Kingdom and the monarchy. What has not changed is the affection of the Australian people for the Queen. On behalf of the opposition I extend our appreciation for her service.

The first is that the previous government did not follow best corporate governance practice when they appointed all of the directors of the NDIS board to have their terms expire on the same day, on 30 June 2016. That is not best corporate governance practice. 


If I did nothing, we would not have a board for the NDIS from the middle of next year. Clearly, therefore, there is a process required to look at the issue of appointment and re-appointment of directors of the NDIS board. I can advise the chamber that on 17 April this year COAG first ministers agreed that the NDIS should have the best board possible and that there should be a process to look at the appointment or re-appointment of board members. I can confirm that on 24 April the Disability Reform Council, which I chair, discussed this and that on 7 July this year I wrote to my ministerial counterparts seeking their agreement to a proposed approach for the appointment of board positions and that by 29 July all jurisdictions had replied, saying that they agreed with the selection process.


What I want to see and what all jurisdictions want to see from the middle of next year is that we have a board which has continuity and that there are some existing board members who are re-appointed—continuity is important at this stage of the scheme's rollout, but we are also open to having new board members. The most important thing is to make sure that this board has the best skill set possible in combination to ensure that the NDIS is the very best that it can be. So there is absolutely nothing unusual or odd about seeking to ensure that we have the best board possible.

 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Assistant Minister for Social Services) (14:09):  For the very good reason that KordaMentha were not engaged to review the performance of the existing board members. The purpose of KordaMentha was to provide advice to government as to what are relevant considerations for looking at a venture of this scale when considering the appointment or re-appointment of board members. This is a vast exercise. This is a scheme, at full rollout, which will be $22 billion a year that will be supporting 460,000 Australians. This is a very complex exercise. We wanted to make sure that we had in the next iteration of the board people who had the right skill set in combination for the transition phase which will rollout from 18,000 participants today to 460,000 participants over three years. I make no apology for the steps that we have taken.

Senator Wong:
  You just confirmed it.




Senator FIFIELD:
  All board positions expire in the middle of next year and if we did nothing—if we had no process—there would not be a board in the middle of next year. It is self-evident that you need a process to look at who will be the board members from the middle of next year, which is exactly what we are doing. As to the other part of your question, Senator Moore, we are continuing negotiations with the jurisdictions on full rollout. They are going well and those negotiations are taking place in the context of heads of agreement, which, as you know, specify the target date for full rollout of the scheme.

 (Victoria—Leader of the Australian Greens) (15:10):  Pursuant to contingent notice of motion, I move:


That so much of the standing orders be suspended as would prevent me moving a motion to provide for the consideration of a matter, namely a motion to give precedence to a motion relating to parliamentary approval of the involvement of Australian forces in Syria.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Senator Di Natale.




Senator Di Natale:
  I move that a motion relating to Australian forces in Syria may be moved immediately and have precedence over all other business this day until determined.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  The question before us is the suspension of standing orders.




Senator DI NATALE:
  Yes. I move directly to the issue at hand. It is that parliamentary approval should be required for Australian forces to be deployed to Syria. I do believe this is a matter of urgency. We have just had—right now, from Senator Abetz in question time—an accusation that is the most serious accusation that could be levelled at a member of the Australian parliament. It is an accusation stating that somebody who questions our involvement in a conflict is somehow questioning the commitment that we have to our service men and women.


That is the refuge of a scoundrel. To suggest that what we are doing by questioning our involvement in a war in Syria is somehow reflecting a lack of commitment to the troops engaged in conflict in that region is pathetic. The best thing we can do to safeguard our troops is to ensure that before we embark on a conflict of that nature we have a full, frank and open debate in this parliament to ensure that what we are doing is going to a war that is legal, going to have a war that is not based on the self-interest of a Prime Minister who is desperate to save his political hide. We need to have a debate in the Australian parliament—

Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (15:12):  Mr Deputy President, I raise a point of order. I have been listening intently to Senator Di Natale. This is a motion about suspending standing orders and why it is imperative that the parliament, the Senate, should avoid its regular routine and deal with an issue that Senator Di Natale says is important, when it cannot be dealt with by Senator Di Natale in some other way during the course of this chamber. My point of order is that he is not explaining why it is essential to suspend standing orders.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  I have been listening carefully, also, and Senator Di Natale has, in fact, opened up with the reasons for his thinking this is an urgent motion that needs to be debated straight away, and he is prosecuting that argument now. I am satisfied there is no point of order.




Senator DI NATALE:
  I do not know what could be more important than the lives of Australian service men and women. What could be more important than that? Why are we not having a debate in this parliament about whether we should be committing our troops to another conflict overseas, particularly when the Prime Minister says we will be committed to a war until we see an end to the genocide that is going on in Syria and we see an end to the terrorism that is being exported? 


According to the Prime Minister, that is what the end game looks like. If that is what the end game looks like, we are there for a very long time. To say that somehow our involvement in that conflict will lead to that outcome is wishful thinking, in the extreme. This should not be a captain's call. As it is in the parliaments of similar democracies, like the UK and Canadian parliaments, there should be a debate within the Australian parliament. 


Here we have, at the stroke of a pen, the Prime Minister deciding to engage in a conflict overseas that has resulted in the displacement of four million Syrian refugees, half of them children. On the one hand, he makes an announcement that we will settle 12,000 of those refugees in Australia, which we welcome. On the other hand, he commits us to a conflict that will aggravate the circumstances that have led to those people fleeing their homelands—a commitment that is not supported on any international legal basis, a commitment that is so muddle-headed, so incredibly reactionary, that we do not know what the endgame looks like. How long are we going to be stuck in Syria? How long are we to going to be there? What does the endgame look like?


At the announcement of our first involvement in Iraq, we said it would be a very slippery slope and we should beware of mission creep occurring. And here it is: we have mission creep on a grand scale. The reason we need a debate in the parliament, the reason this is an urgent motion, is that leaving this to prime ministers, who will potentially put their own self-interest ahead of the national interest, is a very dangerous situation. When the Prime Minister says he wants at least one air strike by the end of the week—and, coincidently, we have a by-election the following week—you start to ask questions about what is motivating this conflict. Former foreign minister Gareth Evans said:


… effective counterterrorism is much more about strong international cooperation on intelligence and policing, and winning relevant community support at home for tough measures.


And the use of military action is always a last resort. This is very dangerous action indeed, and the parliament should be debating it. (Time expired)

Senator ABETZ
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Government in the Senate, Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service and Minister for Employment) (15:17):  The government opposes the motion; no case has been put in relation to urgency. The last thing our service men and women need is the strategic thinking and input of the Australian Greens as to how we might conduct military activities overseas. I think what they actually want is the advice of the intelligence services and the men and women who are at the apex of the Defence organisation. The Leader of the Australian Greens, as is their wont, hypocritically asserted that I engage in the activity of 'the refuge of the scoundrel' and he accused the Australian Prime Minister of sending young Australian service men and women into a theatre for only one purpose—that is, his own political benefit. That is a disgraceful suggestion. It is beneath contempt. And yet, while they say it is outrageous to say anything against their motives, they drop it by the bucket load on the Prime Minister and say that is all fair. Their antics today show that the leader of the Australian Greens is completely unprepared in terms of the standing orders on how to go about this matter. They then presented an argument devoid of any substance.


The important thing for Australian service men and women is that they be part of a group of other countries in this theatre that can fight this evil.




Senator Whish-Wilson:

  Mr Deputy President, Senator Abetz deliberately misquoted me. I said 'Which evil are you talking about?' not 'What evil?'



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  That is not a point of order; it is a debating point. Resume your seat. Senator Abetz, you have the call.




Senator ABETZ:
  The suggestion is that somehow this is an illegal activity. The United States, the United Kingdom and other countries are involved in it. And I tried my luck during question time when I quoted article 51. It has been confirmed that I was right. Article 51 does allow for collective defence measures to be taken such as the ones we are now going to be involved in in relation to Syria. Senator Di Natale says 'How long is it going to take?' Everybody wishes that they could have a definitive answer. It is so easy to stand in this place and ask questions that no man can answer. It is like the question 'How long will it take to put the bushfire out?' It depends on how the wind blows, whether the rain comes and whether a tanker breaks down on the way to the fire—imponderables that you can never fully take into account. It is the same with conflicts around the world. How long will it take? Of course, nobody can answer that. But this we know: the longer it takes to defeat Daesh, the more people will be beheaded and the more women will be raped and then killed. Moet depravity will occur. More antiquities will be destroyed. More vandalism will occur. All the while, the Australian Greens answer to this is 'Oh, if we have a debate in the Australian Senate, Daesh might actually be listening and decide ""No, we should not go on this particular raid today. No, we won't behave in this particular offensive manner today.""'


Sometimes, regrettably, evil has to be fought with force. That is why the Prime Minister's announcement today is such a good and balanced one. It has a military component, to try to defeat the evil which is one of the causes of the mass migration, whilst on the other hand also providing humanitarian assistance to the victims in the short term.

Senator CONROY
 (Victoria—Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (15:22):  I indicate that the opposition will not be supporting this motion. We do accept the general view that has been put that there should be a parliamentary discussion on this. In fact, we made this point very strongly to the government today. What we would prefer is, as was promised by then Minister Johnston in this chamber, regular updates. It has been a while since we have had an update, and I call on the government to provide to the chamber an update. I appreciate that the Minister for Defence is no longer in this chamber, but it could be provided by a senator on behalf of the government. That would then allow a discussion of deployments and the expansion of our activities. I think that would be entirely appropriate.


The government has made that commitment—the former minister made that commitment—and I urge the government to clear some time in the parliamentary schedule, by negotiation or from its own time, to enable all of the senators in this chamber to discuss and debate this issue. It would be a healthy thing for the parliament and a healthy thing for our country if there were an ability for people to express their views. There will be many differing points of view, but the chamber, the parliament and the country will be better for hearing those views. So I urge the government to consider making a statement, perhaps on Thursday, which would allow us to have some discussion and debate during the course of the afternoon. With deference to my colleagues in the Greens, I cannot indicate support for your proposition, but I encourage the government to look at setting aside some time for a genuine discussion in this chamber.

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Assistant Minister for Social Services) (15:24):  I must say I was a little surprised when Senator Di Natale rose to his feet to seek to move a motion before this place to facilitate a discussion on the government's decision today. In fact, I think his objective was to move a motion that it might require parliamentary approval for governments to take a decision to commit forces. But I was a little surprised and perplexed because it seemed that Senator Di Natale had given so little thought to the procedure that would be required that his effort consisted of waving his arms and saying, 'Blah, blah, blah.' Senator Di Natale seeks to have a parliamentary debate on process related to government decisions, but he has not even given any thought to the process and procedure required in this place. Senator Di Natale belied a sense of seriousness in this place and demonstrated that what he was seeking to do was essentially a stunt, but it was a stunt which he was not even well prepared for.


In the Australian context, it has been the practice and the convention observed by governments of both persuasions that the decision to commit Australian Defence Force personnel is taken by the government of the day. It is a decision that is determined by the National Security Committee of the cabinet and is then ratified by the cabinet. That is the process that has been observed. We do not follow the American system. We have a different constitution. It has always been seen to be a decision for the government of the day. If the Australian public have a contrary view, the method in this system is that they can express their view at the ballot box.


That is not to say, however, that it is not appropriate to debate decisions of government in the parliament. In fact, that is what we spend much of each day doing—debating the decisions of the government of the day—whether in the form of proposed legislation or of questions to ministers of the day. Obviously, there are other forums and formats within the parliament where such debates can happen and they do, on occasion, happen by agreement and consensus across the chamber. So the government is not suggesting for a moment that decisions of the government of the day should not be debated—of course they should; that is part of the purpose of the parliament—but there are appropriate forms and procedures for that to happen. What the government does definitely not agree with is that parliamentary approval should be required before the government of the day commits Australian Defence Force personnel. I think we would also disagree with the Greens in relation to what the threshold should be for engagement of military forces with those that we oppose.


I think Senator Abetz is quite right to describe ISIS as evil and to suggest that it is appropriate that we do what we can to help stop its evil. There are times, regrettably, when the deployment of force is required to be determined by the government of the day, but I must completely reject Senator Di Natale's suggestion that the decision of the Prime Minister and the government is in any way, shape or form framed by political considerations. The decision of the government is framed entirely by considerations both of our own national interest and also of the broader international interest. It is not in the interest of Australia, and it is certainly not in the interest of Syria or Iraq or the neighbouring nations, that ISIS be allowed to flourish. ISIS should be contained. ISIS should be destroyed. The government has taken the right decision that we should be a part of that effort, and the Greens have not made a case for the suspension of standing orders.

"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2015-09-09,"



Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia—Co-Deputy Leader of the Australian Greens) (15:29):  I understand that the suspension of standing orders is not a trivial matter, and it is not something that the Greens would engage in lightly. But I was still flabbergasted to hear government spokespeople deny that there was a sense of urgency around a debate such as this. It is an urgent matter when the Prime Minister unilaterally commits the ADF to a conflict on the other side of the world where the strategic imperatives are completely unclear, the success conditions are unclear and the legality is unclear. We heard Senator Abetz's interpretation of the legal basis upon which Australian aviators and, potentially, other personnel will be deployed over Syria and find it completely unsatisfying.


I do not think we should simply rush into this expanded deployment. When we were debating these matters 12 months ago, Senator Christine Milne, as Leader of the Australian Greens, warned of mission creep. She warned of an open-ended military commitment into a complex and violent situation on the other side of the world which Australia bears some responsibility for opening up. If we heard the Prime Minister or anyone on his frontbench—anybody who was in cabinet in 2003 when we signed off, sight unseen, on an illegal and unjustified invasion of Iraq—provide even a moment of acknowledgement that that was a catastrophic strategic mistake, it would be easier to bear some of those who file in here today and condemn the Greens for daring to question the strategic resolve, or the strategic brilliance, of those who continue to deploy foreign forces into these theatres of war on the other side of the world.


Retired General Peter Gration, who was the CDF from 1987 to 1993, points out in an open letter that involvement in airstrikes would be inviting disaster. He goes on to point out:


… there is no UN cover for that particular operation. 


I believe that will give them a strong indication that it would be illegal.


Prime Minister Tony Abbott, in an interview that he did I think last week, was asked: what is the legal basis for an Australian deployment into the Syrian civil war? He pointed out—and I will paraphrase, as this is not a direct quote—Daesh does not respect international borders; why should we? I found it extraordinary that he would choose Daesh as our benchmark for the international rule of law. I find that suggestion somewhat sick when we consider that involvement in illegal wars potentially exposes our service personnel and those who direct them into those theatres of conflict to international sanctions. That is as serious as this can get.


Syria is one of the most dangerous places in the world. I acknowledge the point that the Prime Minister made in his press conference about Syrian civilians—for whom this action is arguably justified—'being caught between the hammer and the anvil'. This makes it sound as though there are only two sides to a simple conflict. That is simply not the case. I will quote Peter Harling of the International Crisis Group—hardly an organisation of non-violent practitioners. Nonetheless, he said the following:


… Islamic State has prompted a response that combines all the ingredients necessary to make it stronger: Western over-the-horizon military intervention; a regional arms race as a variety of countries rush to provide money and weapons to improvised proxies (whose factional and sometimes sectarian agendas further degrade decaying state institutions and exacerbate social fault lines); and growing repression of civil liberties and empowerment of backward-looking (but formally secular) power structures.


That is the disaster that Prime Minister Tony Abbott has waded into.


I understand Senator Abetz's alarm and concern when we raised the fact that The Daily Telegraph reported this morning that the Prime Minister wants somebody bombed by Saturday. It is The Daily Tele, so you cannot take it too seriously. But they do have very good contacts inside the Prime Minister's office. We frequently see these national security announcements mysteriously leaked out of cabinet or the national security committee. How are we supposed to take that kind of information when it is put onto the front page of a Murdoch tabloid?


The ALP—and I have noted Senator Conroy's comments and those of the Leader of the Opposition in the House—wants the government to make a statement on the long-term strategy. Again, I am paraphrasing an appropriate parliamentary discussion: wouldn't the time for that be before the deployment rather than after? We are rushing straight into the same kind of situation that ripped open these sectarian tensions across Iraq, the same kind of situation that the Prime Minister unilaterally signed off on at the behest of the United States government in 2003. Have we learned nothing from history? This parliament is the place for that debate to happen, and now is the time for it to occur.

Senator O'NEILL
 (New South Wales) (15:41):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister representing the Minister for Small Business (Senator Abetz) to a question without notice asked by Senator O'Neill today relating to competition policy.


Again, we have another question time that reveals issues that are tearing this coalition government apart. Those who watched closely when this government was elected might remember that on arrival they actually did not do much. There was this long delay before they actually started to do things. But one of the first things they did do—in an effort to respond to supporters, I expect—was to ask for a review of competition policy. That was one of the first things they implemented, on 4 December 2013. They gave ample time to Mr Harper to undertake his review, and in fact it returned in March 2015. That is when this government got the review: March 2015. On 14 April 2015 Mr Harper himself gave a speech to CEDA. This has been out and under discussion in the public for that whole time—for six months. I also want to put on the record that Mr Harper, perhaps anticipating the incompetence of the government, decided to give them a bit of a hand and attached at the end of his report a draft piece of legislation for the implementation of what he suggested. But even with that big leg-up from the man they picked to do the job of the competition review they still have not settled on a position. In fact, there were reports in the paper, after the coalition party room meeting this week, in which the cabinet is supposed to have deferred a decision on the matter indefinitely.


It is an issue that is tearing this government apart—Liberal from Liberal, National from National. Indeed, there is a list of members of the coalition and the government who are at each other's throats. I will just go through it, as reported in the Australian Financial Review article of 8 September. The article reported that nine members and senators, including Bert van Manen, Matt Canavan, Matt Williams, Andrew Southcott and our own senator Ian Macdonald, argued for the cabinet to approve the proposed changes to section 46 but were met by an attack from the other side of their own party. This goes to the certainty that the Treasurer, Mr Hockey, is doing a terrible, terrible job. His own party does not trust him with anything to do with this competition policy, let alone other economic policy.


This Prime Minister, who has made an unbelievable set of terrible captain's calls, cannot seem to put his foot down on this effects test. Rather, he is just allowing this unrest and division and uncertainty to linger long over those opposite.


There is the sort of commentary that we are hearing from participants in this debate. Particularly the commentary of Minister Billson is worthy of comment. In recent times, he declared that section 46 was a dud. He said straight out that it does not work; it is like 'a hunting dog that won't not leave the porch.' He is out there drumming up business amongst his colleagues in opposition to the uncertain position, or seemingly uncertain position, of the leader at this time.


Let's contrast this with Labor's position. In opposition we made it clear that we do not support this effects test. We do not think it is good policy. We think it would hurt competition. We think it would stand in the way of enterprise. We think it would have a disastrous impact on business investment decisions. We do not agree with it. But the other side cannot even make up their mind about it. In Senator Abetz's answer what we heard was, 'We will consider the Harper review.' They have already been considering it for more than six months. This was a high-order issue. They commissioned this report immediately. It was one of the very first things they did, and they are not advancing at all. Cabinet is all over the place.



Senator Bushby interjecting—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Bushby, that is enough.




Senator O'NEILL:
  Senator Abetz, in his answer to the third question that I put to him—the second supplementary—said, 'Until such time as we determine a view in cabinet, anyone can say anything.' He said, 'Anyone can say anything.'



Senator Smith interjecting—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order! Senator Smith, you will get your opportunity.




Senator O'NEILL:
  This disunity of ideas is exactly as Senator Joseph Ludwig aptly described. I want to put it on the record because it would not have been picked up. He said, 'This is a government that is all over the shop like a dropped pie.' That is exactly the visual image: the detritus all over the floor of a government that has no position on anything of substance, and it is on the watch of Abbott and Hockey—a disaster for businesses across this nation.

Senator SMITH
 (Western Australia) (15:46):  I do not mind starting this debate by acknowledging that normally Senator O'Neill's contributions are worth listening to.



Senator Fifield interjecting—




Senator SMITH:
  My apologies, Senator Fifield: they are usually worth listening to. This is, unfortunately, a very significant departure from that. On the first point, Senator O'Neill is grossly misinformed. If Senator O'Neill is going to take as her sole source of evidence information in the media, she is off to a very poor start. Secondly, and I suspect more significantly, is this point: not once in Senator O'Neill's contribution did we hear Senator O'Neill present a point of view. Does she support reform of section 46 or does she not support reform of section 46? Does she support the concerns of small businesses or does she not support the concerns of small businesses? Senator O'Neill quickly dropped to the bottom of the political barrel by not even addressing the substance of the issue.


The third point is this: Senator O'Neill wants to make it a crime for members of parliament to come to the parliament or to their party rooms and express points of view on behalf of their constituencies. If that is a crime, that speaks not of the welfare of the modern Liberal Party and the National Party; that speaks of the problem inside the modern Australian Labor Party. I think that as adults and as senators we can be mature enough to recognise one important issue, and that is that reform of section 46 is a contentious issue. It deserves to be a contentious issue because this is the first time in 20 years that this nation has had a proper document on which to gauge future reform of competition laws in this country. It is right that we should be having a debate on this issue. It is more than right that members of the Senate, members of the House of Representatives and, indeed, members of the modern Liberal Party come to this place representing the views of their local constituents.


It is interesting on another point: we do not often hear questions or debates from the Labor Party about issues important to small business. Very rarely do we hear issues of debate important to small business brought to the Senate by the Australian Labor Party. I could not help but reflect on part of Senator Abetz's answer to the question from Senator O'Neill when he recounted what the former Labor leader, Kim Beazley, had said. He had said that the Labor Party is no friend and does not pretend to be a friend of small business in this country. That is shameful!


But what we saw today in question time was a retreat, perhaps even a defeat, because Labor did not seek to spend much of its time on the China free trade agreement. One question was asked, but none of its other time was spent on the issue of the China free trade agreement. You cannot come into this place pretending to be concerned about small business but ignore the very real economic opportunities that arise from the free trade agreement with China. That leads me to think that Labor is in retreat or has been defeated in the arguments that it has been trying to put over recent weeks and months around the China free trade agreement. It is very obvious why they might be in retreat and why they might be feeling defeated. It is because Bill Shorten and the modern Labor Party in the Australian parliament have no friends in the Labor Party when it comes to its position on the China free trade agreement. 


What did the Premier of South Australia, Mr Weatherill, have to say about the debate on the China free trade agreement in just the last 24 hours? He said it was time to step aside from the hysteria put about by the modern Labor Party who pretend today to be an interested in small business and in the welfare of Australian workers. Let me end with a quote from Mr Weatherill. Mr Weatherill said— (Time expired)



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator, you have now run out of time. I did grant you a lot of latitude in respect to the later part of your comments, given that the question before the chair is simply: the answer to the question asked by Senator O'Neill.

"Ketter, Sen Christopher",ALP,2015-09-09,"



Senator KETTER
 (Queensland) (15:52):  Once again the chaos and dysfunction of this government are on display for all to see. It is quite clear that the moral authority of the Prime Minister and the Treasurer have been irrevocably damaged by the events of this year. Many of the decisions that the Prime Minister has made, described as captain's picks, have been found completely wanting. It is worth reflecting on the reasons behind this collapse in the authority of the Prime Minister. We have just marked the first two years of the Abbott government, and for the first time in over 20 years more than 800,000 Australians are out of work, with the unemployment rate increasing from 5.7 per cent to 6.3 per cent. We know that annual economic growth is now below trend in every quarter under this government. Families are suffering from cuts of over $6,000 a year, and cost-of-living pressures are increasing. Sick Australians are paying GP tax by stealth. Schools and hospitals have been cut by $80 billion, and students are facing the prospect of $100,000 university degrees. Australians are paying more tax than at any time since the Howard government, and under this scenario the Prime Minister is talking about jacking up the GST. The budget deficit has doubled. At every turn the Australian government has betrayed Australian jobs, from manufacturing to defence and renewable energy. Is it any wonder that the authority of the Prime Minister and the Treasurer has collapsed in this scenario and that that is leading to chaos and dysfunction within the government?


Senator O'Neill has made reference to a recent report concerning the coalition's caucus discussions. It appears that recently the Prime Minister sought to shut the door on the small business sector's hopes for an effects test to curb the misuse of market power by big business, only to find that a number of backbenchers, who have already been named by Senator O'Neill, sought to put pressure on the Prime Minister to adopt the position of the small business minister, Mr Billson, on the effects test. This is quite clearly an example of where we have a dysfunctional situation, where there is open defiance of the Prime Minister's position. The Prime Minister apparently told the joint party room that he was taking the Harper review recommendation seriously; however, he went on to say that the debate had become too 'theological'. That is a rather unusual position for the Prime Minister to take—having set out the position, it now appears that the party is continuing to grapple with this issue.


I want to take up Senator Smith's assertion that this issue has not been looked at before. The issue of an effects test has been considered in 12 reviews since 1976—10 have recommended against its introduction, and that includes the Dawson review in 2003. I understand that that review rejected the proposition of an effects test, and that was also endorsed by then Treasurer Costello and Minister Hockey. We are finding that this is a government which, in contrast to the opposition's very clear position on this issue, seems to be gripped by analysis paralysis. It is not able to make a decision, mainly because the Prime Minister himself is not respected within the Liberal and National parties. The Prime Minister appears to have let the small business minister off the leash to put out his case for these ill-thought out changes. Labor is not in favour of abuse of market power—of course we are not—but we have other mechanisms that we are prepared to pursue. In government we did address this issue by bringing together some of the major supermarket retailers and the National Farmers Federation in an attempt to come up with a code of conduct. There are sensible propositions, but this is a government that clearly is incapable of bringing those forward.

Senator LINDGREN
 (Queensland) (15:57):  Those opposite are not talking about policy, they are talking about politics. I have to agree with my colleague Senator Smith—those opposite should not believe everything they read in the media. How hypocritical they are, when they were in power for six years and did not take competition policy seriously. If those opposite were serious about it, they certainly would have grappled with the issues and taken this review on, as we have. The Harper Competition Policy Review is the first comprehensive review of Australia's competition policy framework in more than 20 years. The proposed amendment to the misuse of market power test is one of more than 50 recommendations contained in the Harper report. The government is continuing to consider recommendations of the Harper review of competition policy, and the government will respond appropriately to those recommendations from the review in due course.


Healthy competition is one of the surest ways to lift long-term productivity growth, incomes, economic prospects and performance. It drives enterprises to excel and to find new ways to delight customers—new offerings, new entrants, better value and choice. A key responsibility of any government is to ensure that the right settings are in place to enable efficient businesses, big and small, to thrive and prosper, and that the contest to win customers is determined on merits, not pure financial muscle. Our government is serious about getting it right. That is why the Abbott government commissioned Professor Ian Harper and his panel to conduct a root and branch review of the competition policy, laws and institutions—the first comprehensive examination in a generation. The Harper report's 56 recommendations seek to lay the groundwork for a more competitive and flexible economy and to make markets work better for the benefit of all Australians. Despite Harper's broad remit, a single recommendation aimed at making the important misuse of market power—section 46—provisions more workable, effective and procompetitive seems to attract nearly all of the media attention and interest group advocacy. Our competition laws must be effective and enforceable in preventing dominant companies misusing their market power to fortify the position or protect their market share by restricting competition and/or drawing new entrants. 


The reframing of section 46, as recommended by the Harper review, attempts to align the provision to its core economic objectives, bring the misuse of market power provision somewhat closer towards a principle-based approach, balance the pro-competitive and anticompetitive impacts of conduct both in the short and long term and, in theory, reduce the risk of unintended consequences.


Some argue that the Harper reframing of section 46 will reduce productivity, chill investment and lead to higher prices. The reverse is true.


The application of the SLC test captures anticompetitive conduct but also allows firms to gain market share by being more innovative and efficient than their rivals, since this benefits consumers and raises productivity.  Innovation is at the heart of competitive conduct. Even where innovation and strategic investments lead to market dominance, the courts and ACCC would not regard that as a lessening of competition.


Misuse of market power cases are rare and, even with the proposed changes to section 46, will continue to be so. Since the turn of the century, neither the full Federal Court nor the High Court have heard scarcely more than a case every two years.


Harper's recommendations focus on the public interest, since healthy competition is what is best for the vitality of our economy and delivers durable benefits for consumers. Is there any alternative superior proposal—one that will deliver durable benefits for consumers, raise our productivity and economic performance, while giving adequate consideration to the concerns of some parties about uncertainty? I do not think so—not at this stage, anyway, from those opposite. If there is, one thing the government would welcome is suggestions from the Labor Party, particularly if they start getting serious about this and start considering the need to implement the Harper review recommendations.

"McAllister, Sen Jenny",ALP,2015-09-09,"



Senator McALLISTER
 (New South Wales) (16:01):  I rise also to take note of the answers to the questions asked by Senator O'Neill to Senator Abetz. As per usual, Senator Abetz's answers do not tell us very much about the subject matter of the question. What they do tell us is a great deal about the dysfunction, the disunity and the disarray that we have all come to expect from the government. 


Just to be very clear and in answer to some of the other contributions to the debate, Labor does not support the effects test. I come here really to offer my condolences to the Minister for Small Business, because it cannot be very pleasant being publicly hung out to dry by your Prime Minister. As recently as the beginning of August, Minister Billson was reported in The Australian Financial Review as being absolutely confident that the government was going to be pursuing this measure. Yet, just this week, it has been kicked into the long grass by the Prime Minister and the Treasurer because they are absolutely terrified about the debate and the division within their own party room.


I also wish to offer my condolences to the business community. Two years ago this government promised that Australia was open for business. Instead, all we have seen is uncertainty, caused by this government's chronic inability to make a decision or, worse, to even produce a stable environment in which the business community can make their decisions. 


The issue of the effects test is characteristic of this much broader pattern. On this issue we had concerns. We came out and said so in a very straightforward manner what our concerns were and the community knew what we were about. The PM clearly shares our concerns. However, he has not made a decision one way or the other. He has not commissioned any further inquiries or tried to get any more information and he is not open to debate about the issue in any way at all. Instead, he has delayed the decision. He is unable to make difficult decisions. And we do not just see it on this issue. We see it on the issue of marriage equality where, instead of allowing the party room to make a decision, that issue has also been kicked into the long grass, pushed off into the never-never where 'We might have a plebiscite or a referendum, but we certainly won't deal with it until after the next election.'


Why is it that the Prime Minister seems unable to make a decision? It is essentially because this is a government that is riven by division. There is disunity in the cabinet. How do we know that? We know there is a divergence of views, because members of cabinet speak about them constantly to the media. We hear about it all the time because they tell us. They have leaked conversation after conversation to the national media. They even leaked the talking points which instructed them not to leak to the media but instead to communicate to the media that cabinet was functioning perfectly well. 


A government that needs talking points to explain to us that its government is functioning perfectly well is a government that is unable to function at all. It is normal to have different views in a party room and that has been explained to us very carefully by members opposite. But you can expect cabinet ordinarily to back any decision. This Prime Minister clearly cannot trust his cabinet to do even that.


The day after the decision to defer this matter was made by the PM, the Minister for Small Business said to the WA Chamber of Commerce and industry:


And you would have read, I am sure in recent days, I am getting smacked around by trying to get the competition rules right. 


Well, the people whom he is getting smacked around by are the people on his own side. He is being smacked around by the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and the Minister for Foreign Affairs.


I say to those opposite but, more importantly, to those people out there in the community that it is time for us to see the grown-up government that we were promised. In the two years that we have had to endure this government, we have not seen anything like it. We have seen division and dysfunction. We have certainly not seen decision making in the public interest.


The government do not stand for anything at all, except for the pursuit of power. They are a government that are not interested in jobs for ordinary people. They are a government that are only interested in their own jobs. (Time expired)

The PRESIDENT:  Leave is granted for one minute.




Senator LINES:
  The Custodial Notification Service has been in operation in New South Wales and the ACT since 2000. It was established out of the royal commission into Aboriginal deaths in custody. It has been the single reason there has not been one death of an Aboriginal person in a police cell in New South Wales since then. The Abbott government cut the CNS funding—its paltry half a million dollars—but, after very strong protest, restored it for just six months at the 11th hour.


In answer to a question on notice from me to Minister Scullion about the likelihood of the CNS being rolled out nationally, he responded by saying, 'It's not under active consideration.' This is a preventative service and should be rolled out nationally. Instead, the Abbott government continues to play with the lives of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people who find themselves in police cells.

The speech read as follows—



WATER AMENDMENT BILL 2015


The Water Amendment Bill continues and strengthens the Abbott Government's commitment to Murray-Darling Basin communities, businesses and the environment. The Coalition has always understood that sound water management, and the required water reforms, are critical in the Australian climate and they continue to be a high priority today, as the Bureau of Meteorology is forecasting a drier El Nino period ahead.


The Howard Government developed and drove the implementation of the National Water Initiative from 2004. A decade on, under the Abbott Government, we continue these endeavours and we seek to enshrine these reforms well into the future. 


Our vision for water reform in Australia is very clearly founded in a triple bottom line outcome. We understand that the focus must be on the social, economic and environmental benefits equally. We will not achieve optimal outcomes through the Basin Plan without this triple bottom line focus. 


Our Government has committed, since 2012, to support and implement the Basin Plan in full and on time, recovering water for the environment to maintain a healthy river system, while enabling our agricultural sectors to be robust and productive, helping to develop and maintain viable rural communities.


As I've travelled through the Basin, the issue that has been raised most often is the need for greater certainty for communities and farmers, certainty for their businesses and certainty for the environment. Our investment in the future of a sustainable agricultural sector underpins our commitment to the Basin Plan environmental outcomes and to farming communities. 


The Abbott Government is committed to delivering the Basin Pan. 


We are delivering on the environmental needs and as I have said in this place before, our Government is investing over $2.5 million per day to 2019 in the future sustainability of irrigated agriculture. This is our commitment to our environment and communities in the Basin.


I go on about this point at length because the biggest issue we face in implementing the Basin Plan is to ensure that it achieves win-win outcomes – all members in this place have an obligation to get this right. 


The Basin Plan represents the culmination of more than two decades of water reform, two decades of bipartisanship. To ensure the prosperous future of our communities we need to ensure that the health of the environment is sustainable for the long term and we need to provide certainty to all community sectors in the Basin, for generations to come.


To achieve this aim, we have made a commitment to cap water purchases to ""bridge the gap"" under the Basin Plan to 1500 gigalitres across the Murray-Darling Basin. Our focus for the remaining water recovery task is focused on infrastructure upgrades, efficiency projects and environmental works and measures. 


This will ensure enduring benefits for both the environment and our rural and irrigation communities. It is the hard-working men and women and their families and businesses in the Basin that we have listened to and consulted with when coming to this decision. The Basin itself is a precious resource, as are the many who live and work in it. 


I have spent the past five months travelling almost the full length of the Basin, meeting a wide range of people, who all hold a wide range of views on how we best manage the needs of the Basin. 


However, it doesn't matter whether they are farmers, environmentalists, indigenous elders, fishermen, the local car dealer, bank manager or cafe owner or tourism operators, the common message is that they want to live in a healthy environment and they also want certainty for their community. 


While the Basin Plan deals with the high level environmental targets, each individual and each community is doing what they can to improve the health of the environment that they live in. There are environmental groups who continue to advocate for an improved environment and who I have seen working with Catchment Management organisations to improve riverine and wetland vegetation, which in turn provides important habitats for fish and wildlife.


There are committed and engaged indigenous groups that want to see outcomes for their communities that deliver on their responsibilities as traditional land managers. They continue to work with the MDBA and the CEWH to achieve better environmental outcomes that align with their cultural heritage.


And in many in cases it's the farmers and irrigators themselves who are undertaking revegetation works on their farms as part of the on-farm modernisation project.


In most part, what we see are community-based organisations who have come together to deliver local outcomes for the environment, who have pride in their native flora and fauna.


However, we must remember that these communities have emerged over the past 100 years on the back of a strong agricultural sector; they understand the need for a change in agricultural water management, but ask that we support them in this transition to improved overall management of our Basin resources.


I've visited dairy farmers in Shepparton and rice farmers in Deniliquin and Leeton. I've seen cotton growers in Dirranbandi, Goodiwindi and Griffith, citrus growers in Renmark and grape growers in Mildura, all the way down to the Lower Lakes, where I met a local fisherman. In all of these places there is a common message – they want certainty for their community and their environment.


What I've seen in the places I've visited in the Basin is how our investment in water infrastructure projects is having positive long-term outcomes for rural communities and their businesses. 


Through improved irrigation delivery infrastructure, we are seeing more opportunities for Basin farmers to get water to their farms with fewer losses along the way. Once water gets to the farm gate, the benefits of Commonwealth investment in on-farm efficiency programs has changed the nature of irrigation farming substantially, to a precise and highly technical business. 


Farmers aren't using the same practices they employed in the 1950s. The technological advances and improvements that are now commonplace are innovative and outstanding, and a credit to the adaptability and ingenuity of the Australian farmer. Increased efficiency for water delivery and a strong understanding of the best way to apply water to a crop at the optimal time, is reducing the water required per hectare, while continuing to increase productivity. As a nation we should be proud.


During my discussions with local farmers in southern NSW, I saw how investment in laser levelling of land has increased crop yield and resulted in the more efficient use of water. Farmers are able to control their watering systems by remote control, rather than getting up throughout the night to turn the water on and off. This is a huge benefit for families and for overall community health. It's the perfect example of a triple bottom line outcome.


In line with community support for infrastructure programs we know that completed projects have demonstrated improved productivity benefits such as increased crop rotation and diversification, water use efficiencies, reduced maintenance and improved soil and weed control management. Some projects have achieved greater than anticipated water savings, with these benefits retained by irrigators to improve their farm productivity further.


Not only is farm productivity and well-being improved from these projects, but with the increased efficiency, water savings are able to be recovered for the environment to deliver water to wetlands and environmental assets throughout the Basin.


We are also focusing our infrastructure investment to our environmental assets and applying the principles of efficient water use to maximise environmental outcomes and our environmental water managers are achieving real benefits for environmental health.


Additionally, the broader community is also benefitting from these projects, as much of the construction work is involving local contractors and regional business, spreading the benefits of the investment through the Basin. 


The Bill also has provisions for expanding the range of efficiency programs available under the Water for the Environment Special Account, which provides for an additional 450 gigalitres of water for the environment, to include investment in upgrading irrigation delivery networks and other off-farm infrastructure, enabling the Commonwealth to deliver future, strategic investment in the Basin and additional environmental water and improved environmental outcomes.


The certainty this 1500 gigalitre cap will provide will work in harmony with our investment in infrastructure. We have already seen very good results from both off-farm and on-farm infrastructure projects. 


More than 10,000 individual irrigators across the Basin are benefitting from infrastructure renewal and upgrades and the returns have already exceeded the expected savings of 600 gigalitres towards the task of bridging the gap.


Since its release in June last year, this Government's Water Recovery Strategy for the Murray-Darling Basin has provided a framework for water recovery to bridge the gap to the Sustainable Diversion Limits set out in the Basin Plan. It provides an overview of the Murray-Darling Basin reform process and the key steps to be undertaken to reach major milestones for Basin Plan implementation between 2014 and 2024. 


It's been two and a half years since the Basin Plan became law and the Australian governments have secured over 1,961 gigalitres in long term average annual yield of surface water in the Basin. 


This represents more than two thirds of the 2,750 gigalitres of the surface water recovery target set out in the Basin Plan to bridge the gap to the Sustainable Diversion Limits, more commonly referred to as SDLs. 


To bridge the remaining gap however will not be a simple task and we understand the challenges in recovering the remaining water. With our focus on infrastructure investment programs, water purchases will progress at a significantly slower pace than in the past, and the focus on strategic water purchase opportunities will help bridge the gap to surface water SDLs to 2019. 


Through the Water Recovery Strategy, we have outlined our focus on infrastructure and efficiency projects, but we have also continued to pursue strategic and targeted purchase opportunities. We know that to achieve the full implementation of the Basin Plan a number of water recovery methods will be required.


I want to state on the record that this Bill in no way diminishes the Abbott Government's commitment to implementing the Basin Plan. I have heard some concerns that this cap will impede water recovery efforts and prevent the achievement of the maximum environmental outcomes. 


Our commitment to the 1500 gigalitre cap was first announced in 2012 when the Basin Plan was made, a commitment we made to the communities of the Basin; our continued support of the 1500 gigalitre cap was given effect in the Water Recovery Strategy for the Murray-Darling Basin, released in June 2014. 


I was pleased to announce with my Ministerial colleagues, Ministers Hunt and Joyce on March 16 this year that we would move to legislate the cap and deliver the commitment we had made to achieve a triple bottom line outcome for the Basin Plan. The introduction of this Bill is the culmination of this journey, which enshrines the 1500 gigalitre limit on surface water purchases by the Commonwealth in legislation, through an amendment to the Water Act.


The state Government's in the Murray-Darling Basin also play an important role in delivering the Basin Plan and we will continue to work with them to deliver water recovery projects, environmental works and measures and the outcomes of the Sustainable Diversion Limit Adjustment Mechanism. 


We have a good history of working together in the Basin to deliver environmental water reforms; the Living Murray Program is a substantial group of projects that are evidence of a shared commitment to delivering environmental outcomes. We will continue to work with all Parties to ensure that the triple bottom line continues to address all three aspects – social, economic and environmental. 


The cap on water purchases complements the focus on water recovery for the environment through on-farm and off-farm infrastructure investment and efficiency projects. The Coalition Government is investing $2.5 million per day to 2019 into the future sustainability of irrigated agriculture, while delivering on the important outcomes for the environment and Murray-Darling Basin communities and we continue to work with the states to achieve this.


Our commitment is to bridge the gap in a careful and measured way; ensuring practical steps are taken to deliver a sustainable outcome for the economy, for Basin communities and for the environment. We believe that healthy rivers and healthy communities should be complementary, not contradictory.


I will now turn to the details of the Bill.


Put simply, the Bill will establish a new Part in the Water Act to give effect to the 1500 gigalitre limit on all surface water purchases within the Murray-Darling Basin that contribute to bridging the gap.


The intent is to capture water purchased directly by the Commonwealth, which occurs predominately through open tender purchase rounds, and not water recovered through irrigation infrastructure efficiency upgrades, water sales by states or those programs which are the result of irrigation network rationalisation and reconfiguration projects funded or partly funded, by the Commonwealth. 


In addition, it does not include purchases made by the Commonwealth Environmental Water Holder, or those made using funds from the Water for the Environment Special Account, as these purchases are different from the intent of the water purchasing programme. 


This 1500 gigalitre limit on water purchasing is aligned with the recovery of water to bridge the gap in line with the implementation of the Basin Plan and will remain in place until the Basin Plan is next reviewed. 


This will provide confidence to the Basin irrigation industry and communities that the cap will be in place for the term of the Basin Plan, delivering the certainty that is very much needed by the communities of the Basin and also ensures that the benefits from ongoing investment in infrastructure-based water recovery are continued and realised.


The Department will ensure that all water recovery is very clearly, publicly and regularly reported, providing transparency on the purchases contributing to the 1500 gigalitre limit.


The Bill will also amend the Murray-Darling Basin Plan 2012 (the Basin Plan) to provide increased flexibility and opportunities to deliver the recovery of 450 gigalitres of water through efficiency measures funded under the Water for the Environment Special Account. 


Efficiency measures improve the environmental outcomes under the Basin Plan by enabling the recovery of additional water for the environment, in line with the requirement to achieve neutral or improved social and economic outcomes.


This amendment provides for the participation of consumptive water users in projects that recover water through works to improve water use efficiency off‑farm. There is strong support within industry for further investment is such measures. This amendment also delivers on the Government's commitment to deliver the Basin Plan to the full extent, with a predominate focus on infrastructure investment.  


This legislation delivers triple bottom line outcomes for Basin communities. The Abbott Government is listening to all stakeholders and there is now an opportunity for the opposition to work with us and support this Bill to ensure our Basin communities get the win-win outcomes to ensure environmental and community sustainability. We will continue to work with all states to deliver the outcomes of the Basin Plan to the fullest extent possible. 


The Abbott Government is strongly committed to the Basin Plan and the substantial water reform agenda and we will implement the plan in a manner that ensures we can have healthy communities and productive farms working alongside a healthy river system. 


This Bill delivers on our commitment to deliver a Basin Plan that addresses the social, economic and environmental needs of the Basin.


I want to thank the opposition, in particular Shadow Minister for the Environment Mark Butler, for the good faith in which they have entered into discussion on the Bill. 


This Bill is being introduced today to provide certainty to the community but, as a sign of this good faith, we will allow this bill to remain in this place to allow for discussion and consultation with states, stakeholders and members of this Parliament.


I commend the Bill to the Senate.

Senator SINGH
 (Tasmania) (17:28):  I begin by indicating that the opposition recognises the government's desire to provide certainty to Murray-Darling Basin communities by placing a cap of 1,500 gigalitres on water purchases. On that basis we will not be standing in the way of this government initiative. The success of the Basin Plan has always rested on bipartisan support at the federal level, the support of the basin states and at least nominal support of agricultural and environmental groups. Given the support of the basin states, Labor will not oppose the passage of the Water Amendment Bill, in the interests of bipartisanship and the stability of the Basin Plan.


The bill proposes to amend the Water Act 2007, to impose a duty on the Commonwealth not to exceed the 1,500 gigalitre-limit on surface water purchases in the Murray-Darling Basin at a time of entering into the water purchase agreement contract. Secondly, it amends the Murray-Darling Basin Plan 2012 to provide increased flexibility in the recovery of some 450 gigalitres of water through efficiency measures funded under the Water for the Environment Special Account.


The success of the Basin Plan has always rested on the bipartisan support I referred to. At the federal level, that has been very important and of course we have strived to, as best we can, extend that to the states. 


As many in this Senate would know, disagreement over the management of our most important river system and the food bowls which rely on it actually predates Federation. The first conference on the Murray was held in 1863, decades before Federation. More than 30 years later, South Australian Premier Charles Kingston, at the 1897 Federation Convention, declared he held out hope, and I quote:


… the Federal Parliament will be trusted with Federal questions of the gravity involved in the use of the waters of the Murray.


The history of conflict surrounding the provision of an overarching management framework for the whole basin also has its place in history, with recorded disputes among the colonies. At the 1898 Melbourne Constitutional Convention, the same Premier stated:


We ought to give the federal parliament which we propose to call into existence; the power—when it deems fit, to legislate on this question in order to remove this fertile source of conflict and friction between the colonies.


So despite the many conferences and conventions it took the severe Federation drought, which started in 1895 and was widespread by 1902, to bring the states together to come to some agreement on the management of the Murray. A conference in Corowa, in 1902, provided the catalyst, eventually resulting in the River Murray Waters Agreement, signed in 1915, by the governments of New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and the Commonwealth. This was followed by the formation of the River Murray Commission, in 1917.


The economic value of the basin's water resources to the states—South Australia, Victoria and New South Wales of course—has seen a legacy of construction resulting in a highly regulated system.


Since the early 1900s numerous water regulation structures, dams and weirs, were built. Almost not a drop of rain falls in the basin and gets to run unimpeded into the sea. Instead, water is stored in dams, weir ponds and modified storages like Menindee Lakes.


By the late 1960s drought, the overextraction of water for irrigation and rising salinity began to put the health of the Murray-Darling system on the radar of politicians and users alike and of course of the community more broadly.


But with increased regulation and an increase in surface water extractions, together with a drought in 1968, environmental impacts were starting to emerge. Water quality had deteriorated to the point that the first benchmark study of salinity, the GHD study, took place in 1970.


We fast forward to the drought of the early 2000s, the millennium drought, as it was clear that more needed to be done. Under the Howard government, the National Water Initiative was agreed and the Water Act 2007 was passed through the parliament.


And now, thanks to the extraordinary efforts of the former minister for water, the member for Watson, since 2012 we have had a basin plan that is restoring our rivers to health, supporting strong regional communities and ensuring sustainable food production.


The Murray-Darling Basin Plan—or the 'Basin Plan' as it has been referred to—has bipartisan support at the federal level and the support of the basin states: South Australia, Victoria, NSW, Queensland and of course the ACT.


Importantly, it has also had the support of farming, environmental and Indigenous groups. Not everyone has had their way of course. Not everyone got all they wanted from the plan, but it remains supported. The plan supports the very important environmental needs of the basin rivers. Within the basin there are approximately 30,000 wetlands; over 60 species of fish;    124 families of macro-invertebrates; 98 species of waterbirds; four threatened water-dependent ecological communities; and hundreds and hundreds of plant species supported by key flood plains.


So it is obvious that this is a very important, if not the most important, system to Australia. The health of the river channels themselves and the flora and fauna they support is not only vital in its own right but vital for the economic and social wellbeing of basin communities.


Related to environmental needs and environmental flows is the fact that Aboriginal nations and communities in the basin want and should have access to the flows they need to ensure the continuation of their culture and their social and economic wellbeing. Aboriginal people feel a deep connection to their land and the waters that flow through and across them. This needs to be recognised and provided for, not as an exercise in imperial patronage but by ensuring that Aboriginal people are empowered through water rights. And when environmental water is released into the rivers and wetlands Aboriginal expertise also needs to be heeded. The deep knowledge of Aboriginal people of the river systems means that they have important, if not vital, advice to give our water managers that, if heeded, can add great value to their work. Groups such as the Northern Basin Aboriginal Nations and the Murray Lower Darling Rivers Indigenous Nations have a lot to offer us, if we listen 


Engagement with Aboriginal people in the basin cannot be done as a 'tick-box' exercise: proper, ongoing engagement will benefit us all.


The Murray-Darling Basin also supports agriculture on a grand scale—around 40 per cent of Australia's agricultural production. According to ABS figures, in 2012-13 the basin accounted for over 50 per cent of Australia's irrigated produce, including nearly 100 per cent of Australia's rice, 96 per cent of Australia's cotton, 75 per cent of Australia's grapes, 59 per cent of Australia's hay, 54 per cent of Australia's fruit, 52 per cent of Australia's production from sheep and livestock and    45 per cent of Australia's dairy.


Around two million people live and work in the basin, in communities ranging from fewer than 1,000 people to large urban centres such as Wagga Wagga, with over 45,000 people. A further 1.2 million people depend on its water to survive. All of this agricultural production and the two million people living in the basin rely on a healthy, functioning river system. So, restructuring and reform in such an important area as this is always very difficult. I suppose it can be said that the bill before the Senate is about redressing the issues still held by some of those basin communities in particular.


The Basin Plan brought into force in November 2012 will set basin-wide sustainable diversion limits and return 2,750 gigalitres to the environment. Basin states are required to prepare water resource plans that will give effect to the sustainable diversion limits from July 2019. Under the sustainable diversion limit adjustment mechanism, up to 650 gigalitres can be provided through supply measures and projects that deliver environmental outcomes with less water. Proposals for these supply measures are, I understand, in varying states of preparation and assessment at the moment. There is bipartisan commitment to bridge the gap between what these supply measures can provide and the 2,750 gigalitres to be returned to the environment.


On top of the 2,750-gigalitre target, an additional 450 gigalitres will be returned to the environment. Funding was provided through legislation in 2013 for this additional 450 gigalitres, which must be obtained through projects that ensure no social or economic downsides for basin communities, such as on-farm irrigation projects. There is $1.78 billion in the Water for the Environment Special Account, including $200 million for the removal of constraints identified in the constraints management strategy.


To date, more than 1,900 gigalitres have been recovered for the environment. This includes more than 1,160 gigalitres of water through water purchases, over 600 gigalitres through infrastructure investment and over 180 gigalitres through other basin state recovery actions. This is water that can be used at appropriate times and where it is needed to improve flows and help restore health throughout the system. Already, we have seen successful water releases overseen by the Commonwealth Environmental Water Holder and the state and regional water management agencies.


Importantly, there has been significant Commonwealth investment in ensuring that farms remain productive as the plan is delivered. Indeed, $2 million a day is being and will be spent on efficiency and infrastructure measures out to 2019. This is not only a significant amount of money; it is a significant commitment to the Basin Plan, to the health of our rivers and to our ecosystems and communities they support.


As I mentioned earlier, Labor recognises the government's wish to provide certainty to basin communities by placing a cap of 1,500 gigalitres on water purchases. As with the Basin Plan itself, and many aspects of it, there are conflicting points of view that do need to be acknowledged on the issue of water purchase versus infrastructure measures as the best means of achieving the outcomes of the Basin Plan. Labor has consulted with various stakeholders with divergent points of view about this issue and carefully considered their points of view. I have listened to those points of view myself, and that is what an effective opposition does.


We have carefully considered the position of the basin states as well. Again, on that basis we will not be opposing the bill. Given the support of the basin states, we will not be standing in the way of this bill in the interests of bipartisanship—which has always, of course, underscored the strength of our progression to the point we have reached today.


For the opposition, there are two key imperatives for the success of the Basin Plan and these imperatives are the same for our approach to the cap on water purchases. These are bipartisan support at the federal level; and the support of all the basin states. Given that there is support from the basin states for this reform, as well as the progress that has been made to date in recovering water for the environment, Labor will not oppose this bill.


As I said, the success of the Basin Plan has always rested on that bipartisanship and, of course, on the support of those key basin states—particularly New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia. The Murray-Darling Basin Plan 2012 has been a success story in and of itself. As I said in my second reading speech, I do pay tribute to the then minister, Tony Burke, the member for Watson, who did a tremendous amount of work to ensure that we are where we are today in debating this bill. He did a tremendous amount of work on the Murray-Darling Basin Plan, on the issues raised by stakeholders and member states.


In considering the depth and detail of the bill before us, Labor will support it and vote with the government on this bill.

"Rhiannon, Sen Lee",AG,2015-09-09,"



Senator RHIANNON
 (New South Wales) (17:44):  The Water Amendment Bill is a sloppy piece of legislation. It is very confusing, and when you sit down and read it you really wonder what the purpose of it is. What is the intent? Clearly the government has an aim here. You start to wonder what the driver is. What is the political interest going on here? What was the intent of the Liberal and National Parties when they came up with this? You would have to conclude that it is to support their constituency—agricultural big businesses—and it looks like the Nationals were probably a key driver, because the more you look into this legislation the more you come to the conclusion that it is about unravelling the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. This is an incredibly serious point with regard to water policy in this country, the driest continent on earth. We have already seen under this government the demise of the National Water Commission, effectively, and the National Water Initiative. Now the intent is to unravel what was already a compromise—the Water Act was already a compromise—and we should remember that as the government now pushes to have a cap in the legislation.


The starting point for any legislation on water should be that we live in an increasingly climate changed world. That should mean that we address the long-term certainties around water in the Murray-Darling Basin. That is how the Greens approach the critical issue of managing the Murray-Darling. But, as I said, this bill undermines the Water Act that it seeks to amend. The Water Bill overrides the Commonwealth's obligations to achieve the sustainable diversion limits mandated in the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. The bill limits how much water can be bought back from willing sellers. It is an extraordinary change. It really is incredibly serious. Now we hear that Labor is going to be sitting there with the Liberals and the Nationals and allowing this to go through.


The bill removes flexibility to achieve the aims of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. It is essential to managing water that we recognise the importance of the current plan. In a political, budget constrained environment, and into the future, the responsibility of the government to invest wisely in cost-efficient and proven effective outcomes should also be a given. The bill risks substantial expenditure of public monies on projects that may further reduce the net amount of water available to groundwater or downstream water users across the basin. With this in mind, the Australian Greens do not support the passing of the bill. When you look into issues around water policy, certainty is so important, and that is something that this bill removes. The health of the Murray-Darling river system—the protected wetlands, basin communities, the flood plains, agricultural soils and crops—requires certainty at some level of water flow. To achieve the health of the basin rivers, certainty of flow is absolutely paramount. This is particularly so for the downstream ecosystems and communities. The River Lakes and Coorong Action Group remind us that the Coorong and surrounds—and this is from their submission—'bears a great deal of the risk if the Murray-Darling Basin Plan fails to restore the health of the River system and achieve the objects of the Water Act 2007'.


What do we mean by certainty? Certainty of a guaranteed buyer is central. The water licensees who wish to sell water entitlements surplus to their requirements need the certainty of a guaranteed buyer in the Commonwealth, especially when times are tough. The Commonwealth itself needs to be certain that it has flexibility to meet its legislative and ethical obligations to achieve sustainable diversion limits through the purchase of environmental water licences from willing sellers when needed. The bill itself needs to provide certainty in its aims, definitions and outcomes. But it contains no certainties. It is a confusing piece of legislation. Again, it is about unravelling the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. So much time and so many resources went into that plan, with such a fundamental compromise already. It was a small step forward, but now it looks like we will be left with nothing.


Any speakers in this place who say otherwise—that it is not full of uncertainties—are misleading the public. What you see here, I believe, are the proponents of the bill walking both sides of the road. We said this regularly with the Nationals and I will be interested to hear their comments. It is classic: selling themselves that they are there for the farming folk and there for the farming communities. When you look into this bill you see that on the one hand they say that, but on another hand: who do they deliver for? This bill delivers for big water interests—big irrigators. Do not come into the debate and distort the Greens' position. We are not against all irrigation. We are about getting the balance right so that farming can be sustainable in this country as we face the incredible challenges of climate change. That is what a responsible government should be doing.


The 2007 Murray-Darling Basin Plan, with its supporting legislation, was written in response to what was then one of the worst droughts in Australia's written history. It is recognised that the overallocation of water from the Murray-Darling Basin has affected not only the ecological wellbeing of the rivers but also the long-term sustainability of the communities that run the length of those waterways and their water catchments and the amazing flood plains that make up the Murray-Darling Basin. Without healthy, flowing water in the Murray-Darling rivers and their tributaries, their irreplaceable environmental values and the communities that depend on the health of the basin's water will wither and die. This is not guaranteed, and this bill puts it under much greater threat.


The current Murray-Darling Basin Plan is informed by a shared recognition that a nationally coordinated approach to water reform is vital to addressing the overallocation of water out of the Murray-Darling Basin. As noted by the River Lakes and Coorong Action Group, the plan represents well over 20 years of planning and negotiation between many competing stakeholder interests. In their submission, the group states that the Murray-Darling Basin Plan should be implemented and evaluated as it was designed to achieve the agreed objectives of the Water Act 2007. I emphasise that point again, because this is what is being lost with this bill—a deep undermining of important legislation, the Water Act. Yes, the Greens criticised it at the time, but it was still something of an advance. We cannot go backwards to that point; we cannot see another fundamental aspect of managing our water resources cut up and divided in such a sinister way.


Central to the plan is the reduction of water extracted and diverted from the Basin to sustainable limits by 2019, stated in the 2012 Plan to be 10,873 gigalitres per annum. Now 2750 gigalitres of environmental water must be recovered each year with the option of offsetting this volume by supply measures. The ability of the Commonwealth to purchase water licences to meet the previously mandated recovery of 2,750 gigalitres per annum of environmental water is the safety net of the whole Plan and thus a central plank to achieving the objects of the Water Act 2007. 


I emphasise again that the 2,750 gigalitres was a major compromise, and it is worth remembering just how much of a compromise it was. Remember the years of debate, all the resources, all the experts and all those discussions. The scientific experts identified that what was needed was the return of an additional 7,600 gigalitres per annum of water to provide a high level of certainty to achieving the required environmental outcomes. Remember that when we use the term 'environmental outcomes' you should not try to narrow that down in a reductionist approach to this debate. Environmental outcomes are about the health of the whole system; it is about the health of the communities and about the productivity of the region. That is what we mean by 'environmental outcomes'. That is what many experts recommended in 2007. As I say, the 2,750 gigalitres per annum was a major compromise; that amount was seen as minimal for the health of the Murray-Darling river systems. We know that the Commonwealth is responsible for ensuring that the sustainable diversion limits or SDLs are achieved.


The SDLs should be able to live up to their name and be sustainable. Retaining the ability to purchase environmental water if any shortfall in water recovery occurs is essential to the Plan. That is how it should work, but this bill does not pass that test of being able to restore water. The bill imposes a limit of 1,500 gigalitres per annum on the volume of environmental water the Commonwealth may purchase to meet its obligations under the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. This is where it becomes incredible: the cap of 1,500 gigalitres in the bill is a rigid limitation. We know there are complexities in managing the water and we know terrible droughts can come, but putting such a low cap into the legislation will make it so much harder. 


It really is a very deep betrayal, particularly when we see Labor, the Nationals and Liberals lining up on this. Surely, there should be more debate and surely we should be listening to the excellent submissions that warned us about what could happen if this bill passes. To share another voice from those submissions, let me quote that of the Murray Lower Darling Rivers Indigenous Nations: 


By placing additional costs and restraints on the Commonwealth’s ability to recover water for the environment, the Bill will severely hamper its ability to meet Water Act objects…


That is the essence of the problem that we have here. This bill does not line up with the intent of the Water Act. It is actually about dividing it up. There was also a joint submission from the Australian Conservation Foundation, Environment Victoria and Environmental Justice Australia. Their submission stated:


Our primary concern with the Bill is that the cap will be in the Water Act itself. Since the Water Act takes precedence as a legal instrument over the Basin Plan, honouring the cap will take precedence over honouring the SDLs.


That is why I keep saying that it is about unravelling the very important work that was done in bringing forward that Water Bill.


If the Commonwealth cannot meet the SDLs via infrastructure upgrades or efficiency measures—because, for example, they become prohibitively expensive or they simply do not deliver the amount of water required—it will not be able to use buy-backs to bridge the gap. That is the advice from the ACF, Environment Victoria and Environmental Justice Australia, and that advice should be followed. The warnings are there and they are clear. There is no indication in the bill as to what would happen if the Commonwealth finds itself in this position, because as further noted by that joint submission and that from the EDOs of Australia: if the Commonwealth cannot meet its obligations to bridge 100 per cent of the gap to meet the SDLs, the gap would then become the reasonable excuse—remember that is the term: 'the reasonable excuse'—trigger in the Basin Plan that would allow the states to exceed the SDLs, the sustainable diversion limits. Again, the proof is there and we had it laid out before us. The submissions clearly show how this bill will unravel and undermine the Water Act to such a dangerous extent where we are left with no plan for the Murray-Darling.


This bill creates a framework that effectively allows governments to walk away from their commitments to the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. With no remaining liability to meet the SDLs, with no requirement to meet the sustainable diversion limits—that is what we are talking about here. This is simply unacceptable. It should be unacceptable to all senators and to all parties, but again we know that the Labor, Liberal and National Parties are all working together in this most backward piece of legislation. I have described the bill as 'sloppy' and 'confusing' and that is shown even in the fundamental definitions. The expression 'long-term annual average quantities of water' is used, but what does it mean? There is no certainty as to whether the 1,500-gigalitre limit is on entitlements or on long-term annual average entitlements. Because so much of it is unclear, that is why you start to question the intent. It is not just about the cap at 1,500, it is not just about 1,500 gigalitres, it is not just that the cap is actually this time in the act, it is also about the definition, it is about whole piece of legislation. You are left wondering what the intent here is.


Submissions by the EDOs of Australia—ACF and the organisations that put in the joint submission—take up this deficiency in the bill. They have questioned it very deeply. The Inland Rivers Network stated:


… there is no definition of what this means or how it is to be calculated, over what period of time.


It is an extraordinary way to craft legislation. We do know that unbundling of water from land has created a new asset that many irrigators have chosen to sell to create new wealth. This bill puts this asset at risk. Again, how extraordinary that we have the Liberals, the Nationals and Labor putting this asset at risk. This is another very serious outcome if this bill is passed.


The bill removes the current surety businesses have that a guaranteed buyer—the Commonwealth—will be available should they wish to sell water entitlements surplus to their requirements. The Nature Conservation Council of New South Wales in their submission examines the case of a farmer who has achieved required water efficiency and seeks to sell any part of their water entitlements as a positive investment. In their submission the NCC New South Wales stated:


Constraints on the purchase of water for the environment through the market will reduce demand and therefore market prices, reducing the potential for financially viable investments.


This bill is contrary to the notion of open markets. The coalition is supposed to be the party of open markets, and there are times that they work and do assist, and this has been an example of it. Here we have a bill that is contrary, as I said, to the notion of open markets that this government trumpets. It is contrary because it seeks to remove the choice for farmers to sell surface water entitlements in the open water trading market.


A number of submissions to the inquiry, including the ones from the EDOs of Australia and the Inland Rivers Network, reminds us that a 2012 Marsden Jacob Associates survey of the MDB water entitlement sellers found that 80 per cent of irrigators considered that the sale of their water had been a positive or very positive outcome and that a large number of those sellers remained in the area and continued farming. I share that information because it contradicts one of the myths that has been put around to try to justify this change with regard to water assets.


The EDOs of Australia note that contrary to assertions that, 'banks directly forced irrigators to sell water', the 'survey results suggest that irrigators made the decision to sell by themselves, in consultation with family and advisors taking into account their assets and liabilities, uncertainty about future water availability, and other factors.' We saw the way that the water assets system was set out under the plan has worked very well.


The Greens do share the concerns of the Murray Lower Darling Rivers Indigenous Nations, the River Lakes and Coorong Action Group, and the other groups that have put in very well thought out, very well argued submission to the inquiry on this bill. The Murray-Darling Basin is already suffering deep decline. The Murray-Darling Basin Plan was important and is a contribution and is certainly a positive, but probably so much more was needed. Rather than going forward, with this legislation we are going backwards.


For that reason the Greens will move a second reading amendment. I move:


At the end of the motion, add:


but the Senate is of the opinion that water purchases managed under the Act should be driven by an evidence-based approach premised on the latest climate and hydrological science.


This legislation is a great set back. I recommend our amendment. It is the one contribution we can make to try to get water policy in this country back on track.

"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2015-09-09,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (18:04):  I too stand today to speak about the Water Amendment Bill 2015, and I commend this bill to the Senate extremely enthusiastically. I think it is one of the most significant pieces of legislation for the rural and regional communities of this country, particularly those communities that are along the length and breadth of the Murray-Darling Basin's rivers and tributaries.


Before I actually talk about why I am so keen to support the Water Amendment Bill, I want point out a few things to the House and some factual inaccuracies that have been put on the table, some scaremongering and some completely unnecessary comments that have been put forward by some groups who have sought to undermine this piece of legislation. Firstly, I draw the attention of the House to the dissenting report of the Australian Greens party, which is a report that was tabled yesterday. The Senate Standing Committee on Environment and Communications, of which I am the chair, inquired into this particular bill, and the Australian Labor Party and the coalition both agreed that this bill should be passed. However, the Greens did dissent, and there are a couple of things in their dissenting report that I believe should be put on the record for the factual inaccuracy of what it said. In paragraph 1.3 of their dissenting report in relation to the 1,500-gigalitre cap on water, which this piece of legalisation seeks to amend in the Water Act, the Greens stated:


It undermines the very Act it seeks to amend by overriding the Commonwealth's obligations to achieve the Sustainable Diversion Limits mandated in the Murray-Darling Basin Plan by limiting how much water it may buy back from willing sellers.


First and foremost, I want to very clearly put on the record it that in no way, at no time, never has there been any intention by the introduction of this piece of legislation for the coalition and obviously with the support of the Australian Labor Party that we would ever move away from the targets that we said we would stick to for the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. Those targets of 2,750 gigalitres and the additional 450 gigalitres, which take it up to 3,200 gigalitres of water returned to the environment, are targets that nobody, but nobody, has ever sought to move away from. I think it is mischievous of the Greens to suggest that there is in any way any intention by anybody in this process to move away from those targets. It is entirely unreasonable, it is mischievous and, in a sense, it is quite damaging because it seeks to undermine the very process the Greens, purportedly, are there to support.


Another comment in the Greens dissenting report was at paragraph 1.6, where they say of the bill:


It risks substantial expenditure of public monies on projects that may further reduce the net amount of water available to groundwater or downstream water users across the Basin.


I am not quite sure how they managed to come up with that particular statement. There is nothing at all in the legislation and there nothing in terms of real, substantiated and scientifically based evidence that would suggest that that is in any way true. There is nothing at all to substantiate that, and I note that in their dissenting report the Greens do not really give any reason for why they would make that comment suggesting less water would be available to groundwater or downstream water users. There is no reason whatsoever that that would be the case. As I said, we have never, ever previously moved away from the sustainable diversion limits mandated in the Murray-Darling Basin Plan.


Furthermore, in paragraph 1.9, the Greens make the comment:


The water licensees who wish to sell water entitlements surplus to their requirements need the certainty of a guaranteed buyer in the Commonwealth, especially when times are tough.


There is absolutely no need for the Commonwealth to be in that marketplace. Since there has been a little bit of stabilisation in the market, we have already seen that the water market is finding its own level—pardon the pun. One of the main things that were a real problem was that, because the Commonwealth Environmental Water Holder was such a substantial player in this market, its capacity to influence the water market very quickly, when something changed, was creating such a level of uncertainty that the growers, irrigators and others who wanted to participate in the water market were never quite sure from one day to the next what the market was likely to do. 


For example, to draw your attention to how volatile the water market was, in 2007 the price of high-security water in the downstream regions in the southern connected Basin reach in excess of $1,200 for the temporary purchase of water for a 12-month period. When you consider that at times the purchase of permanent water has barely reached that amount, you can see how incredibly volatile this market can be. So, having such a big buyer in the marketplace can sometimes be a bad thing. If we just allow the market to operate as the market should operate, with genuine buyers and sellers of water on a commercial basis, the market will find its own price. Once again, that comment by the Greens was quite ill informed and perhaps a little bit mischievous.


Another comment made in the Greens' dissenting report was:


Only willing water entitlement sellers will sell their licenses. Indeed the unbundling of water from land has created a new asset that many irrigators have chosen to sell to create new wealth.


I think Senator Rhiannon made reference to this in her contribution a moment ago—that only willing sellers were selling their water. I can advise Senator Rhiannon that that is not the case. I come from a community in South Australia that is reliant on the River Murray for its very existence. Without the River Murray and the irrigation communities, my community would not exist. Many, many people sold their water entitlements in the past few years because of pressure from the banks. Sure, many of them did make a decision based on their business operations at the time, but in many instances those business operations were in such a dire state because of the uncertainty about their future due to water; the amount of water that had already been taken out of our communities and had put additional pressures on those that remained; and other impacts like the high price of the Australian dollar, low commodity prices and the like. So, while these people were not forced in any way, shape or form to sell their water by the Commonwealth Environmental Water Holder or by the Commonwealth government, many of them were in a position where they had no choice but to relinquish their entitlements because of the bottom line and pressure from the banks.


The survey from which Senator Rhiannon was quoting was done in  2012. It needs to be noted that that survey was undertaken at a time when there were very high quantities of water in the river. We had had a couple of years of extremely high inflows into the river, with very high rainfall in the catchment area. It was also before the implications of the start of the implementation of the Basin Plan had been seen. Quoting from a survey done at a time when there were a whole of circumstances that are largely irrelevant to the situation we find ourselves in today is probably opportunistic in terms of using a report that suits your argument but does not necessarily accurately reflect the current situation.


In the committee's hearings during the process of inquiring into the bill, the most disappointing thing was the obvious complete and utter selfishness of organisations like the Australian ENGOs, some of the green groups and even the Alexandrina Council from down around the Lower Lakes. My argument to them is that there is nothing at all in this legislation that should give anybody any concern that we do not intend to meet our targets as set by the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. Therefore, why would an environmental group even care where the water came from as long as those targets were met? To be out there actively advocating that we should not have a cap on water—something that irrigators have been desperately crying out for and something that will be of immense benefit to our irrigators, our irrigation communities and the support businesses that rely on them—and that these people cannot have the kind of security that this piece of legislation is likely to deliver is, I think, the height of selfishness. All the narrative about establishing the Basin Plan in the first place was around the fact that we needed a certain amount of water for the delivery of water for environmental purposes.


I think in the end we established an agreed position on the amount of water that we would seek to return to the environment. For ENGOs and some of the green groups to come back and say that we need to take more money from irrigators and not even allow a process that tries to get water other than by taking it out of productive use is, I think, just extraordinary. It beggars belief that they would even consider that that was an acceptable thing to do. As I said, the most important thing about this piece of legislation, which caps the amount of water that can be returned to the environment from buybacks at 1,500 gigalitres, is that it means our river communities can now have some certainty and surety into the future about the decisions that they are going to make around their businesses. 


For the last four or five years, perhaps even longer than that if you take into account the impacts and the effects of the millennium drought that the basin has been suffering from prior to the Murray-Darling Basin Plan negotiations and initial implementation, irrigators have been living in an extraordinary world of total uncertainty. They do not know from one day to the next what is likely to be taken out of their community. They have no idea of what their entitlements are likely to be. They have no idea of what the future of their community will be, and they have seen their communities decimated by a thousand cuts. One week we take this amount of water out of the community. The next week somebody sells their water because they are desperate. The next week somebody sells some more of their water, possibly because of an opportunistic reason where they see it as a way of getting out and liquidating some of their assets. 


What we have seen over the last six, seven, eight and nine years is extraordinary uncertainty for the communities in the basin. The possibility of being able to return some certainty to those irrigators and the irrigation communities by them knowing that only a small amount of water is likely to be taken out of productive use from buying it back from irrigators means that they can now start making plans about their future—whether they are going to replant or whether they are going to seek to buy water. It would give stability back to the water market and allow the price of water to stabilise for the first time in as many years. This is really good news for our river communities. 


As I said, I was really quite distressed to think that the ENGOs and the green groups would think of denying irrigators the opportunity to be able to get some certainty back into their lives simply because they think there might be some hidden agenda here somewhere and somehow, all of sudden, miraculously, the Australian government, the Senate or, for that matter, the Australian Labor Party would countenance moving away from the mandated targets that we were seeking to achieve. 


The other thing that is probably really quite distressing in the debate that we have seen from the Greens and the ENGOs is the suggestion that the coalition actually does not care about the environment. At the end of the day, the sustainability of our entire community is going to rely on a healthy river system. We recognise very clearly that a healthy river system is something that is absolutely essential. But there is no point in us having a healthy river system when we have achieved an excess of water but we have actually taken it all from productive use and there is no more water available in the basin for agricultural production. That seems to me like a very short-sighted approach to achieving water for the environment. 


What we have always said—and it is something that I have said in my community for as long as I can remember—is that we should always seek to achieve the water for the environment by means other than by taking water out of productive use. Only when we have exhausted every possible avenue within our financial limits to achieve water targets by alternative means, whether it is by constraints management, whether it is by on-farm or off-farm efficiencies or whether it is by works and measures—whatever it happens to be—only when we have exhausted every single one of those options should we start taking water out of productive use. We are a very lucky country and we have the opportunity for future economic prosperity through agriculture, but we are not going to be able to realise that agricultural prosperity for Australia if we take water out of productive use before we even try to implement efficiencies savings in the system. 


There is one thing that I think has been missed in this whole argument, particularly by those ENGOs and the like who gave evidence. When I asked the ENGOs of Australia how many of the people who worked in their organisation actually lived outside of a capital city, how many of them lived, resided and participated in communities along the Murray-Darling Basin system, their answer was that they had no-one. What I would like to say to many of these groups who are very happy to stand up and grandstand about these things is that maybe it would do them the world of good to go out and spend some time living in these communities to realise that the very people who rely on the water that comes out of the river are the people who are striving to do the right thing by their river system. 


If you look at the impact that has occurred within the irrigation districts in the place that I live, in the Riverland of South Australia, from the amount of water that has already been taken out of our irrigation communities, you will see that it is having a Swiss cheese effect. What it is happening is that when you take 20 per cent or 30 per cent of the water out of a community, the remaining 70 per cent of irrigators still have to pay for the infrastructure for the delivery of their water. They still have to pay all the overheads and the costs of pumping a lesser amount of water to a lesser amount of farms. So all we end up doing is pushing out the price of water and reducing the productivity in the region. This is not a responsible way to go about addressing this problem. I am not saying that, at the end of the day, the fact that we have had to take some water out of productive use may not have been necessary. It just disappoints me that we do not make that way of getting water the last resort; instead, we go out and take in excess of 1,100 gigalitres of water. 


The other thing that I would like to put on the record is that in South Australia we have met our basin and valley targets of returning water for environmental purposes. Every single drop of water that has been returned in South Australia for environmental purposes in order to achieve the outcomes of the sustainable diversion limits in the Murray-Darling Basin Plan has come from irrigators—every single drop has come from irrigators. I do not think it is unreasonable for irrigators in my home state of South Australia to feel comfortable about not having any more water taken from them until such time as all other avenues have been exhausted. 


Before I conclude my remarks, I would like to say that on 27 August the SDL stocktake report was tabled. The SDL stocktake report is an independent report. It was commissioned and undertaken by independent assessors. It came back and said that, of the works and measures in the projects that had been put forward to try to return water that had been put up by the state governments across the Murray-Darling Basin, in its independent opinion, after undertaking the assessment, the water recovery targets that were in train at that time after being significantly discounted and being very conservative estimates would already deliver 500 gigalitres. We said we would deliver 650 gigalitres by this means. The SDL stocktake report said we were already on track to get a 500 gigalitres. If you consider the level of discounting that had been applied to the application and calculations of the existing projects, there was a huge amount of confidence in the report that the full 650 gigalitres of the water recovery targets would be able to be met and that possibly more than 650 gigalitres would be able to be returned through the works and measures that were on foot.


In conclusion, it gives me great pleasure to be here and to be able to say to the Senate that I support the Water Amendment Bill 2015 that seeks to put a cap at 1,500 gigalitres on the amount of water that is able to be bought back from irrigators as part of the targets that are sought through the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. It gives me pleasure because I believe that it is the right thing for our river communities. I think it is the right thing for our economy in Australia. I think it is a responsible form of action to take to ensure the one thing that we said we would do in the delivery of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan, which was deliver a triple bottom line.


Initially the plan was skewed towards only environmental outcomes and was devil may care about the consequences for our river communities and our irrigators. We successfully changed it in conjunction with the opposition, which was then the government. I think that we achieved a very sensible outcome. We sought to achieve an environmental outcome that reasonably and rationally considering the communities that live along the river and that rely on water and irrigation. I commend the bill to the Senate.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Water Amendment Bill 2015</title>,BILLS,22,1,speech
"Canavan, Sen Matthew",Nats,2015-09-09,"



Senator CANAVAN
 (Queensland—Nationals Whip in the Senate) (18:24):  I also would like to rise to give my support to this bill, the Water Amendment Bill 2015. I want to say up-front that nothing in this bill changes the amount of water that will be provided for environmental purposes under the Basin Plan. That figure broadly remains at the level of 2,750 gigalitres, although there is an adjustment mechanism in the Basin Plan which provides some of range around that figure. This bill does not change that one iota. It does not change the amount of water that will be provided to the environment.


When I was here earlier listening to Senator Rhiannon, she said that somehow this revealed that the Nationals in particular and the coalition by extension do not care for the environment and are not prioritising the environment. The question that has to go back to her is: how does this reveal any lack of concern for the environment when it does not actually change the amount of water that will be provided to the environment?


It changes only one thing. What it does change is how we will recover that water to provide for the environment. The isolated opposition of the Greens to this reveals their true agenda. It is not to protect the environment. It is that they oppose irrigation. It is not that they want to protect wetlands. It is that they do not like intensive agriculture and they want to destroy jobs in the communities that rely on intensive agriculture for their livelihoods and sustenance and which produce the affordable foods that Australians are used to being able to consume. There are many, many farmers that rely on the Murray-Darling Basin and many families that rely on those farmers earning an income. The Greens want to make sure we have unrestricted buyback to rip the economic guts out of these communities and to rip the economic rug out from underneath those farming families.


We in the National Party and in the coalition generally are opposed to that kind of approach. We are opposed to that kind of approach because we support families that live in the basin. We support the jobs that have been created in the basin. We support the very diverse and affordable food that all Australians can eat thanks to the Murray-Darling Basin.


This is something that is really important for the whole country. It is not just important for the 2.1 million people and families who live in the basin. It is important for all Australians because we all rely on the food that is grown in the Murray-Darling Basin every week when we go down to Coles and Woolies. Every week when you go down to the supermarket you are most likely buying something that was grown or started being grown in the Murray-Darling Basin because it accounts for a full 40 per cent of agriculture in Australia. Australians are used to being able to have pretty cheap food. They are used to being able to access food at a low price. There is nothing wrong with that. But if we were to shut down the Murray-Darling Basin, which the Greens want to do with their crazy target of 6,700 gigalitres, that would completely remove the ability of Australians to buy cheap food in their shopping trolleys every week. It would not just affect the families in the basin; it would affect every family in this country if we were to follow the Greens approach, stop our ability to grow food and make food more expensive across our entire country. I do not support that. I want to support the people who grow our food in this nation. This bill helps to do that. It helps to do that because it re-emphasises that this government is committed to finding an environmental outcome which is practical and does not reduce the productive capacity of Murray-Darling Basin communities.


There are two main broad ways to recover water. There is a third way which I will go into later in my speech, but there are two main broad ways to recover water to go back to the environment. I agreed with Senator Rhiannon when she mentioned in her speech that we have overallocated water in the Murray-Darling Basin. All sides of politics agree with that. Indeed, it was the former Howard government that kicked this process off on Australia Day in 2007. There was an overallocation. But there are two broad ways to deal with that overallocation. One way is to buy the water back from farmers and reduce the amount of water that is used for food production and therefore reduce the amount of food that is produced in the Murray-Darling Basin. That is one way.


The other way is to invest in ways of using water more efficiently so that we can still produce the same amount of food in the basin at the same prices we currently enjoy and have the same number of jobs but put the water savings made from those efficient investments towards the environment. That is the other way to do it, and I believe that we should emphasise that way and not the buyback way. The buyback way destroys communities, it destroys jobs and it lessens our ability to grow cheap and affordable food. The infrastructure way is the smart way because it makes us use water smarter and more efficiently. We can still provide that water to the environment, but we will not undermine the economic efficiency of basin communities.


That is exactly what this bill does. This bill does that because it gives basin communities, the 2.1 million people in the basin, the certainty that the Basin Plan will not buy back more than 1,500 gigalitres. That is a lot of water. In round terms it is three times the size of Sydney Harbour that we will be buying back every year, on average. But it is much better to cap that amount to provide that certainty than to leave an open-ended commitment that does not allow people in the basin to plan for their futures and invest in their own lives.


I noted that Senator Rhiannon talked about the need to provide certainty to the environment, that frogs and fishes and wetlands and trees and all these other wonderful things in God's green planet deserve certainty on how to plan their futures. I think that people deserve that certainty too. I think people are part of our natural environment, a pretty important part of our natural environment and just as important, if I may go out on a limb, as trees, frogs and wetlands. They deserve certainty, and this bill provides them with that certainty.


There has been some contention and controversy that the Water Act cannot deliver a triple-bottom-line approach, which is what I am proposing here. I think we should treat people, the environment—trees and frogs—and society—the social structure in our communities—on an equal and level playing field. I think they should all be considered in a balanced way when we come into this place and make decisions on these matters. Those decisions need to be informed by the values we have, not just by the raw numbers and data that we have access to, because it goes to a values choice about how much you value someone's job and community. Those things are really important and they should be considered on an equal basis with environmental factors. That is what is broadly known as a triple-bottom-line approach.


I can understand why some consider that the Water Act may fail to deliver such a triple bottom line, because in the construction of the Water Act at a federal level it did get quite complicated. At a federal level the Commonwealth government does not have constitutional powers over our river systems. This applies particularly in relation to irrigation: powers over irrigation are reserved for the states under section 100 of the Constitution. So when the Water Bill was going through the parliament in 2007, other heads of power had to be relied on to provide the Commonwealth government with the powers to legislate in this field. That influenced the drafting of the Water Act. This is most prevalent in section 3, in particular—the objects of the act. Objects (a) to (h) are listed—I do not know how many that makes—but the key ones in this context are objects (b) and (c) which state:


(b) to give effect to relevant international agreements …


—and all of those agreements relate to environmental issues such as wetlands and migratory birds—


(c) in giving effect to those agreements, to promote the use and management of the Basin water resources in a way that optimises economic, social and environmental outcomes …


That is a description of this triple-bottom-line context, but it is important to note that that triple-bottom-line definition is preceded by the qualification 'in giving effect to those agreements'. Those international agreements, as I said, all related to environmental factors.


There is great legal controversy about whether or not those international agreements provide the government and the MDBA with the flexibility to act in a triple-bottom-line manner. I will not go into much more detail, but sections 20 and 21 are also relevant in this context, where the words 'giving effect to relevant international agreements' are repeated. Section 21 begins with the preamble that the Basin Plan is 'to implement international agreements', then later in that section it says that the Basin Plan is to have regard to things such as social, cultural, Indigenous and other public benefit processes and the consumptive and other economic uses of basin water resources. But again, those economic, social and Indigenous priorities are all subordinate, in a way, in those sections of the act, to the overarching environmental factors. That has clearly given rise to some concern that the Basin Plan will not be implemented in a triple-bottom-line way.


This bill helps to remove those concerns, because it clearly states that the government's approach will be defined by capping the amount of water that can be bought back and capping it in a way which limits the economic harm caused by reduced consumptive and productive water use in the Murray-Darling Basin. We will instead seek to implement those other ways of recovering water—the more efficient, smarter ways—so that we can act in a way which does not harm people's jobs, does not take families off their farms and does not reduce our ability to grow cheap and affordable food.


There was something else in Senator Rhiannon's speech which grabbed me: apparently we are doing this to help big water corporations, or some such. Corporations always seem to be the bad guys in the Greens' fairytales. Water licences are now primarily owned by the Commonwealth government, but they are not the ones of interest in this particular piece of legislation. The facts are that, apart from the environmental use of water, water licences are primarily owned by family farmers in the Murray-Darling Basin. They are the people who own the asset, but they are actually not the people that we are trying to protect and target with this legislation, because they have an asset. They have a licence. As much as I want to see farming continue in this country, and intensive agriculture continue in the Murray-Darling Basin, they are not as harmed as other people when water is bought back. Under the buyback proposal an irrigator, a licence holder, has the option to sell their water licence, to achieve a good price for that asset and then have the flexibility, with those resources, to do what they like with the rest of their life. They can move to the Gold Coast or they can buy another farm somewhere else. Indeed, some of them have sold their licences and then bought other licences elsewhere. I think Senator Nash would well remember the Kahlbetzer family, who were able to sell, how much was it—




Senator Nash:
  $300 million.




Senator CANAVAN:
  $303 million worth of water licences, I think, to Senator Wong. You only get one Senator Wong in your lifetime, and Kahlbetzer has certainly made every post a winner on that deal—$303 million worth of water licences were bought by the Commonwealth government and he took off to Africa and bought massive amounts of farms and water licences there, and we were left with effectively just air. I cannot remember—I stand to be corrected—but I think that $303 million bought 109 gigalitres of water. If I were over next to Senator Nash in the chamber, I could ask the departmental adviser. But 109 gigalitres works out at about $3,000 a megalitre—about 50 per cent higher than the usual average going rate for water. It was a great deal for one of those parties, and it was not the Commonwealth government; it was the Australian taxpayer, unfortunately. Those are the options available to irrigators. They have that flexibility after they sell their licences, and good luck to them. 


But there are other people who do not have that option; they do not have that flexibility. When water is bought out of a small town and economic activity falls, the people who own the motel, the tyre shop, the newsagency, the bakery or the service station do not have any water licences—they do not get any bailout from the Commonwealth government—but their turnover and their revenue definitely fall. Their businesses are definitely affected. That has been an unfortunate consequence of the Basin Plan, but we want to limit that unfortunate consequence.


Just last year I was up in St George—I was there a few months ago as well. Last year I particularly went to speak to people in St George, a country town in south-western Queensland that relies heavily on irrigated agriculture. A big water licence was bought near a smaller town close to St George called Dirranbandi. That has had a terrible effect on the town. Agricultural consultants have had to leave because there is no more business for them. The wider business community has been affected, and it is causing quite a bit of harm.


The problem for St George is that there is still a lot of work to do. Under the Basin Plan, St George is slated to have its water use reduced by around 100 gigalitres. I should say that this is for the wider Condamine-Balonne region, but, under the current proposal, most of it will come from the St George area. Then there is potentially a common pool amount which would possibly amount to around 50 gigalitres from the area, depending on the review that will be done over the next year. So they are facing a 150 gigalitre reduction. It is about a 50 per cent reduction in water use in that district. It is a third of the overall Condamine-Balonne district. For various reasons that I will go into shortly, at the moment there is not the plan to take water from those areas. They will lose half their productive asset, half their economic asset. The whole town is only there because of this. St George exists because 30 or 40 years ago we built a place called Beardmore Dam. Other farmers came into the area and built ring tanks to store water from overland flow and started growing wheat, grains, cotton and all these other products that have sustained St George. It is a beautiful town, away from the coast, in our nation, and we should protect towns like St George. I certainly want to make sure they continue to flourish in the future.


At the moment we have achieved 50 gigs or so, so we have 100 to take back, possibly 150. At the moment around 50 gigs have been recovered in the Condamine-Balonne. What has been really disappointing is that, of those 50 gigs, only about four gigs—last time I checked it was about four, but it may have changed—was recovered through infrastructure, through that option of getting more efficient. The other 46 have been recovered through buyback. If that proportion continues, St George will no longer exist in its current form, unfortunately. It will be a much diminished town. I do not want to see that. I want to protect against that happening. That is why this cap is very important. It is very important to pass this cap, but it is not the only thing we must do to save towns like St George.


I would like to conclude by briefly talking about some other issues that we need to tackle in this field to protect towns like St George—issues that I hope will be taken up in the inquiry by the Senate Select Committee on the Murray-Darling Basin Plan, which is visiting St George for a hearing on 29 September. I encourage all residents in the area to go along to that hearing, to make submissions and to have their views heard. Particularly, we have to get smarter at delivering the environmental benefits we want to deliver. For the Greens this is about reducing intensive agriculture. For those of us that are the rational political parties in this country—and I include the Labor Party in that—it is not about reducing intensive agriculture; it is about protecting the environment. That is what our goal should be. 


When you go to St George and to the wider area, you learn about the environment. The Murray-Darling is not just one big old dry carpet like it is down here on the floor, where you put water down on one end of the carpet and it flows to the other end. It is not a series of interconnected garden hoses. It is a very different and diverse system. It covers a huge area across our country. In that part of the area, when you put water in and try to deliver a water-flow event, often the water will not push down the river system unless there is a big flood; it will bifurcate at the end of the river systems into wetlands, and those wetlands are often the ones we want to target and provide water to. But we can do that in a smart way or in a silly way. We can buy back water haphazardly and chuck water down the river. There are assets we can use in this region to make sure we get the same environmental outcome without destroying towns like St George and destroying the livelihoods of the 2,000 people that live there and the lives of about another 2,000 that live in the area. There are weirs on the Culgoa and Balonne rivers in the area that we can use more efficiently to direct environmental flows towards environmental assets in a more efficient way. 


The Commonwealth Environmental Water Holder are now the biggest irrigator in our country. They own the most amount of water right now—about 1,160 gigalitres of water. They are the biggest irrigator in our country and they need to get smarter about how they water their fields, just like we have expected farmers over the years to get more efficient at watering their own fields. They can do that by using assets in this region to make sure that, when we put water down the Balonne, half of it does not go down the wrong river and end up watering stuff which is actually not that much of the priority or not as important as other environmental assets. There is a weir there we can use and upgrade to direct the water to the appropriate places. I do give credit to the government, which has had a number of reports prepared on these issues recently, but now we need to act in the next couple of years to make sure that we do get smarter with this way of recovering water. I would add that we need to think about getting water from places other than just St George. There are other environmental assets upstream in the Condamine-Balonne region, around Chinchilla and Dalby, which also should be considered, particularly to minimise the impact on St George but also to help the micro and macro invertebrates is that part of the system. 


The final thing I want to say is that this should not just be about water; this is about the environment. Just adding water is a simplistic way of trying to deal with this issue. This is not a cake mix that you buy down at your local shops and just add water to make it work. It needs a lot more sense to get a productive environment in our Murray-Darling system. We need to be smarter about this and look at what we are targeting, which is the environment, not people's jobs, which is what the Greens want to do.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Water Amendment Bill 2015</title>,BILLS,22,1,speech
"Bernardi, Sen Cory",LP,2015-09-09,"



Senator BERNARDI
 (South Australia) (18:44):  It gives me great pleasure to rise and speak on the Water Amendment Bill 2015. Water is one of the most important resources for our nation. More specifically, it is a vital element for the prosperity of my state of South Australia. There has also been the rather vexed issue about who owns and has rights to the water as it flows through the Murray-Darling Basin. I remember the spirited discussions and debates we had in the past with our Nationals cousins, particularly from Queensland, who were obviously concerned for their communities whilst South Australians were desperately concerned for the wellbeing of their communities. I also acknowledge that there has generally been a bipartisan approach. We had some differences with the now opposition when they were in government, but there has generally been a bipartisan approach to the need to get the balance right.


You cannot just advocate for environmental flows whilst ignoring the impacts on and the costs to local communities, many of whom are entirely dependent on the health and wellbeing of the Murray-Darling Basin—none more so, I would posit, than some of the communities in South Australia, who did it extraordinarily tough during the 10 years of drought when people like Tim Flannery and the Greens party were telling us that it would never rain again, the rain would not fall in the right spots, that we would all have to move north or to Tasmania, or whatever their claim of the day was. The reality is it was a dreadful drought and emotions were very high. People were fighting very hard for their livelihoods and their communities and to represent the interests of their states. But through it all there was an acknowledgment and an acceptance that the Murray-Darling Basin is a national river system. We have to coexist and use it wisely.


It used to frustrate me when we would discover at Senate inquiries and Senate estimates that there were thousands of kilometres of illegal structures in other states that were used to store water—they had no approval—when we had communities in my Riverland region of South Australia that were desperately in need of water allocations for their citrus crops. A huge toll was taken on many communities. Some farmers and growers left the land. Some risked it all and rolled the dice to see if they could continue building their prosperity. Some were successful and, unfortunately, some were not. But through it all there was general goodwill. The general goodwill was that the Murray-Darling Basin is the lifeblood of many communities. We have to come to a compromise that will provide benefits to the communities, meet our nation's requirement for a food bowl and, of course, achieve the environmental outcomes that are very important for the long-term health of any ecosystem.


I am pleased to be speaking on this bill. The coalition has committed to implementing the Murray-Darling Basin Plan in full. It has committed to doing it on time; it has committed to doing it on budget. But, perhaps most importantly, it is going to have what some refer to as the triple-bottom-line focus that, as I mentioned, supports and maintains healthy, viable communities and the environment for the future. It is acknowledged—and there may be some dispute about this in other areas of Australia—that the basin is the food bowl of our nation. We need to make sure it is used sustainably. We need to make sure it is used prudently to ensure the survival and prosperity of both our communities and the environment for future generations. As a father—and even those of you who are not parents—I understand that we are the custodians of this land, we are the stewards of the resources and we need to make sure we are preparing our country for the challenges ahead.


I am delighted to say that we on this side of the chamber—and I acknowledge that it is not going to be opposed by those on the other side—are committed to working with the people of the basin to make sure that farmers and communities are viable and sustainable for the long term. It is not just about us; it is about future generations. The government, through the hard work of ministers and through the representations of many backbenchers who have a vested interest in this, from the point of view of representing the community—but who also have a clear and unambiguous understanding of what needs to be done—has worked with all stakeholders to deliver this triple-bottom-line outcome.


It is about delivering greater certainty. When there is greater certainty, there is an opportunity for businesses, community leaders, civic leaders, local governments, state and federal governments—every organisation imaginable—to plan for the future. Perhaps the greatest risk to planning is the unknown. The whims and dictates of bureaucrats, governments or personalities are the things that can have a dramatic impact, more often negatively than positively, in the sustainability and viability of our regional and rural Riverland communities. The government has tried to deliver that certainty. It wants to deliver certainty for farmers, businesses, communities and, very importantly, the environment, and that is what this bill does.


I will just touch upon some of the key elements of the bill. A key element for certainty for communities and businesses is how the government is going to cover its legislative obligations, principally in recovering water for the environment. The coalition has had—and I acknowledge Minister Birmingham's work on this when in opposition—a strong, steadfast and long-term commitment to returning the Murray-Darling Basin to health, whilst also recognising and supporting agriculture. It is no good having one without the other. It is no good just chasing the agricultural basket and ignoring the health of the river or the river system. Of course you cannot sustain it without a healthy river system, and yet there is no point in having a healthy river system if it is not going to be able to be utilised for the benefit of all Australians, not just the environment. It is about getting the balance right. 


This is a common-sense and logical approach that I wish was applied more often in seeking legislative outcomes. But we have it here. The government has followed up on its election commitment to give priority to investment in water infrastructure efficiencies that return water to the environment through water recovery by purchase. Investment in infrastructure is the primary method of recovering water to improve the basin environment. I have observed some of that lack of infrastructure firsthand on a number of occasions. I want to pay credit to the South Australian Riverland communities who have invested very heavily in infrastructure to prove themselves to be some of the most efficient users of Murray-Darling Basin water. But there is a sense of frustration at times when you drive through the Riverland and you see the overhead watering of certain crops in the middle of the day, and that is simply because the infrastructure is not strong enough to cope with the demands for watering—the pipes are not big enough, and the cost of putting bigger pipes in is prohibitive particularly in difficult times. But there is this commitment from these communities that they want to do the right thing, so they install drip irrigation, they try to use appropriate methods, and going to such inefficient methods of watering is a last resort. It is driven by a lack of infrastructure; even so, they have done a mighty job. The frustration is compounded when they see, upstream, much less efficient methods of watering. That is a source of frustration and I know it is something the government has acknowledged, and I know that many other communities acknowledge that, given the right incentives, given the right infrastructure, they can do a better job as well. That helps the entire health of the system.


So the government has followed through on its election commitment, and that is what this legislation is about. It is about the government meeting its election commitment to cap water purchases and focus on the triple bottom line outcomes through improving our agricultural efficiency. This is an unprecedented investment—some $12 billion to implement the Basin Plan, with several outcomes in mind but, to sum it up, to better manage our waterways through the provision of improved key water infrastructure that will benefit the environment and agriculture. Every single day between now and 30 June 2019—some senators probably will not be here in 2019, Madam Acting Deputy President O'Neill, though I have no doubt that you will be—there will be $2.5 million invested in the future of agriculture in the basin. That is $3.9 billion going into infrastructure that will improve farm efficiency and productive capacity while returning water to the environment.


Earlier today we heard from Senator McKim in his first speech about how sustainability is the key driver for the next 100 years. When I was listening to the contributions made here I noted that the Labor Party got that mantra—they understand that sustainability is important and that is why they are not opposing this bill; they understand that investment is the key to getting productivity outcomes and environmental outcomes. What I do not understand is how Senator Rhiannon, from the Greens party, could stand up and say the Greens were opposing this bill—they are opposing it when it is all about getting better environment outcomes along with better agricultural outcomes. It is a win-win—$12 billion invested into a plan to protect the environment and protect agriculture in this country, and there are people that are opposed to it! That makes no sense when it was said earlier today that sustainability is the key driver of the next hundred years. I would suggest that we have to take with a grain of salt the Greens' supposed commitment to better environmental outcomes. There is no balance there—there is no balance at all. 


To prove that there is a human dimension to this and that we are not just talking generically about communities or groups of farmers, over 10,000 individual irrigators have benefited from the government's water efficiency programs that underpin the government's approach to implementing the Basin Plan. Already, 10,000 irrigators are doing better from a productivity point of view; they are delivering better environmental outcomes as a result of the government's approach to implementing the Basin Plan. Part of that plan is about a water recovery target. I mentioned before that $2.5 million a day is going to be spent through until 2019—and there is also a water recovery target of 2,750 gigalitres by 2019. We are going to prioritise water recovery efforts through investment in on-farm and off-farm water-saving infrastructure and efficiency projects over water purchasing.


Madam Acting Deputy President, I regret that I am unable to complete my remarks tonight because I have to replace you in the chair. But there is a lot more to say. I think we need to herald the brave, courageous approach that the government has taken. I acknowledge that the opposition have chosen not to oppose this legislation for petty politicking's sake—they may have had some variations in how they might have approached it, but they recognise that this is a very important step for the security and sustainability of both our environmental river system in the Murray-Darling Basin and the agricultural communities that rely so much on it.

"McKenzie, Sen Bridget",Nats,2015-09-09,"



Senator McKENZIE
 (Victoria) (19:00):  It gives me great satisfaction to commend this particular bill, the Water Amendment Bill 2015, to the Senate. I do thank those opposite and the Labor Party for supporting its passage through the other place. 




Senator Kim Carr:
  Why are you holding it up then?




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Bernardi
):  Order!




Senator McKENZIE:
  Senator Carr—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Ignore the interjection, Senator McKenzie, and please address your comments through the chair.




Senator McKENZIE:
  Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. Here is Senator Carr, from my home state of Victoria, who sat through the discussions in our own state about the Murray-Darling Basin Plan—and how contentious it was. You saw, over and over again, rural and regional communities, which feed the food processors, in the western suburbs of Melbourne, who actually underpin your preselection. The workers in those food- processing outlets are funding and supporting you in your preselection process and yet you do not want to sit and listen anymore to us talking about legislation that will allow them to go on producing the fabulous, clean, green produce that our great state produces. Senator Carr, you harp on about advanced manufacturing and science, and yet you do not want to sit and listen to me—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Address your comments through the chair, Senator McKenzie.




Senator McKENZIE:
  Through you, Mr Acting Deputy President, you do not want to talk about what will underpin agriculture production in our home state, Senator Carr, and food processing, and so many jobs of the Australian Workers Union in the food production sector going forward. And that is this piece of legislation, which caps water buybacks at 1,500 gigalitres. It is a happy, happy day that we bring forward this legislation.


This government and, I hope, the opposition also recognises that the Murray-Darling Basin is the lifeblood of food production in this country—from Queensland, right through New South Wales to the great food production state of Victoria, right through to your own home state, Mr Acting Deputy President Bernardi, of South Australia. Water, as the Minister for Agriculture is often quite fond of saying, is wealth. If you are involved in agriculture in any way, shape or form, without water you cannot really do much. Ask the UAE! They have huge food security issues as a result of a lack of water. 


The basin is the food bowl of our nation and we need to use it sustainably. We need to use that resource very carefully and in a considered manner. There has been a huge debate publicly. I remember public forums in Mildura where some of the horticulturalists up there actually had effigies, if you like, for want of a better word, of parliamentary bureaucrats and, indeed, parliamentarians with concrete-filled gumboots. They were throwing them into the Murray-Darling River as a result of some of those community forums where hundreds of people turned up to tell the then minister for water, Minister Burke, and Craig Knowles, what they actually thought of the process of constructing the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. They told them that it was a little airy-fairy and that we were picking out numbers and not focusing on outcomes. I think what the independent report, released last week, actually shows is that they were right. We had identified the environmental assets that we as a nation thought were important to protect and the fact that we had to collectively share water in order to ensure their sustainability and ongoing health. But we did not have a number on what that looked like. The environment is fickle: sometimes it rains; sometimes it does not. What you need one year to keep those particular assets healthy, you might not need another year.


The report released last week showed that we have been really good at what we do and that some of those assets need less water, but I will get on to that a little later. I want to talk us through just how important the Murray-Darling Basin is and indeed irrigated agriculture. Located within the Murray-Darling Basin are 40 per cent of Australia's farms; 70 per cent of our irrigated land area; nine per cent of people are employed in agriculture and related support service industries; and about three per cent of people are employed in food product manufacturing and agricultural product wholesaling. 


Indeed, as I mentioned in my comments, through you, Chair, to Senator Carr, there is food-processing, production and export industries in capital cities right through the Murray-Darling Basin states that actually provide many jobs. Over 300,000 jobs are currently in food manufacturing in Australia and over half of those are located in regional Australia. So there are many jobs tied up in ensuring the ongoing sustainability of agriculture production throughout the Murray-Darling Basin.


We did have a millennium drought. Irrigated agricultural production is a significant industry and, in 2012-13, it contributed $6,800 million. In 2013 irrigated agricultural production in the basin accounted for over 50 per cent of our total irrigated produce and 100 per cent of Australia's rice. Isn't it fabulous that we are exporting rice to the world? From a water perspective, we can actually produce rice really efficiently. Ninety-six per cent of Australia's cotton is grown in the basin; 75 per cent of Australia's grapes, and most of that is in my own home state of Victoria, right in Andrew Broad's great seat of Mallee; 59 per cent of Australia's hay; and 54 per cent of Australia's fruit. And did you know—here is a little known fun fact—that 80 per cent of Australia's pear production actually comes out of the heart of Senator Carr's state and mine, and that is the Golden Valley, the heart of irrigated agriculture in Victoria? And 52 per cent of Australia's production of sheep and livestock, and 45 per cent of Australia's dairy production are undertaken in the basin. When you look at our dairy production and what it is actually contributing, off the Melbourne wharfs, it is our largest export every day. I am sure there are a few MUA workers whose jobs rely on the great Murray Goulburn, which produces fabulous product right throughout Victoria but indeed in the irrigated agriculture sections, particularly around Shepparton, Katunga and the like.


But it is not just about agricultural production, as we have discussed. This is about getting a triple-bottom-line result. This was always about getting a triple-bottom-line result for agricultural production and the ongoing financial sustainability and local economic benefits, not only for famers but for the regional communities in which they find themselves. It is also about the environment—those environmental assets that as a nation we have deemed important enough to share water on. Let's face it: water did not get into the Constitution; it was not a Commonwealth responsibility, because we were fighting about it then and we are still fighting about it. So, to actually have a bipartisan approach is quite fabulous, because it took a while to get some of the states onboard.


Did you know that the Murray River is actually the only river in the world that has its own flag? That is how important that river is to us, to our heritage and to the construction and pioneering spirit of those who came before us. But I will not bore you with that. Let's get onto the details of the bill. I think what is so exciting about how we have actually found the solution on how to balance those competing social, economic and environmental interests is that we have chosen to invest our money in infrastructure to assist farmers, to get some productivity gains, to ensure that they still can compete with the world with our fabulous clean, green product. We are investing $2.5 million every day, up to 2019, in the future of agriculture in the Basin—$3.9 billion going into infrastructure that will help improve farm efficiency and productive capacity while returning water to the environment. That has taken some work.



Senator Kim Carr interjecting—




Senator McKENZIE:
  I think about the water minister for Victoria at the time, and I know Senator Carr that you will join with me in thanking the previous Liberal-Nationals party state government's water minister, the leader of the Nationals in Victoria, Peter Walsh, for his very strong stance on this. He was not going to get steamrolled by South Australia. He was not going to get steamrolled by New South Wales. I know the now minister, Minister Neville, will be very thankful that the minister ensured that Victoria absolutely brought home the bacon when it came to positive outcomes with respect to the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. He showed absolute leadership in that area, and I know Minister Neville will be very happy to oversee the implementation of that plan.


The 1,500-gigalitre cap on water purchase was a key pre-election commitment by the coalition, and we have done several Senate inquiries into the Murray-Darling Basin Plan and its various iterations over the course of the last government. Everybody in this place will be very clear that we were always going to back communities' capacity to provide their own wealth for their families and find those savings. I heard Senator Rhiannon's comments around needing to focus on having a strong evidence base, backed by science. I could not agree more. How can we make decisions on how to balance competing interests by using anything other than science? I think the more evidence we gather through this process, the more reviews that we do, the more we go through the actual implementation process and work out how much water we need in any given space, that will become a really exciting space. I look forward to the Greens' support of those various reports, which will absolutely be backed with science. Putting a certain number of gigalitres down the river and forgetting that the Barmah Choke exists I think just shows that evidence is really, really important; having an understanding of the local context of the policy outcomes you want to implement is really, really important.


On 5 August the Commonwealth, along with the New South Wales government, announced a $263.5 million investment for round 5 of the On-Farm Irrigation Efficiency Program. This investment upgrades farm infrastructure in the southern New South Wales basin, returns 20 gigalitres of water to farmers and returns 77 gigalitres of water to the environment, which I think is really important. When we talk about an evidence base, as I mentioned earlier, there was an independent stocktake report—which I am not sure you mentioned, Senator Rhiannon, but hopefully other Greens senators contributing to this debate may—on 27 August, into the sustainable diversion limit adjustment process. The report vindicated the progress of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan implementation and showed that projects are on track to deliver the environmental outcomes outlined under the Basin Plan. It actually showed that over 500 gigalitres less water is needed to meet the environmental targets in the plan and that states are on track to deliver the required projects. How fantastic that states and communities, farmer organisations and irrigation councils are working together to actually implement the Murray-Darling Basin Plan to the point that we are saving over 500 gigalitres of water. That is what we do know. It is not more water, Senator Hanson-Young, but less, which I think is absolutely fantastic.


Consultants Mr Turner and Mr Martin were chosen by the Basin Officials Committee to undertake the stocktake. This included not just assessing favourable projects that might give us the result they want. It was a comprehensive, independent report using a methodology that nobody could argue with—assessments of 36 supply and constraint measure proposals currently being proposed by jurisdictions as potential projects in the sustainable diversion limit adjustment mechanism. That is going to reduce the need for water recovery while still delivering the plan's environmental outcomes. That is fabulous news. So, congratulations, because when we look at water-recovery strategies—that is, buybacks and the impact of the former government's approach to finding water—that had devastating effects on our communities: $1 billion of taxpayers' money to devastate communities like the Pyramid Hill district, which lost over 50 per cent of its original high-security entitlement in less than a decade. We have the unrelenting buyback plan of the former government that devastated communities as water was removed from systems leaving a greater and greater burden on those who chose to stay.


We also had the millennium drought which further exacerbated the financial and mental stress on those families who were deciding if they should stay in the game—should they still be dairy producers—or should they sell their water entitlement and take their luck on the market with an ever-decreasing equity in their property? The former government's approach was very, very concerning, but I am very, very glad that they are on board with our commitment to infrastructure, and I am extremely grateful for their support in implementing this cut, because this is something that our community has called for—our farmer groups, the NFF, the irrigator councils and local producers right across regional Victoria were wanting to know that no more would somebody be swooping in and buying water in an open market with a chequebook that they could not compete with. They could not compete with the Commonwealth coming in and buying water for the environment and undermining them.


In the brief minutes remaining, I wanted to comment on some of the responses of the states, in particular over the last month or so, to this issue. On 7 September there was an article in The Landstating:


The South Australian and Victorian governments had opposed the 1,500GL cap, which threatened the fate of the Water Amendment Bill 2015 introduced into parliament in late May.


But the two states shifted position this week after the Parliamentary Secretary to the Environment Minister Bob Baldwin released an independent stocktake report on the progress of the environmental water flow targets—


The article went on to say:


Mr Baldwin—


the parliamentary secretary—


said the report showed that more than 500GL less water was needed to meet the plan's target, and it was reasonable to achieve up to 650 GL less water to meet the plan's 2750GL baseline target.


There were some issues, obviously—New South Wales southern irrigators are still disappointed—but the VFF in my home state is very, very happy. The South Australian and Victorian governments have both backed the federal coalition's plan to legislate the 1,500-gig cap on Commonwealth water buybacks, paving the way for bipartisan support. Obviously, both the Victorian and South Australian governments are led by the Labor Party. Minister Neville's spokesman said that the state was not opposed to the cap. The spokesperson for Minister Neville said:


We want to see certainty for communities and businesses in the (state's) north and environmental outcomes.


That is exactly what we want to see too—certainty—and I am so glad that Senator Carr is going to be voting in favour of this bill and supporting Minister Neville.




Senator Kim Carr:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order going to relevance. I am concerned that Senator McKenzie has not explained to us why there are six government speakers—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  There is no point of order. Resume your seat, Senator Carr. Senator McKenzie, you have the call.




Senator McKENZIE:
  I am so passionate about this issue—




Senator Kim Carr:
  No, you are not! You obstruct, you filibuster!




Senator McKENZIE:
  If you were equally passionate, Senator Carr, about the productive capacity of our home state, you would also be rising to add your voice to the National Party, to the Liberal Party and to crossbench senators who support the cap. If you look at my contribution on this particular topic over the time that I have been here, you will see that this is not the first time that I have spoken about it.




Senator Kim Carr:
  At length on a non-controversial bill!




Senator McKENZIE:
  Senator Carr—through you, Mr Acting Deputy President—just because you do not like the sound of my voice or what I am saying does not mean you do not have to listen.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order!




Senator McKENZIE:
  There are so many people supporting this. It is not just Senator Carr who is supporting this legislation, or the National Party, or the Liberal Party. The National Irrigators Council—Tom Chesson—said: 'We have long advocated for a legislated 1,500GL cap on water buybacks in the MDB and we welcome the legislation currently before the Senate to provide for this measure.' Equally, the NFF said that it is an excellent example of how to achieve good environmental outcomes while also taking steps to reduce the social and economic impacts of the plan on rural and regional communities. I am sure that the Labor Party country caucus will be rising in unison to add something other than carping from the sidelines and some positive input into this debate on such a significant bipartisan approach to water management and sustainable environmental outcomes.




Senator Smith:
  Carping—was that a pun?




Senator McKENZIE:
  That is very funny, Senator Smith. I will pay that, especially since irrigation channels are full of them.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Ignore the interjections, Senator McKenzie.





Senator McKENZIE:
  The National Farmers' Federation said that this was demonstrating significant goodwill, making comments publicly about how the uncertainty had undermined community confidence. If there is one thing you need in agriculture it is confidence. I commend the bill to the Senate. (Time expired)


Debate interrupted.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Water Amendment Bill 2015</title>,BILLS,22,1,speech
"Singh, Sen Lisa",ALP,2015-09-09,"



Senator SINGH
 (Tasmania) (17:28):  I begin by indicating that the opposition recognises the government's desire to provide certainty to Murray-Darling Basin communities by placing a cap of 1,500 gigalitres on water purchases. On that basis we will not be standing in the way of this government initiative. The success of the Basin Plan has always rested on bipartisan support at the federal level, the support of the basin states and at least nominal support of agricultural and environmental groups. Given the support of the basin states, Labor will not oppose the passage of the Water Amendment Bill, in the interests of bipartisanship and the stability of the Basin Plan.


The bill proposes to amend the Water Act 2007, to impose a duty on the Commonwealth not to exceed the 1,500 gigalitre-limit on surface water purchases in the Murray-Darling Basin at a time of entering into the water purchase agreement contract. Secondly, it amends the Murray-Darling Basin Plan 2012 to provide increased flexibility in the recovery of some 450 gigalitres of water through efficiency measures funded under the Water for the Environment Special Account.


The success of the Basin Plan has always rested on the bipartisan support I referred to. At the federal level, that has been very important and of course we have strived to, as best we can, extend that to the states. 


As many in this Senate would know, disagreement over the management of our most important river system and the food bowls which rely on it actually predates Federation. The first conference on the Murray was held in 1863, decades before Federation. More than 30 years later, South Australian Premier Charles Kingston, at the 1897 Federation Convention, declared he held out hope, and I quote:


… the Federal Parliament will be trusted with Federal questions of the gravity involved in the use of the waters of the Murray.


The history of conflict surrounding the provision of an overarching management framework for the whole basin also has its place in history, with recorded disputes among the colonies. At the 1898 Melbourne Constitutional Convention, the same Premier stated:


We ought to give the federal parliament which we propose to call into existence; the power—when it deems fit, to legislate on this question in order to remove this fertile source of conflict and friction between the colonies.


So despite the many conferences and conventions it took the severe Federation drought, which started in 1895 and was widespread by 1902, to bring the states together to come to some agreement on the management of the Murray. A conference in Corowa, in 1902, provided the catalyst, eventually resulting in the River Murray Waters Agreement, signed in 1915, by the governments of New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and the Commonwealth. This was followed by the formation of the River Murray Commission, in 1917.


The economic value of the basin's water resources to the states—South Australia, Victoria and New South Wales of course—has seen a legacy of construction resulting in a highly regulated system.


Since the early 1900s numerous water regulation structures, dams and weirs, were built. Almost not a drop of rain falls in the basin and gets to run unimpeded into the sea. Instead, water is stored in dams, weir ponds and modified storages like Menindee Lakes.


By the late 1960s drought, the overextraction of water for irrigation and rising salinity began to put the health of the Murray-Darling system on the radar of politicians and users alike and of course of the community more broadly.


But with increased regulation and an increase in surface water extractions, together with a drought in 1968, environmental impacts were starting to emerge. Water quality had deteriorated to the point that the first benchmark study of salinity, the GHD study, took place in 1970.


We fast forward to the drought of the early 2000s, the millennium drought, as it was clear that more needed to be done. Under the Howard government, the National Water Initiative was agreed and the Water Act 2007 was passed through the parliament.


And now, thanks to the extraordinary efforts of the former minister for water, the member for Watson, since 2012 we have had a basin plan that is restoring our rivers to health, supporting strong regional communities and ensuring sustainable food production.


The Murray-Darling Basin Plan—or the 'Basin Plan' as it has been referred to—has bipartisan support at the federal level and the support of the basin states: South Australia, Victoria, NSW, Queensland and of course the ACT.


Importantly, it has also had the support of farming, environmental and Indigenous groups. Not everyone has had their way of course. Not everyone got all they wanted from the plan, but it remains supported. The plan supports the very important environmental needs of the basin rivers. Within the basin there are approximately 30,000 wetlands; over 60 species of fish;    124 families of macro-invertebrates; 98 species of waterbirds; four threatened water-dependent ecological communities; and hundreds and hundreds of plant species supported by key flood plains.


So it is obvious that this is a very important, if not the most important, system to Australia. The health of the river channels themselves and the flora and fauna they support is not only vital in its own right but vital for the economic and social wellbeing of basin communities.


Related to environmental needs and environmental flows is the fact that Aboriginal nations and communities in the basin want and should have access to the flows they need to ensure the continuation of their culture and their social and economic wellbeing. Aboriginal people feel a deep connection to their land and the waters that flow through and across them. This needs to be recognised and provided for, not as an exercise in imperial patronage but by ensuring that Aboriginal people are empowered through water rights. And when environmental water is released into the rivers and wetlands Aboriginal expertise also needs to be heeded. The deep knowledge of Aboriginal people of the river systems means that they have important, if not vital, advice to give our water managers that, if heeded, can add great value to their work. Groups such as the Northern Basin Aboriginal Nations and the Murray Lower Darling Rivers Indigenous Nations have a lot to offer us, if we listen 


Engagement with Aboriginal people in the basin cannot be done as a 'tick-box' exercise: proper, ongoing engagement will benefit us all.


The Murray-Darling Basin also supports agriculture on a grand scale—around 40 per cent of Australia's agricultural production. According to ABS figures, in 2012-13 the basin accounted for over 50 per cent of Australia's irrigated produce, including nearly 100 per cent of Australia's rice, 96 per cent of Australia's cotton, 75 per cent of Australia's grapes, 59 per cent of Australia's hay, 54 per cent of Australia's fruit, 52 per cent of Australia's production from sheep and livestock and    45 per cent of Australia's dairy.


Around two million people live and work in the basin, in communities ranging from fewer than 1,000 people to large urban centres such as Wagga Wagga, with over 45,000 people. A further 1.2 million people depend on its water to survive. All of this agricultural production and the two million people living in the basin rely on a healthy, functioning river system. So, restructuring and reform in such an important area as this is always very difficult. I suppose it can be said that the bill before the Senate is about redressing the issues still held by some of those basin communities in particular.


The Basin Plan brought into force in November 2012 will set basin-wide sustainable diversion limits and return 2,750 gigalitres to the environment. Basin states are required to prepare water resource plans that will give effect to the sustainable diversion limits from July 2019. Under the sustainable diversion limit adjustment mechanism, up to 650 gigalitres can be provided through supply measures and projects that deliver environmental outcomes with less water. Proposals for these supply measures are, I understand, in varying states of preparation and assessment at the moment. There is bipartisan commitment to bridge the gap between what these supply measures can provide and the 2,750 gigalitres to be returned to the environment.


On top of the 2,750-gigalitre target, an additional 450 gigalitres will be returned to the environment. Funding was provided through legislation in 2013 for this additional 450 gigalitres, which must be obtained through projects that ensure no social or economic downsides for basin communities, such as on-farm irrigation projects. There is $1.78 billion in the Water for the Environment Special Account, including $200 million for the removal of constraints identified in the constraints management strategy.


To date, more than 1,900 gigalitres have been recovered for the environment. This includes more than 1,160 gigalitres of water through water purchases, over 600 gigalitres through infrastructure investment and over 180 gigalitres through other basin state recovery actions. This is water that can be used at appropriate times and where it is needed to improve flows and help restore health throughout the system. Already, we have seen successful water releases overseen by the Commonwealth Environmental Water Holder and the state and regional water management agencies.


Importantly, there has been significant Commonwealth investment in ensuring that farms remain productive as the plan is delivered. Indeed, $2 million a day is being and will be spent on efficiency and infrastructure measures out to 2019. This is not only a significant amount of money; it is a significant commitment to the Basin Plan, to the health of our rivers and to our ecosystems and communities they support.


As I mentioned earlier, Labor recognises the government's wish to provide certainty to basin communities by placing a cap of 1,500 gigalitres on water purchases. As with the Basin Plan itself, and many aspects of it, there are conflicting points of view that do need to be acknowledged on the issue of water purchase versus infrastructure measures as the best means of achieving the outcomes of the Basin Plan. Labor has consulted with various stakeholders with divergent points of view about this issue and carefully considered their points of view. I have listened to those points of view myself, and that is what an effective opposition does.


We have carefully considered the position of the basin states as well. Again, on that basis we will not be opposing the bill. Given the support of the basin states, we will not be standing in the way of this bill in the interests of bipartisanship—which has always, of course, underscored the strength of our progression to the point we have reached today.


For the opposition, there are two key imperatives for the success of the Basin Plan and these imperatives are the same for our approach to the cap on water purchases. These are bipartisan support at the federal level; and the support of all the basin states. Given that there is support from the basin states for this reform, as well as the progress that has been made to date in recovering water for the environment, Labor will not oppose this bill.


As I said, the success of the Basin Plan has always rested on that bipartisanship and, of course, on the support of those key basin states—particularly New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia. The Murray-Darling Basin Plan 2012 has been a success story in and of itself. As I said in my second reading speech, I do pay tribute to the then minister, Tony Burke, the member for Watson, who did a tremendous amount of work to ensure that we are where we are today in debating this bill. He did a tremendous amount of work on the Murray-Darling Basin Plan, on the issues raised by stakeholders and member states.


In considering the depth and detail of the bill before us, Labor will support it and vote with the government on this bill.

"Rhiannon, Sen Lee",AG,2015-09-09,"



Senator RHIANNON
 (New South Wales) (17:44):  The Water Amendment Bill is a sloppy piece of legislation. It is very confusing, and when you sit down and read it you really wonder what the purpose of it is. What is the intent? Clearly the government has an aim here. You start to wonder what the driver is. What is the political interest going on here? What was the intent of the Liberal and National Parties when they came up with this? You would have to conclude that it is to support their constituency—agricultural big businesses—and it looks like the Nationals were probably a key driver, because the more you look into this legislation the more you come to the conclusion that it is about unravelling the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. This is an incredibly serious point with regard to water policy in this country, the driest continent on earth. We have already seen under this government the demise of the National Water Commission, effectively, and the National Water Initiative. Now the intent is to unravel what was already a compromise—the Water Act was already a compromise—and we should remember that as the government now pushes to have a cap in the legislation.


The starting point for any legislation on water should be that we live in an increasingly climate changed world. That should mean that we address the long-term certainties around water in the Murray-Darling Basin. That is how the Greens approach the critical issue of managing the Murray-Darling. But, as I said, this bill undermines the Water Act that it seeks to amend. The Water Bill overrides the Commonwealth's obligations to achieve the sustainable diversion limits mandated in the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. The bill limits how much water can be bought back from willing sellers. It is an extraordinary change. It really is incredibly serious. Now we hear that Labor is going to be sitting there with the Liberals and the Nationals and allowing this to go through.


The bill removes flexibility to achieve the aims of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. It is essential to managing water that we recognise the importance of the current plan. In a political, budget constrained environment, and into the future, the responsibility of the government to invest wisely in cost-efficient and proven effective outcomes should also be a given. The bill risks substantial expenditure of public monies on projects that may further reduce the net amount of water available to groundwater or downstream water users across the basin. With this in mind, the Australian Greens do not support the passing of the bill. When you look into issues around water policy, certainty is so important, and that is something that this bill removes. The health of the Murray-Darling river system—the protected wetlands, basin communities, the flood plains, agricultural soils and crops—requires certainty at some level of water flow. To achieve the health of the basin rivers, certainty of flow is absolutely paramount. This is particularly so for the downstream ecosystems and communities. The River Lakes and Coorong Action Group remind us that the Coorong and surrounds—and this is from their submission—'bears a great deal of the risk if the Murray-Darling Basin Plan fails to restore the health of the River system and achieve the objects of the Water Act 2007'.


What do we mean by certainty? Certainty of a guaranteed buyer is central. The water licensees who wish to sell water entitlements surplus to their requirements need the certainty of a guaranteed buyer in the Commonwealth, especially when times are tough. The Commonwealth itself needs to be certain that it has flexibility to meet its legislative and ethical obligations to achieve sustainable diversion limits through the purchase of environmental water licences from willing sellers when needed. The bill itself needs to provide certainty in its aims, definitions and outcomes. But it contains no certainties. It is a confusing piece of legislation. Again, it is about unravelling the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. So much time and so many resources went into that plan, with such a fundamental compromise already. It was a small step forward, but now it looks like we will be left with nothing.


Any speakers in this place who say otherwise—that it is not full of uncertainties—are misleading the public. What you see here, I believe, are the proponents of the bill walking both sides of the road. We said this regularly with the Nationals and I will be interested to hear their comments. It is classic: selling themselves that they are there for the farming folk and there for the farming communities. When you look into this bill you see that on the one hand they say that, but on another hand: who do they deliver for? This bill delivers for big water interests—big irrigators. Do not come into the debate and distort the Greens' position. We are not against all irrigation. We are about getting the balance right so that farming can be sustainable in this country as we face the incredible challenges of climate change. That is what a responsible government should be doing.


The 2007 Murray-Darling Basin Plan, with its supporting legislation, was written in response to what was then one of the worst droughts in Australia's written history. It is recognised that the overallocation of water from the Murray-Darling Basin has affected not only the ecological wellbeing of the rivers but also the long-term sustainability of the communities that run the length of those waterways and their water catchments and the amazing flood plains that make up the Murray-Darling Basin. Without healthy, flowing water in the Murray-Darling rivers and their tributaries, their irreplaceable environmental values and the communities that depend on the health of the basin's water will wither and die. This is not guaranteed, and this bill puts it under much greater threat.


The current Murray-Darling Basin Plan is informed by a shared recognition that a nationally coordinated approach to water reform is vital to addressing the overallocation of water out of the Murray-Darling Basin. As noted by the River Lakes and Coorong Action Group, the plan represents well over 20 years of planning and negotiation between many competing stakeholder interests. In their submission, the group states that the Murray-Darling Basin Plan should be implemented and evaluated as it was designed to achieve the agreed objectives of the Water Act 2007. I emphasise that point again, because this is what is being lost with this bill—a deep undermining of important legislation, the Water Act. Yes, the Greens criticised it at the time, but it was still something of an advance. We cannot go backwards to that point; we cannot see another fundamental aspect of managing our water resources cut up and divided in such a sinister way.


Central to the plan is the reduction of water extracted and diverted from the Basin to sustainable limits by 2019, stated in the 2012 Plan to be 10,873 gigalitres per annum. Now 2750 gigalitres of environmental water must be recovered each year with the option of offsetting this volume by supply measures. The ability of the Commonwealth to purchase water licences to meet the previously mandated recovery of 2,750 gigalitres per annum of environmental water is the safety net of the whole Plan and thus a central plank to achieving the objects of the Water Act 2007. 


I emphasise again that the 2,750 gigalitres was a major compromise, and it is worth remembering just how much of a compromise it was. Remember the years of debate, all the resources, all the experts and all those discussions. The scientific experts identified that what was needed was the return of an additional 7,600 gigalitres per annum of water to provide a high level of certainty to achieving the required environmental outcomes. Remember that when we use the term 'environmental outcomes' you should not try to narrow that down in a reductionist approach to this debate. Environmental outcomes are about the health of the whole system; it is about the health of the communities and about the productivity of the region. That is what we mean by 'environmental outcomes'. That is what many experts recommended in 2007. As I say, the 2,750 gigalitres per annum was a major compromise; that amount was seen as minimal for the health of the Murray-Darling river systems. We know that the Commonwealth is responsible for ensuring that the sustainable diversion limits or SDLs are achieved.


The SDLs should be able to live up to their name and be sustainable. Retaining the ability to purchase environmental water if any shortfall in water recovery occurs is essential to the Plan. That is how it should work, but this bill does not pass that test of being able to restore water. The bill imposes a limit of 1,500 gigalitres per annum on the volume of environmental water the Commonwealth may purchase to meet its obligations under the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. This is where it becomes incredible: the cap of 1,500 gigalitres in the bill is a rigid limitation. We know there are complexities in managing the water and we know terrible droughts can come, but putting such a low cap into the legislation will make it so much harder. 


It really is a very deep betrayal, particularly when we see Labor, the Nationals and Liberals lining up on this. Surely, there should be more debate and surely we should be listening to the excellent submissions that warned us about what could happen if this bill passes. To share another voice from those submissions, let me quote that of the Murray Lower Darling Rivers Indigenous Nations: 


By placing additional costs and restraints on the Commonwealth’s ability to recover water for the environment, the Bill will severely hamper its ability to meet Water Act objects…


That is the essence of the problem that we have here. This bill does not line up with the intent of the Water Act. It is actually about dividing it up. There was also a joint submission from the Australian Conservation Foundation, Environment Victoria and Environmental Justice Australia. Their submission stated:


Our primary concern with the Bill is that the cap will be in the Water Act itself. Since the Water Act takes precedence as a legal instrument over the Basin Plan, honouring the cap will take precedence over honouring the SDLs.


That is why I keep saying that it is about unravelling the very important work that was done in bringing forward that Water Bill.


If the Commonwealth cannot meet the SDLs via infrastructure upgrades or efficiency measures—because, for example, they become prohibitively expensive or they simply do not deliver the amount of water required—it will not be able to use buy-backs to bridge the gap. That is the advice from the ACF, Environment Victoria and Environmental Justice Australia, and that advice should be followed. The warnings are there and they are clear. There is no indication in the bill as to what would happen if the Commonwealth finds itself in this position, because as further noted by that joint submission and that from the EDOs of Australia: if the Commonwealth cannot meet its obligations to bridge 100 per cent of the gap to meet the SDLs, the gap would then become the reasonable excuse—remember that is the term: 'the reasonable excuse'—trigger in the Basin Plan that would allow the states to exceed the SDLs, the sustainable diversion limits. Again, the proof is there and we had it laid out before us. The submissions clearly show how this bill will unravel and undermine the Water Act to such a dangerous extent where we are left with no plan for the Murray-Darling.


This bill creates a framework that effectively allows governments to walk away from their commitments to the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. With no remaining liability to meet the SDLs, with no requirement to meet the sustainable diversion limits—that is what we are talking about here. This is simply unacceptable. It should be unacceptable to all senators and to all parties, but again we know that the Labor, Liberal and National Parties are all working together in this most backward piece of legislation. I have described the bill as 'sloppy' and 'confusing' and that is shown even in the fundamental definitions. The expression 'long-term annual average quantities of water' is used, but what does it mean? There is no certainty as to whether the 1,500-gigalitre limit is on entitlements or on long-term annual average entitlements. Because so much of it is unclear, that is why you start to question the intent. It is not just about the cap at 1,500, it is not just about 1,500 gigalitres, it is not just that the cap is actually this time in the act, it is also about the definition, it is about whole piece of legislation. You are left wondering what the intent here is.


Submissions by the EDOs of Australia—ACF and the organisations that put in the joint submission—take up this deficiency in the bill. They have questioned it very deeply. The Inland Rivers Network stated:


… there is no definition of what this means or how it is to be calculated, over what period of time.


It is an extraordinary way to craft legislation. We do know that unbundling of water from land has created a new asset that many irrigators have chosen to sell to create new wealth. This bill puts this asset at risk. Again, how extraordinary that we have the Liberals, the Nationals and Labor putting this asset at risk. This is another very serious outcome if this bill is passed.


The bill removes the current surety businesses have that a guaranteed buyer—the Commonwealth—will be available should they wish to sell water entitlements surplus to their requirements. The Nature Conservation Council of New South Wales in their submission examines the case of a farmer who has achieved required water efficiency and seeks to sell any part of their water entitlements as a positive investment. In their submission the NCC New South Wales stated:


Constraints on the purchase of water for the environment through the market will reduce demand and therefore market prices, reducing the potential for financially viable investments.


This bill is contrary to the notion of open markets. The coalition is supposed to be the party of open markets, and there are times that they work and do assist, and this has been an example of it. Here we have a bill that is contrary, as I said, to the notion of open markets that this government trumpets. It is contrary because it seeks to remove the choice for farmers to sell surface water entitlements in the open water trading market.


A number of submissions to the inquiry, including the ones from the EDOs of Australia and the Inland Rivers Network, reminds us that a 2012 Marsden Jacob Associates survey of the MDB water entitlement sellers found that 80 per cent of irrigators considered that the sale of their water had been a positive or very positive outcome and that a large number of those sellers remained in the area and continued farming. I share that information because it contradicts one of the myths that has been put around to try to justify this change with regard to water assets.


The EDOs of Australia note that contrary to assertions that, 'banks directly forced irrigators to sell water', the 'survey results suggest that irrigators made the decision to sell by themselves, in consultation with family and advisors taking into account their assets and liabilities, uncertainty about future water availability, and other factors.' We saw the way that the water assets system was set out under the plan has worked very well.


The Greens do share the concerns of the Murray Lower Darling Rivers Indigenous Nations, the River Lakes and Coorong Action Group, and the other groups that have put in very well thought out, very well argued submission to the inquiry on this bill. The Murray-Darling Basin is already suffering deep decline. The Murray-Darling Basin Plan was important and is a contribution and is certainly a positive, but probably so much more was needed. Rather than going forward, with this legislation we are going backwards.


For that reason the Greens will move a second reading amendment. I move:


At the end of the motion, add:


but the Senate is of the opinion that water purchases managed under the Act should be driven by an evidence-based approach premised on the latest climate and hydrological science.


This legislation is a great set back. I recommend our amendment. It is the one contribution we can make to try to get water policy in this country back on track.

"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2015-09-09,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (18:04):  I too stand today to speak about the Water Amendment Bill 2015, and I commend this bill to the Senate extremely enthusiastically. I think it is one of the most significant pieces of legislation for the rural and regional communities of this country, particularly those communities that are along the length and breadth of the Murray-Darling Basin's rivers and tributaries.


Before I actually talk about why I am so keen to support the Water Amendment Bill, I want point out a few things to the House and some factual inaccuracies that have been put on the table, some scaremongering and some completely unnecessary comments that have been put forward by some groups who have sought to undermine this piece of legislation. Firstly, I draw the attention of the House to the dissenting report of the Australian Greens party, which is a report that was tabled yesterday. The Senate Standing Committee on Environment and Communications, of which I am the chair, inquired into this particular bill, and the Australian Labor Party and the coalition both agreed that this bill should be passed. However, the Greens did dissent, and there are a couple of things in their dissenting report that I believe should be put on the record for the factual inaccuracy of what it said. In paragraph 1.3 of their dissenting report in relation to the 1,500-gigalitre cap on water, which this piece of legalisation seeks to amend in the Water Act, the Greens stated:


It undermines the very Act it seeks to amend by overriding the Commonwealth's obligations to achieve the Sustainable Diversion Limits mandated in the Murray-Darling Basin Plan by limiting how much water it may buy back from willing sellers.


First and foremost, I want to very clearly put on the record it that in no way, at no time, never has there been any intention by the introduction of this piece of legislation for the coalition and obviously with the support of the Australian Labor Party that we would ever move away from the targets that we said we would stick to for the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. Those targets of 2,750 gigalitres and the additional 450 gigalitres, which take it up to 3,200 gigalitres of water returned to the environment, are targets that nobody, but nobody, has ever sought to move away from. I think it is mischievous of the Greens to suggest that there is in any way any intention by anybody in this process to move away from those targets. It is entirely unreasonable, it is mischievous and, in a sense, it is quite damaging because it seeks to undermine the very process the Greens, purportedly, are there to support.


Another comment in the Greens dissenting report was at paragraph 1.6, where they say of the bill:


It risks substantial expenditure of public monies on projects that may further reduce the net amount of water available to groundwater or downstream water users across the Basin.


I am not quite sure how they managed to come up with that particular statement. There is nothing at all in the legislation and there nothing in terms of real, substantiated and scientifically based evidence that would suggest that that is in any way true. There is nothing at all to substantiate that, and I note that in their dissenting report the Greens do not really give any reason for why they would make that comment suggesting less water would be available to groundwater or downstream water users. There is no reason whatsoever that that would be the case. As I said, we have never, ever previously moved away from the sustainable diversion limits mandated in the Murray-Darling Basin Plan.


Furthermore, in paragraph 1.9, the Greens make the comment:


The water licensees who wish to sell water entitlements surplus to their requirements need the certainty of a guaranteed buyer in the Commonwealth, especially when times are tough.


There is absolutely no need for the Commonwealth to be in that marketplace. Since there has been a little bit of stabilisation in the market, we have already seen that the water market is finding its own level—pardon the pun. One of the main things that were a real problem was that, because the Commonwealth Environmental Water Holder was such a substantial player in this market, its capacity to influence the water market very quickly, when something changed, was creating such a level of uncertainty that the growers, irrigators and others who wanted to participate in the water market were never quite sure from one day to the next what the market was likely to do. 


For example, to draw your attention to how volatile the water market was, in 2007 the price of high-security water in the downstream regions in the southern connected Basin reach in excess of $1,200 for the temporary purchase of water for a 12-month period. When you consider that at times the purchase of permanent water has barely reached that amount, you can see how incredibly volatile this market can be. So, having such a big buyer in the marketplace can sometimes be a bad thing. If we just allow the market to operate as the market should operate, with genuine buyers and sellers of water on a commercial basis, the market will find its own price. Once again, that comment by the Greens was quite ill informed and perhaps a little bit mischievous.


Another comment made in the Greens' dissenting report was:


Only willing water entitlement sellers will sell their licenses. Indeed the unbundling of water from land has created a new asset that many irrigators have chosen to sell to create new wealth.


I think Senator Rhiannon made reference to this in her contribution a moment ago—that only willing sellers were selling their water. I can advise Senator Rhiannon that that is not the case. I come from a community in South Australia that is reliant on the River Murray for its very existence. Without the River Murray and the irrigation communities, my community would not exist. Many, many people sold their water entitlements in the past few years because of pressure from the banks. Sure, many of them did make a decision based on their business operations at the time, but in many instances those business operations were in such a dire state because of the uncertainty about their future due to water; the amount of water that had already been taken out of our communities and had put additional pressures on those that remained; and other impacts like the high price of the Australian dollar, low commodity prices and the like. So, while these people were not forced in any way, shape or form to sell their water by the Commonwealth Environmental Water Holder or by the Commonwealth government, many of them were in a position where they had no choice but to relinquish their entitlements because of the bottom line and pressure from the banks.


The survey from which Senator Rhiannon was quoting was done in  2012. It needs to be noted that that survey was undertaken at a time when there were very high quantities of water in the river. We had had a couple of years of extremely high inflows into the river, with very high rainfall in the catchment area. It was also before the implications of the start of the implementation of the Basin Plan had been seen. Quoting from a survey done at a time when there were a whole of circumstances that are largely irrelevant to the situation we find ourselves in today is probably opportunistic in terms of using a report that suits your argument but does not necessarily accurately reflect the current situation.


In the committee's hearings during the process of inquiring into the bill, the most disappointing thing was the obvious complete and utter selfishness of organisations like the Australian ENGOs, some of the green groups and even the Alexandrina Council from down around the Lower Lakes. My argument to them is that there is nothing at all in this legislation that should give anybody any concern that we do not intend to meet our targets as set by the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. Therefore, why would an environmental group even care where the water came from as long as those targets were met? To be out there actively advocating that we should not have a cap on water—something that irrigators have been desperately crying out for and something that will be of immense benefit to our irrigators, our irrigation communities and the support businesses that rely on them—and that these people cannot have the kind of security that this piece of legislation is likely to deliver is, I think, the height of selfishness. All the narrative about establishing the Basin Plan in the first place was around the fact that we needed a certain amount of water for the delivery of water for environmental purposes.


I think in the end we established an agreed position on the amount of water that we would seek to return to the environment. For ENGOs and some of the green groups to come back and say that we need to take more money from irrigators and not even allow a process that tries to get water other than by taking it out of productive use is, I think, just extraordinary. It beggars belief that they would even consider that that was an acceptable thing to do. As I said, the most important thing about this piece of legislation, which caps the amount of water that can be returned to the environment from buybacks at 1,500 gigalitres, is that it means our river communities can now have some certainty and surety into the future about the decisions that they are going to make around their businesses. 


For the last four or five years, perhaps even longer than that if you take into account the impacts and the effects of the millennium drought that the basin has been suffering from prior to the Murray-Darling Basin Plan negotiations and initial implementation, irrigators have been living in an extraordinary world of total uncertainty. They do not know from one day to the next what is likely to be taken out of their community. They have no idea of what their entitlements are likely to be. They have no idea of what the future of their community will be, and they have seen their communities decimated by a thousand cuts. One week we take this amount of water out of the community. The next week somebody sells their water because they are desperate. The next week somebody sells some more of their water, possibly because of an opportunistic reason where they see it as a way of getting out and liquidating some of their assets. 


What we have seen over the last six, seven, eight and nine years is extraordinary uncertainty for the communities in the basin. The possibility of being able to return some certainty to those irrigators and the irrigation communities by them knowing that only a small amount of water is likely to be taken out of productive use from buying it back from irrigators means that they can now start making plans about their future—whether they are going to replant or whether they are going to seek to buy water. It would give stability back to the water market and allow the price of water to stabilise for the first time in as many years. This is really good news for our river communities. 


As I said, I was really quite distressed to think that the ENGOs and the green groups would think of denying irrigators the opportunity to be able to get some certainty back into their lives simply because they think there might be some hidden agenda here somewhere and somehow, all of sudden, miraculously, the Australian government, the Senate or, for that matter, the Australian Labor Party would countenance moving away from the mandated targets that we were seeking to achieve. 


The other thing that is probably really quite distressing in the debate that we have seen from the Greens and the ENGOs is the suggestion that the coalition actually does not care about the environment. At the end of the day, the sustainability of our entire community is going to rely on a healthy river system. We recognise very clearly that a healthy river system is something that is absolutely essential. But there is no point in us having a healthy river system when we have achieved an excess of water but we have actually taken it all from productive use and there is no more water available in the basin for agricultural production. That seems to me like a very short-sighted approach to achieving water for the environment. 


What we have always said—and it is something that I have said in my community for as long as I can remember—is that we should always seek to achieve the water for the environment by means other than by taking water out of productive use. Only when we have exhausted every possible avenue within our financial limits to achieve water targets by alternative means, whether it is by constraints management, whether it is by on-farm or off-farm efficiencies or whether it is by works and measures—whatever it happens to be—only when we have exhausted every single one of those options should we start taking water out of productive use. We are a very lucky country and we have the opportunity for future economic prosperity through agriculture, but we are not going to be able to realise that agricultural prosperity for Australia if we take water out of productive use before we even try to implement efficiencies savings in the system. 


There is one thing that I think has been missed in this whole argument, particularly by those ENGOs and the like who gave evidence. When I asked the ENGOs of Australia how many of the people who worked in their organisation actually lived outside of a capital city, how many of them lived, resided and participated in communities along the Murray-Darling Basin system, their answer was that they had no-one. What I would like to say to many of these groups who are very happy to stand up and grandstand about these things is that maybe it would do them the world of good to go out and spend some time living in these communities to realise that the very people who rely on the water that comes out of the river are the people who are striving to do the right thing by their river system. 


If you look at the impact that has occurred within the irrigation districts in the place that I live, in the Riverland of South Australia, from the amount of water that has already been taken out of our irrigation communities, you will see that it is having a Swiss cheese effect. What it is happening is that when you take 20 per cent or 30 per cent of the water out of a community, the remaining 70 per cent of irrigators still have to pay for the infrastructure for the delivery of their water. They still have to pay all the overheads and the costs of pumping a lesser amount of water to a lesser amount of farms. So all we end up doing is pushing out the price of water and reducing the productivity in the region. This is not a responsible way to go about addressing this problem. I am not saying that, at the end of the day, the fact that we have had to take some water out of productive use may not have been necessary. It just disappoints me that we do not make that way of getting water the last resort; instead, we go out and take in excess of 1,100 gigalitres of water. 


The other thing that I would like to put on the record is that in South Australia we have met our basin and valley targets of returning water for environmental purposes. Every single drop of water that has been returned in South Australia for environmental purposes in order to achieve the outcomes of the sustainable diversion limits in the Murray-Darling Basin Plan has come from irrigators—every single drop has come from irrigators. I do not think it is unreasonable for irrigators in my home state of South Australia to feel comfortable about not having any more water taken from them until such time as all other avenues have been exhausted. 


Before I conclude my remarks, I would like to say that on 27 August the SDL stocktake report was tabled. The SDL stocktake report is an independent report. It was commissioned and undertaken by independent assessors. It came back and said that, of the works and measures in the projects that had been put forward to try to return water that had been put up by the state governments across the Murray-Darling Basin, in its independent opinion, after undertaking the assessment, the water recovery targets that were in train at that time after being significantly discounted and being very conservative estimates would already deliver 500 gigalitres. We said we would deliver 650 gigalitres by this means. The SDL stocktake report said we were already on track to get a 500 gigalitres. If you consider the level of discounting that had been applied to the application and calculations of the existing projects, there was a huge amount of confidence in the report that the full 650 gigalitres of the water recovery targets would be able to be met and that possibly more than 650 gigalitres would be able to be returned through the works and measures that were on foot.


In conclusion, it gives me great pleasure to be here and to be able to say to the Senate that I support the Water Amendment Bill 2015 that seeks to put a cap at 1,500 gigalitres on the amount of water that is able to be bought back from irrigators as part of the targets that are sought through the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. It gives me pleasure because I believe that it is the right thing for our river communities. I think it is the right thing for our economy in Australia. I think it is a responsible form of action to take to ensure the one thing that we said we would do in the delivery of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan, which was deliver a triple bottom line.


Initially the plan was skewed towards only environmental outcomes and was devil may care about the consequences for our river communities and our irrigators. We successfully changed it in conjunction with the opposition, which was then the government. I think that we achieved a very sensible outcome. We sought to achieve an environmental outcome that reasonably and rationally considering the communities that live along the river and that rely on water and irrigation. I commend the bill to the Senate.

"Canavan, Sen Matthew",Nats,2015-09-09,"



Senator CANAVAN
 (Queensland—Nationals Whip in the Senate) (18:24):  I also would like to rise to give my support to this bill, the Water Amendment Bill 2015. I want to say up-front that nothing in this bill changes the amount of water that will be provided for environmental purposes under the Basin Plan. That figure broadly remains at the level of 2,750 gigalitres, although there is an adjustment mechanism in the Basin Plan which provides some of range around that figure. This bill does not change that one iota. It does not change the amount of water that will be provided to the environment.


When I was here earlier listening to Senator Rhiannon, she said that somehow this revealed that the Nationals in particular and the coalition by extension do not care for the environment and are not prioritising the environment. The question that has to go back to her is: how does this reveal any lack of concern for the environment when it does not actually change the amount of water that will be provided to the environment?


It changes only one thing. What it does change is how we will recover that water to provide for the environment. The isolated opposition of the Greens to this reveals their true agenda. It is not to protect the environment. It is that they oppose irrigation. It is not that they want to protect wetlands. It is that they do not like intensive agriculture and they want to destroy jobs in the communities that rely on intensive agriculture for their livelihoods and sustenance and which produce the affordable foods that Australians are used to being able to consume. There are many, many farmers that rely on the Murray-Darling Basin and many families that rely on those farmers earning an income. The Greens want to make sure we have unrestricted buyback to rip the economic guts out of these communities and to rip the economic rug out from underneath those farming families.


We in the National Party and in the coalition generally are opposed to that kind of approach. We are opposed to that kind of approach because we support families that live in the basin. We support the jobs that have been created in the basin. We support the very diverse and affordable food that all Australians can eat thanks to the Murray-Darling Basin.


This is something that is really important for the whole country. It is not just important for the 2.1 million people and families who live in the basin. It is important for all Australians because we all rely on the food that is grown in the Murray-Darling Basin every week when we go down to Coles and Woolies. Every week when you go down to the supermarket you are most likely buying something that was grown or started being grown in the Murray-Darling Basin because it accounts for a full 40 per cent of agriculture in Australia. Australians are used to being able to have pretty cheap food. They are used to being able to access food at a low price. There is nothing wrong with that. But if we were to shut down the Murray-Darling Basin, which the Greens want to do with their crazy target of 6,700 gigalitres, that would completely remove the ability of Australians to buy cheap food in their shopping trolleys every week. It would not just affect the families in the basin; it would affect every family in this country if we were to follow the Greens approach, stop our ability to grow food and make food more expensive across our entire country. I do not support that. I want to support the people who grow our food in this nation. This bill helps to do that. It helps to do that because it re-emphasises that this government is committed to finding an environmental outcome which is practical and does not reduce the productive capacity of Murray-Darling Basin communities.


There are two main broad ways to recover water. There is a third way which I will go into later in my speech, but there are two main broad ways to recover water to go back to the environment. I agreed with Senator Rhiannon when she mentioned in her speech that we have overallocated water in the Murray-Darling Basin. All sides of politics agree with that. Indeed, it was the former Howard government that kicked this process off on Australia Day in 2007. There was an overallocation. But there are two broad ways to deal with that overallocation. One way is to buy the water back from farmers and reduce the amount of water that is used for food production and therefore reduce the amount of food that is produced in the Murray-Darling Basin. That is one way.


The other way is to invest in ways of using water more efficiently so that we can still produce the same amount of food in the basin at the same prices we currently enjoy and have the same number of jobs but put the water savings made from those efficient investments towards the environment. That is the other way to do it, and I believe that we should emphasise that way and not the buyback way. The buyback way destroys communities, it destroys jobs and it lessens our ability to grow cheap and affordable food. The infrastructure way is the smart way because it makes us use water smarter and more efficiently. We can still provide that water to the environment, but we will not undermine the economic efficiency of basin communities.


That is exactly what this bill does. This bill does that because it gives basin communities, the 2.1 million people in the basin, the certainty that the Basin Plan will not buy back more than 1,500 gigalitres. That is a lot of water. In round terms it is three times the size of Sydney Harbour that we will be buying back every year, on average. But it is much better to cap that amount to provide that certainty than to leave an open-ended commitment that does not allow people in the basin to plan for their futures and invest in their own lives.


I noted that Senator Rhiannon talked about the need to provide certainty to the environment, that frogs and fishes and wetlands and trees and all these other wonderful things in God's green planet deserve certainty on how to plan their futures. I think that people deserve that certainty too. I think people are part of our natural environment, a pretty important part of our natural environment and just as important, if I may go out on a limb, as trees, frogs and wetlands. They deserve certainty, and this bill provides them with that certainty.


There has been some contention and controversy that the Water Act cannot deliver a triple-bottom-line approach, which is what I am proposing here. I think we should treat people, the environment—trees and frogs—and society—the social structure in our communities—on an equal and level playing field. I think they should all be considered in a balanced way when we come into this place and make decisions on these matters. Those decisions need to be informed by the values we have, not just by the raw numbers and data that we have access to, because it goes to a values choice about how much you value someone's job and community. Those things are really important and they should be considered on an equal basis with environmental factors. That is what is broadly known as a triple-bottom-line approach.


I can understand why some consider that the Water Act may fail to deliver such a triple bottom line, because in the construction of the Water Act at a federal level it did get quite complicated. At a federal level the Commonwealth government does not have constitutional powers over our river systems. This applies particularly in relation to irrigation: powers over irrigation are reserved for the states under section 100 of the Constitution. So when the Water Bill was going through the parliament in 2007, other heads of power had to be relied on to provide the Commonwealth government with the powers to legislate in this field. That influenced the drafting of the Water Act. This is most prevalent in section 3, in particular—the objects of the act. Objects (a) to (h) are listed—I do not know how many that makes—but the key ones in this context are objects (b) and (c) which state:


(b) to give effect to relevant international agreements …


—and all of those agreements relate to environmental issues such as wetlands and migratory birds—


(c) in giving effect to those agreements, to promote the use and management of the Basin water resources in a way that optimises economic, social and environmental outcomes …


That is a description of this triple-bottom-line context, but it is important to note that that triple-bottom-line definition is preceded by the qualification 'in giving effect to those agreements'. Those international agreements, as I said, all related to environmental factors.


There is great legal controversy about whether or not those international agreements provide the government and the MDBA with the flexibility to act in a triple-bottom-line manner. I will not go into much more detail, but sections 20 and 21 are also relevant in this context, where the words 'giving effect to relevant international agreements' are repeated. Section 21 begins with the preamble that the Basin Plan is 'to implement international agreements', then later in that section it says that the Basin Plan is to have regard to things such as social, cultural, Indigenous and other public benefit processes and the consumptive and other economic uses of basin water resources. But again, those economic, social and Indigenous priorities are all subordinate, in a way, in those sections of the act, to the overarching environmental factors. That has clearly given rise to some concern that the Basin Plan will not be implemented in a triple-bottom-line way.


This bill helps to remove those concerns, because it clearly states that the government's approach will be defined by capping the amount of water that can be bought back and capping it in a way which limits the economic harm caused by reduced consumptive and productive water use in the Murray-Darling Basin. We will instead seek to implement those other ways of recovering water—the more efficient, smarter ways—so that we can act in a way which does not harm people's jobs, does not take families off their farms and does not reduce our ability to grow cheap and affordable food.


There was something else in Senator Rhiannon's speech which grabbed me: apparently we are doing this to help big water corporations, or some such. Corporations always seem to be the bad guys in the Greens' fairytales. Water licences are now primarily owned by the Commonwealth government, but they are not the ones of interest in this particular piece of legislation. The facts are that, apart from the environmental use of water, water licences are primarily owned by family farmers in the Murray-Darling Basin. They are the people who own the asset, but they are actually not the people that we are trying to protect and target with this legislation, because they have an asset. They have a licence. As much as I want to see farming continue in this country, and intensive agriculture continue in the Murray-Darling Basin, they are not as harmed as other people when water is bought back. Under the buyback proposal an irrigator, a licence holder, has the option to sell their water licence, to achieve a good price for that asset and then have the flexibility, with those resources, to do what they like with the rest of their life. They can move to the Gold Coast or they can buy another farm somewhere else. Indeed, some of them have sold their licences and then bought other licences elsewhere. I think Senator Nash would well remember the Kahlbetzer family, who were able to sell, how much was it—




Senator Nash:
  $300 million.




Senator CANAVAN:
  $303 million worth of water licences, I think, to Senator Wong. You only get one Senator Wong in your lifetime, and Kahlbetzer has certainly made every post a winner on that deal—$303 million worth of water licences were bought by the Commonwealth government and he took off to Africa and bought massive amounts of farms and water licences there, and we were left with effectively just air. I cannot remember—I stand to be corrected—but I think that $303 million bought 109 gigalitres of water. If I were over next to Senator Nash in the chamber, I could ask the departmental adviser. But 109 gigalitres works out at about $3,000 a megalitre—about 50 per cent higher than the usual average going rate for water. It was a great deal for one of those parties, and it was not the Commonwealth government; it was the Australian taxpayer, unfortunately. Those are the options available to irrigators. They have that flexibility after they sell their licences, and good luck to them. 


But there are other people who do not have that option; they do not have that flexibility. When water is bought out of a small town and economic activity falls, the people who own the motel, the tyre shop, the newsagency, the bakery or the service station do not have any water licences—they do not get any bailout from the Commonwealth government—but their turnover and their revenue definitely fall. Their businesses are definitely affected. That has been an unfortunate consequence of the Basin Plan, but we want to limit that unfortunate consequence.


Just last year I was up in St George—I was there a few months ago as well. Last year I particularly went to speak to people in St George, a country town in south-western Queensland that relies heavily on irrigated agriculture. A big water licence was bought near a smaller town close to St George called Dirranbandi. That has had a terrible effect on the town. Agricultural consultants have had to leave because there is no more business for them. The wider business community has been affected, and it is causing quite a bit of harm.


The problem for St George is that there is still a lot of work to do. Under the Basin Plan, St George is slated to have its water use reduced by around 100 gigalitres. I should say that this is for the wider Condamine-Balonne region, but, under the current proposal, most of it will come from the St George area. Then there is potentially a common pool amount which would possibly amount to around 50 gigalitres from the area, depending on the review that will be done over the next year. So they are facing a 150 gigalitre reduction. It is about a 50 per cent reduction in water use in that district. It is a third of the overall Condamine-Balonne district. For various reasons that I will go into shortly, at the moment there is not the plan to take water from those areas. They will lose half their productive asset, half their economic asset. The whole town is only there because of this. St George exists because 30 or 40 years ago we built a place called Beardmore Dam. Other farmers came into the area and built ring tanks to store water from overland flow and started growing wheat, grains, cotton and all these other products that have sustained St George. It is a beautiful town, away from the coast, in our nation, and we should protect towns like St George. I certainly want to make sure they continue to flourish in the future.


At the moment we have achieved 50 gigs or so, so we have 100 to take back, possibly 150. At the moment around 50 gigs have been recovered in the Condamine-Balonne. What has been really disappointing is that, of those 50 gigs, only about four gigs—last time I checked it was about four, but it may have changed—was recovered through infrastructure, through that option of getting more efficient. The other 46 have been recovered through buyback. If that proportion continues, St George will no longer exist in its current form, unfortunately. It will be a much diminished town. I do not want to see that. I want to protect against that happening. That is why this cap is very important. It is very important to pass this cap, but it is not the only thing we must do to save towns like St George.


I would like to conclude by briefly talking about some other issues that we need to tackle in this field to protect towns like St George—issues that I hope will be taken up in the inquiry by the Senate Select Committee on the Murray-Darling Basin Plan, which is visiting St George for a hearing on 29 September. I encourage all residents in the area to go along to that hearing, to make submissions and to have their views heard. Particularly, we have to get smarter at delivering the environmental benefits we want to deliver. For the Greens this is about reducing intensive agriculture. For those of us that are the rational political parties in this country—and I include the Labor Party in that—it is not about reducing intensive agriculture; it is about protecting the environment. That is what our goal should be. 


When you go to St George and to the wider area, you learn about the environment. The Murray-Darling is not just one big old dry carpet like it is down here on the floor, where you put water down on one end of the carpet and it flows to the other end. It is not a series of interconnected garden hoses. It is a very different and diverse system. It covers a huge area across our country. In that part of the area, when you put water in and try to deliver a water-flow event, often the water will not push down the river system unless there is a big flood; it will bifurcate at the end of the river systems into wetlands, and those wetlands are often the ones we want to target and provide water to. But we can do that in a smart way or in a silly way. We can buy back water haphazardly and chuck water down the river. There are assets we can use in this region to make sure we get the same environmental outcome without destroying towns like St George and destroying the livelihoods of the 2,000 people that live there and the lives of about another 2,000 that live in the area. There are weirs on the Culgoa and Balonne rivers in the area that we can use more efficiently to direct environmental flows towards environmental assets in a more efficient way. 


The Commonwealth Environmental Water Holder are now the biggest irrigator in our country. They own the most amount of water right now—about 1,160 gigalitres of water. They are the biggest irrigator in our country and they need to get smarter about how they water their fields, just like we have expected farmers over the years to get more efficient at watering their own fields. They can do that by using assets in this region to make sure that, when we put water down the Balonne, half of it does not go down the wrong river and end up watering stuff which is actually not that much of the priority or not as important as other environmental assets. There is a weir there we can use and upgrade to direct the water to the appropriate places. I do give credit to the government, which has had a number of reports prepared on these issues recently, but now we need to act in the next couple of years to make sure that we do get smarter with this way of recovering water. I would add that we need to think about getting water from places other than just St George. There are other environmental assets upstream in the Condamine-Balonne region, around Chinchilla and Dalby, which also should be considered, particularly to minimise the impact on St George but also to help the micro and macro invertebrates is that part of the system. 


The final thing I want to say is that this should not just be about water; this is about the environment. Just adding water is a simplistic way of trying to deal with this issue. This is not a cake mix that you buy down at your local shops and just add water to make it work. It needs a lot more sense to get a productive environment in our Murray-Darling system. We need to be smarter about this and look at what we are targeting, which is the environment, not people's jobs, which is what the Greens want to do.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,22,2,speech
"Bernardi, Sen Cory",LP,2015-09-09,"



Senator BERNARDI
 (South Australia) (18:44):  It gives me great pleasure to rise and speak on the Water Amendment Bill 2015. Water is one of the most important resources for our nation. More specifically, it is a vital element for the prosperity of my state of South Australia. There has also been the rather vexed issue about who owns and has rights to the water as it flows through the Murray-Darling Basin. I remember the spirited discussions and debates we had in the past with our Nationals cousins, particularly from Queensland, who were obviously concerned for their communities whilst South Australians were desperately concerned for the wellbeing of their communities. I also acknowledge that there has generally been a bipartisan approach. We had some differences with the now opposition when they were in government, but there has generally been a bipartisan approach to the need to get the balance right.


You cannot just advocate for environmental flows whilst ignoring the impacts on and the costs to local communities, many of whom are entirely dependent on the health and wellbeing of the Murray-Darling Basin—none more so, I would posit, than some of the communities in South Australia, who did it extraordinarily tough during the 10 years of drought when people like Tim Flannery and the Greens party were telling us that it would never rain again, the rain would not fall in the right spots, that we would all have to move north or to Tasmania, or whatever their claim of the day was. The reality is it was a dreadful drought and emotions were very high. People were fighting very hard for their livelihoods and their communities and to represent the interests of their states. But through it all there was an acknowledgment and an acceptance that the Murray-Darling Basin is a national river system. We have to coexist and use it wisely.


It used to frustrate me when we would discover at Senate inquiries and Senate estimates that there were thousands of kilometres of illegal structures in other states that were used to store water—they had no approval—when we had communities in my Riverland region of South Australia that were desperately in need of water allocations for their citrus crops. A huge toll was taken on many communities. Some farmers and growers left the land. Some risked it all and rolled the dice to see if they could continue building their prosperity. Some were successful and, unfortunately, some were not. But through it all there was general goodwill. The general goodwill was that the Murray-Darling Basin is the lifeblood of many communities. We have to come to a compromise that will provide benefits to the communities, meet our nation's requirement for a food bowl and, of course, achieve the environmental outcomes that are very important for the long-term health of any ecosystem.


I am pleased to be speaking on this bill. The coalition has committed to implementing the Murray-Darling Basin Plan in full. It has committed to doing it on time; it has committed to doing it on budget. But, perhaps most importantly, it is going to have what some refer to as the triple-bottom-line focus that, as I mentioned, supports and maintains healthy, viable communities and the environment for the future. It is acknowledged—and there may be some dispute about this in other areas of Australia—that the basin is the food bowl of our nation. We need to make sure it is used sustainably. We need to make sure it is used prudently to ensure the survival and prosperity of both our communities and the environment for future generations. As a father—and even those of you who are not parents—I understand that we are the custodians of this land, we are the stewards of the resources and we need to make sure we are preparing our country for the challenges ahead.


I am delighted to say that we on this side of the chamber—and I acknowledge that it is not going to be opposed by those on the other side—are committed to working with the people of the basin to make sure that farmers and communities are viable and sustainable for the long term. It is not just about us; it is about future generations. The government, through the hard work of ministers and through the representations of many backbenchers who have a vested interest in this, from the point of view of representing the community—but who also have a clear and unambiguous understanding of what needs to be done—has worked with all stakeholders to deliver this triple-bottom-line outcome.


It is about delivering greater certainty. When there is greater certainty, there is an opportunity for businesses, community leaders, civic leaders, local governments, state and federal governments—every organisation imaginable—to plan for the future. Perhaps the greatest risk to planning is the unknown. The whims and dictates of bureaucrats, governments or personalities are the things that can have a dramatic impact, more often negatively than positively, in the sustainability and viability of our regional and rural Riverland communities. The government has tried to deliver that certainty. It wants to deliver certainty for farmers, businesses, communities and, very importantly, the environment, and that is what this bill does.


I will just touch upon some of the key elements of the bill. A key element for certainty for communities and businesses is how the government is going to cover its legislative obligations, principally in recovering water for the environment. The coalition has had—and I acknowledge Minister Birmingham's work on this when in opposition—a strong, steadfast and long-term commitment to returning the Murray-Darling Basin to health, whilst also recognising and supporting agriculture. It is no good having one without the other. It is no good just chasing the agricultural basket and ignoring the health of the river or the river system. Of course you cannot sustain it without a healthy river system, and yet there is no point in having a healthy river system if it is not going to be able to be utilised for the benefit of all Australians, not just the environment. It is about getting the balance right. 


This is a common-sense and logical approach that I wish was applied more often in seeking legislative outcomes. But we have it here. The government has followed up on its election commitment to give priority to investment in water infrastructure efficiencies that return water to the environment through water recovery by purchase. Investment in infrastructure is the primary method of recovering water to improve the basin environment. I have observed some of that lack of infrastructure firsthand on a number of occasions. I want to pay credit to the South Australian Riverland communities who have invested very heavily in infrastructure to prove themselves to be some of the most efficient users of Murray-Darling Basin water. But there is a sense of frustration at times when you drive through the Riverland and you see the overhead watering of certain crops in the middle of the day, and that is simply because the infrastructure is not strong enough to cope with the demands for watering—the pipes are not big enough, and the cost of putting bigger pipes in is prohibitive particularly in difficult times. But there is this commitment from these communities that they want to do the right thing, so they install drip irrigation, they try to use appropriate methods, and going to such inefficient methods of watering is a last resort. It is driven by a lack of infrastructure; even so, they have done a mighty job. The frustration is compounded when they see, upstream, much less efficient methods of watering. That is a source of frustration and I know it is something the government has acknowledged, and I know that many other communities acknowledge that, given the right incentives, given the right infrastructure, they can do a better job as well. That helps the entire health of the system.


So the government has followed through on its election commitment, and that is what this legislation is about. It is about the government meeting its election commitment to cap water purchases and focus on the triple bottom line outcomes through improving our agricultural efficiency. This is an unprecedented investment—some $12 billion to implement the Basin Plan, with several outcomes in mind but, to sum it up, to better manage our waterways through the provision of improved key water infrastructure that will benefit the environment and agriculture. Every single day between now and 30 June 2019—some senators probably will not be here in 2019, Madam Acting Deputy President O'Neill, though I have no doubt that you will be—there will be $2.5 million invested in the future of agriculture in the basin. That is $3.9 billion going into infrastructure that will improve farm efficiency and productive capacity while returning water to the environment.


Earlier today we heard from Senator McKim in his first speech about how sustainability is the key driver for the next 100 years. When I was listening to the contributions made here I noted that the Labor Party got that mantra—they understand that sustainability is important and that is why they are not opposing this bill; they understand that investment is the key to getting productivity outcomes and environmental outcomes. What I do not understand is how Senator Rhiannon, from the Greens party, could stand up and say the Greens were opposing this bill—they are opposing it when it is all about getting better environment outcomes along with better agricultural outcomes. It is a win-win—$12 billion invested into a plan to protect the environment and protect agriculture in this country, and there are people that are opposed to it! That makes no sense when it was said earlier today that sustainability is the key driver of the next hundred years. I would suggest that we have to take with a grain of salt the Greens' supposed commitment to better environmental outcomes. There is no balance there—there is no balance at all. 


To prove that there is a human dimension to this and that we are not just talking generically about communities or groups of farmers, over 10,000 individual irrigators have benefited from the government's water efficiency programs that underpin the government's approach to implementing the Basin Plan. Already, 10,000 irrigators are doing better from a productivity point of view; they are delivering better environmental outcomes as a result of the government's approach to implementing the Basin Plan. Part of that plan is about a water recovery target. I mentioned before that $2.5 million a day is going to be spent through until 2019—and there is also a water recovery target of 2,750 gigalitres by 2019. We are going to prioritise water recovery efforts through investment in on-farm and off-farm water-saving infrastructure and efficiency projects over water purchasing.


Madam Acting Deputy President, I regret that I am unable to complete my remarks tonight because I have to replace you in the chair. But there is a lot more to say. I think we need to herald the brave, courageous approach that the government has taken. I acknowledge that the opposition have chosen not to oppose this legislation for petty politicking's sake—they may have had some variations in how they might have approached it, but they recognise that this is a very important step for the security and sustainability of both our environmental river system in the Murray-Darling Basin and the agricultural communities that rely so much on it.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,22,2,speech
"McKenzie, Sen Bridget",Nats,2015-09-09,"



Senator McKENZIE
 (Victoria) (19:00):  It gives me great satisfaction to commend this particular bill, the Water Amendment Bill 2015, to the Senate. I do thank those opposite and the Labor Party for supporting its passage through the other place. 




Senator Kim Carr:
  Why are you holding it up then?




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Bernardi
):  Order!




Senator McKENZIE:
  Senator Carr—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Ignore the interjection, Senator McKenzie, and please address your comments through the chair.




Senator McKENZIE:
  Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. Here is Senator Carr, from my home state of Victoria, who sat through the discussions in our own state about the Murray-Darling Basin Plan—and how contentious it was. You saw, over and over again, rural and regional communities, which feed the food processors, in the western suburbs of Melbourne, who actually underpin your preselection. The workers in those food- processing outlets are funding and supporting you in your preselection process and yet you do not want to sit and listen anymore to us talking about legislation that will allow them to go on producing the fabulous, clean, green produce that our great state produces. Senator Carr, you harp on about advanced manufacturing and science, and yet you do not want to sit and listen to me—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Address your comments through the chair, Senator McKenzie.




Senator McKENZIE:
  Through you, Mr Acting Deputy President, you do not want to talk about what will underpin agriculture production in our home state, Senator Carr, and food processing, and so many jobs of the Australian Workers Union in the food production sector going forward. And that is this piece of legislation, which caps water buybacks at 1,500 gigalitres. It is a happy, happy day that we bring forward this legislation.


This government and, I hope, the opposition also recognises that the Murray-Darling Basin is the lifeblood of food production in this country—from Queensland, right through New South Wales to the great food production state of Victoria, right through to your own home state, Mr Acting Deputy President Bernardi, of South Australia. Water, as the Minister for Agriculture is often quite fond of saying, is wealth. If you are involved in agriculture in any way, shape or form, without water you cannot really do much. Ask the UAE! They have huge food security issues as a result of a lack of water. 


The basin is the food bowl of our nation and we need to use it sustainably. We need to use that resource very carefully and in a considered manner. There has been a huge debate publicly. I remember public forums in Mildura where some of the horticulturalists up there actually had effigies, if you like, for want of a better word, of parliamentary bureaucrats and, indeed, parliamentarians with concrete-filled gumboots. They were throwing them into the Murray-Darling River as a result of some of those community forums where hundreds of people turned up to tell the then minister for water, Minister Burke, and Craig Knowles, what they actually thought of the process of constructing the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. They told them that it was a little airy-fairy and that we were picking out numbers and not focusing on outcomes. I think what the independent report, released last week, actually shows is that they were right. We had identified the environmental assets that we as a nation thought were important to protect and the fact that we had to collectively share water in order to ensure their sustainability and ongoing health. But we did not have a number on what that looked like. The environment is fickle: sometimes it rains; sometimes it does not. What you need one year to keep those particular assets healthy, you might not need another year.


The report released last week showed that we have been really good at what we do and that some of those assets need less water, but I will get on to that a little later. I want to talk us through just how important the Murray-Darling Basin is and indeed irrigated agriculture. Located within the Murray-Darling Basin are 40 per cent of Australia's farms; 70 per cent of our irrigated land area; nine per cent of people are employed in agriculture and related support service industries; and about three per cent of people are employed in food product manufacturing and agricultural product wholesaling. 


Indeed, as I mentioned in my comments, through you, Chair, to Senator Carr, there is food-processing, production and export industries in capital cities right through the Murray-Darling Basin states that actually provide many jobs. Over 300,000 jobs are currently in food manufacturing in Australia and over half of those are located in regional Australia. So there are many jobs tied up in ensuring the ongoing sustainability of agriculture production throughout the Murray-Darling Basin.


We did have a millennium drought. Irrigated agricultural production is a significant industry and, in 2012-13, it contributed $6,800 million. In 2013 irrigated agricultural production in the basin accounted for over 50 per cent of our total irrigated produce and 100 per cent of Australia's rice. Isn't it fabulous that we are exporting rice to the world? From a water perspective, we can actually produce rice really efficiently. Ninety-six per cent of Australia's cotton is grown in the basin; 75 per cent of Australia's grapes, and most of that is in my own home state of Victoria, right in Andrew Broad's great seat of Mallee; 59 per cent of Australia's hay; and 54 per cent of Australia's fruit. And did you know—here is a little known fun fact—that 80 per cent of Australia's pear production actually comes out of the heart of Senator Carr's state and mine, and that is the Golden Valley, the heart of irrigated agriculture in Victoria? And 52 per cent of Australia's production of sheep and livestock, and 45 per cent of Australia's dairy production are undertaken in the basin. When you look at our dairy production and what it is actually contributing, off the Melbourne wharfs, it is our largest export every day. I am sure there are a few MUA workers whose jobs rely on the great Murray Goulburn, which produces fabulous product right throughout Victoria but indeed in the irrigated agriculture sections, particularly around Shepparton, Katunga and the like.


But it is not just about agricultural production, as we have discussed. This is about getting a triple-bottom-line result. This was always about getting a triple-bottom-line result for agricultural production and the ongoing financial sustainability and local economic benefits, not only for famers but for the regional communities in which they find themselves. It is also about the environment—those environmental assets that as a nation we have deemed important enough to share water on. Let's face it: water did not get into the Constitution; it was not a Commonwealth responsibility, because we were fighting about it then and we are still fighting about it. So, to actually have a bipartisan approach is quite fabulous, because it took a while to get some of the states onboard.


Did you know that the Murray River is actually the only river in the world that has its own flag? That is how important that river is to us, to our heritage and to the construction and pioneering spirit of those who came before us. But I will not bore you with that. Let's get onto the details of the bill. I think what is so exciting about how we have actually found the solution on how to balance those competing social, economic and environmental interests is that we have chosen to invest our money in infrastructure to assist farmers, to get some productivity gains, to ensure that they still can compete with the world with our fabulous clean, green product. We are investing $2.5 million every day, up to 2019, in the future of agriculture in the Basin—$3.9 billion going into infrastructure that will help improve farm efficiency and productive capacity while returning water to the environment. That has taken some work.



Senator Kim Carr interjecting—




Senator McKENZIE:
  I think about the water minister for Victoria at the time, and I know Senator Carr that you will join with me in thanking the previous Liberal-Nationals party state government's water minister, the leader of the Nationals in Victoria, Peter Walsh, for his very strong stance on this. He was not going to get steamrolled by South Australia. He was not going to get steamrolled by New South Wales. I know the now minister, Minister Neville, will be very thankful that the minister ensured that Victoria absolutely brought home the bacon when it came to positive outcomes with respect to the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. He showed absolute leadership in that area, and I know Minister Neville will be very happy to oversee the implementation of that plan.


The 1,500-gigalitre cap on water purchase was a key pre-election commitment by the coalition, and we have done several Senate inquiries into the Murray-Darling Basin Plan and its various iterations over the course of the last government. Everybody in this place will be very clear that we were always going to back communities' capacity to provide their own wealth for their families and find those savings. I heard Senator Rhiannon's comments around needing to focus on having a strong evidence base, backed by science. I could not agree more. How can we make decisions on how to balance competing interests by using anything other than science? I think the more evidence we gather through this process, the more reviews that we do, the more we go through the actual implementation process and work out how much water we need in any given space, that will become a really exciting space. I look forward to the Greens' support of those various reports, which will absolutely be backed with science. Putting a certain number of gigalitres down the river and forgetting that the Barmah Choke exists I think just shows that evidence is really, really important; having an understanding of the local context of the policy outcomes you want to implement is really, really important.


On 5 August the Commonwealth, along with the New South Wales government, announced a $263.5 million investment for round 5 of the On-Farm Irrigation Efficiency Program. This investment upgrades farm infrastructure in the southern New South Wales basin, returns 20 gigalitres of water to farmers and returns 77 gigalitres of water to the environment, which I think is really important. When we talk about an evidence base, as I mentioned earlier, there was an independent stocktake report—which I am not sure you mentioned, Senator Rhiannon, but hopefully other Greens senators contributing to this debate may—on 27 August, into the sustainable diversion limit adjustment process. The report vindicated the progress of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan implementation and showed that projects are on track to deliver the environmental outcomes outlined under the Basin Plan. It actually showed that over 500 gigalitres less water is needed to meet the environmental targets in the plan and that states are on track to deliver the required projects. How fantastic that states and communities, farmer organisations and irrigation councils are working together to actually implement the Murray-Darling Basin Plan to the point that we are saving over 500 gigalitres of water. That is what we do know. It is not more water, Senator Hanson-Young, but less, which I think is absolutely fantastic.


Consultants Mr Turner and Mr Martin were chosen by the Basin Officials Committee to undertake the stocktake. This included not just assessing favourable projects that might give us the result they want. It was a comprehensive, independent report using a methodology that nobody could argue with—assessments of 36 supply and constraint measure proposals currently being proposed by jurisdictions as potential projects in the sustainable diversion limit adjustment mechanism. That is going to reduce the need for water recovery while still delivering the plan's environmental outcomes. That is fabulous news. So, congratulations, because when we look at water-recovery strategies—that is, buybacks and the impact of the former government's approach to finding water—that had devastating effects on our communities: $1 billion of taxpayers' money to devastate communities like the Pyramid Hill district, which lost over 50 per cent of its original high-security entitlement in less than a decade. We have the unrelenting buyback plan of the former government that devastated communities as water was removed from systems leaving a greater and greater burden on those who chose to stay.


We also had the millennium drought which further exacerbated the financial and mental stress on those families who were deciding if they should stay in the game—should they still be dairy producers—or should they sell their water entitlement and take their luck on the market with an ever-decreasing equity in their property? The former government's approach was very, very concerning, but I am very, very glad that they are on board with our commitment to infrastructure, and I am extremely grateful for their support in implementing this cut, because this is something that our community has called for—our farmer groups, the NFF, the irrigator councils and local producers right across regional Victoria were wanting to know that no more would somebody be swooping in and buying water in an open market with a chequebook that they could not compete with. They could not compete with the Commonwealth coming in and buying water for the environment and undermining them.


In the brief minutes remaining, I wanted to comment on some of the responses of the states, in particular over the last month or so, to this issue. On 7 September there was an article in The Landstating:


The South Australian and Victorian governments had opposed the 1,500GL cap, which threatened the fate of the Water Amendment Bill 2015 introduced into parliament in late May.


But the two states shifted position this week after the Parliamentary Secretary to the Environment Minister Bob Baldwin released an independent stocktake report on the progress of the environmental water flow targets—


The article went on to say:


Mr Baldwin—


the parliamentary secretary—


said the report showed that more than 500GL less water was needed to meet the plan's target, and it was reasonable to achieve up to 650 GL less water to meet the plan's 2750GL baseline target.


There were some issues, obviously—New South Wales southern irrigators are still disappointed—but the VFF in my home state is very, very happy. The South Australian and Victorian governments have both backed the federal coalition's plan to legislate the 1,500-gig cap on Commonwealth water buybacks, paving the way for bipartisan support. Obviously, both the Victorian and South Australian governments are led by the Labor Party. Minister Neville's spokesman said that the state was not opposed to the cap. The spokesperson for Minister Neville said:


We want to see certainty for communities and businesses in the (state's) north and environmental outcomes.


That is exactly what we want to see too—certainty—and I am so glad that Senator Carr is going to be voting in favour of this bill and supporting Minister Neville.




Senator Kim Carr:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order going to relevance. I am concerned that Senator McKenzie has not explained to us why there are six government speakers—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  There is no point of order. Resume your seat, Senator Carr. Senator McKenzie, you have the call.




Senator McKENZIE:
  I am so passionate about this issue—




Senator Kim Carr:
  No, you are not! You obstruct, you filibuster!




Senator McKENZIE:
  If you were equally passionate, Senator Carr, about the productive capacity of our home state, you would also be rising to add your voice to the National Party, to the Liberal Party and to crossbench senators who support the cap. If you look at my contribution on this particular topic over the time that I have been here, you will see that this is not the first time that I have spoken about it.




Senator Kim Carr:
  At length on a non-controversial bill!




Senator McKENZIE:
  Senator Carr—through you, Mr Acting Deputy President—just because you do not like the sound of my voice or what I am saying does not mean you do not have to listen.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order!




Senator McKENZIE:
  There are so many people supporting this. It is not just Senator Carr who is supporting this legislation, or the National Party, or the Liberal Party. The National Irrigators Council—Tom Chesson—said: 'We have long advocated for a legislated 1,500GL cap on water buybacks in the MDB and we welcome the legislation currently before the Senate to provide for this measure.' Equally, the NFF said that it is an excellent example of how to achieve good environmental outcomes while also taking steps to reduce the social and economic impacts of the plan on rural and regional communities. I am sure that the Labor Party country caucus will be rising in unison to add something other than carping from the sidelines and some positive input into this debate on such a significant bipartisan approach to water management and sustainable environmental outcomes.




Senator Smith:
  Carping—was that a pun?




Senator McKENZIE:
  That is very funny, Senator Smith. I will pay that, especially since irrigation channels are full of them.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Ignore the interjections, Senator McKenzie.





Senator McKENZIE:
  The National Farmers' Federation said that this was demonstrating significant goodwill, making comments publicly about how the uncertainty had undermined community confidence. If there is one thing you need in agriculture it is confidence. I commend the bill to the Senate. (Time expired)


Debate interrupted.

Senator SMITH
 (Western Australia) (19:20):  One of the characteristics of history is that we do not realise we are living through it until after the fact. As senior US presidential advisor, cabinet member and author John Gardener put it, 'history never looks like history when you're living through it'. However, today is one of those occasions on which we should appreciate a moment in history as it occurs, because the symbolism of the moment is one of rich significance for our country. Today, as senators will be aware, Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II becomes the longest-reigning monarch to occupy the throne. In observing that occurrence today, I believe we are doing more than marking the achievement of an individual sovereign, remarkable though it is.


Today's occasion is as much as tribute to the institution of the Crown itself as it is to the remarkable woman who has occupied the throne for 63 years and 217 days. Those who sing the words of 'God Save The Queen' pray that the monarch is 'long to reign over us'. We should of course be thankful that prayer has been answered.


It is entirely in keeping with the dignified and graceful approach to her duties as sovereign that the Queen herself has requested that today be one of simple observance, rather than one of celebration. After her lifetime of service and devotion to duty, it is entirely appropriate that Her Majesty's wishes be respected in this regard. At the same time, it is opportune to reflect on the values and traditions for which the Crown stands and which have undoubtedly sustained the Queen and nations of the Commonwealth alike over the long period of her reign.


They are values which are timeless and which the Queen herself pledged to preserve in a broadcast made on the very evening of her Coronation, on 2 June 1953:


Parliamentary institutions, with their free speech and respect for the rights of minorities, and the inspiration of a broad tolerance in thought and expression—all this we conceive to be a precious part of our way of life and outlook.


During recent centuries, this message has been sustained and invigorated by the immense contribution, in language, literature and action, of the nations of our Commonwealth overseas. It gives expression, as I pray it always will, to living principles, as sacred to the Crown and Monarchy as to its many Parliaments and Peoples. I ask you now to cherish them—and practise them too; then we can go forward together in peace, seeking justice and freedom for all men.


I think it is significant that at the moment she was crowned, the Queen's mind was very clearly focused on freedom of speech and the protection of minorities as being the ones that most clearly defined the values of the Crown and the Commonwealth it serves.


This spirit was also captured by an editorial in The Sydney Morning Herald, which appeared the day after the Queen's coronation, that noted the occasion was one for Commonwealth nations to 'count up anew the benefits of their unique association', because the Commonwealth stood 'as a bulwark of sanity and order in a bewildered world'. It went on to suggest that Her Majesty's coronation was auspicious; the dawning of a new Elizabethan age that could:


...forge within the Commonwealth a unity of purpose and a concentration of influence that could write a chapter...worthy to rank with the bravest chapters of the past.


I would contend that there was much prescience in that observation. Think about the role the Commonwealth played in the fight against apartheid in South Africa or the injustices perpetrated by Robert Mugabe in Zimbabwe—both situations in which Australia played a leading role.


Then, of course, there is the more recent Charter of the Commonwealth, signed by the Queen in 2013, which noted that Commonwealth nations are 'implacably opposed to all forms of discrimination, whether rooted in gender, race, colour, creed, political belief or other grounds'. In this statement, we hear echoes of the very same sentiments expressed by the Queen in her Coronation address. It is this consistency and sureness of purpose that explains the durability of the Crown in a world that is much changed.


So tonight I think it is appropriate to reflect on the relationship between Australia and the Crown—a relationship that has undergone significant change over the decades of the Queen's reign, but one which endures and remains strong. 


The Queen herself has opened sessions of this parliament on three occasions—in 1954, 1974 and 1977, all when parliament still sat at the Old Parliament House. Of course, she also opened this new and permanent Parliament House in May 1988 and has been a visitor to the building on several occasions since, most recently in October 2011. It was in her first address to the Australian Parliament, in 1954, that Her Majesty emphasised the central place of the Crown within Australia's parliamentary structure. At the outset, she noted the very first section of the Australian Constitution, which establishes that legislative power shall be 'vested in a Federal Parliament, which shall consist of the Queen, a Senate and a House of Representatives'. She went on to say:


It is therefore a joy for me, today, to address you not as a Queen from far away, but as your Queen and as a part of your Parliament. In a real sense, you are here as my colleagues, friends and advisers.


She then went on out outline those institutions for which the Crown stood and which are the foundation of the unity between the Commonwealth of Nations—being parliamentary sovereignty, a democratically controlled executive and the just and impartial administration of the law. As she noted:


They have, in this century, survived the greatest trials of war and economic hardship.


She also described Australia as a nation where 'growth and progress are manifest, a country of freedom, eloquent of that true democracy which dignifies and expresses the individual human being'. Those words ring as true today as they did when Her Majesty said them during her first visit here in 1954. This is not by accident, or chance.


The strength of the Crown endures because, in subtle but important ways, it is an institution that is constantly evolving, in a way that promotes its continuing relevance. The very fact that Australia's democracy is one of the longest-enduring in the world is a testament to the fact that the sinews of our system of government do not break under strain; they are supple and they flex to take account of modern needs.


For the myriad of cultural, language and economic differences that could potentially divide the nations which make up the modern Commonwealth, they instead remain bound together by commitments to personal liberty, religious freedom, the right to freedom of expression and an inherent understanding of the dignity and worth of every individual. In a 21st century context, these are the values that sustain support for the Crown across geographic boundaries and give it ongoing relevance in a changing world.


For supporters of the Crown within a parliamentary democracy, the continuing task is to highlight the role the Crown plays in promoting these shared values in a dignified, non-political manner, which strengthens unity and protects democratic ideals in the face of challenges from other ideologies around the world. Again, this is something which our present monarch has done with great acumen, with an eye to consistency and with enormous dignity.


On this day, when the Queen becomes our longest reigning sovereign, I am sure all parliamentarians would wish to join with me in acknowledging and thanking Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II for her lifetime of devoted service and dedication to duty. Long may she reign.
