"Minchin, Sen Nick",LP,2008-02-12,"—by leave—On behalf of the opposition, I congratulate Senator Evans and other ministers and office holders on their appointments. I congratulate the Labor Party on their election to government. They have been given an enormous responsibility by the people of Australia. It is our business and our job now to hold them to account for the responsibility they have for governing this great nation.
I inform the Senate that, as Senator Evans alluded to, I have been elected Leader of the Opposition in the Senate—a job I intend to hold for as little time as possible—and Senator Abetz the Deputy Leader. Senator Ellison is the Manager of Opposition Business and Senator Parry the Opposition Whip, with Senator Judith Adams as his deputy. Senator Scullion has been elected as the Leader of the Nationals in the Senate, and I congratulate him on that election and on his election as a senator for the Northern Territory. He will presently inform the Senate of other arrangements for the National Party.
For the information of senators, I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a list of the shadow ministry and parliamentary secretaries, including Senate representational arrangements.
Leave granted.

I would like to inform the Senate that at our party meeting on 17 December I was re-elected the Leader of the Greens. Senator Rachel Siewert was elected as our party whip and Senator Milne was elected as the party chair.

"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2008-02-12,"—At the request of Senator Bartlett, I give notice that, on the next day of sitting, he will move:
That the following bill be introduced: A Bill for an Act to amend the Defence Act 1903 to provide for parliamentary approval of overseas service by members of the Defence Force, and for related purposes. Defence Amendment (Parliamentary Approval of Overseas Services) Bill 2008.

Senator Bob Brown to move on 14 February 2008:
That the Senate—
notes the Reserve Bank of Australia’s concern about ‘significant inflation pressures’ and the Rudd Government’s call for wage restraint from Australian workers; and
acknowledges that parliamentarians should lead by example in that wage restraint.

Senator Milne to move on 14 February 2008:
That the Senate—
notes that at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) meeting in Bali, Indonesia in December 2007, an action plan was agreed to, which, inter alia, resolved to:
urgently enhance implementation of the United Nations Convention on Climate Change,
respond to the findings of the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, that delay in reducing emissions significantly constrains opportunities to achieve lower stabilisation levels and increases the risk of more severe climate change impacts, and
adopt a decision at the UNFCCC meeting in 2009 on the sustained implementation of the convention, through long-term cooperative action after the end of the Kyoto Protocol in 2012;
agrees that it is in the interest of current and future Australians that the Bali Action Plan succeed in producing an international agreement which minimises the risk of dangerous interference with the climate; and
calls on the Government to contribute in good faith to a timely successful implementation of the Bali Action Plan.

Senator Milne to move on 14 February 2008:
That the Senate—
notes that:
in December 2007, the Prime Minister (Mr Rudd) said that the Government believe that ‘climate change represents one of the greatest moral, economic and environmental challenges of our age’,
on 6 February 2008, the Minister for Finance and Deregulation (Mr Tanner) announced funding cuts to climate-related programs, including $3 million from the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation’s Research Vessel Southern Surveyor, $6 million from the Biodiversity Hotspots program and $42 million from the Renewable Remote Power Generation Program, and
in 2007, the Institute for Sustainable Futures at the University of Technology in Sydney calculated that perverse subsidies supporting fossil fuel industries amounted to between $6.4 billion and $7.2 billion in the 2005-06 financial year; and
calls on the Government to phase out perverse subsidies to the fossil fuel industry and to reverse its decision to cut funding to research into climate change science and renewable energy programs.",SENATE,<title>NOTICES</title>,<title>Presentation</title>,Notices,12,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2008-02-12,"—The opposition does not oppose this motion. However, I point out that there was an amendment to paragraph (2), inserting the reason why this should be given such priority. Obviously, it is a matter of history and that is why the words ‘That, recognising the historic importance of a National Apology to the Stolen Generations, the first item of business’ are included. I want to make that clear to the Senate.
The other aspect is that this is unprecedented in nature due to the fact that we will be having a debate with a limited number of speakers. The motion will then be moved and, later on, the debate will continue under the guise of ‘taking note’. That is unprecedented and, for the record—quite separate from the subject matter, which is an important issue—it should be recognised that this is an unprecedented procedure being used on a historic occasion. People who look back on this measure and the way it was dealt with procedurally should not take this as a precedent for the future. This is a course taken only due to the unique issue that we are dealing with. Normal procedure in the Senate is to have a debate. Once everyone who wishes to participate in that debate has spoken, the motion is put and then voted upon. That is the normal procedure. In this case, it will be different. We appreciate why and we have agreed to that, but, just for the record, we believe that the points I have made should be spelt out for posterity.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Rearrangement</title>,Business,13,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2008-02-12,"—On behalf of the Greens, I want to concur with the Leader of the Opposition but go further and say that we do not support the arrangement which effectively means that those senators who speak after the vote is taken will have their contribution to this historic debate downgraded. There is no way that that will not occur. Every senator is elected equal to this place and every senator has an equal right to contribute to this debate. At the end, the debate should go to a vote, not least because of but most because of the historic nature of the move to extend an apology to the stolen generations.
I am very concerned that there is a lack of respect for this chamber in this move by the government. We all have a right as senators to contribute to something as important as this. We know that the procedure tomorrow is being tightly controlled by the government, and we wish the government well. I will be contributing to the congratulations to the government on making this move, but the process in here is not right. It should not be depriving every senator of their contribution to this historic debate. It was simply a matter of the government scheduling the final vote to be taken on Thursday or giving everybody a five-minute contribution. We could have finished it tomorrow afternoon, but the government, in the process it has set out, is taking away from the due respect that every senator has a right to speak in this place. While we support the motion to bring on the matter for debate tomorrow, we do not support that component. I put on the record that we do not support the component which says that those senators who contribute after the vote will effectively be doing so as also-rans.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Rearrangement</title>,Business,13,1,speech
"Evans, Sen Chris (Leader of the Government in the Senate)",ALP,2008-02-12,"—I just want to make a couple of comments in response. I thank the chamber for the cooperation shown in terms of support for this motion. I understand that the procedure is unusual, but, as Senator Ellison quite rightly pointed out, this is a historic occasion. We have attempted to get the cooperation of the Senate in order to do this in a proper way and to show proper respect for those people who are waiting for the apology. I appreciate that Senator Minchin and other party leaders have shown cooperation on that. I understand, with 28 votes in this chamber, that I am not capable of delivering that on behalf of the government—that it requires the cooperation of others. I put on record my appreciation of that and the indication of support for the motion.
Senator Bob Brown, it is not a question of not respecting the chamber. When we discussed this at a meeting of the leaders and whips, we all understood that it is actually a question of respecting those Indigenous people to whom we apologise.
—We can respect those.
—Senator Brown, you were represented at the meeting and we just came to the conclusion that the best way was to have some finality to the issue on the day when the apology was made in the House of Representatives and that we did so in the Senate at the same time. That was the consensus that we reached. As I said, I appreciate the cooperation on that matter. What we have done in moving a second motion, effectively noting the apology, is try to facilitate the ability of all senators to contribute to the debate about the apology and to express their views on it. I know it is an unusual method, but it met the two requirements that we sought to achieve: firstly, to finalise the apology—have the expression of the view of the parliament on the day when the House of Representatives and the Senate debate the issue; and, secondly, to ensure that every senator has the ability to contribute to the debate.
There are a lot of government senators who want to speak, but the reality is that if we allow a full debate on the Wednesday, given the normal scheduling of events, it would not conclude on the Wednesday but would roll over to Thursday. If everyone who wanted to speak did speak, potentially it might have to then be deferred until we return in three or four weeks time. Clearly that is not an appropriate way to proceed.
I think we have come to a reasonable compromise. I understand the concerns expressed. I do not think in any way the contributions of senators later on tomorrow will be downgraded. They will be in the Hansard; they will be an expression of their views. I know Labor senators will take the opportunity to speak and I certainly will not devalue any of the contributions that are made. So I think it is a question on this occasion of balancing the respect for the institution of the Senate and its procedures with the respect for those to whom we seek to apologise on behalf of the nation tomorrow. I think we have got the balance right, and I appreciate the support of the chamber.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Rearrangement</title>,Business,13,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2008-02-12,"—I wanted to put briefly the Democrats’ perspective on this issue. I think, frankly, Senator Evans has got it about right. It is not an ideal process but it is an unusual arrangement, as I think has been said in another context. This apology is not about all of us getting a say; this apology is for Indigenous Australians. Obviously it is important what is said in this chamber and what is decided by this chamber and in the other place, but what is also extremely important is the experiences of so many Indigenous Australians, particularly members of the stolen generations themselves and what they experience tomorrow in particular. The role the Senate plays in debating this motion, and I assume in passing it, is just one part of that wider experience and the wider impact it will have on them.
I think it is right to suggest that this should not become a precedent as a matter of course. These are an unusual set of circumstances but there will be, of course, opportunities for all of us to put our views before this chamber, not just about this motion but the wider issues regarding the stolen generations, as I and many in the Democrats have for many years and as others will continue to do. When we are talking about a historic, unique and formal type of process and motion such as this, I think it is understandable to need to take into account not just our needs as a chamber but what works best, particularly for the many Indigenous people who are looking to tomorrow with great anticipation. That role should not be forgotten.
I would also note that my understanding is that, whilst less than ideal, it is still somewhat better than what is being proposed in the House of Representatives, where I think it is just the Leader of the Opposition and the Prime Minister and nobody else, neither Independents nor the National Party, who will get a guernsey at all there. What we have is a slight improvement on that and at least a recognition of the full diversity of voices who are getting an opportunity to be heard through the party representative structure. I think it is satisfactory given the context and is a unique set of circumstances. But, as all senators would appreciate, it certainly will not be the last time that the Democrats or anybody else, I imagine, hopefully, will be debating these issues, because there is a lot of other unfinished business regarding the stolen generations and the Bringing them home report and we need to be continuing to debate that in this chamber. The formal resolution tomorrow is a unique circumstance and, given the context and the other activities that are happening around here and in this house, as opposed to in this chamber, I think it is a reasonable compromise.
Question agreed to.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Rearrangement</title>,Business,13,1,speech
"Moore, Sen Claire",ALP,2008-02-12,"—Before I start, I would just like to put on record how deeply moved I have been listening to the condolence comments in the chamber this afternoon. They have been particularly moving and give great dignity to the people about whom they were created.
I want to talk about one of the icons of Australian entertainment, and that is Margret Roadknight. I want to stress at this point that her name is Margret, as she says when she gives her unique performances: M-a-r-g-r-e-t Roadknight. Last Saturday evening I was very privileged be able to attend a concert in Brisbane which was sponsored by the Brisbane Labour History Association with the help of the wonderful Woodford Folk Festival people and also sponsored by the Queensland Council of Unions. That particular concert was put on to celebrate songs of protest. It went by the astounding name of Rekindle the Flames of Discontent. Who better to be one of the headline acts at that particular function than Margret Roadknight?
During 2007 Ms Roadknight celebrated 44 years of performance across the world. Not just in Australia, but most particularly representing Australia across the world. You can see by looking at her performance history that she has worked on all continents. She has brought her unique style and also her passion for community, her passion for social justice and, most importantly, her passion for engaging the community with her skill. She has brought that to people across the globe, and done us proud as Australians as she has been there, so often, representing Australia.
I will quote from one of Margret Roadknight’s many reviews, and I do encourage people who may be listening to follow up some of the reviews that Margret has received in the last 44 years of performance. Margret has travelled to America many times because of the linkages with the folk and the music scene there. This was quoted in the Oakland Tribune in San Francisco:
... as much as for her impressive voice and choice of songs, Roadknight is delightful because she sheds so much fresh light on the nature of the world and its people.
This is her gift. She enjoys the world, she learns from her community and then she takes her special gift, her craft, her musicality and her wonderful voice to engage all of us.
Margret has been known most commonly for her love of social justice. When you look at her biography, you see that she has taken song to engage all of us in so many issues of social justice. While she is performing, she consistently tells stories to the audience—not just in her performance, but in anecdotes, sharing over those many years of performance and over 35 recordings. She laughingly says that her career spans the history of recording. She holds up LPs and then looks at video disks and DVDs. That shows that she has gone through most of the recent years of seeing how this industry developed.
In that time, she has taken her gift to look at what has been happening in our world. When performing, she often talks about one of her favourite experiences—one which we can share, because it is about the issue of peace. She has been a genuine peace activist for all of her life, not just in her recording period. She talks with great pride and humour about when she was privileged to play at a United Nations event in 1982 talking about nuclear war and disarmament. That is a continuing argument that we have in our world. Margret talks about performing in front of the world audience and doing her particular interpretation of that wonderful song, Imagine. Anyone who has been privileged to hear Margret Roadknight perform Imagine will not forget that experience.
As Margret performs, she engages with the audience and encourages all of us to use our voices because she says that voice is our tool; voice is communication. She says with authority that, towards the end of her performance before this massive audience, the electronic digital machinery around the top of the area began, without warning, to pick up the words of Imagine. So as her voice was ringing across the square, with thousands of people there and an international audience, as she was singing about peace, imagining a world with peace and crying for a world where we can make peace, across the area which shows the international news and also the Wall Street figures, the words of Imagine were being printed. She stood alone with her guitar and her voice and the world heard this message. She states that the world must continue to hear this message because we still have not attained peace. But Margret Roadknight will continue in the battle to ensure that we can.
Ms Roadknight also has the gift of engaging and teaching all of us to use our voices, because she is committed to see that the world can sing. Over these many years, she has always had voice workshops where she challenges all of us to use our own voices and she says quite rightly, ‘When you are happy sing; when you are sad sing louder.’ She says that is the way to perform and to make our lives better.
I am particularly keen to talk about Margret in this place tonight because over 20 years ago when this building was being created Margret was actually part of the Deep Bells Ring touring program, which she helped to develop, in which she and others travelled around work sites and talked to workers and people who were gathered around work sites and engaged them with the power of voice and the power of linking voice with getting across your message. I was speaking with Senator Lundy the other day and she was at the Parliament House work site when Deep Bells Ring headlined by Margret Roadknight was performed. I ask all of you who are here to think about how that message—with the workers gathered, talking about the songs of workers, the songs of construction—took a moment in the creation of this building. Now we are, more than 20 years later, talking about a major celebration of this wonderful building. I hope that, when we are actually celebrating 20 years of our Parliament House, we will be able to have Margret Roadknight’s voice again in this area, speaking about how with our voices we can share and make a difference to our world.
Margret speaks often about her travels and about the wonderful experience you can have travelling through other lands, learning their instruments, learning their music and sharing. For those of us who know Margret, she says that she ‘does not blend in easily’. She is a woman who I think claims a height of six foot five or more and she talks about travelling through China in the 1970s and 1980s. That image brings to mind a particular, classic image of a very tall and impressive European woman working with many of the Chinese people. She did stand out, but she was welcomed and loved and she still in performances today recounts some experiences and some of the beautiful melodies that she learnt from the Chinese people which she integrates into performance now. Margret learns from other communities. She engages with and enjoys their music. She then gives that the Roadknight touch, and that splendid voice, which is distinctive and extremely impressive, gives us the chance to learn so much about so many other cultures and ways of performing.
Margret is not a songwriter; she consistently says that she does not write songs. She gathers songs from other people and then presents them in her own way. It can be Chinese folk music, Israeli dance music, or the magical rhythms of South America or South Africa. I think some of my favourites of hers are from Australian songwriters. As a young woman, I remember going to folk festivals and hearing her particular version of Girls in Our Town and its message stays in my mind about the hope and the hopelessness of young women growing up in country towns. I also think she has a particular relationship with the music of Ted Egan. Some of her music celebrating women as pioneers have become anthems for women in our country and others. I want to give great praise to Margret Roadknight for her skill, for her passion, for her social activism and for all the entertainment and enjoyment she has given me and so many others. We remember her message: ‘When you are happy sing; when you are sad sing louder.’",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Ms Margret Roadknight</title>,Adjournment,19,1,speech

"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2008-02-12,"—The Minister for the Environment and Water Resources has provided the following answer to the honourable senator’s question:
There have been three nominations to the National Heritage List relating to the Burrup Peninsula and Dampier Archipelago. (b) The nominations are from the International Federation of Rock Art Organisations, Indigenous groups from the region, and the National Trust of Western Australia. (c) The nominations were received on 25 March 2004, 10 May 2004 and 24 May 2004, respectively.
I have not, nor has my Department, received a nomination for World Heritage listing. In accordance with the World Heritage Convention only the Australian Government can nominate places within its jurisdiction for inscription on the World Heritage List.
Yes. A request for emergency listing of the area was received on 19 May 2004. The request was subsequently withdrawn and the matter was concluded. A second request for emergency listing was received on 12 December 2006. On 22 December 2006 this request for emergency heritage listing was declined.
, (4) and (5) There are no provisions in the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 for appeals against proposed inclusions in the National Heritage List.
Yes. The Western Australian Government provided information under [then] section 324G (available on the WA Department of Industry and Resources website) and [then] 324H of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 in relation to the potential National Heritage List boundary and the economic and management implications if the place was included in the National Heritage List. I received correspondence from the Western Australian Deputy Premier in March and met with him on 16 April 2007 to discuss the timing of a decision on National Heritage listing and the development of Western Australian management arrangements. I also received correspondence from the Deputy Premier regarding the list on 2 July. My Department also met with officials from the Western Australian Government to discuss procedural aspects of the inclusion of the Dampier Archipelago in the National Heritage List and options for addressing the potential economic, social and management implications.
In 2003 there was correspondence leading to informal discussions between officers from my Department and Western Australian Government officials about preliminary and procedural aspects of a possible World Heritage Serial Rock Art nomination. These discussions did not continue following the commencement of the National Heritage listing processes.
Yes. The Department has commissioned two reports. The first report was completed in 2005 and was a desktop study of scientific values for Indigenous cultural heritage on the Burrup Peninsula and Dampier Archipelago. This report has been released to the nominators and to the persons identified under s.324G(4) of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 as owners and occupiers and Indigenous persons with rights and interests in the nominated area. In 2006 this report was updated, as information that could not be accessed in 2005 was subsequently made available for consideration. This second report was completed in August 2006.
On 3 July 2007 I acknowledged the Dampier Archipelago and Burrup Peninsula’s outstanding heritage value to the nation by including it in the National Heritage List. I also acknowledge it has significance of an international scale.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title>,<title>National Heritage List</title>,Answers to Questions on Notice,21,1,answer
