Mr STEPHEN SMITH (

Perth
—
Minister for Defence and Deputy Leader of the House
) (

by leave—The government is committed to providing regular reports and updates on Afghanistan, including to the parliament. I last updated the House on 10 May on a range of issues relating to Australia's detainee management in Afghanistan in keeping with my commitment to provide regular updates to the Australian people on detainee management and to be open and transparent on these matters. I undertook at that time to update the parliament more generally on Afghanistan following my attendance with the Prime Minister at the NATO/International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) Leaders' Summit in Chicago over the weekend. The summit followed on from the recent meeting in Brussels of NATO/ISAF Foreign and Defence Ministers, which I attended together with Foreign Minister Carr.




Chicago s
ummit



At the NATO/ISAF Leaders' Summit in Chicago on 20 and 21 May, the Prime Minister and I reaffirmed Australia's long-term commitment to Afghanistan. This was a valuable opportunity for the international community to commit to supporting Afghanistan post-transition, after 2014, so essential to secure Afghanistan's future. Australia's commitments to Afghanistan align with the key outcomes of the Chicago summit. Firstly, at Chicago, the international community reviewed transition and mapped the way forward in Afghanistan to the end of 2014. As President Obama said at the conclusion of the Chicago Summit, 'We leave Chicago with a clear roadmap. Our coalition is committed to this plan to bring our war in Afghanistan to a responsible end.'


In Afghanistan, transition is already in progress, with around half the population living in areas where the Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF) have begun taking lead security responsibility. The third tranche of provinces and districts will formally commence transition in the middle of this year, at which time three-quarters of the population will be living under ANSF security lead. It is expected that the final, and fifth tranche, will begin transition by mid-2013, the so called Lisbon milestone. At this point, with all of Afghanistan's population under Afghan National Security Forces security lead, ISAF's role will shift from combat to support. Oruzgan province will formally commence transition in the middle of this year and will likely have fully transitioned to Afghan National Security Forces responsibility over the subsequent 12 to 18 month period. 


Secondly, the international community is committed to continuing to fund, train and support the Afghan National Security Forces post-transition to consolidate and build on the security gains of the transition strategy. As the Prime Minister and I announced on 16 May, Australia will contribute US$100 million annually for three years from 2015 as part of international community efforts to help sustain and support the Afghan National Security Forces beyond the end of the transition process. It is essential that the international community provides the resources for ensuring the sustainability and effectiveness of the Afghan National Security Forces beyond 2014.


Australia has already contributed substantially to the development and sustainment of the Afghan National Army (ANA), pledging in 2009 US$200 million over five years to the Afghan National Army Trust Fund. Australia has a vital national interest in supporting Afghanistan's security and stability after transition. Our commitment to ANSF funding reflects these enduring national interests.


Thirdly, at the Chicago summit, the international community committed to supporting Afghanistan's development in the long-term. Australia's longer term commitment will be underscored by the Comprehensive Long-Term Partnership with Afghanistan, signed at the Chicago summit by the Prime Minister and President Karzai. This was foreshadowed by the Prime Minister in her statement to parliament in November 2011. The signing of the partnership confirms Australia's bilateral commitment to Afghanistan and sets out Australia's enduring cooperation and relationship with Afghanistan post-2014. It sends a signal to the people of Afghanistan, the Taliban and the region that the international community will not walk away from Afghanistan at the end of 2014.


Similarly, on 1 May 2012, the United States signed a strategic partnership agreement with Afghanistan, which provides a framework for their long-term bilateral relationship. A number of our international partners, including NATO, the United Kingdom, France, India and Italy have signed similar agreements.


Eighteen months ago at the Lisbon summit, in November 2010, the international community and the Afghan government set down a clear process and timeframe for transition of full security responsibility to the Afghan National Security Forces. Australia's own transition planning is entirely consistent with this strategy.


President Karzai announced on 13 May 2012 the third tranche of provinces and districts to formally enter the transition process. Australia welcomed the inclusion of Oruzgan province in this third tranche. The Afghan National Army 4th Brigade is progressing towards being able to operate independently, and is increasingly assuming the lead for the planning, preparation and execution of tactical operations. The Afghan security presence is expanding across Oruzgan province. We fully expect to be in a position to hand over security in Oruzgan province to the Afghan National Security Forces over the 12- to 18-month period that I have referred to. 


We must, however, continue to be present in support of the Afghan National Security Forces in Oruzgan, and be combat ready to do so until transition is complete. This means that, as transition progresses, the Afghan National Security Forces will take on more and more responsibility for security. But ISAF partners must remain ready to support them, as required.


After the completion of transition, our commitment in Afghanistan will look significantly different from the commitment we have today. Australia's commitment to Afghanistan will not end with the transfer of security responsibility to the Afghan National Security Forces in Oruzgan province. Australia has made clear that we expect to maintain a presence in Afghanistan beyond 2014 through training, military advisers, capacity building and development assistance. 




Civilian 
c
asualties



Let me deal with a range of other matters relating to Afghanistan. The government is committed to transparency and providing information on civilian casualties in Afghanistan to the parliament and the Australian people. The Australian Defence Force takes the issue of civilian casualties very seriously. The Australian Defence Force operates under strict rules of engagement intended to minimise civilian casualties, and deeply regrets any loss of innocent life. 


Today I update the parliament on the status of inquiries into the following civilian casualty incidents:


On 2 November 2010, following an engagement between an Afghan National Security Forces and Mentoring Taskforce 4 partnered patrol and insurgents in the Baluchi Valley region, it was claimed that a civilian had been killed by small arms fire.


On 27 March 2011, a small Afghan boy was seriously wounded, and an Afghan man was killed, during an engagement between insurgents and a partnered Afghan National Police Provincial Response Company-Oruzgan and Special Operations Task Group patrol. Sadly, the young boy, after receiving medical care, died from his wounds. 


On 29 October 2011, Australian soldiers engaged and killed a man who approached their site at speed and failed to adhere to all directions to stop. Unfortunately, the Afghan male was unable to be saved. 


An inquiry was conducted into each of these incidents. The inquiries are under consideration and I will advise on the outcomes of this consideration in due course.


On 1 May this year, an Afghan boy was injured during an engagement between insurgents and Australian Special Forces and elements of the Afghan National Security Forces undertaking a partnered security operation. The boy is receiving medical treatment and is expected to recover. As the Department of Defence advised on 9 May, an inquiry is underway on this matter. When completed, the inquiry will be considered and I will advise of the outcome in due course.




Combat 
f
atality 
r
eports



I now turn to an update on Inquiry Officer Reports into deaths of ADF soldiers in Afghanistan. All Inquiry Officer Reports into combat deaths which occurred in 2010 have been completed, the respective families have been briefed on the outcomes of the inquiries and the outcomes of the inquiries have been made public, or not, as appropriate.


In 2011 there were nine incidents resulting in the combat deaths of 11 soldiers. Family members have been briefed in relation to five of the nine incidents. Briefing the family members in relation to three of the nine incidents will be progressed as soon as possible. Once the Inquiry Officer Reports have been considered by the families, the reports will then be presented to me for consideration for public release. I regard the wishes of the family so far as public release is concerned as a relevant material factor to consider in publication of the report beyond the family itself and others directly affected.


In relation to the ninth incident involving the 30 May 2011 crash of the Australian CH-47D Chinook helicopter in Afghanistan, on 4 April the Chief of the Defence Force advised that he had appointed a commission of inquiry into the incident in which Lieutenant Marcus Case was tragically killed.




Detainee 
m
anagement 
u
pdate



I turn now to detainee management issues. Since my statement to the House on 10 May 2012 on detainee management in Afghanistan, I can provide updates on a number of issues. 




CCTV failures



I have previously reported to the House on the temporary loss of CCTV footage at the Australian Defence Force Initial Screening Area (ISA) in Tarin Kowt. As noted in my report to the House on 9 February 2012, I asked the Department of Defence to investigate whether any of these failures in the CCTV footage coincided with allegations of detainee mistreatment. I can now report to the House that Defence's review of detainee files has revealed that no additional allegations of detainee mistreatment were identified during the time of the CCTV outage. 




Interrogation



As previously reported, the government has agreed to extend the time selected detainees could be held in Australian custody at the Initial Screening Area, prior to their release or transfer, for the purpose of comprehensive screening. Comprehensive screening enables the Australian Defence Force to determine whether a detainee has knowledge which could assist in the force protection of the ADF, ISAF and Afghan partners. The length of time for which detainees can be held in the Initial Screening Area may be extended beyond the current 96 hours (four days) for an additional three days, and a possible further extension of three days.


As at 21 May 2012, approximately 20 per cent of detainees apprehended by the ADF while on operations in Afghanistan have undergone interrogation within the Initial Screening Area since interrogation operations commenced in February of this year. Of these, around 25 per cent of detainees interrogated by the ADF have been released within the initial 96-hour period as there was insufficient evidence to support their continued detention. The remaining 75 per cent of detainees interrogated by the ADF were held in Australian custody within the Initial Screening Area beyond the initial 96-hour period on an initial three-day comprehensive screening extension. Approximately 40 per cent of these detainees remained in Australian custody on a subsequent additional three-day comprehensive screening extension.




Capture/recapture



Between 1 August 2010—when Australia took responsibility for detainee management from the Dutch—and 21 May this year, the ADF captured 12 people who were subsequently released then recaptured. Six of the individuals in question were released as there was insufficient evidence to warrant their continued detention. Of the remaining six detainees, there was sufficient evidence to warrant their transfer and prosecution. Three were subsequently transferred to United States custody at the Detention Facility in Parwan, and three were transferred to Afghan custody at the NDS, National Directorate of Security detention facility in Oruzgan. 




Australian Defence Force Investigative Service (ADFIS)



In January this year, I was advised that the Inspector General of the Australian Defence Force had commenced an inquiry into allegations of flawed Australian Defence Force Investigative Service, or ADFIS, processes in the Middle East Area of Operations. Last week, I was advised that a number of further matters had been raised in the context of these allegations. In addition, concerns had also been raised in relation to the conduct of Inspector General of the Australian Defence Force inquiries in the Middle East Area of Operation. These matters are now the subject of separate inquiries by the Inspector General of the Australian Defence Force. I will advise on the outcomes as appropriate in due course.




Australia's wounded



In Afghanistan, our military and civilian personnel carry out their work in a difficult, arduous and challenging security environment, at substantial personal risk. Since the beginning of this year, 10 soldiers have been wounded in battle. Eight of these injuries were sustained in improvised explosive device attacks and two were wounded during contact with the enemy. The government and the parliament acknowledge the sacrifice of Australian Defence Force members in fulfilling Australia's commitment to Afghanistan. We also acknowledge the sacrifice and the pain of their families.


We have also seen an Australian civilian wounded in Afghanistan for the first time. Mr David Savage, an AusAID worker, was injured in a suicide bomb attack on 26 March this year. The Australian people and the Australian government and the Australian parliament value very much the contribution made by our civilian personnel, such as Mr Savage, working closely alongside their military colleagues in Afghanistan. 




Conclusion



Progress towards transition to Afghan-led security responsibility is being made in Oruzgan province and across Afghanistan. This progress towards transition is in line with the Lisbon Strategy and the plans of our International Security Assistance Force and Afghan partners, as confirmed at the Chicago summit. The summit itself was a success: in reviewing transition and mapping the way forward in Afghanistan to the end of 2014; in securing the international community's commitment to continuing to fund, train and support the Afghan National Security Forces post-transition; and in supporting Afghanistan's security and development in the long term.


Notwithstanding this success, Afghanistan continues to be difficult and dangerous—difficult and dangerous for our troops deployed there. As the northern fighting season commences, the thoughts of all members of the House and all Australians will be with our forces in Oruzgan and Afghanistan. I thank the House.


I ask leave of the House to move a motion to enable the honourable member for Fadden to speak for 17 minutes. I also present a paper tabled in conjunction with my ministerial statement.


Leave granted.




Mr STEPHEN SMITH:
  I move:


That so much of standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the honourable member for Fadden speaking in reply to my statement for a period not exceeding 17 minutes.


Question agreed to.

"Robert, Stuart, MP",LP,2012-05-24,"



Mr ROBERT
 (Fadden) (09:19):  I thank the minister for his continued commitment to keep the House up to date with the progress of combat operations and the work of international communities within ISAF and the wider body of work, including the reconstruction and aid effort within Afghanistan. The coalition notes the outcomes of the Chicago summit. We note the outcomes that NATO has released. We note the range of comments on the delivery of outcomes including the three points that President Obama has released. We also note that the Oruzgan transition in tranche 3 is looking to commence mid-year with completion over 18 months from July to December next year in transitioning from combat to support. We continue to reiterate that this should always be a metrics based, command judged and led transition. Commanders should be the ones telling us patrol base by patrol base, valley by valley, ridgeline by ridgeline, the pace at which transition should occur.


I refer the minister to what would appear to be confusing statements from the Prime Minister. I am sure the minister will be able to fix these up at some stage or provide some guidance. I note the Prime Minister on 16 April, when announcing Hamid Karzai's next few months in terms of tranche 3 and transition, indicated the bulk of our force and enablers would transition in 12 to 18 months. That would cease their work literally by Christmas 2013. The Prime Minister said:


We will no longer be conducting routine front-line operations within the Afghan National Security Forces. The Australian-led Provincial Reconstruction Team will have completed its work and the majority of our troops will have returned home. We will no longer be conducting routine front-line operations … Provincial Reconstruction Team will have completed its work. 


The first question is: did the Prime Minister mean the PRT or was she in fact referring to the mentoring taskforce? In terms of the bulk of our troops coming home, is that a firm commitment from the Prime Minister that at the cessation by, or no later than, the end of next year the MRT will indeed commence coming home in bulk? I note that in the joint transcript between the minister and the Prime Minister on Monday 21 May, the Prime Minister again said:


In Oruzgan Province, in which we work, transition begins in coming months and, as you know, we expect this process to take 12 to 18 months, and at its conclusion the majority of Australian troops will be able to return home.


The Prime Minister makes the same statement. She then goes on to say:


Our mission after transition will change and it will evolve. Afghanistan will have responsibility for its own security. ISAF will have made a shift from its combat mission, but there will still be a continuing need for support.


However, under questioning, later on the Prime Minister made this statement:


At the end of 2014, what you see is the end of the current mission, the current combat mission, and a move to a different set of circumstances …


All we simply ask is for some clarification, Minister, in terms of whether 2013 is the end of it. Is it the best likelihood under the best guidance you currently have for the full transition from combat to support? Will the bulk of Australian combat troops be returning by the end of that transition, currently somewhere between July and December 2013, or will the bulk of the troops be moving in 2014?


General Allen's statement that in the last 12 months there has been an expansion of the Afghan security forces from 276,000 to 340,000 is a welcome statement, including his comments:


The expansion and professionalization of Afghan security forces now allow us to recover the remaining 23,000 US surge troops by this fall—


I gather he means August or around that time—


enable us to continue to pressure the Taliban to reintegrate and reconcile, and make possible security transition to the Afghans in accordance with our Lisbon commitments.


Such statements are indeed welcome.


I also note from the minister that he is committing Australian forces, with which the coalition agrees in terms of transition, to Duntroon in the desert, which I still believe is the preferred thing to call it rather than Sandhurst in the sand, and to the school of gunnery, which is great, as well as a future role for our special operations as long as the mandate is acceptable to the nation—all of which the coalition accepts. Minister, you have made no comment on the current over 150 embedded ostensibly staff officers within the various joint headquarters. I gather US forces will retain some headquarter element and there may be an opportunity for Australian military forces to retain some military officers embedded at that headquarter level—again, which the coalition would support. It would be good to get an idea at what level and at what ranks and at what positions the Australian military could expect to have some of their officers and other ranks within that embedded force.


I note the support for a long-term partnership within Afghanistan to ensure that Afghanistan can no longer return to being a place where terrorism is supported, aided, abetted, indoctrinated and given freedom of action. Again, the coalition supports a long-term partnership. We acknowledge the $100 million per annum starting in 2015. We were somewhat interested to see that this number is significantly higher compared with the majority of other European nations, especially when we factor GDP into the equation—the percentage of GDP that other nations have provided. I think Australia can be very proud that as a nation we are so generous in our support, not only to the US alliance in providing such a level of funding but to NATO as a whole.


We also note that aid will run or increase from $165 million to $250 million by 2015-16, as announced on 20 May 2012. Minister, last time we spoke, a week or two ago, the coalition expressed its profound disappointment in the budget, especially in the $5½ billion worth of cuts to Defence. We acknowledge and we accept your statements and the statements of senior military officers that this will have no impact on current defence support to current operations and we accept that. However, as we look forward to a long-term partnership in transition, we see that elements of Australian military forces, ostensibly special forces, may well have a commitment role up to the end of the decade—again, something which the Prime Minister has announced in this House and the coalition has supported.


If that is the case, the question is what impact will these defence cuts have on our future military capability and our future military operations post-2014, acknowledging and accepting at face value the commanders' and the minister's judgment that the current cuts will have no impact on current military operations? I therefore ask, Minister, if you could get back to the House with your advice as to what impact the current cuts will have on future combat capability. I refer you to Chief of Army General Morrison's message dated 9 May 2012, sent to all commanders and RSMs, where he lists in significant detail the cuts Army will have to make as a direct consequence of the budget. In fact, in his opening paragraph he said:


It is important that you understand the scale of the ADF's budgetary reductions to help you put into context the decisions that have been made.


So, Minister, if you could provide some update on the following delayed projects and what impact they may have on future conduct capability, accepting current combat capability is fine: JP 2097 Phase IB—REDFIN Special Operations Capability, the replacement special operations vehicles and battle management system, which has slipped at least one year; JP 129 Phase 3—the Tactical Unmanned Aerial Vehicle, the Shadow replacement or upgrade, which has slipped one year; LAND 125 Phase 3 Charlie—Soldier Enhancement Version 2 or enhancing the F88's lethality, which, again, has slipped; LAND 125 Phase 4—the Integrated Soldier System Version 3, next generation of the soldier combat system covering lethality, survivability, mobility and command and control; JP 154 Phase 2—the counter IED, or improvised explosive device, force protection ECM and the weapons technical intelligence capability; and, lastly, JP 3011 Phase 1—the non-lethal weapons enhancing the ADF's non-lethal capabilities.


I note the minister's update in terms of civilian casualties and the work that has been done to ensure that civilian casualties are investigated where they occur. I think it is important, though, for the House to understand the professionalism of our soldiers, which the minister has of course spoken of. Having spoken to many soldiers in Afghanistan over my three visits there, and having known many of their commanders, I know we are faced at times on combat operations with civilians being in the middle. I know as a statement of fact that when civilians are caught in the crossfire Australian soldiers cease shooting. Our enemy does not, and there lies the substantive difference between our force and the enemy we fight. Every effort is made to ensure that there are as few civilian casualties as possible—every effort. In terms of civilians in the battlefield, which is an everyday occurrence, their place in the battlefield ensures that our combat capability cannot be maximised because we do not fire into civilian compounds. We cease firing when civilians are engaged in the middle ground or in the way but our enemy forces do not. I thank the minister for his update on civilian casualties. I remind the House of the professionalism of our forces and the work they do every day to ensure civilians are not harmed and are not impacted. I remind them that the enemy we face has—to their shame—no problem firing at our troops where there are civilians in the middle. I thank the minister for his brief on the ADFA issues and the ADFIS issues and for his update to the House in that respect. I request the minister to drop the coalition a confidential line on the nature of those ADFIS issues and where they are, to give us an idea from a personnel point of view.


I note the minister's update on combat fatality reports. I note that all inquiry officer reports in combat deaths that occurred in 2010 have been completed. The families of those personnel killed in action have been briefed on the outcomes of those inquiries. I understand some of those reports have been made public and some have not been, and the coalition supports the minister's absolute discretion in determining what is appropriate in those circumstances. I agree with the minister that the families' wishes with regard to any public release are paramount and should always be highly in consideration.


I note that there are still four incidences outstanding from 2011, and the families of those ADF personnel killed in action may not have been briefed as a result of those actions. I acknowledge the minister will update the House as soon as practical on the outcomes of those inquiries. We all understand that it is important that families know in as much detail as possible the circumstances around how their loved ones gave their lives for the nation, but again I urge the minister to ensure the appropriate resources are provided to finalise these inquiries. Some of these four may have been waiting up to 300 days—10 or 12 months. Reports on inquires into US service personnel take an average of two months to complete. The four outstanding are taking up to 10 to 12 months.


It is important, as we finalise the discussion of the update on Afghanistan and the coalition's response, that I join the minister in acknowledging our men and women and what they are doing. The government and the opposition were represented yesterday when the elements of MTF-5—which is the base force surrounding the 3rd Battalion, the Royal Australian Regiment—and all of the enablers from 15 different units had their parade at Enoggera Barracks as family and friends wished them well as they went. It is important to know that something like 900 troops from MTF-5, based around the 3rd Battalion, will transition over the current months into Afghanistan for their six-month tour of duty.


I wish Lieutenant Colonel Trent Scott, a good colleague of mine whom I joined with in 1988, and the men and women of the 3rd Battalion, the Royal Australian Regiment, and all the enabling forces that go with MTF-5, the very best in what they do. I know Australians can be proud of what they will do. They will fight hard. They will ask no quarter and they will give none. However, they will show great compassion. They will show great leadership on the field. They will respect the Afghans with whom they fight and those whom they fight against, and they will do our nation proud. Minister, thank you again for your commitment in keeping the House up to date.

"Albanese, Anthony, MP",ALP,2012-05-24,"



Mr ALBANESE
 (Grayndler—Leader of the House and Minister for Infrastructure and Transport) (09:33):  I move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


The Broadcasting Services Amendment (Digital Television) Bill 2012 introduces amendments to the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 to facilitate earlier access, in particular circumstances, to the Viewer Access Satellite Television service, or VAST.


The VAST service is a first-class, direct-to-home digital commercial satellite television service which covers all of Australia. For the first time, viewers not served by terrestrial transmitters have access to the full range of digital television services. Every Australian can now access the full range of commercial and national free-to-air digital TV services.


However, currently viewers in areas that will never receive reliable commercial digital television terrestrial reception cannot access VAST until six months before switchover in their licence area. 


This bill will allow the conditional access scheme administrator to specify open access areas, where viewers residing in such areas will be automatically entitled to immediate access to VAST. 


The bill will also amend the definition of applicable services used by the scheme administrator to assesses eligibility to access VAST.


Currently, an assessment of whether viewers have adequate reception of applicable services only considers those services provided by commercial television broadcasting licensees. The amendments in this bill will broaden the definition to also take account of services provided by organisations which represent commercial broadcasters, such as Regional Broadcasting Australia.


The bill also contains minor amendments to allow broadcasters operating in the Remote Central and Eastern Australia licence areas to use services from VAST as a source of programming for their terrestrial transmitters. It also contains amendments to authorise viewers in the Territory of Christmas Island and the Territory of Cocos (Keeling) Islands, the Coral Sea Islands Territory and Norfolk Island to access VAST if they choose. 


Finally, the bill will provide greater flexibility to vary the timing of a simulcast period relating to a metropolitan or regional licence area.


While the timetable for the switch-off to analog signals was announced in 2008, further consultation with broadcasters indicates that metropolitan switchover dates are likely to require variation. These changes will stagger the transition to digital television to ensure both government assistance schemes and broadcaster engineering resources are available and appropriately managed to achieve digital switchover by the end of 2013.


In some cases, these amended dates could fall outside the maximum variations currently permitted by the Broadcasting Services Act.


The bill will allow the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy to vary the date for a licence area's digital switchover to any future date the minister specifies, provided that date is before 31 December, 2013. Similar amendments will be made in respect of digital-only local market area determinations.


The government is committed to working with local communities on the switchover to digital television, and will continue to set and publicise the dates well in advance of switchover.


I commend the bill to the House.


Debate adjourned.

Mr GRAY

 (Brand—Special Minister of State and Minister for the Public Service and Integrity) (10:55):  I move:


That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: new National Archives Preservation Facility and refurbishment of the existing Mitchell facility for the National Archives of Australia at Mitchell, Australian Capital Territory.


The National Archives of Australia preserves valuable Commonwealth records as part of archival resources of Australia and makes them available to present and future generations of Australians. The National Archives presently leases a number of facilities across Australia, with the largest record storage facilities being located at Mitchell and Greenway in the Australian Capital Territory, Chester Hill in New South Wales and East Burwood in Victoria. A comprehensive strategic planning study undertaken by the National Archives on the existing record storage capacity and capability against projected future requirements confirmed that repositories were operating at close to full capacity. Current estimation is that the National Archives will be full in 2015.


A 2010 survey of Commonwealth agencies identified a backlog of 165 shelf-kilometres of archives that will in time be transferred to the National Archives. The National Archives preservation facility and Mitchell refurbishment projects were developed under the two-stage capital works budget approval process. The new National Archives preservation facility and refurbished existing Mitchell facility, together with an internally funded upgrade of the Archive's Sydney facility, will provide gross space until 2031. The Greenway facility in the ACT will be relinquished. The new facility will enable the National Archives to partly address the 165 shelf-kilometre backlog, provide sufficient storage for growth until 2031, provide greater capacity and capability for a digital repository, and provide improved preservation and conservation work areas.


Subject to parliamentary approval, a multistage procurement process will commence in 2013. The successful developer will commence work on construction of the new facility and the integrated fit-out in 2015, with occupancy planned for mid-2016. Also, subject to parliamentary approval, work will commence on the existing Mitchell facility refurbishment in 2017 and be completed in 2019.


I commend the motion to the House.

Mr ZAPPIA
 (Makin) (11:16):  I rise to speak briefly in support of the Paid Parental Leave and Other Legislation Amendment (Dad and Partner Pay and Other Measures) Bill 2012. Since coming into government Labor has done much to assist children in their development and to assist parents in raising them. The government increased the childcare rebate from 30 per cent to 50 per cent, and it now stands at $7,500. It has increased family payments, most recently in this year's budget, with the schoolkids education bonus of $410 for each primary school child and $820 for each secondary school child. It has also increased family tax benefit part A payments up to $600 per family. Also in this year's budget the government added another $55.7 million for the Home Interaction Program for Parents and Youngsters. That is a very important program which very directly targets young mums and their children. Labor has done that because it wants every child to have the best start in life. There has been considerable research which shows that the support given to children should start from the day a child is born, because early child development is crucial to a child's future.


This legislation is another initiative that will help children with their development. Parental care in the very early days can be so important to the child and make so much difference in later life. The dad and partner pay bill enables eligible dads and partners to take leave from their work to support mum and baby and to receive two weeks pay at the minimum wage rate, that is, the same rate as that which applies to the Paid Parental Leave scheme and which currently is around $590 per week. This will be a welcome measure for the parents of a newborn and particularly so for first-time parents for whom parenting is a new experience.


The birth of a child is a special time for families. For the mum it can also be extremely demanding, tiring and, at times, stressful. This can be more so the case if there were complications with the birth for either the mum or the baby, or other medical conditions that may arise after the birth. All births are different and the level of support and care needed by both mother and baby will differ. But support and care is needed and the two weeks of paid leave available to the dad or partner enables that care to be provided. The support will be particularly welcomed by parents who, for whatever reason, do not have other close family members nearby to lend a hand if the need arises.


Of course, this legislation complements and supplements the Paid Parental Leave scheme legislation introduced by the Labor government in 2011. That legislation provides 18 weeks of parental leave at the minimum weekly wage rate. It is a provision that the opposition claim they will increase, and they say they will do so by taxing the largest companies in this country with an extra 1.5 per cent tax. But they did nothing about it in their last 12 months in office. In fact I understand many of them in the past have opposed a paid parental leave scheme. It is interesting that, after this government brought in the 18 weeks Paid Parental Leave scheme, the opposition then say that they will go one better. It is a complete turnaround from where they were when in government. Nevertheless that is what they say, and I understand that they will also be opposing this legislation today.


The new assistance which will be available from 1 January 2013 effectively brings the Paid Parental Leave  scheme to 20 weeks. The payment will be made by the Department of Human Services and not by the employer. The payment is in line with the recommendations of the Productivity Commission when it handed down its report on this matter.


Finally, the dad and partner pay will be available to eligible full-time, part-time, casual, seasonal, contract and self-employed workers. Like the parental leave pay, this new payment will be available during the first 12 months after the birth or adoption of a child. This is good legislation. It is legislation that, once again, adds support to families, and I commend it to the House.

"Georganas, Steve, MP",ALP,2012-05-24,"



Mr GEORGANAS
 (Hindmarsh) (11:21):  I too rise to support this very important bill, the Paid Parental Leave and Other Legislation Amendment (Dad and Partner Pay and Other Measures) Bill 2012. This is a very good bill. This is true Labor reform where we give the opportunity to parents to better their lives and to ensure that, during those very, very important moments after the birth of a child, dad can be home for a short time to do all he can to bond with the child, to assist the mother and to do all the things that parents do for their newborn. The purpose of the bill, as I said, is to extend the government's provisions to new parents through the creation of a new payment, called 'dad and partner pay,' for eligible working fathers and other eligible partners. That will be available from 1 January 2013. The dad and partner pay will be set at the rate of the national minimum wage, at the same rate per week as paid parental leave.


The government's new dad and partner payment will be available to eligible people from all walks of life—retail workers, hospitality workers, office workers, factory workers, construction workers, farmers, small business owners and teachers, just to name a few. It will be available to eligible full-time, part-time, casual, seasonal, contract and self-employed workers. The dad and partner payment will be available to the father of the child; the partner of the child's birth mother; an adoptive parent of the child; or a person who satisfies circumstances prescribed by the paid parental leave rules 2010 exceptional circumstances.


The eligibility criteria for dad and partner pay, including the income test, work test and residency requirements, will be consistent with those applying to parental leave pay. This is a great addition to the package of programs and payments that Labor has put in place to help working families. It is very important as it assists parents, as I said, in those very early days of a child's life, a very important stage. This package is there to assist fathers in those very important days to be able to be at home, to bond with the child, to help with that child and to be a part of that very important development of that child's first few weeks.


There are probably no more special or magical times in our lives than at the birth of a new baby, than the addition to our families of a beautiful new child. Many of us in this place have been through that period and we know that it is one of the greatest times in our lives. I do not think there is anything that beats that moment when you come home with that newborn child. Many of us here have been through that and would understand what I am saying. There is probably no other time in our lives when the overwhelming sense that we experience is joy and hope for the future, that of our families and of the child itself.


There are probably no more difficult and draining times in our lives than those first few days and weeks—I am sure that many of us would say months—when the time required to care for a newborn child is at its dizziest height, around the clock, 24/7. Those first, wonderful, magical days and weeks are the focus of this bill, providing the encouragement and help that this Labor government wants to give to new dads and partners to fully participate, help their loved one and bond with their new child. I am sure that many MPs here in this place who have had children know the strain of the parents, especially the mother, who needs to take care of that newborn child alone. This measure will assist in that regard.


I am certain that many women would see the potential help of their partner a godsend—help with the child, help around the house, help in venturing out into the world for provisions, help in managing the flow of relatives and well-wishers and, quite simply, help in getting some sleep.


I have two wonderful boys, who are now adults. When they were born our finances were such that I could not have time off work. At that time I was driving taxis. I did that full time for eight years. But I managed to change my shift around and worked the so-called 'drag shift,' from 6 pm to 6 am. I then came home and tried to give Wendy, my wife, a bit of a rest so that I could do something with our child. I remember how difficult that time was. It was a period when—and still is even today for many people—finances were not that good, when people still had to go to work and life still continued. This measure will assist those people.


 I note that the Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs is here in the chamber. I congratulate her on such a great bill that will assist families and parents to give them some sort of help during those very important moments when that child is brought home. I commend the bill to the House.

"Macklin, Jenny, MP",ALP,2012-05-24,"



Ms MACKLIN
 (Jagajaga—Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and Minister for Disability Reform) (11:26):  I thank all members for their contribution to the debate on this very important bill, the Paid Parental Leave and Other Legislation Amendment (Dad and Partner Pay and Other Measures) Bill 2012.


As the member for Hindmarsh, I think, has so eloquently put it, this is a very special time in the lives of mums and dads. We hope that this extra paid time will give dads the sort of help and support that the member for Hindmarsh has put so well.


This bill extends the government's Paid Parental Leave scheme to include a new payment, the so-called dad and partner pay, for eligible working fathers and partners. It took this Labor government to deliver this bill and Australia's first national Paid Parental Leave scheme. It gives working parents, mums and dads, the security to stay at home with their newborn babies in what we all know are those very critical, early months of a child's development. I can inform the House that more than 150,000 families across the country have already taken up this government's historic Paid Parental Leave scheme.


Dads will now be able to have the chance to have some time off work as well. Dad and partner pay will give eligible fathers and partners two weeks pay, at the rate of the national minimum wage. Our Paid Parental Leave scheme, now with dad and partner pay added, will of course further reduce the pressures on new parents when their children are very small. It also, very importantly, gives both parents the opportunity to share in the care of their newborn baby. It is the case that so many dads want to do that, which is a great thing. It also lets parents make their own choices about how they want to balance their work and family arrangements.


Another important thing about our Paid Parental Leave scheme is that it delivers real benefits to business. It is funded by the government and paid through employers, so employers can stay in touch with their long-term employees while they are taking time off to care for a new baby. I will just remind the House that this was the approach recommended by the Productivity Commission after an extensive inquiry.


This does make sure that our Paid Parental Leave scheme is a workplace entitlement not a welfare payment and, as I said, it very importantly makes sure that employers keep in touch with their valuable skilled staff. That is why I am very disappointed that the Liberals, yet again, are trying to wreck our Paid Parental Leave scheme that so many people, parents and employers, are already benefiting from right around Australia.


We do not support the foreshadowed Liberals' amendments that would undermine the link between women taking time off to have a baby and their workplace. The Liberals tried this once before in here. It got voted down. Now they are going to try and wreck a scheme that is working very, very well.


This demonstrates this opposition's view of Paid Parental Leave. They are trying to upset a paid parental leave scheme that is working very well. By contrast, they have put forward a proposal themselves for paid parental leave that certainly does not have the support of their own party room. It would give wealthy women—women earning $200,000, $500,000 or $1 million—$75,000 to have a baby, if Mr Abbott had his own way, while working families would have to make do on the minimum wage.


We know that there is a lot of conflict about this in the Liberal party room. We know that they have a massive $70 billion budget black hole that they have to fill, and yet they want to spend billions on paying very, very wealthy women, giving them $75,000 to have a baby.


We will not be supporting the foreshadowed amendment. It will undermine our Paid Parental Leave scheme, which is working extremely well for parents and for employers. And I think this proposed amendment from the opposition just shows once again how out of touch they are with the needs of working families.

Mr BILLSON
 (Dunkley) (11:33):  I ask leave to move opposition amendments (1) and (2) as circulated in my name together.


Leave granted.




Mr BILLSON:
  The amendments that I will put on behalf of the coalition are very sensible amendments. I am reminded, in listening to the minister, that I think Bill Kelty was right—sometimes the truth will do. There is nothing of the kind in the amendments that the coalition is putting forward that does in any way undermine the government's scheme. We have some well argued and clearly articulated views that people's costs do not default to a minimum wage when a child arrives—people's household expenses continue—and that the coalition's paid parental leave proposal is responsive to that real-life reality, giving real money and real time to deal with the real expenses families face.


But, given that the government is not receptive to the coalition's improved and far superior paid parental leave scheme, we are seeing what we can do to improve the scheme that is currently operating. The coalition's amendments seek to do that by relieving a completely unnecessary and unjustified burden on employers, particularly small employers, to act as the pay clerks for the government's scheme. The amendments that we have put forward seek to vary the current default position under the Paid Parental Leave Act where employers, in the majority of cases, are mandated by the department secretary to carry out the Commonwealth's paid parental leave pay-clerk responsibilities. The amendments would change this so that employers would only pay PPL payments when both the employer and the employee consented to the employer making those payments. What that means is that—for an employer with the resources, the size of operation or, in some cases, with a scheme of their own already where they are keen and in a position to do the government's work for it in making these payments, and where the employee feels that that is in their interests as well—that arrangement can take place.


That opt-in arrangement would see an employer complete the paperwork and verify eligibility in partnership with the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth would confirm eligibility and then interact with the employer and then set around a number of payments—a number of payments that in fact probably total about 20 transactions. I will just hold up for the benefit of the chamber and for those who are interested a flowchart of what would actually take place. There are almost 20 separate transactions that an employer is obliged to be engaged with once it has been confirmed that an employee is eligible for the government funded, government determined PPL payments.


Our argument is this. We know there is a significant increase in small business insolvencies, with time-scarce small business employers working very hard to stay afloat. They are cash poor, in many cases, and without the organisational infrastructure to change their payroll system so that this payment coming through the Commonwealth mimics a payment as if it were made by employers but then is not subject to many of the other requirements that come along with a payroll system. Our view is that not all employers are inclined to do that work or are in a position to carry it out without considerable and unnecessary cost and compliance risk. Once they have been determined by the secretary to be obliged to carry out this role, if they do not carry out that responsibility a substantial fine is available to the government to penalise them and that is an additional compliance risk for an employer.


I was very interested to hear in the second reading debate a number of the Labor members talk about how well the scheme was going because so many employers were involved. What an Orwellian contribution that was. They do not have a choice—they are obliged to be involved. To use that argument to say there is no problem here, there is no opportunity for improvement, is absolute nonsense. In relation to the minister's argument that this would, in her words, 'undermine the scheme' encourages me to go back— (Time expired)

As Bill Kelty said, the truth will often do. The changes that we are foreshadowing in these amendments do not in any way alter people's eligibility. They do not in any way compromise what the minister boasts about as the success of the scheme. In fact, what was ironic was that in the early phase of the scheme, the option that we are putting forward was the way the scheme operated. So for the first six months this is what happened: these payments were paid by Centrelink through the Family Assistance Office directly to eligible employees and it was on that basis the government went around boasting about the success of the scheme. All we are saying is let the success continue. If that is the benchmark, make that available to employers. But for those where the employee and the employer wish to have the employer handle the payment then so be it. We are not objecting to that. If that is people's desire then these amendments facilitate that.


I remember last time this debate was held that one of the people brought out in support of the current arrangements was Sony, a very substantial international corporation with more people in their pay office than most small businesses have in their entire enterprise. They had an existing paid parental leave scheme, so it was a matter of simply bolting on the extra cash from the Commonwealth and they were more than happy to do that. I say good luck to them, but not every business in Australia is Sony. Not everyone is in a position to carry out that work and not everyone is desirous of carrying out that work, either as an employer or as an employee, but if they are, let them do that work on behalf of the Commonwealth. Let employers and employees who are eligible for PPL payments opt in to have the employer pay those payments.


The minister says this is part of the staying in touch regime. Again, I would draw her attention to the fact that the staying in touch provisions that are available under the legislation the government has introduced are not being altered at all. We are not stopping that. We see the value in that. Where there might be some change in technology or an important occasion within the workplace where someone on a period of paid parental leave is invited to come back in and be a part of the workplace because of something of significance, we are not opposed to that. What this is about is who organises the back of house work to see some digits appear in an electronic bank statement. This is not mid last century, when you came in and got your pay cheque off somebody. There is no physical engagement with this payment—it is an electronic funds transfer. So how that adds to the quality of the relationship between an employer and an employee is beyond me. I am quite certain most workplaces I have been involved with and many I have talked to, rather than turn their minds to more than 20 engagements in transactions with the risk of fines if they get them wrong, would rather spend their time talking with the person eligible for paid parental leave about how things are going, how the microhuman is going, how the family is going and how excited people are about coming back, even organising a bouquet of flowers, not having this the red tape burden that would distract the employer from that work.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  I ask the member for Dunkley not to make excessive use of props. He has referred to the props sufficient times.




Mr BILLSON:
  Sorry, I thought twice was not excessive in my second contribution, but I thank you for your counsel. I will put the props to one side, waving them to show you how many points of engagement there are. My point is the payment process is a financial transaction and the back of house work in the first six months of this scheme was done by the Commonwealth, and we believe that should continue unless the employer and the employee want it to be different. These amendments bring about that change. They actually inoculate against the risk that was identified in the Productivity Commission report, that the biggest danger employers were facing was the risk of discrimination towards women of reproductive ages because of imposts the scheme might impose upon them, not as it currently stands but if there was work and coordinated effort to require employers to push up the contribution with their own funds and their own effort.


The other thing this debate offers is an opportunity for the government to correct a broken promise. The Prime Minister, then in another shadow ministerial role, said:


Labor will not support a system that imposes additional financial burdens or administrative complexity on small businesses or in any way acts as a discouragement to the employment of women.


Yet what we have here in the way this scheme is designed are those additional financial and administrative burdens and complexities—the very thing that was promised by Labor not to be imposed on small business. Well, here is a chance for the government to honour a commitment by rectifying yet another broken promise. (Extension of time granted) That was what the government committed to when in opposition. That promise was broken. We have tried on a number of occasions to allow the government to keep the faith with those to whom it had made that commitment and here is another opportunity for that today, to actually ensure that the system does not impose additional financial burdens or administrative complexity on small businesses.


What has changed? Not much, according to a then Labor minister, Jan Jarratt, when she wrote to the previous—two ago—small business minister asking: 'Why don't you embrace what the coalition is doing? Why don't you look at even an opt-in or an opt-out proposal?' That is what Labor in Queensland were advocating, so it is nice to know that even some within the Labor movement thought what was being proposed was a perfectly sensible measure, along with the very long list of industry organisations, particularly small business groups, that want to be cut some slack here and to have the red tape burden reduced. That is exactly what these amendments seek to achieve. The big organisations have the resources and are in a position to carry out a pay clerk role on behalf of the Commonwealth with no change whatsoever to the eligibility criteria or the payments that might be available to eligibility recipients. It requires no change whatsoever, none of the undermining that the minister would have you believe exists. It is about who does the back of house work so that some digits appear on a bank statement. The Commonwealth has done that before and did it well. It used to boast about the success of the scheme. We think that should continue.


And guess what is in the bill we are debating today? Those payments to the dads. And guess who is processing those? The Family Assistance Office at Centrelink. So the machinery that we are advocating should be available to a small employer—the minister argues it undermines the very scheme and then she launches into an attack on the coalition; her argument is absolute nonsense—is the very machinery that is being used to make another payment relating to the Paid Parental Leave scheme. And guess what happens in the event that the employer is insolvent or at some risk and the department secretary chooses not to decree that they be the ones carrying out the pay clerk role? The machinery that we are arguing should be available more broadly kicks in. So this is not some transformational change; this is a sensible, completely pragmatic, very constructive and positive proposal to relieve an unnecessary and unjustified small business compliance and red tape burden in particular.


The government, when in opposition, made a commitment that it would not do this. When in government, Queensland Labor said that what you have done is not helpful for small business so why don't you do what the coalition is proposing. The Productivity Commission said there are a range of things that need to be weighed here but please do not place new barriers in front of employers employing women of a reproductive age such as additional cost and compliance burdens.


There is a shopping list on this flow chart. I will not wave it around again but I will quickly summarise the action steps that are needed in the minister's department's own material about the considerable work that is involved for an employer in these exercises. It says employers are not required to separately identify payments—but they are not required to make a superannuation contribution, so we should decouple that. It says it is not supposed to trigger any payroll action, so decouple that as well. It says there is no need for a separate bank account but you need to make sure you can account for every dollar that comes in. It says there are processes required for ensuring that people are eligible—and so on and so on. So this is not without a considerable amount of burden on an employer at a time when there is quite a lot of mutual adjustment needed in a workplace where one of your team members has the good fortune of looking forward to becoming a parent. That is a time of considerable mutual adjustment for the person anticipating the child and also for the workplace.


So why add to that with this needless, useless and unnecessary red tape burden? Well, there is a reason—and the ACTU belled the cat on it. 'If the coalition amendments got up,' the ACTU warned, 'it would restrict unions' capacity to improve and enforce PPL in workplaces.' So this is not really about the integrity of the scheme. It is not about any suggestion that we are undermining. This is about giving small business employers a break. The only argument that runs against that is the union saying that, with this machinery in place, it is easier for the union movement to fit up employers with additional costs and additional obligations.

Ms MACKLIN
 (Jagajaga—Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and Minister for Disability Reform) (11:48):  As I indicated, the government will not be supporting this amendment. I am pleased that the member for Dunkley referred in his remarks to the Productivity Commission report, a very significant piece of work that was done for the government on paid parental leave. Unfortunately, the member for Dunkley did not go to the recommendation of the Productivity Commission's report on the employer role. The recommendation considered that, even though it was recommending a government funded scheme, the delivery mechanism should demonstrate that paid parental leave is a normal feature of employment arrangements like other workplace entitlements such as annual leave. They recommended the role for employers in the scheme that the government has implemented because they considered that it would benefit business. So if the member for Dunkley was being truthful today in the debate he would go to the recommendations in the Productivity Commission report that go to exactly this point.


The potential administrative burden on business, including small business, was in fact taken into account by the Productivity Commission in their detailed analysis. Once they had done that analysis they nevertheless recommended that employers make these payments for their long-term employees. I repeat again that the reason they did that was to keep a connection between an employer and an employee when the employee takes time off to have a baby. The Productivity Commission itself found that it would help employers—I think it is important that we do listen to the advice from the Productivity Commission in this regard—retain valuable and skilled staff.


I want to go to the feedback that we have had from a range of sources indicating that the employer role in the Paid Parental Leave scheme is in fact operating smoothly and that it would not be helpful to the smooth operation of the scheme for the opposition's amendment to get up. Employer funding arrangements are working well. We have had few complaints about the scheme either from parents or employers and the early findings are that employers are not finding their role burdensome.


I will just go to the preliminary advice from an employer survey conducted in the first six months of the employer role. It says that the scheme has been relatively easy for organisations to implement. Employers have found that sourcing information is easy, information was accurate and helpful and that most employers, regardless of their business size, said it was easy to organise payments. So I think in these debates it is important that we look at the facts rather than the rant that we heard from the member for Dunkley. If I can go to some of the figures, since the scheme started on 1 January 2011 we have, as I said, had more than 150,000 expectant and new parents applying for paid parental leave. We have a lot of people who have actually finished receiving their payment and others, of course, currently receiving it or waiting for their babies to be born. More than 29,000 employers have registered for the scheme. Around 43 per cent of those are small businesses—12½ thousand. Around 5,000 registered employers have opted to provide parental leave pay to employees that they are not required to pay it to. These would be employees who are working for them on a shorter term basis, for example. Around a third of those 5,000 are in fact small business, so all of the evidence would suggest that businesses are not finding it difficult; in fact, quite the reverse. That is why it is so disappointing to have this amendment moved. It was lost once. I hope it will be lost again, because the scheme is working very well for parents and working very well for employers. We hope that the scheme can continue to work very well for both parents and employers. That is why the government introduced it, and the government will be opposing the amendment.

Mr BILLSON
 (Dunkley) (11:53):  The minister referred to the Productivity Commission report about how things will help employers. Just to assist the House, and for those listening, the Productivity Commission said a paid parental leave scheme would help employers. There is nothing whatsoever in the report that says that forcing employers to pay the payments would help employers. There is nothing of the kind in it at all. There is an on-balance recommendation in the report, if I could help the minister, that signalling—that is, some effort to characterise the nature of the payment—would somehow justify the imposition of the burden. I just correct that information for the House, because there was quite a mangulation of what is actually in the Productivity Commission report dressed up as a justification for the current arrangements. 


The signalling is supposed to say that because a number appears in a bank account people will immediately understand what that is and that that will build a stronger bond between employers and employees. For anyone listening, I ask you to imagine if enhanced interpersonal relationships simply require a number to appear in a bank account—that in some way that would explain why there was cash being thrown around by the government in order to enhance its relationship with those receiving the cash. In an employer-employee arrangement, I am pretty certain that people—particularly the women I have spoken with—would have thought, 'That is a strange way of maintaining a relationship: by having a payment made into a bank account and the back office operations being a burden imposed on employers.'


Secondly, the signalling argument that is canvassed in the Productivity Commission's report is completely undermined by the government's own rhetoric. It never misses an opportunity to run around telling everybody that it is paying for this, it is a Labor scheme, isn't it great and aren't we blessed to have a Labor government. So the signalling virtue that the minister was half inferring, given that she had misrepresented the recommendations as they were provided in the Productivity Commission report, has actually been undermined by the government's own behaviour. The government's own behaviour has compromised the signalling benefits in a hotly contested on-balance conclusion in the Productivity Commission report in which there was industry organisation after industry organisation explaining the reality of it in the workplace and that this was, in their eyes, a very dubious conclusion that the government now hangs its hat on.


Also, I understand the minister to have been saying that it negates the need for the government to honour its commitments. If it was so clear, why make that commitment? Why make an election commitment that says that Labor will not support a system that imposes additional financial burdens or administrative complexities on small businesses? Why make that commitment if you are not intending to keep it? This is like: 'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead.' The government is saying, 'There will be no compliance and financial costs for small businesses under a PPL scheme the government leads'—yet there is. It is a broken promise. Here is a chance to rectify this broken promise and actually live up to the words that seemed perfectly reasonable and were happily shopped around and traded around prior to the election, but when push comes to shove there will be some contorted representation of what is in the Productivity Commission report. It is as if the government is saying, 'Oh, we do not need to uphold our election commitments.' It is a bit like saying, 'The Greens stole my homework.' Here, it is the PC that are being blamed for not honouring the election commitment. 


Finally, let me reiterate that the motive behind this is about signalling, according to the Productivity Commission. The government's own actions undermine the value of that signalling by singing out to anyone who is interested: 'It is a government scheme. We determine who is eligible. It doesn't matter what you are paid, this is what you are going to get.' That is what the government is actually doing. So even the on-balance argument in the Productivity Commission report has hit the rocks because of the government's own behaviour. What does it leave you with? It leaves you with the question: what is the justification? This is where this secret ACTU memo bells the cat. The only reason the Gillard government is opposing these very sensible and constructive measures and amendments by the coalition to support small business is that the unions want them to oppose it.


Why do the unions want to oppose it? As it says in this secret memo that was given to me, the amendments that we are proposing 'will also restrict the union's capacity to improve and enforce paid parental leave in the workplace'. This is an industrial campaign to impose additional top-up costs and burdens on small business, the very additional costs that the Productivity Commission warned against. Those are the facts behind this argument, and I urge the House to support the sensible coalition amendment. (Time expired)

"Zappia, Tony, MP",ALP,2012-05-24,"



Mr ZAPPIA
 (Makin) (11:16):  I rise to speak briefly in support of the Paid Parental Leave and Other Legislation Amendment (Dad and Partner Pay and Other Measures) Bill 2012. Since coming into government Labor has done much to assist children in their development and to assist parents in raising them. The government increased the childcare rebate from 30 per cent to 50 per cent, and it now stands at $7,500. It has increased family payments, most recently in this year's budget, with the schoolkids education bonus of $410 for each primary school child and $820 for each secondary school child. It has also increased family tax benefit part A payments up to $600 per family. Also in this year's budget the government added another $55.7 million for the Home Interaction Program for Parents and Youngsters. That is a very important program which very directly targets young mums and their children. Labor has done that because it wants every child to have the best start in life. There has been considerable research which shows that the support given to children should start from the day a child is born, because early child development is crucial to a child's future.


This legislation is another initiative that will help children with their development. Parental care in the very early days can be so important to the child and make so much difference in later life. The dad and partner pay bill enables eligible dads and partners to take leave from their work to support mum and baby and to receive two weeks pay at the minimum wage rate, that is, the same rate as that which applies to the Paid Parental Leave scheme and which currently is around $590 per week. This will be a welcome measure for the parents of a newborn and particularly so for first-time parents for whom parenting is a new experience.


The birth of a child is a special time for families. For the mum it can also be extremely demanding, tiring and, at times, stressful. This can be more so the case if there were complications with the birth for either the mum or the baby, or other medical conditions that may arise after the birth. All births are different and the level of support and care needed by both mother and baby will differ. But support and care is needed and the two weeks of paid leave available to the dad or partner enables that care to be provided. The support will be particularly welcomed by parents who, for whatever reason, do not have other close family members nearby to lend a hand if the need arises.


Of course, this legislation complements and supplements the Paid Parental Leave scheme legislation introduced by the Labor government in 2011. That legislation provides 18 weeks of parental leave at the minimum weekly wage rate. It is a provision that the opposition claim they will increase, and they say they will do so by taxing the largest companies in this country with an extra 1.5 per cent tax. But they did nothing about it in their last 12 months in office. In fact I understand many of them in the past have opposed a paid parental leave scheme. It is interesting that, after this government brought in the 18 weeks Paid Parental Leave scheme, the opposition then say that they will go one better. It is a complete turnaround from where they were when in government. Nevertheless that is what they say, and I understand that they will also be opposing this legislation today.


The new assistance which will be available from 1 January 2013 effectively brings the Paid Parental Leave  scheme to 20 weeks. The payment will be made by the Department of Human Services and not by the employer. The payment is in line with the recommendations of the Productivity Commission when it handed down its report on this matter.


Finally, the dad and partner pay will be available to eligible full-time, part-time, casual, seasonal, contract and self-employed workers. Like the parental leave pay, this new payment will be available during the first 12 months after the birth or adoption of a child. This is good legislation. It is legislation that, once again, adds support to families, and I commend it to the House.

"Georganas, Steve, MP",ALP,2012-05-24,"



Mr GEORGANAS
 (Hindmarsh) (11:21):  I too rise to support this very important bill, the Paid Parental Leave and Other Legislation Amendment (Dad and Partner Pay and Other Measures) Bill 2012. This is a very good bill. This is true Labor reform where we give the opportunity to parents to better their lives and to ensure that, during those very, very important moments after the birth of a child, dad can be home for a short time to do all he can to bond with the child, to assist the mother and to do all the things that parents do for their newborn. The purpose of the bill, as I said, is to extend the government's provisions to new parents through the creation of a new payment, called 'dad and partner pay,' for eligible working fathers and other eligible partners. That will be available from 1 January 2013. The dad and partner pay will be set at the rate of the national minimum wage, at the same rate per week as paid parental leave.


The government's new dad and partner payment will be available to eligible people from all walks of life—retail workers, hospitality workers, office workers, factory workers, construction workers, farmers, small business owners and teachers, just to name a few. It will be available to eligible full-time, part-time, casual, seasonal, contract and self-employed workers. The dad and partner payment will be available to the father of the child; the partner of the child's birth mother; an adoptive parent of the child; or a person who satisfies circumstances prescribed by the paid parental leave rules 2010 exceptional circumstances.


The eligibility criteria for dad and partner pay, including the income test, work test and residency requirements, will be consistent with those applying to parental leave pay. This is a great addition to the package of programs and payments that Labor has put in place to help working families. It is very important as it assists parents, as I said, in those very early days of a child's life, a very important stage. This package is there to assist fathers in those very important days to be able to be at home, to bond with the child, to help with that child and to be a part of that very important development of that child's first few weeks.


There are probably no more special or magical times in our lives than at the birth of a new baby, than the addition to our families of a beautiful new child. Many of us in this place have been through that period and we know that it is one of the greatest times in our lives. I do not think there is anything that beats that moment when you come home with that newborn child. Many of us here have been through that and would understand what I am saying. There is probably no other time in our lives when the overwhelming sense that we experience is joy and hope for the future, that of our families and of the child itself.


There are probably no more difficult and draining times in our lives than those first few days and weeks—I am sure that many of us would say months—when the time required to care for a newborn child is at its dizziest height, around the clock, 24/7. Those first, wonderful, magical days and weeks are the focus of this bill, providing the encouragement and help that this Labor government wants to give to new dads and partners to fully participate, help their loved one and bond with their new child. I am sure that many MPs here in this place who have had children know the strain of the parents, especially the mother, who needs to take care of that newborn child alone. This measure will assist in that regard.


I am certain that many women would see the potential help of their partner a godsend—help with the child, help around the house, help in venturing out into the world for provisions, help in managing the flow of relatives and well-wishers and, quite simply, help in getting some sleep.


I have two wonderful boys, who are now adults. When they were born our finances were such that I could not have time off work. At that time I was driving taxis. I did that full time for eight years. But I managed to change my shift around and worked the so-called 'drag shift,' from 6 pm to 6 am. I then came home and tried to give Wendy, my wife, a bit of a rest so that I could do something with our child. I remember how difficult that time was. It was a period when—and still is even today for many people—finances were not that good, when people still had to go to work and life still continued. This measure will assist those people.


 I note that the Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs is here in the chamber. I congratulate her on such a great bill that will assist families and parents to give them some sort of help during those very important moments when that child is brought home. I commend the bill to the House.

Ms MACKLIN
 (Jagajaga—Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and Minister for Disability Reform) (11:26):  I thank all members for their contribution to the debate on this very important bill, the Paid Parental Leave and Other Legislation Amendment (Dad and Partner Pay and Other Measures) Bill 2012.


As the member for Hindmarsh, I think, has so eloquently put it, this is a very special time in the lives of mums and dads. We hope that this extra paid time will give dads the sort of help and support that the member for Hindmarsh has put so well.


This bill extends the government's Paid Parental Leave scheme to include a new payment, the so-called dad and partner pay, for eligible working fathers and partners. It took this Labor government to deliver this bill and Australia's first national Paid Parental Leave scheme. It gives working parents, mums and dads, the security to stay at home with their newborn babies in what we all know are those very critical, early months of a child's development. I can inform the House that more than 150,000 families across the country have already taken up this government's historic Paid Parental Leave scheme.


Dads will now be able to have the chance to have some time off work as well. Dad and partner pay will give eligible fathers and partners two weeks pay, at the rate of the national minimum wage. Our Paid Parental Leave scheme, now with dad and partner pay added, will of course further reduce the pressures on new parents when their children are very small. It also, very importantly, gives both parents the opportunity to share in the care of their newborn baby. It is the case that so many dads want to do that, which is a great thing. It also lets parents make their own choices about how they want to balance their work and family arrangements.


Another important thing about our Paid Parental Leave scheme is that it delivers real benefits to business. It is funded by the government and paid through employers, so employers can stay in touch with their long-term employees while they are taking time off to care for a new baby. I will just remind the House that this was the approach recommended by the Productivity Commission after an extensive inquiry.


This does make sure that our Paid Parental Leave scheme is a workplace entitlement not a welfare payment and, as I said, it very importantly makes sure that employers keep in touch with their valuable skilled staff. That is why I am very disappointed that the Liberals, yet again, are trying to wreck our Paid Parental Leave scheme that so many people, parents and employers, are already benefiting from right around Australia.


We do not support the foreshadowed Liberals' amendments that would undermine the link between women taking time off to have a baby and their workplace. The Liberals tried this once before in here. It got voted down. Now they are going to try and wreck a scheme that is working very, very well.


This demonstrates this opposition's view of Paid Parental Leave. They are trying to upset a paid parental leave scheme that is working very well. By contrast, they have put forward a proposal themselves for paid parental leave that certainly does not have the support of their own party room. It would give wealthy women—women earning $200,000, $500,000 or $1 million—$75,000 to have a baby, if Mr Abbott had his own way, while working families would have to make do on the minimum wage.


We know that there is a lot of conflict about this in the Liberal party room. We know that they have a massive $70 billion budget black hole that they have to fill, and yet they want to spend billions on paying very, very wealthy women, giving them $75,000 to have a baby.


We will not be supporting the foreshadowed amendment. It will undermine our Paid Parental Leave scheme, which is working extremely well for parents and for employers. And I think this proposed amendment from the opposition just shows once again how out of touch they are with the needs of working families.

Mr LAMING
 (Bowman) (13:25):  This is an important debate about the healthcare of this country. This is an important debate about whether you invest $692 million in non-service-providing bureaucracy. This is a debate about whether, having set up 10 authorities in health, you set up an 11th. This is a debate about just how much focus you can place on the back-end, fiddling with the structure of our health system, without putting any skin in the game at the front. This is fundamentally about how much money is ripped out of service provision in order to fund this government's preoccupation with setting up more authorities and spending more money on layers of bureaucracy that once was done by something called the Department of Health.


I can understand that the more consultants one employs, the more you need a panel to monitor them; and that in turn is watched by committees; and that in turn is guided by councils and is ultimately answerable to authorities one after the other. I can also see good reason, from the Left side of politics, to simply generate more and more of these layers and call it transparency. I can understand why ultimately, when you are trying to guarantee more outcomes, and a floor in outcomes, in the end you simply need more people watching the system to achieve that. I can also see, from where those people come from, why that is so important to them.


But this debate is also about whether we are prepared to turn our health system around and put the patient at the centre of that experience, whether we are going to unlock resources and make them available to the clinicians on the frontline that know how to make the system work better but are currently disempowered to do so. Today's debate is quite simply about how far we are prepared to go before we have a system that is completely out of balance, with a focus on bureaucracy and not enough on the patient.


There are actually truly important things to be focused on in health policy, but this is by an administration that spent not $1 and not one cent of the stimulus package on health. If healthcare were something truly important, Minister Plibersek, tell me exactly what in the stimulus package was spent on healthcare and what proportion of it was spent on health. You will always have a procession of government MPs from both sides, when they are incumbent in government, saying they are spending more than their predecessors, but that is not the debate. Healthcare is growing and Australia's expenditure on health is approaching 10 per cent of GDP. Every administration will claim they spend more than their predecessor. No, this is the debate about just how many layers of bureaucracy are needed for a system to work. At some point we have to say that is enough.


I can understand wishing to continue the important roles of many of these commissions and councils. But we also need to ask ourselves how big they have to be. This is not a debate about the ends, it is a debate about the means by which we get there. If I go through the $118 million over four years on the National Health Performance Authority and the other nine authorities that have been established—not even including those that already existed and are being continued—at some point we have to say, is this the best way to spend the money? You only have to look at the budget—the cold, hard reality of every budget—to see the context in which these authorities are being set up. It is simply by ripping money off service providers and simply by building less Indigenous health infrastructure. It is about removing money from important things like delivering public and preventative healthcare. Let's go through it: I am not giving you this data, I am reading it from the budget papers—$3.3 million cut from substance misuse programs, particularly in Indigenous Australia. If there is one thing you ask people in Central Australia most it is, 'Where are the support services for those who need them most?' There was $68 million cut from the health workforce programs and $75 million cut from Indigenous health infrastructure. This is the currency that builds these new authorities.


I am not for a moment going to say that we do not need a system to get the Commonwealth and states working together, but I am criticising the size, the mechanism and the delays in how it is being done. I am criticising the fact that there has been a complete focus on the back end of the health system by an administration that has lost sight of the front end. There is effectively no communication with rural doctors about ways to retain them in practice or about the reforms around geographical classification systems. This is a government in denial. I say, simply, that what we need to be doing in Australia is pick up what is truly at the forefront to give us a cutting-edge health system. We have seen this in other nations around the world who have freed themselves from the almost puerile debate about the fact that there is no role for private health in medicine. Parts of Europe have effectively moved on from that debate.


We have no movement whatsoever on workforce productivity and no action around the Productivity Commission reports. The reality is that in public radiotherapy in this country you will wait 10 weeks on average for treatment if you do not have private health insurance, but there is no movement from the other side to fix that problem. There is no movement from the Commonwealth. There is no movement from the fact that they have 21 public health staff per linear accelerator in the public system and about 11 to 12 in the private system. There is no answer to that.


In relation to mental health they have been dragged kicking and screaming to a solution after leaders from mental health forums had to resign their positions to get some action from this government. In the big area of time to commercialisation, pharmacogenomics, which is the need to have companion diagnostics for more efficient prescribing, none of that is being addressed, where massive savings exist. Of course, in this proposition we simply have Health Workforce Australia, with a considerable amount of money, working slowly through the modelling process to fund solutions particularly for regional and remote Australia, for providers practising at top of licence and in making sure we are providing the workforce that we will need in decades to come.


At the moment we have deficits with doctor numbers, deficits with nursing numbers and no other answer from this government except, 'We'll train more.' That is right—they will simply turn the taps on and hope they end up in the right location. This is the product of focusing on the back end where you take everyone's job, make them insecure, cancel the divisions of general practice and throw it all up in the air. What do you think stakeholders do? They are completely panicked about where they will be next. They have no idea whether they will get a share of the Medicare local pie. Do you know what they do for two or three years? They stop criticising the government, they grab one-page press releases and say, 'What are we going to do? How does my job survive? How can I make this system work that has been imposed on me?' That is understandable. I have always said that, as health is probably the most complex system run by a government, reform of it is a privilege that is earned; it is not an automatic right of incumbency.


This is a government that did nothing except talk about a takeover and then not do it and then come up with a plan that states rejected. Then, in this period of absolutely desolate despondency in a government that is completely and utterly distracted from the main game, we have these flirtations with truthfulness. The former health minister said:


… we don’t want to increase the size of the bureaucracy—it’s not appropriate for us to establish an authority where there is not a need to do so. There will need to be people who can process essentially the cheques that need to be paid through to local hospital networks, but it doesn’t require an authority.


I rest my case. The former health minister said that and yet here we are today consuming valuable time that could be spent finding solutions for remote and Indigenous Australian health delivery—but we are not. Why not? Because the price of setting up these administrations is removing money from the Cape York welfare reforms. That is right, with new ways of looking after children, identifying those most at risk, the direct instruction model of education to keep kids at school, not just once in the morning but all day, enjoying school, staying at school and graduating school. That money gets ripped to do what we are debating today—the 11th authority. It is like you get one extra authority thrown in when you establish your first 10.


We are quite happy to talk about the importance of these reforms and of jurisdictions working together, but you read a set of budget papers and there are 38 employees in rural health services, then you read the next set of budget papers and there are 98 employees. I do not want this to be a flippant comment, but once there was a department of health to do these things. I do not mind us finding smarter ways to do things but what we are doing here is the lazy approach. It is more layers, more levels and no necessary agreement from our state colleagues on the way this is being done.


When the political obituary is written of this government they in health will say that they fiddled with the back end but never took the hard yards at the front. It is a government quite happy to fiddle with financing, as they do around school reforms, but they are not looking at quality. The one thing that a government can do is focus on quality of care. Have there been any reforms around practice incentives? No—just move the bar higher to save a few quid. Have there been any reforms around chronic disease management so that we get guaranteed outcomes when a patient comes to a GP? No—just keep paying the money out without any guarantee of quality outcomes.


The government has been incumbent now for four years. It is time now to take some responsibility for the outcomes of the health system and to stop fiddling with the back end. Get your head out from around the back and come and live with a local remote nurse for a week and come and see chronic renal services being delivered in Central Australia in the Western Desert. Get out of Canberra, get out of the beltway and start looking after local service providers. Free them up to unlock the potential of this great health system.

Ms PLIBERSEK
 (Sydney—Minister for Health) (13:36):  I will not spend too much time talking about the previous member's contribution, but I cannot go past pointing out a few things. When he said, 'What did you spend out of the stimulus? Not a cent on health and hospitals.' Well, not a cent beside the $5 billion in the Health and Hospitals Fund. I guess if he thinks that is nothing then he probably has a different view of value for money from me, as well as $600 million on the GP superclinics and GP clinic upgrades. He spoke about bureaucracy as though this is all about bureaucracy. There is no net increase in bureaucracy because of these measures. This measure will move some staff who were in the department of health to an independent body. You would think that having an independent body would be something that would be welcomed by members opposite. The previous speaker was concerned about this all being about bureaucracy and the back end. He failed to mention the increased investment that the Commonwealth will make in hospitals over coming years—an extra $20 billion into hospitals and into hospital services, going up to, initially, 45 per cent and then 50 per cent of the funding of the growth in the efficient price of hospital services.


In fact, the previous government, when Tony Abbott was health minister, decreased the proportion of Commonwealth funding going to hospitals. This government is increasing the proportion of Commonwealth funding going into hospitals. We are talking about a guaranteed $16.4 billion extra in coming years. The idea that we make that investment without having the surety, transparency and insight that these independent funding bodies give us is not right. That is the reason the coalition never made any health reforms, that they never improved our health system—because they were ripping money out of it. But the money they did put in, they just shovelled out the door without watching where it went. The government not only have the health funding body that we are speaking about today but also have the MyHospitals website that allows people to see in detail the performance of their own hospitals.


I thank members for their contributions to the debate on these bills, the National Health Reform Amendment (Administrator and National Health Funding Body) Bill 2012 and the Federal Financial Relations Amendment (National Health Reform Bill) 2012. These bills represent a critical part of the government's historic national health reforms and deliver on improving the sustainability and transparency of funding for our nation's public hospital system.


Under the National Health Reform Agreement the Commonwealth government and all state and territory governments have agreed to implement new funding arrangements for our public hospitals to improve access, transparency and financial sustainability. The National Health Reform Amendment Bill provides a key element of that agreement through the creation of the National Health Funding Pool Administrator and the National Health Funding Body. Corresponding legislation will also be introduced in all states and territories, supporting the establishment of the administrator. The administrator will be responsible for calculating and advising the Treasurer of the levels of Commonwealth funding for public hospitals required to meet our commitments under the National Health Reform Agreement. He or she will also be responsible for making payments from the National Health Funding Pool and reporting each month and annually on the amounts paid through the National Health Funding Pool to local hospital networks, the basis on which payments were made and the number of services provided. This will provide unparalleled transparency in public hospital funding. For the first time, the public will see how much funding flows to local hospital networks and why and where the money comes from.


The provisions relating to the appointment of the administrator will be the same in the Commonwealth and state and territory acts. I will shortly be moving amendments to the bill to give effect to an agreement with the states to split the functions of the administrator between Commonwealth and state laws. But the sum of the functions will remain as they are expressed in the current bill.


This legislation also establishes a national health funding body to assist the administrator in his or her tasks. Since this bill was first presented to the parliament the Senate Finance and Public Administration Legislation Committee has conducted an inquiry. I am pleased to inform the House that the committee has recommended that the bill be passed, with the amendments that I will shortly be moving on behalf of the government. 


The Federal Financial Relations Amendment (National Health Reform) Bill 2012 will also put Australia's federal financial relations on a more sustainable footing for the future and allow us to better manage health expenditure growth. These changes are designed to deliver value for money spent on important health services. This bill makes our health reforms possible so that future generations can enjoy an affordable and sustainable healthcare system.


I thank, again, the members who have contributed to this debate. The establishment of the National Health Funding Administrator and the National Health Funding Body is clear evidence of the government's ongoing drive to deliver for all Australians the best-quality healthcare possible and to improve the transparency of our health system.


I note that the shadow minister for health and ageing has entered the House. He asked earlier about the number of public servants who would be employed by this body. About 20 people will manage about $30 billion of finances going to hospital health services. However, there is no net increase in the number of health bureaucrats because we are, at the same time, reducing the number of health bureaucrats in the health department itself. I commend the bills to the house.

"Laming, Andrew, MP",LP,2012-05-24,"



Mr LAMING
 (Bowman) (13:25):  This is an important debate about the healthcare of this country. This is an important debate about whether you invest $692 million in non-service-providing bureaucracy. This is a debate about whether, having set up 10 authorities in health, you set up an 11th. This is a debate about just how much focus you can place on the back-end, fiddling with the structure of our health system, without putting any skin in the game at the front. This is fundamentally about how much money is ripped out of service provision in order to fund this government's preoccupation with setting up more authorities and spending more money on layers of bureaucracy that once was done by something called the Department of Health.


I can understand that the more consultants one employs, the more you need a panel to monitor them; and that in turn is watched by committees; and that in turn is guided by councils and is ultimately answerable to authorities one after the other. I can also see good reason, from the Left side of politics, to simply generate more and more of these layers and call it transparency. I can understand why ultimately, when you are trying to guarantee more outcomes, and a floor in outcomes, in the end you simply need more people watching the system to achieve that. I can also see, from where those people come from, why that is so important to them.


But this debate is also about whether we are prepared to turn our health system around and put the patient at the centre of that experience, whether we are going to unlock resources and make them available to the clinicians on the frontline that know how to make the system work better but are currently disempowered to do so. Today's debate is quite simply about how far we are prepared to go before we have a system that is completely out of balance, with a focus on bureaucracy and not enough on the patient.


There are actually truly important things to be focused on in health policy, but this is by an administration that spent not $1 and not one cent of the stimulus package on health. If healthcare were something truly important, Minister Plibersek, tell me exactly what in the stimulus package was spent on healthcare and what proportion of it was spent on health. You will always have a procession of government MPs from both sides, when they are incumbent in government, saying they are spending more than their predecessors, but that is not the debate. Healthcare is growing and Australia's expenditure on health is approaching 10 per cent of GDP. Every administration will claim they spend more than their predecessor. No, this is the debate about just how many layers of bureaucracy are needed for a system to work. At some point we have to say that is enough.


I can understand wishing to continue the important roles of many of these commissions and councils. But we also need to ask ourselves how big they have to be. This is not a debate about the ends, it is a debate about the means by which we get there. If I go through the $118 million over four years on the National Health Performance Authority and the other nine authorities that have been established—not even including those that already existed and are being continued—at some point we have to say, is this the best way to spend the money? You only have to look at the budget—the cold, hard reality of every budget—to see the context in which these authorities are being set up. It is simply by ripping money off service providers and simply by building less Indigenous health infrastructure. It is about removing money from important things like delivering public and preventative healthcare. Let's go through it: I am not giving you this data, I am reading it from the budget papers—$3.3 million cut from substance misuse programs, particularly in Indigenous Australia. If there is one thing you ask people in Central Australia most it is, 'Where are the support services for those who need them most?' There was $68 million cut from the health workforce programs and $75 million cut from Indigenous health infrastructure. This is the currency that builds these new authorities.


I am not for a moment going to say that we do not need a system to get the Commonwealth and states working together, but I am criticising the size, the mechanism and the delays in how it is being done. I am criticising the fact that there has been a complete focus on the back end of the health system by an administration that has lost sight of the front end. There is effectively no communication with rural doctors about ways to retain them in practice or about the reforms around geographical classification systems. This is a government in denial. I say, simply, that what we need to be doing in Australia is pick up what is truly at the forefront to give us a cutting-edge health system. We have seen this in other nations around the world who have freed themselves from the almost puerile debate about the fact that there is no role for private health in medicine. Parts of Europe have effectively moved on from that debate.


We have no movement whatsoever on workforce productivity and no action around the Productivity Commission reports. The reality is that in public radiotherapy in this country you will wait 10 weeks on average for treatment if you do not have private health insurance, but there is no movement from the other side to fix that problem. There is no movement from the Commonwealth. There is no movement from the fact that they have 21 public health staff per linear accelerator in the public system and about 11 to 12 in the private system. There is no answer to that.


In relation to mental health they have been dragged kicking and screaming to a solution after leaders from mental health forums had to resign their positions to get some action from this government. In the big area of time to commercialisation, pharmacogenomics, which is the need to have companion diagnostics for more efficient prescribing, none of that is being addressed, where massive savings exist. Of course, in this proposition we simply have Health Workforce Australia, with a considerable amount of money, working slowly through the modelling process to fund solutions particularly for regional and remote Australia, for providers practising at top of licence and in making sure we are providing the workforce that we will need in decades to come.


At the moment we have deficits with doctor numbers, deficits with nursing numbers and no other answer from this government except, 'We'll train more.' That is right—they will simply turn the taps on and hope they end up in the right location. This is the product of focusing on the back end where you take everyone's job, make them insecure, cancel the divisions of general practice and throw it all up in the air. What do you think stakeholders do? They are completely panicked about where they will be next. They have no idea whether they will get a share of the Medicare local pie. Do you know what they do for two or three years? They stop criticising the government, they grab one-page press releases and say, 'What are we going to do? How does my job survive? How can I make this system work that has been imposed on me?' That is understandable. I have always said that, as health is probably the most complex system run by a government, reform of it is a privilege that is earned; it is not an automatic right of incumbency.


This is a government that did nothing except talk about a takeover and then not do it and then come up with a plan that states rejected. Then, in this period of absolutely desolate despondency in a government that is completely and utterly distracted from the main game, we have these flirtations with truthfulness. The former health minister said:


… we don’t want to increase the size of the bureaucracy—it’s not appropriate for us to establish an authority where there is not a need to do so. There will need to be people who can process essentially the cheques that need to be paid through to local hospital networks, but it doesn’t require an authority.


I rest my case. The former health minister said that and yet here we are today consuming valuable time that could be spent finding solutions for remote and Indigenous Australian health delivery—but we are not. Why not? Because the price of setting up these administrations is removing money from the Cape York welfare reforms. That is right, with new ways of looking after children, identifying those most at risk, the direct instruction model of education to keep kids at school, not just once in the morning but all day, enjoying school, staying at school and graduating school. That money gets ripped to do what we are debating today—the 11th authority. It is like you get one extra authority thrown in when you establish your first 10.


We are quite happy to talk about the importance of these reforms and of jurisdictions working together, but you read a set of budget papers and there are 38 employees in rural health services, then you read the next set of budget papers and there are 98 employees. I do not want this to be a flippant comment, but once there was a department of health to do these things. I do not mind us finding smarter ways to do things but what we are doing here is the lazy approach. It is more layers, more levels and no necessary agreement from our state colleagues on the way this is being done.


When the political obituary is written of this government they in health will say that they fiddled with the back end but never took the hard yards at the front. It is a government quite happy to fiddle with financing, as they do around school reforms, but they are not looking at quality. The one thing that a government can do is focus on quality of care. Have there been any reforms around practice incentives? No—just move the bar higher to save a few quid. Have there been any reforms around chronic disease management so that we get guaranteed outcomes when a patient comes to a GP? No—just keep paying the money out without any guarantee of quality outcomes.


The government has been incumbent now for four years. It is time now to take some responsibility for the outcomes of the health system and to stop fiddling with the back end. Get your head out from around the back and come and live with a local remote nurse for a week and come and see chronic renal services being delivered in Central Australia in the Western Desert. Get out of Canberra, get out of the beltway and start looking after local service providers. Free them up to unlock the potential of this great health system.

Ms PLIBERSEK
 (Sydney—Minister for Health) (13:36):  I will not spend too much time talking about the previous member's contribution, but I cannot go past pointing out a few things. When he said, 'What did you spend out of the stimulus? Not a cent on health and hospitals.' Well, not a cent beside the $5 billion in the Health and Hospitals Fund. I guess if he thinks that is nothing then he probably has a different view of value for money from me, as well as $600 million on the GP superclinics and GP clinic upgrades. He spoke about bureaucracy as though this is all about bureaucracy. There is no net increase in bureaucracy because of these measures. This measure will move some staff who were in the department of health to an independent body. You would think that having an independent body would be something that would be welcomed by members opposite.

Mr MATHESON
 (Macarthur) (13:45):  Tomorrow is 65 Roses Day and some very special children in my electorate will be raising awareness about cystic fibrosis. CF is the most common, life-threatening, recessive genetic condition affecting Australian children and young adults today. There are about 3,000 people living with the condition in Australia. CF seriously affects breathing and digestion, and sufferers need up to two hours of intensive chest physio daily to help break up the mucus in their lungs so they can breathe. They also take up to 40 enzyme tablets to help with digestion every day just to survive. The average life expectancy of someone with CF is now in their mid-30s, but there are still many children who do not reach adulthood and, sadly, there is no cure. In Australia, one in every 2,500 babies will be born with CF and there are one million genetic carriers.


Today, there are more than 80 people living with CF in Macarthur and most of them are children. Earlier this year I was brought to tears when I heard 12-year-old Julia Free from Elderslie speak about her condition. Julia said that, even though CF was a big part of her everyday life, she would not let it define who she was. She does not want people to think she is special because she has CF; she just wants to be herself. And, while she hates the hospital visits, going to clinic, missing school, the coughing attacks, surgery and having drugs pumped through a line in her arm, Julia considers herself lucky to have a family and community that love her and are helping her raise money to find a cure.


I encourage everyone in this place to make a donation towards 65 Roses Day tomorrow so that Julia's one wish can come true: that CF will soon stand for one thing—cure found.

Leave not granted.

"Abbott, Tony, MP",LP,2012-05-24,"



Mr ABBOTT
 (Warringah—Leader of the Opposition) (14:55):  I move:


That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the Member for Warringah from moving forthwith:


That this House censures the Prime Minister for her consistent failure to be honest with the Australian people.


We have a right to move a censure motion in this parliament, and the Prime Minister has an obligation to respond. She has a duty to this parliament and she should not shirk her duty. I have to say no previous Prime Minister, no Prime Minister in living memory, would be as cowardly in facing this parliament as this Prime Minister is. That is why standing orders should be suspended.


Standing orders must be suspended because this parliament needs to debate the Prime Minister's consistent failure to be open and honest with the Australian people. And hasn't there been a long litany of betrayals? There was her failure to be straight with the member for Griffith over the prime-ministership. There was her failure to be honest with the Australian people before the last election over the carbon tax. There was her failure to be honest and straight with the member for Denison over poker machine reform. There was her betrayal of the member for Scullin over the speakership. There was her failure, seen again and again in question time this week, to be honest with the Australian people and this parliament over the carbon tax, pretending time and time again that it had no impact on the decision to close the Kurri Kurri smelter when plainly it had every impact on that decision.


Is it any wonder that Bill Kelty, in desperation over the legend of the Labor Party, said to his former colleagues, 'Start with the truth. Why don't you try the truth?' This is a Prime Minister who has never seen the truth, never known the truth and, if she ever saw it, she would flee from it, as she flees from this parliament day in, day out. Where this Prime Minister has particularly failed to be straight with the people and the parliament—and this is why standing orders should be suspended—is over the member for Dobell and his statement to the parliament earlier this week.


At a human level, I have a great deal of sympathy for the member for Dobell. All of us in this chamber, including members on this side of the House, have a great deal of sympathy at a human level for the member for Dobell. We have no sympathy though for a government and for a prime minister who have put him in this position by insisting that he remain in the parliament when the honourable course of action for him would be to resign. That would be the honourable course of action for the member for Dobell. Standing orders must be suspended—




Mr Albanese:
  Madam Deputy Speaker, I am reluctant to move a point of order, but there is a very clear standing order for which the Leader of the Opposition's statements are out of order. There cannot be a statement that someone must resign from the parliament. It is clearly out of order.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The Leader of the Opposition has the call and will refer to the motion before the chair.




Mr ABBOTT:
  Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. Standing orders must be suspended because it is the Prime Minister who is in the dock here, not the member for Dobell. There are many members of parliament over the years whose behaviour has been questionable, but it is how their party leaders have dealt with that behaviour that really matters and has determined the standing or otherwise of this parliament.


Standing orders must be suspended so this Prime Minister's integrity can be debated. That is the fundamental issue that has been before the parliament this week. For months the Prime Minister has been saying to us every time we have asked questions about the member for Dobell, 'Just wait for the Fair Work Australia report,' and we waited, and we waited, and we waited, and we waited. For almost four years we waited for that report. I have to say it was worth waiting for. There were damning findings in that report, damning findings that $100,000 of union members' cash had been withdrawn improperly and unaccountably, that hundreds of thousands of dollars of union members' money had been used improperly to secure election and that $6,000 of union members' cash had been used on escort services. These are facts, these are findings of facts, not mere allegations. And where is the Prime Minister? She is skulking in the whip's office rather than addressing this issue of integrity which is dogging her government.


Standing orders must be suspended because for months the Prime Minister said she had full confidence in the member for Dobell. She said she wanted him to be in the parliament for many, many years. Now, along with the carbon tax that she will not actually name, this is the one subject that she refuses to deal with. She said to the ACTU that she was disgusted with a member and with a union, refusing to name the member and refusing to name the union. She told the public that a line had been crossed, but refused to explain exactly what that line had been. Now—and this is why standing orders must be suspended—she says that the member is too tainted to sit with Labor in the caucus, but he is not too tainted to sit with Labor in the parliament. That is why standing orders must be suspended.


This government has no concern for the member for Dobell, as the huge absence of members opposite during his statement demonstrated. This government is only concerned with its own survival, and that is why standing orders must suspended. The Prime Minister needs to say who she believes. Does she believe the meticulous, exacting report and findings of Fair Work Australia or does she believe the member? Does she believe this meticulous report or does she believe a self-serving piece of parliamentary theatre? Standing orders must be suspended so this Prime Minister can declare who she backs. Does she back her creation, Fair Work Australia, or does she back the member whose support she is so desperately clinging to to survive in office? This is a fundamental question of integrity for the Prime Minister, and that is why it is so disgraceful that she will not stand up in this parliament and answer it.


The Prime Minister cannot avoid dealing with this fundamental choice and she should not run away from it, because Fair Work Australia and the member for Dobell both cannot be right. Either the member for Dobell has misled the parliament or Fair Work Australia is guilty of the most extraordinary incompetence, of the most remarkable conspiracy, in the long and not always glorious history of this parliament. I say to members opposite that the Australian public are watching what happens in this parliament. They are embarrassed by the revelations about the member for Dobell but more and more they are impatient and disgusted with this Prime Minister.


Standing orders should be suspended because there is nothing wrong with our country that a change of government would not improve. More particularly there is nothing wrong with this parliament that a change of government could not fix. This parliament itself is not the problem. The problem is a government and a Prime Minister that are consistently trashing, debasing and demeaning this parliament in their desperate quest to survive. This is a rotten government, a rotten Prime Minister. It should go and it should go now.

Mr PYNE
 (Sturt—Manager of Opposition Business) (15:05):  I second the motion. It is bad enough that the Prime Minister breaks her promises to the Australian people, but it is even worse that she takes the coward's course of not standing up and fighting for her position. She takes the coward's course of running from the fight, turning her back to the battle and, instead, leaving it up to the Leader of the House every time to defend her tawdry record in office in this place on these suspension motions. But it is understandable because how could the Prime Minister stand in this House and defend the indefensible.



Mr Ruddock interjecting—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Ms AE Burke
):  Order! The member for Berowra.




Mr PYNE:
  It is no surprise that she will not be here today, that she will not stand in this House to defend the indefensible. That is another reason why she should be censured: for her failure to be honest with the Australian people. She should be censured because the Prime Minister has lost the trust of the Australian people, she should be censured because the Prime Minister presides over a rotten government and she should be censured because the Australian people deserve better. I thought in question time I was not listening to Julia—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Order! The Manager of Opposition Business.




Mr PYNE:
  Standing orders should be suspended because this motion of censure against the Prime Minister is the most important matter that we can deal with before the House today. Questioning the honesty, the integrity and the character of a Prime Minister is a very serious step. We have taken it very rarely in the last five years. We may have moved many suspensions; we have hardly moved any censures. The import part of this debate is that it is about the censure of the Prime Minister. In question time the Prime Minister said:


… there is one side of politics … that you can trust …


I thought for a minute that I was listening to Julia Zemiro the comedian, not to Julia Gillard the Prime Minister. How could the Prime Minister stand in this place and seriously so argue, after the breach of faith on the carbon tax, the mandatory precommitment for poker machines, the East Timor solution, the citizens assembly and the Australia Day riot? One after another, she has broken her promises to the Australian people. That is why standing orders should be suspended, so that we can debate this motion properly and so that speakers from both sides of the House can take the time necessary. 


If the government think they can defend the Prime Minister, why would they not take the censure? Former Prime Minister Howard used to take every censure that the then opposition moved, because former Prime Minister Howard had the confidence to stand in this House and defend his record, to stand and defend his government.


This Prime Minister failed to take the censure. She scurried from the chamber to coward's castle and refused to stand in here and defend her record, and for that she should be condemned. Don't just take my word for it, Madam Deputy Speaker: standing orders should be suspended and this motion should be debated, because there are people on that side of the House who want to debate this motion. Some of them have done so in the last three months. In fact, a third of the caucus voted against the Prime Minister. Rather than vote for this Prime Minister, they voted for someone they described as a psychopath. 


In fact, former Prime Minister Rudd was the one who, on 24 February, said: 


Julia has lost the trust of the Australian people …


He also said:


It wasn't K Rudd who made a pre-election commitment on a carbon tax. It wasn't K Rudd who made a particular commitment to Mr Wilkie on the question of poker machines. It wasn’t K Rudd who had anything to do with the East Timor solution or the Malaysia solution. These were initiatives and decisions taken uniquely by the prime minister.


Wasn't he absolutely right? 




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Ms AE Burke
):  Order! The Manager of Opposition Business needs to return to the motion before the chair.




Mr PYNE:
  And that is why the Prime Minister should come into the House and debate this motion. The reason why standing orders should be suspended is that the censure motion must be debated in this House. I call on the cross-benchers to support this motion to suspend, because debating the integrity of the Prime Minister and her character is the most important thing we can do in this parliament to try to restore some integrity to this disastrous 43rd Parliament, which has broken the confidence of the Australian people in their national government. It is time now—not in June, not at the end of next year—for the Prime Minister to go. It is time right now, today, for the caucus to act, to do what we all know they want to do, to save their own political hides and dispatch this Prime Minister.

He does not have the character to be Prime Minister of this nation.




Ms Julie Bishop:
  Madam Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The Leader of the House is not speaking to the motion. He is telling false statements—in fact, telling lies about the Leader of the Opposition.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The Leader of the House has the call.




Mr ALBANESE:
  Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. This is a Leader of the Opposition who is into the politics of confrontation, aggression and conflict. That is what defines him—his very meaning— because he does not want to engage in a debate about substance and policy. Here we are, one week after the budget and the coalition are moving a suspension of standing orders, not to debate the economic policy and their alternative—which he gave on the Thursday night, which had no substance at all—not to debate the economic impact of what is occurring in Europe, not to debate the impact of what is happening with employment, climate change, social policy, transport policy, health policy and education policy. No. On 58 separate occasions they have moved a suspension of standing orders. That is why you just cannot take them seriously.


The opposition said before, 'This is a suspension of standing orders to have a censure debate. We don't do that very often.' Thirty-four times they have done it—they are delusional, and the parliament is only halfway through the term—out of the 58 suspensions. They are so delusional.


It is as though they go into the office of the Manager of Opposition Business for tactics every morning. They ask: 'What will we do today?' The 30 of them who sit on the 'tactics committee' have a debate and they all disagree, so they end up settling on: 'I know, we'll do what we did yesterday.' It is groundhog day because, no matter what is happening in the economy, today we had a few questions about the company in Kurri Kurri. You would think the opposition would want a debate on it. No, no. The Leader of the Opposition—the workers' friend—will be up there on Saturday, with a nudge, nudge, wink, wink, saying that it is all a result of the carbon price, but he is actually not prepared to debate the substance. I will tell you what I have been doing today, as a minister of the Crown: I have introduced five pieces of legislation, including legislation to create a national maritime regulator benefiting the economy by $30 billion over 20 years. I have introduced legislation to reform the Navigation Act. The act has been there since 1912 and still has provisions in it to allow a master of a ship to shoot someone and to be immune from prosecution. It still has provisions in it that the master has to be informed if a lunatic is coming on board. That could be appropriate! But we have reformed it—done major reform. We have announced a $20 million package to help exports in Tasmania, with my Tasmanian Labor colleagues and the member for Denison, who lobbied for this project. What did they do about it? Nothing. I will tell you what we have done. We are continuing to work on the Pacific Highway. What are they doing? Sledging it and saying no to it.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Ms AE Burke
):  Order! The Leader of the House will return to the motion.




Mr ALBANESE:
  The reason why standing orders should not be suspended, Madam Deputy Speaker, is because they are the issues of substance.


That is why I went into politics. I went into politics to make a difference—to make a difference to the people who I grew up with, to the vulnerable people in the community, through things such as the National Disability Insurance Scheme and the education refund and through measures such as the industrial relations reforms we have brought in to get rid of Work Choices and, most fundamentally, to make sure that we have a strong economy.


And there is no stronger economy anywhere in the world. For the first time in 40 years, under this Prime Minister and this Treasurer we have unemployment, official interest rates and inflation all under five per cent—for the first time in 40 years. No wonder they do not want to debate us on substance. If you want to have a debate about those issues, bring it on! But if you just want this self-indulgent, blood-lust for power that we see from this megalomaniac opposite, then we will say no to that, because what we are seeing day after day in this parliament is a trashing of the pillars of democracy, a trashing of the separation of powers, a trashing of the presumption of innocence, a trashing of the rule of law.


It is fundamentally important that we meet the challenge which is there in this hung parliament. A hung parliament is different. It does bring with it different characteristics. It brings forward a challenge for the maturity of our democracy. It is the case that, for the first time since the Second World War, the government does not have a majority on the floor of this parliament. That is an opportunity as well as a challenge. It is an opportunity to have a far more consultative parliament. It is an opportunity to be far more inclusive than the traditional system whereby a government has a majority and uses its numbers to crunch through. It is an opportunity to change that. But what we are seeing from those opposite is the longest dummy spit in Australian political history—a refusal to accept the result from the Australian people in 2010. We see every single day a refusal and a challenge to the legitimacy not of this government but of our democracy. That is what has made them angry. And that is why you have the extraordinary proposition that people should just be told to resign and people should just change the outcome. We even had, last week, the Manager of Opposition Business put notices on the motion—notices on the paper—




Mr Pyne:
  Motions on the Notice Paper.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Order, the member for Sturt! The Manager of Opposition Business is being petty.




Mr ALBANESE:
  that people could be suspended from the parliament. He withdrew that this week. He withdrew it. So what is this all about? The idea that, in the future, a government that has a majority would use that majority to change the make-up of an elected parliament. These are precedents that have consequences for the future. This is taking the politics of destructiveness to a very dangerous level indeed. And that is why senior people such as Nick Minchin have warned against the approach of this Leader of the Opposition and those who sit behind him.


I know that many of them are very uncomfortable with the actions of the opposition—very uncomfortable indeed. There was even the issue of the disclosure of the committee that met last night, where you had, to his great credit, Mr Secker agreeing with Yvette D'Ath, the chair, in terms of the reference on that issue. So you have people who have stood up for integrity of process, as did the member for Canning, to his great credit. But what we see continually is a preparedness to trash any rule whatsoever. This bloke is not a conservative; he is just a reactionary.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Order! The time allotted for the debate has expired. The question is that the motion moved by the Leader of the Opposition be agreed to.

"Abbott, Tony, MP",LP,2012-05-24,"



Mr ABBOTT
 (Warringah—Leader of the Opposition) (14:55):  I move:


That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the Member for Warringah from moving forthwith:


That this House censures the Prime Minister for her consistent failure to be honest with the Australian people.


We have a right to move a censure motion in this parliament, and the Prime Minister has an obligation to respond. She has a duty to this parliament and she should not shirk her duty. I have to say no previous Prime Minister, no Prime Minister in living memory, would be as cowardly in facing this parliament as this Prime Minister is. That is why standing orders should be suspended.


Standing orders must be suspended because this parliament needs to debate the Prime Minister's consistent failure to be open and honest with the Australian people. And hasn't there been a long litany of betrayals? There was her failure to be straight with the member for Griffith over the prime-ministership. There was her failure to be honest with the Australian people before the last election over the carbon tax. There was her failure to be honest and straight with the member for Denison over poker machine reform. There was her betrayal of the member for Scullin over the speakership. There was her failure, seen again and again in question time this week, to be honest with the Australian people and this parliament over the carbon tax, pretending time and time again that it had no impact on the decision to close the Kurri Kurri smelter when plainly it had every impact on that decision.


Is it any wonder that Bill Kelty, in desperation over the legend of the Labor Party, said to his former colleagues, 'Start with the truth. Why don't you try the truth?' This is a Prime Minister who has never seen the truth, never known the truth and, if she ever saw it, she would flee from it, as she flees from this parliament day in, day out. Where this Prime Minister has particularly failed to be straight with the people and the parliament—and this is why standing orders should be suspended—is over the member for Dobell and his statement to the parliament earlier this week.


At a human level, I have a great deal of sympathy for the member for Dobell. All of us in this chamber, including members on this side of the House, have a great deal of sympathy at a human level for the member for Dobell. We have no sympathy though for a government and for a prime minister who have put him in this position by insisting that he remain in the parliament when the honourable course of action for him would be to resign. That would be the honourable course of action for the member for Dobell. Standing orders must be suspended—




Mr Albanese:
  Madam Deputy Speaker, I am reluctant to move a point of order, but there is a very clear standing order for which the Leader of the Opposition's statements are out of order. There cannot be a statement that someone must resign from the parliament. It is clearly out of order.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The Leader of the Opposition has the call and will refer to the motion before the chair.




Mr ABBOTT:
  Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. Standing orders must be suspended because it is the Prime Minister who is in the dock here, not the member for Dobell. There are many members of parliament over the years whose behaviour has been questionable, but it is how their party leaders have dealt with that behaviour that really matters and has determined the standing or otherwise of this parliament.


Standing orders must be suspended so this Prime Minister's integrity can be debated. That is the fundamental issue that has been before the parliament this week. For months the Prime Minister has been saying to us every time we have asked questions about the member for Dobell, 'Just wait for the Fair Work Australia report,' and we waited, and we waited, and we waited, and we waited. For almost four years we waited for that report. I have to say it was worth waiting for. There were damning findings in that report, damning findings that $100,000 of union members' cash had been withdrawn improperly and unaccountably, that hundreds of thousands of dollars of union members' money had been used improperly to secure election and that $6,000 of union members' cash had been used on escort services. These are facts, these are findings of facts, not mere allegations. And where is the Prime Minister? She is skulking in the whip's office rather than addressing this issue of integrity which is dogging her government.


Standing orders must be suspended because for months the Prime Minister said she had full confidence in the member for Dobell. She said she wanted him to be in the parliament for many, many years. Now, along with the carbon tax that she will not actually name, this is the one subject that she refuses to deal with. She said to the ACTU that she was disgusted with a member and with a union, refusing to name the member and refusing to name the union. She told the public that a line had been crossed, but refused to explain exactly what that line had been. Now—and this is why standing orders must be suspended—she says that the member is too tainted to sit with Labor in the caucus, but he is not too tainted to sit with Labor in the parliament. That is why standing orders must be suspended.


This government has no concern for the member for Dobell, as the huge absence of members opposite during his statement demonstrated. This government is only concerned with its own survival, and that is why standing orders must suspended. The Prime Minister needs to say who she believes. Does she believe the meticulous, exacting report and findings of Fair Work Australia or does she believe the member? Does she believe this meticulous report or does she believe a self-serving piece of parliamentary theatre? Standing orders must be suspended so this Prime Minister can declare who she backs. Does she back her creation, Fair Work Australia, or does she back the member whose support she is so desperately clinging to to survive in office? This is a fundamental question of integrity for the Prime Minister, and that is why it is so disgraceful that she will not stand up in this parliament and answer it.


The Prime Minister cannot avoid dealing with this fundamental choice and she should not run away from it, because Fair Work Australia and the member for Dobell both cannot be right. Either the member for Dobell has misled the parliament or Fair Work Australia is guilty of the most extraordinary incompetence, of the most remarkable conspiracy, in the long and not always glorious history of this parliament. I say to members opposite that the Australian public are watching what happens in this parliament. They are embarrassed by the revelations about the member for Dobell but more and more they are impatient and disgusted with this Prime Minister.


Standing orders should be suspended because there is nothing wrong with our country that a change of government would not improve. More particularly there is nothing wrong with this parliament that a change of government could not fix. This parliament itself is not the problem. The problem is a government and a Prime Minister that are consistently trashing, debasing and demeaning this parliament in their desperate quest to survive. This is a rotten government, a rotten Prime Minister. It should go and it should go now.

"Pyne, Christopher, MP",LP,2012-05-24,"



Mr PYNE
 (Sturt—Manager of Opposition Business) (15:05):  I second the motion. It is bad enough that the Prime Minister breaks her promises to the Australian people, but it is even worse that she takes the coward's course of not standing up and fighting for her position. She takes the coward's course of running from the fight, turning her back to the battle and, instead, leaving it up to the Leader of the House every time to defend her tawdry record in office in this place on these suspension motions. But it is understandable because how could the Prime Minister stand in this House and defend the indefensible.



Mr Ruddock interjecting—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Ms AE Burke
):  Order! The member for Berowra.




Mr PYNE:
  It is no surprise that she will not be here today, that she will not stand in this House to defend the indefensible. That is another reason why she should be censured: for her failure to be honest with the Australian people. She should be censured because the Prime Minister has lost the trust of the Australian people, she should be censured because the Prime Minister presides over a rotten government and she should be censured because the Australian people deserve better. I thought in question time I was not listening to Julia—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Order! The Manager of Opposition Business.




Mr PYNE:
  Standing orders should be suspended because this motion of censure against the Prime Minister is the most important matter that we can deal with before the House today. Questioning the honesty, the integrity and the character of a Prime Minister is a very serious step. We have taken it very rarely in the last five years. We may have moved many suspensions; we have hardly moved any censures. The import part of this debate is that it is about the censure of the Prime Minister. In question time the Prime Minister said:


… there is one side of politics … that you can trust …


I thought for a minute that I was listening to Julia Zemiro the comedian, not to Julia Gillard the Prime Minister. How could the Prime Minister stand in this place and seriously so argue, after the breach of faith on the carbon tax, the mandatory precommitment for poker machines, the East Timor solution, the citizens assembly and the Australia Day riot? One after another, she has broken her promises to the Australian people. That is why standing orders should be suspended, so that we can debate this motion properly and so that speakers from both sides of the House can take the time necessary. 


If the government think they can defend the Prime Minister, why would they not take the censure? Former Prime Minister Howard used to take every censure that the then opposition moved, because former Prime Minister Howard had the confidence to stand in this House and defend his record, to stand and defend his government.


This Prime Minister failed to take the censure. She scurried from the chamber to coward's castle and refused to stand in here and defend her record, and for that she should be condemned. Don't just take my word for it, Madam Deputy Speaker: standing orders should be suspended and this motion should be debated, because there are people on that side of the House who want to debate this motion. Some of them have done so in the last three months. In fact, a third of the caucus voted against the Prime Minister. Rather than vote for this Prime Minister, they voted for someone they described as a psychopath. 


In fact, former Prime Minister Rudd was the one who, on 24 February, said: 


Julia has lost the trust of the Australian people …


He also said:


It wasn't K Rudd who made a pre-election commitment on a carbon tax. It wasn't K Rudd who made a particular commitment to Mr Wilkie on the question of poker machines. It wasn’t K Rudd who had anything to do with the East Timor solution or the Malaysia solution. These were initiatives and decisions taken uniquely by the prime minister.


Wasn't he absolutely right? 




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Ms AE Burke
):  Order! The Manager of Opposition Business needs to return to the motion before the chair.




Mr PYNE:
  And that is why the Prime Minister should come into the House and debate this motion. The reason why standing orders should be suspended is that the censure motion must be debated in this House. I call on the cross-benchers to support this motion to suspend, because debating the integrity of the Prime Minister and her character is the most important thing we can do in this parliament to try to restore some integrity to this disastrous 43rd Parliament, which has broken the confidence of the Australian people in their national government. It is time now—not in June, not at the end of next year—for the Prime Minister to go. It is time right now, today, for the caucus to act, to do what we all know they want to do, to save their own political hides and dispatch this Prime Minister.

Report relating to the consideration of bills introduced 21 to 24 May 2012



1. The committee met in private session on 23 and 24 May 2012.


2. The committee determined that the following referrals of bills to committees be made—




Standing Committee on Climate Change, Environment and the Arts:



Water Efficiency Labelling and Standards Amendment (Scheme Enhancements) Bill 2012.


REASONS FOR REFERRAL/PRINCIPAL ISSUES FOR CONSIDERATION: The bill gives the Minster power to make changes which will be disallowable legislative instruments. It is appropriate then that a committee investigate the reasons for giving the Minister this power.




Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services:



Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Stronger Super) Bill 2012; and


Superannuation Supervisory Levy Imposition Amendment Bill 2012.


REASONS FOR REFERRAL/PRINCIPAL ISSUES FOR CONSIDERATION: Industry concerns that technical details may not operate as intended, and dissatisfaction with the consultation process.




Standing Committee on Economics:



Clean Energy Finance Corporation Bill 2012;


Clean Energy Legislation Amendment Bill 2012;


Clean Energy (Customs Tariff Amendment) Bill 2012; and


Clean Energy (Excise Tariff Legislation Amendment) Bill 2012.


REASONS FOR REFERRAL/PRINCIPAL ISSUES FOR CONSIDERATION: (a) The advantages to the Australian economy from the establishment of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC); (b) the need for such a government entity given its stated purpose, and to investigate why market failures have occurred, particularly if such projects are expected to deliver a commercial return; (c) to investigate whether the legislation has adequate provisions when it comes to assessing the commercial feasibility of projects selected by the CEFC, and the suitability of the initiatives the CEFC will be supplementing in terms of the government's clean energy programs; (d) whether adequate safeguards and standards exist in relation to the selection of projects by the CEFC to prevent waste of taxpayer's money; and (e) the suitability of the government's accounting treatment in light of the allocation of appropriations for this government entity.


Passenger Movement Charge Amendment Bill 2012.


REASONS FOR REFERRAL/PRINCIPAL ISSUES FOR CONSIDERATION: The government told the industry that they were not going to increase the passenger movement charge – the industry did not have an adequate consultation process prior to it being flagged. It will likely have an adverse effect on the tourism sector and would be worthwhile allowing stakeholders to have input.


Tax Laws Amendment (2012 Measures No. 2) Bill 2012;


Income Tax (Managed Investment Trust Withholding Tax) Amendment Bill 2012; and


Pay As You Go Withholding Non-compliance Tax Bill 2012.


REASONS FOR REFERRAL/PRINCIPAL ISSUES FOR CONSIDERATION: In relation to the managed investment trust withholding tax — doubling of tax, impact on investment in Australia, sovereign risk issues and impact on long term infrastructure investment. In relation to consolidation measures — retrospective application of tax charges.




Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs:



Australian Human Rights Commission Amendment (National Children's Commissioner) Bill 2012.


REASONS FOR REFERRAL/PRINCIPAL ISSUES FOR CONSIDERATION: The adequacy of funding for the functions of the National Children's Commissioner and whether any existing functions of the Australian Human Rights Commission will be compromised thereby. Also, the interoperability of the functions of the National Children's Commissioner with state and territory child welfare and guardian responsibilities.


Do Not Knock Register Bill 2012.


REASONS FOR REFERRAL/PRINCIPAL ISSUES FOR CONSIDERATION: The constitutionality of the bill.


Privacy Amendment (Enhancing Privacy Protection) Bill 2012.


REASONS FOR REFERRAL/PRINCIPAL ISSUES FOR CONSIDERATION: Consideration of: (a) the adequacy of the proposed Australian Privacy Principles; (b) the efficacy of the proposed measures relating to credit reporting; (c) whether defences to contraventions should extend to inadvertent disclosures where systems incorporate appropriate protections; and (d) whether provisions relating to use of depersonalised data are appropriate.

REASONS FOR REFERRAL/PRINCIPAL ISSUES FOR CONSIDERATION: (a) The advantages to the Australian economy from the establishment of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC); (b) the need for such a government entity given its stated purpose, and to investigate why market failures have occurred, particularly if such projects are expected to deliver a commercial return; (c) to investigate whether the legislation has adequate provisions when it comes to assessing the commercial feasibility of projects selected by the CEFC, and the suitability of the initiatives the CEFC will be supplementing in terms of the government's clean energy programs; (d) whether adequate safeguards and standards exist in relation to the selection of projects by the CEFC to prevent waste of taxpayer's money; and (e) the suitability of the government's accounting treatment in light of the allocation of appropriations for this government entity.


Passenger Movement Charge Amendment Bill 2012.


REASONS FOR REFERRAL/PRINCIPAL ISSUES FOR CONSIDERATION: The government told the industry that they were not going to increase the passenger movement charge – the industry did not have an adequate consultation process prior to it being flagged. It will likely have an adverse effect on the tourism sector and would be worthwhile allowing stakeholders to have input.

"Hunt, Greg, MP",LP,2012-05-24,"



Mr HUNT
 (Flinders) (15:30):  The carbon tax was, very simply, designed to destroy jobs in the aluminium sector, it was designed to destroy jobs in the electricity sector and it was designed to destroy jobs in the food-cooling and trucking industries—and it is doing that right now. Let me begin with a real world example. Yesterday Norsk Hydro announced the loss of 344 jobs at its Kurri Kurri plant in the Hunter, right on the doorstep of the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency's own seat. This plant was started in the 1960s precisely because of the cheap electricity available to it. Its foundation stone, its fundamental principle, was that it had access to cheap electricity. For those reasons, this plant at Kurri Kurri was established. For those reasons, for the best part of 40 years there has been employment in the aluminium sector. But all of that is coming to a halt.


What did Norsk Hydro say in its statement yesterday? The government would have us believe that the carbon tax is simply a coincidence, that it is, like every other misfortune, just bad luck, somebody else's fault, something else coming along. But the statement from the company could not have been clearer:


Following a thorough review it is clear that the plant will not be profitable in the short term with current market prices, while long-term viability will be negatively affected by a number of factors including increasing energy costs and the carbon tax.


Let us look at what is happening here. With Norsk Hydro, we see that there is a bad situation, a difficult climate, for aluminium production in Australia. The worst thing you could do is take their long-term comparative advantage of relatively low energy costs—the reason that this plant was created in this place—and trash it. That is what the carbon tax does, and the evidence from the company could not have been clearer.


What was the government's response? Did the government say, 'We're sorry, we acknowledge it, we realise it'? The government went into denial. The minister for climate change said in his press release yesterday:


I have spoken with the company today, which confirmed that today's announcement has been driven by current financial losses that are unrelated to the carbon price …


So it was nothing to do with the carbon price. We thought: this does not seem right. The Leader of the Opposition asked the minister for climate change directly about statements by the company. At 2:29 pm yesterday the minister for climate change said in this House:


I spoke to a company representative again today in relation to this issue who emphasised to me that the announcement today is not driven by the implications of the carbon price.


The Prime Minister then said:


Minister Combet has spoken directly to the company today, and they are very clear that their current financial pressures have nothing to do with the carbon price.


That was despite the fact that, in its statement, the company was express, clear and absolute. But what we then discovered this morning was that the minister knew all along that the carbon tax was absolutely at the heart of it. In an interview with Aaron Carney on ABC Radio in Newcastle this morning the minister for climate change was forced to fess up that the company said something very different. He said about the discussions with him personally: 'They have described it as one of many factors in the long term.'


What are we saying here? The company told the minister. The minister said to the parliament: 'They never talked to me about it; it was never one of the factors.' The company told the minister. They also told the world via press release that the carbon tax was fundamental to their decision. The company told the minister and he deceived the parliament. The company told the world. We all knew, and the Prime Minister denied it. So what we have from this government is a denial about the jobs impact of the carbon tax, a denial about the very thing the carbon tax was intended to do.


Let us look at their own modelling. Treasury's modelling says there will be a 60 per cent reduction in aluminium production in Australia compared with what would have been the case without the carbon tax. This is not against other factors; this is against the sole variable of the carbon tax. Treasury's modelling, released late last year, says the carbon tax will see a 60 per cent reduction in aluminium production in Australia. And that is what it was intended to do; that is the way it operates. It reduces Australia's emissions by moving our production offshore to China. That does not help the world, it does not help Australia, but it sure helps China.


And so we see clear express Treasury modelling—undeniable. We have a clear express statement from the company that employed those 344 workers who will now lose their livelihoods, who will now be seeking work, who will now be wondering how they can meet their mortgage, pay their commitments and deal with the concerns of their family. These are real jobs expressly linked to the carbon tax by the company and then all denied by the government—except that the minister had to concede that what he said in this place yesterday was simply not true. And the situation for the aluminium industry and jobs gets worse. As we see, Bell Bay in Tasmania is under review. Point Henry in Victoria is under review. And, yes, it is absolutely true that there are real and profound challenges with the high dollar and with the low metals price in relation to aluminium production. That makes it even more the case that this is the worst possible time to impose a unilateral tax on Australian production that does not apply to the product of overseas competitors being brought into Australia. 


The government will say, 'Don't worry; we're giving them compensation.' The Aluminium Association's own work shows that the bill for the aluminium sector will quadruple as that compensation collapses and as the price of the carbon tax increases. Over 10 years the impact on the industry will quadruple, and that is the way they make decisions about capital allocations. That is the way they make decisions about who has a job and who does not have a job. That is the real world of decision making in business in Australia, and what we see here is that jobs are being expressly, clearly and absolutely destroyed because the cost of electricity is being driven up, because the cost of operating an aluminium plant, with their direct emissions, is being driven up and, compared with the rest of the world, an already bad situation is being made worse.


Let me turn to the cost of living side. The question in relation to electricity is absolutely central. We hear from the government, 'Look, there's only been a 10 per cent increase'—and we should be thankful for that! The New South Wales Treasury says this will become a 15 per cent increase in short order. The Electricity Supply Association, who, I would remind the government, are the very people that issue the bill—not the government; the Electricity Supply Association members issue the bill—say it will be a 20 per cent increase because there is a second whammy coming in April 2014, when they have to buy forward permits under the government's scheme. So that second price is coming as sure as night follows day—not to mention incremental price rises along the way.


For this year, if you are in New South Wales, you probably face a 16 per cent increase in your electricity bill, of which half or more is coming from the carbon tax. A bad situation is being made far worse. When the government says, 'Look, it's only 10 per cent now,' let us be absolutely clear that the next 10 per cent is coming right down the track and so we do this on top of what KPMG says is a 74 per cent rise in the cost of electricity over the last five years in my own city of Melbourne. All of this means that consumers will pay the bill. They are the ones that are going to pay the price.


Let us go forward to councils, because we heard from the minister today that the councils are not going to pay. Well, 104 councils from around Australia—Albury, Ballina, Bathurst, Bega, Bellingen, Murray, Muswellbrook, Newcastle, Orange, Bundaberg, Cairns, Central Highlands, Etheridge, Gold Coast; it goes on right around the country—received a letter from the Clean Energy Regulator in the last week which said: 'You are possibly operating a significant landfill which potentially could mean that you will be liable under the Clean Energy Act. Please advise in writing by 31 May 2012.' The reason? It is because 'you are likely to be a liable entity for the 2012-13 financial year'. That entry will be recorded in the register.


What does that mean? It means that councils around Australia, firstly, do not know for certain whether they are about to be hit; 104 councils are struggling to understand whether they will be a target. Secondly, the price of going to the tip is going up as of 1 July, and the minister knows it and the parliamentary secretary knows it. Let me give you an example from the Prime Minister's own electorate that this price rise is coming now. It comes from the budget papers on the published record of Wyndham council. Wyndham council is interesting because it is in the Prime Minister's own electorate. What have they budgeted as the amount of money they have to raise through increased rates because of the carbon tax on their landfill this year? $13.02 million. One council, Wyndham City Council, in one electorate, the Prime Minister's electorate, needs $13 million precisely because of the impact of the carbon tax.



Mr Dreyfus interjecting—




Mr HUNT:
  If the parliamentary secretary doubts it, I am happy to table the Wyndham City Council's public records for this year. Let me go further than that, though, because the question is: why has this happened? It is because they are going to have a liability for potentially 30 or 40 years for the waste which is deposited as of 1 July. The government tries to say, 'Look, they don't have to worry about that for 12 months.' But they have to collect the money now to cover that charge, because in 12 months time they are not going to be able to find who deposited the waste, who put it there. That is why Treasury has advised the Manningham City Council that they should be increasing rates now. The government knows that the price rises are coming, the government is advising councils that the price rises are coming and the government is in denial that city tips, council tips and regional tips right around the country are about to be hit. But you cannot walk away from 104 councils which have received letters from the Clean Energy Regulator in the last week.


That then brings me to the last area, the fact that we are going to see rises in refrigeration. The government says, 'Look, it is only going to be a little bit.' Here is a letter from Iceman Transport Refrigeration's Cynthia Marshall to the member for Moreton, Graham Perrett. In it she says that the carbon tax component is going to take the cost of her refrigerant gas from $5,200 a month to $20,200 a month. It is going to quadruple the price. And lest you think that this firm has it wrong, the government's own Calculating the Equivalent Carbon Price on Synthetic Greenhouse Gases information brochure shows that some prices will be, in carbon tax equivalent for a tonne of refrigerant gas, $75,000. That is not a fabrication. That is not somebody else's view. That is the government's own information. So that is what is happening in the real world: people are paying with their jobs and people are paying with their hip pockets. It is no surprise that we are seeing the most dishonest advertising campaign put forward by a government in living memory. What we saw on budget night was that the campaign was taken to $70 million. It included an extra $36 million of advertising—$14 million between budget day and 1 July. That is $270,000 a day of public money to tell them why they should learn to love the carbon tax—except for the fact that it does not mention the carbon tax. Not once does $36 million buy you a mention of the carbon tax. Last night we heard why: an honest official—whose name I will not raise, because I do not want him to be purged—said before estimates that the Prime Minister's own department excluded the name because people might be confused if carbon tax was mentioned. They did it on the basis of information that the term 'carbon tax' confused people, because it really let them know that they are the ones who are going to pay with their jobs and they are the ones who are going to pay through their hip pocket. It is time this government was finally honest— (Time expired)

"Dreyfus, Mark, MP",ALP,2012-05-24,"



Mr DREYFUS
 (Isaacs—Cabinet Secretary, Parliamentary Secretary for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency and Parliamentary Secretary for Industry and Innovation) (15:46):  I am very happy to rise today to speak on this matter of public importance. The topic, the impact of the carbon tax on jobs and the cost of living, is a very significant one. It is important because our moves to price carbon through an emissions trading scheme will make a fundamental change to the nation's economy. Our plan to cut carbon pollution and drive investment in clean energy technologies and infrastructure, such as solar, gas and wind, will help build the clean energy future which future generations of this country deserve. It will help our children. It will help our grandchildren. It will reduce our emissions and position Australian business for the development of the global low-carbon economy which is coming. It will position Australia for the jobs that come with that global low-carbon economy, which I know those opposite do not want to think about because they want to put their heads in the sand. They do not want to think about the future that is coming. They do not want to think about what the rest of the world is doing to grapple with the problem of global carbon pollution—



Mr Christensen interjecting—




Mr DREYFUS:
  to grapple with the problem of dangerous climate change, which I know the member for Dawson denies the existence of. Instead of actually embracing a package that would secure Australia's future in a carbon constrained world, the coalition is engaging—and we have heard some more of it today—in a hysterical, shameful and misleading scare campaign. Their claim is that the carbon price will drive up the cost of living and that Australians will be worse off. I need to be clear: nine of 10 Australian households will be receiving a tax cut or a pension rise or a benefit rise through our package to help with the cost of living.


It is amazing to see the Liberal Party pretend that they care about the welfare of working Australians, given their track record of failing to provide support. Just two weeks ago our Labor government delivered an excellent budget, which provided a substantial boost to low-income households—again, something that those opposite do not care about—only to have that same excellent budget derided as 'class warfare' by the negative and out-of-touch Leader of the Opposition. If you think providing support to parents to help with sending their kids to school is class warfare, if you think delivering tax cuts for all taxpayers earning up to $80,000 a year is class warfare, then you are completely out of touch and completely beholden to your Liberal mates like Clive Palmer at the expense of ordinary Australians.


The coalition's attitude to this budget shows just how shallow the supposed care that the Liberal Party and the National Party profess for working people really is. All they actually care about is their mates with deep pockets. We are interested in governing for the many and not just for the few. If the opposition cared one bit about the cost of living and about making ends meet, they would be supporting the clean energy package and the budget, because both of them will make millions of Australians better off. You know that the best way to learn about what the coalition really thinks on helping families deal with the cost of living is by looking at what the Liberal Party did when they were in office and what they do when it comes to important votes in this place. As the Leader of the Opposition has said, you cannot believe anything he says unless he writes it down. Better still, look at the actual record of the coalition. 


The best way for Australians to have a decent life is through a well-paid, secure job. If we had listened to the Leader of the Opposition, if we had listened to the opposition who voted against our stimulus package in 2009, we would be in a situation where hundreds of thousands more Australians would be out of a job. Around 70 per cent of the stimulus package was infrastructure which has left a long-term legacy for our nation. Not only does the opposition oppose government action to secure jobs; when in office they brought in Work Choices. That was their record in office because they have never had a plan for our economy, except a race to the bottom by cutting pay and conditions of working people. Try dealing with cost-of-living issues when you have had your penalty rates cut or when you have been unfairly dismissed. The Liberals cannot help themselves. Only yesterday we saw more reports that the coalition want to return to what many on that side believe to this day to be their crowning achievement, which was Work Choices. They are talking behind closed doors in their party room, looking at ways they can strip away pay, strip away penalty rates, strip away conditions from working people.


We can hold our heads up high on the cost of living because we got rid of Work Choices. We have acted to make sure that people do have a job which is secure and that when they have a job it is fairly paid with good conditions. We can hold our heads up high because we acted to support jobs during the global financial crisis. And we can hold our heads up high because we have helped with the quality of living as well as with the cost of living by investing in services in health and education after years of coalition neglect. We have acted to improve services and we have acted to reduce out-of-pocket expenses. When we are talking about the cost of living we do need to sort out fact from fiction. There are so many false and misleading claims that have been made by this coalition opposition that I cannot begin to list them all, but they all stem from the Leader of the Opposition's desire to say and do anything to get into office. There is no abuse that he will not hurl, no misrepresentation that he will not make in order to put the position that he wishes to put. Really, they have long ago stopped basing any of their claims on reality. They claim that the price of everything is going to go through the roof, but they cannot add up.


I will just take one of the more recent spurious claims of the opposition. I am very pleased that at least a representative of the National Party is here. The National Party leader told parliament yesterday that the cost of—



Opposition members interjecting—




Mr DREYFUS:
  Sorry to insult you—that the cost of servicing a domestic refrigerator would go up by $300 a year. But to spend that much, the Leader of the Nationals would have to call technicians to his house to fully replace the refrigerant gas every five days and he would have to do this for a whole year. Whatever will they come up with next!


The opposition's claims stopped being based on reality a long time ago. They will say and do anything to whip up panic. They will hurl any abuse and misstate any fact—like the Leader of the Opposition claiming that the coal industry was going to die. The Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency dealt very effectively with that in question time. It is rubbish, like, indeed, the misrepresentations on the Kurri Kurri aluminium smelter. We have just heard some of them being repeated by the member for Flinders.


I want to state a few things for the benefit of the House. The government is conscious absolutely of the pressures facing the aluminium industry but the issue needs to be considered in the context of aluminium prices peaking at US$3,300 per tonne but now being approximately US$2,000, a fall of 40 per cent. That collapse in aluminium prices has resulted in numerous closures of older, less competitive aluminium smelters around the world. Hydro Aluminium has consistently identified the strong Australian dollar, low metal prices and current international economic conditions as contributing to the financial problems at the smelter. The company has been clear that their current financial pressures have nothing to do with the carbon price, which is yet to commence—just to remind members of the House.


This was confirmed today in the Financial Review where the company stated—and this is the company talking here, not any suggestions by the government: 


The carbon price is not a major issue compared to other factors. 


The same report confirmed that the company is already losing $6 million to $7 million a month—and there is no carbon price in place. Of course that situation is a matter of regret, but what we do not need is those opposite coming into this House and pretending that the carbon price, which is yet to commence, is the reason—and that is what we have heard from those opposite—for closures in any part of the country, or the reason, indeed, for any business failure that they can point to.


We have had further spreading of misrepresentation by the member for Flinders in relation to councils. What he failed to say in mentioning the City of Wyndham is that the City of Wyndham supports the carbon price.



A government member: Whoops!




Mr DREYFUS:
  Whoops, indeed. What he failed to say in relation to the City of Wyndham is that the City of Wyndham provides waste services in its very large landfill to between eight and 10 other Melbourne councils and provides with its very large landfill services to a very large number of commercial firms which need to dump waste. Perhaps he did not know this. I have met with the City of Wyndham and discussed with them the way in which they are going to be meeting their obligation, and I did not hear from them any of the hysteria that the member for Flinders has been out and about with today. I did not hear any of the hysteria that the member for Flinders wants to spread. What I heard from the City of Wyndham, and the other councils who attended the meeting with me, was that they understand that the carbon price is coming in; they have made the calculations they need to make in order to be able to deal with it; they support the carbon price and they understand the way in which the mechanism works, which is that there are to be costs passed on. They understand that insofar as there are going to be rate rises for the ratepayers of the City of Wyndham that those rate rises will be in the order of 13c to 40c per household per week and that the household assistance package is $10.10 on average per household per week. So that it is more than able to deal with the small level of rate rises which will be associated with the carbon price, if indeed the particular council does need to introduce those rate rises.


So when the opposition gets up, as no doubt they will again, to tell us that the lights are going to go out or that the sky is falling in or that the beer will go flat, I would say to them: they know just how untrue their claims in relation to the carbon price are. They know the misrepresentations they are making and they are going to be sorely disappointed that we do not have the disasters which they are clearly looking for, because after 1 July we will be holding this opposition to account. I will be looking forward to going to Whyalla and reminding the citizens of Whyalla that their town did not become a ghost town—in fact, that their town is a growing town, despite the fact that we have a carbon price. I am looking forward to going to coal mines around the country and discussing with workers the nonsense that we have heard from the Leader of the Opposition that the coal industry will die. And I am looking forward to going to industry around the country and telling workers the truth, unlike those opposite who think that it is appropriate conduct for them as an opposition to tell lies to the people of Australia about the affect—

  I withdraw. I am very glad to have the opportunity—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The parliamentary secretary has not been given the call yet. I thank the parliamentary secretary. He has assisted the House by withdrawing that word. I call the parliamentary secretary.




Mr DREYFUS:
  I am very glad to have the opportunity to talk about the cost of living, because this Labor government is doing so much to help Australians. We are a Labor government and the reason why we are in this place is to act to improve people's lives, to make life easier, to improve services, to spread opportunity, to support working families. What we have from Tony Abbott's coalition is an anti-Labor party and they are anti-Labor because, no matter what we do, they oppose it. They are anti-Labor to their core because they oppose workplace rights and, at every opportunity they get, they cut services to working people. For a long time under the former Howard government, many Australians found themselves wondering why they were not able to share in the benefits of the boom, why services shrank, why costs and interest rates rose. An Abbott government would be no different. The budget has been well received by Australians. That is because it is a budget which helps Australians and all we have is Liberal opportunism that is seeking to take advantage of any downturn in the economy. Those opposite love to talk down the economy.


We need to keep steadily in mind what is at stake here. The government needs to act on climate change. Any responsible government of Australia needs to act on climate change. There is an absolute consensus among climate scientists that climate change is real, that there will be significant future impacts if no action is taken to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions. A low carbon global economy is coming. It is up to us to decide whether we help Australian business take advantage of this or simply bury our heads in the sand, which is what those opposite wish to do.

"Baldwin, Bob, MP",LP,2012-05-24,"



Mr BALDWIN
 (Paterson) (16:01):  There is no denying the fact that carbon tax is bad for business, it is bad for Australia. I only need to point to the evidence yesterday: Kurri Hydro—344 jobs to go. This morning at 10 o'clock the company started the consultation process to make the determination about the wind-up mothballing. So when the parliamentary secretary says he looks forward to going out into the community to meet the workers, I say to him, 'Don't bother going to Kurri because there will be no workers at the factory, there will be no workers at the aluminium smelter.' 


What is misleading is that this parliamentary secretary has joined in the chorus with the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency by stating that Kurri Hydro say the carbon tax has not affected their decision to close the plant. I want to quote from correspondence, a press release and a letter I received yesterday from Mr Olaf Wigstol, the senior vice-president. It says in part:


Following a thorough review, it is clear that the plant will not be profitable in the short term with current market prices, while long-term viability will be negatively affected by a number of factors including increasing energy costs and the carbon tax.


Yesterday in the parliament, the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency responded to a question from the Leader of the Opposition by saying:


I spoke to a company representative again today in relation to this issue who emphasised to me that the announcement today is not driven by the implications of the carbon price … 


That is misleading the House.


He backed it up with a press release dated yesterday which restated that the announcement is:


… driven by current financial losses that are unrelated to the carbon price, which does not begin until 1 July.


On the ABC in Newcastle on 1233 this morning, I was interviewed alongside Minister Combet. During the discussion it was put to him by Aaron Kearney who actually read the website that carbon tax was a factor. Minister Combet for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency and the member for Charlton who actually has a number of these workers living in his electorate said, 'It is not a critical cornerstone, they have described it as one of the many factors in the long term.' So I am going to be rather generous today. I am going to ask the minister to come in and correct the record because this minister has deliberately misled the House. 




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Hon. BC Scott
):  Order! The member for Paterson will withdraw the words 'deliberately misled'. You can do that by substantive motion.




Mr BALDWIN:
  I will tell you why I will not. Just let me finish for a second. 



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Order! The member for Paterson will withdraw or I will sit you down.




Mr BALDWIN:
  I will withdraw then.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  You will withdraw unreservedly.




Mr BALDWIN:
  I withdraw unreservedly. But on Monday, if he does not come into the House and correct the record, I will put it to the Privileges Committee for examination. Deputy Speaker, there are 344 workers on top of the 150 that have already gone in Kurri. Will this parliamentary secretary go out there and meet them? No, he will not. Will the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency stand up for his constituents? No, he will not. Because this government and, in particular the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency, are like an episode of Fawlty Towers. The Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency plays the role of Basil so well. Just don't mention the war. Don't mention the carbon tax, don't mention the war. It is an episode of Fawlty Towers. The sad reality is that Fawlty Towers is actually funny; this government is not, and the impacts of the decisions of this government will affect our nation dramatically.


In fact, modelling that was done will show that by 2050 Australia's aluminium industry could be slashed by 60 per cent and New South Wales Treasury estimates 18½ thousand job losses from the Hunter due to the carbon tax, and they have started. We can remember the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency during the waterfront dispute, standing with those workers—workers united will never be divided—standing up for their jobs. But when given the opportunity to stand up for the jobs of those people—some who live in the electorate of the minister and some who live in the electorates of the members for Hunter, Shortland and Newcastle and in my electorate—these members talk the talk but when it comes to walking the walk, the only thing they do is walk away. One would think they are like people who stand by conviction and beat their chest and deliver ultimatums. I would point to an ABC media interview just over a year ago, on 15 April 2011, when the national secretary of the Australian Workers Union, Paul Howes, warned this government, 'If one job is gone, our support for the carbon tax is gone.' Now, I expect it to be repealed 344 times because just in our patch that will be 344 jobs gone. But will Mr Howes now stand up to this government? Of course he will not, because he is one of the people who installed this Prime Minister—the same Prime Minister who promised there would be no carbon tax under the government that she led. What we are seeing is an episode of Fawlty Towers. Just do not mention the war, do not mention the carbon tax. It is disgraceful.


I turn for a moment to my own portfolio of tourism. We have asked this government many times, through Senate estimates and directly of the Prime Minister: what modelling have you done on a carbon tax and its implications for the tourism industry? There has been none—no modelling. Let me point to modelling that was done by one of the industry associations, the Tourism and Transport Forum, whose modelling in the submission they put to this government said that if you bring a carbon tax in 6,400 jobs would go. These are working families that this Prime Minister talks about wanting to support, but she is prepared to see, in the tourism industry alone, 6,400 jobs go. 


They also said that the economic hit would be around $750 million off the bottom line. This is an industry that is already in financial trouble. They are going to have the carbon tax—oh, sorry; don't mention the war—imposed upon them. Qantas have said that the implications to them are around $150 million next year. Virgin have said that the cost implications to them are $45 million. People like Quicksilver and other cruise operators up on the Great Barrier Reef have said their cost impact in the fuel price increases alone will be $250,000 a year. This mob opposite do not understand business. If they understood business they would understand that we are actually in price-point-sensitive markets. The aluminium industry is a price-point-sensitive market but nowhere as much as the tourism industry. Now, a lot of those operators who are going to suffer this cost impost on 1 July have already forward-sold bookings for months and months to come on fixed prices. They cannot just lift their price because of the carbon tax, and what I fear is that even more jobs will go.


Members opposite, particularly those in the Hunter where these jobs will go—and this will only be the beginning—have an opportunity to come into this House next week and move a bill that will suspend the carbon tax until at least after the next election when people, like those 344 workers at Kurri who are going to go, will have a chance to say what they think, and it is about time this government started to listen. Those members opposite who represent tourism electorates have an opportunity to come in here and stand up for their workers who are going to lose their jobs. This mob over there are very good at talking the talk. They are outstanding at talking the talk, but when it comes to walking the walk the only thing they ever do is walk away from the workers. We have seen it from the minister for climate change, who when he was not in power championed the case for the workers but when he gets here says, 'Oh, sorry.' There are all these excuses, but just do not mention the war. Well, let me tell you, there is a war. The coalition is fighting a war to save jobs. The government is fighting a war to kill off jobs and they should be condemned for it.

"Husic, Ed, MP",ALP,2012-05-24,"



Mr HUSIC
 (Chifley—Government Whip) (16:11):  I issue a simple challenge to the member for Paterson. If you want to put a privileges claim in against the member for Charlton, I will be following up with my own, because you just misled the House, claiming 345 jobs will be gone for a price that has not even come in. So when you are ready, we will be ready to meet that challenge.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Hon. BC Scott
):  Order! Member for Chifley, resume your seat. I said it in the Federation Chamber this morning: the use of the word 'you' is a reflection on the occupier of this chair. It is coming from both sides of this chamber and the Federation Chamber. In your comments just then you were saying 'you, you, you'. That is a reflection on me and other occupiers of the chair. I said this morning that I would not pull people up, but I will in future whilst ever they use that word 'you'.




Mr HUSIC:
  I am grateful for the guidance and I will ensure it does not happen again. This place should be a forum for struggle. It should be a struggle for ideas. It is one of the biggest issues facing the country and it should have two sides being able to put up competing approaches to deal with this issue of climate change and how we respond. We have put a price on pollution. We recognise that with this issue you cannot keep putting it off, that in actual fact we need to embark on a major economic and environmental reform. We have put forward a comprehensive plan. Those opposite believe the best way to deal with it is to plant a stack of trees. Relying on the science and relying upon market-driven responses, we have put forward a solution. Those opposite cannot find one scientist or economist to back what they are saying.


On the way through, we have admitted, acknowledged and been quite upfront that there will be price impacts, but we have also provided a comprehensive and far-reaching assistance package. Their response is to take it away: pension increases—gone; family tax benefit increases—gone; tax threshold increases—gone. I did say that this place is a place for struggle but for those opposite I never thought it was a struggle for comprehension, to be able to understand what needs to be done. They are hard-pressed to understand that when you highlight a problem you should be able to find a solution or, if you are unable to do it, at least back a solution. They go around wringing their hands 24/7 about cost-of-living increases and pressures but then vote against the schoolkids bonus. When you are worried about jobs in the steel industry, you do not vote against a steel transformation plan. When you visit factories, slipping on your own crocodile tears about jobs, you do not go and cut $500 million of industry assistance or, worse still, sneer at efforts to protect 46,000 auto jobs in this country. We have had a number of them say, 'Why should we be defending an industry that's gone?'


There they are, writing off that industry, claiming it is not worth saving. That is what they are saying. That is their economic philosophy. How do you say you are worried about costs of living and not support people's means to meet those costs of living by holding on to their own jobs? And now we have an MPI claiming that the coalition has concern about both costs of living and jobs. You do not talk about tax relief for business and then say you are against a company tax rate cut. You do not do it.




Dr Mike Kelly:
  Absolute hypocrisy!




Mr HUSIC:
  It is absolute hypocrisy, as pointed out by the Parliamentary Secretary for Defence. You do not say you want to see lower personal tax and then promise one million people that you will reduce the tax-free threshold. They talk about costs of living but fight against every single effort that we have put forward to help families and to secure jobs.


It is worth noting that nearly a million people taken out the taxation system are 60 per cent women. Hundreds of thousands of those people taken out will be students and young people. In denying those people a tax break the coalition seeks to give a tax break to the richest woman in the world; someone who, every single second of the day, earns as much as a worker on minimum wage earns in one single week. If you were a young person and you scored a job to help pay your way through TAFE or uni, what would you think of a political party that came along and said: 'We think you should pay more tax. We think Gina Rinehart should pay less, but we think you should pay more, and that is why we are reducing the tax-free threshold.' Talk about making life harder for young people! There they are, studying, trying to get ahead and to make their way in the world, and those opposite come along saying that they want to increase tax.


In my electorate 58,000 people will see a tax cut. In my electorate 19,000 will see an increase in family tax benefit payments and 24,000 pensioners will see a lift in their pension. Mind you, if you are concerned about cost-of-living increases—and I raise this with the member for Flinders because he talked a lot about my home state—5,000 of those 24,000 pensioners in the electorate of Chifley are worried that they will see an increase in their public housing rents because Barry O'Farrell will increase those rents just at the time we are providing assistance.




Mr Perrett:
  Shame!




Mr HUSIC:
  A shame indeed. We provide $10.10 in assistance through all the initiatives that we put forward as a transition to a clean energy future to cover the $9.90 average increase. That is a boost to help deal with cost-of-living increases. The member for Flinders has flung around all sorts of playdough stats here—




Mr Hunt:
  Which one did you disagree with?




Mr HUSIC:
  I am going to get to that point, don't you worry. The New South Wales government has made all sorts of claims about electricity price increases. In fact, it has been a roulette wheel of stats. The problem has been that the numbers have always gone down. They went from a point when they said that electricity prices would go up by 20 per cent in New South Wales and then, when it was challenged, it went down to 15 per cent. When it was challenged again it went down to 10 per cent, which is pretty much where the Treasury modelling anticipated that this would head.


The New South Wales government also did not take into account the economic growth, particularly the growth in renewables jobs that would occur in New South Wales, and they were roundly hounded for that. They did not take into account renewables jobs, and the Premier also welcomed the fact that New South Wales would be home to the Clean Energy Financing Corporation. They did not say no to that.


The member for Flinders talked a lot about my home state, but I want to give him some home truths. The New South Wales Minister for Resources and Energy was out there claiming electricity prices in New South Wales would increase by 16 per cent, the bulk of this due to the carbon price. That was what he said. Eight per cent of that increase, or, as the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency has indicated, roughly $3.30, would be as a result of what we are doing by putting a price on carbon. That eight per cent increase is compensated for—it is assisted. What happens to the other eight per cent in New South Wales that they will be paying as a result of what is happening with power prices in New South Wales?




Mr Perrett:
  It's the same in Queensland.




Mr HUSIC:
  Queensland, as the member for Moreton has pointed out, has the same deal. So where is the cost-of-living increase, or the assistance to help cover that cost-of-living expense, that we never hear from those opposite? We also had reference to landfills. I can inform the member for Flinders that the biggest driver of costs in New South Wales for taking rubbish to a tip is the waste management levy administered by the New South Wales government. This will continue to be administered by the New South Wales government into the future and will increase costs. Yet we never heard a word from the member for Flinders, or any of those opposite, on what would be provided to compensate or assist families on the way through.


You also might want to know that the New South Wales government was big about holding back on cost-of-living increases, yet we found out in the previous week that close to $300 increases in water bills will eventuate as a result of the New South Wales government backing a submission to IPAR to see those water bills go up.


Those opposite continue to perpetuate myths and mistruths about what will happen. They pretend that they know about the impact of cost-of-living increases but do nothing about it. (Time expired)

"Frydenberg, Josh, MP",LP,2012-05-24,"



Mr FRYDENBERG
 (Kooyong) (16:21):  I rise to speak on this matter of public importance on carbon pricing to tell the House why the party that delivered us the pink batts fiasco, the green loans scandal, the school halls blow-out, the network tender debacle, the GroceryWatch and Fuelwatch embarrassments and the misguided and costly failures of the NBN has gone one step further by, in 38 days time, delivering to the Australian people—all 23 million of them—a carbon tax. This is a carbon tax that nobody voted for and a carbon tax that nobody wants. Let's not forget that this Prime Minister told the Australian people just five days before the last election, 'There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead.' Let's not forget this is the same Prime Minister who said that the Labor Party was 'the party of truth-telling'. This is the same Prime Minister who promised at the last election a citizens assembly—another gabfest—and instead has delivered the Australian people another tax grab. That is what we have to wait for in 38 days time.


We are here to discuss the impact of the carbon tax on the jobs and the cost of living of Australians. We are here to discuss why companies such as Toyota and Holden, Hydro Aluminium and OneSteel, ANZ, Westpac, Macquarie Group, Royal Bank of Scotland, Qantas, Goodman Fielder, Telstra, 1st Fleet trucking, Pacific Brands and Murray Goulburn all have shed jobs this year. We are here to discuss why the only jobs that are being created in Australia are in the bureaucracy, because this government has announced a $3.2 billion Australian renewable energy agency, a $256 million clean energy regulator and a carbon cop, a $25 million climate change authority and the daddy of them all, the $10 billion Clean Energy Finance Corporation.


We are here to tell the Australian people that the only other jobs outside the bureaucracy and the Prime Minister's office that are being created are in the advertising industry, thanks to a $70 million taxpayer funded advertising campaign that does not mention the two words 'carbon tax'—you would probably have to spend an extra $30 million to get it out there. Of the $70 million, $36 million is being rushed out the door, a total of $270,000 a day. This is scandalous, because on 8 March in the Agea spokesman for the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency said no decision had been made on the future of advertising. In April in the HeraldSunit was reported: 'Last night a spokesman for Climate Change Minister Greg Combet said no decision had been made about whether to create more carbon tax ads.' Rubbish: we now know about the $70 million going out the door.


What are we going to get in 38 days time? We are going to get a $23 a tonne carbon tax that is going to hit Australian households by at least $515 a year—a carbon tax which will grow to $29 a tonne by 2016, $37 a tonne by 2020 and a shameful $350 a tonne by 2050. We are told by the Energy Supply Association of Australian that Australian consumers are already paying more than 70 per cent more for their electricity than their counterparts in the United States and 130 per cent more than their counterparts in Canada. What is going to happen on 1 July? Automatically gas and electricity are going up by 10 per cent. What is more we will be spending Australian taxpayer money to buy carbon permits overseas to the tune of $3½ billion by 2020 and a massive $57 billion by 2050, at a time when Europe Poll are investigating massive fraud with the carbon trading scheme. This is what Australian people have to look forward to.


Who is going to be hurt? Self-funded retirees are going to be hurt. They have written to me. Gabrielle Whiting is a constituent of mine. She is under the age of 65 and earns about $35,000 a year. She has gone to the government's own calculator on its website to work out how she goes under the carbon tax. Guess what? She is $251 a year worse off. Self-funded retirees have been forgotten by this government. What the carbon tax is going to do to my state of Victoria has been illustrated in a Deloitte report. This Deloitte report contains a quote from a Premier Ted Baillieu press release. He says as a result of their modelling, which is based on Treasury modelling, by 2015: 


There will be 35,000 fewer jobs than would have been the case without a carbon tax. 


Investment will be down almost $6.3 billion, or 6.6 per cent. 


Per capita income will be more than $1,050 lower. 


The Victorian State Budget will be almost $660 million worse off.


I know that in other states, like Queensland where are a number of my colleagues come from, similar Deloitte reports have found that the Queensland gross state product would be 2.76 per cent lower by 2020 and 4.11 per cent lower in 2050 with a carbon tax compared to without a carbon tax. These are destructive numbers—they are not just numbers, they are families and households.


We heard in the parliament today about Hydro Aluminium which will be closing down its Kurri Kurri plant which employs 344 people. We have heard that Qantas, OneSteel and BlueScope Steel have all lost more than 2,000 jobs and will be having a $400 million a year carbon tax bill. We have heard that aluminium output, on the basis of the government's own Treasury modelling, will be over 60 per cent lower after a carbon tax—in fact, the Australian chair of Rusal, the world's largest aluminium producer, has said the carbon tax is based on 'a very flawed assumption that our competitors are going to have similar or more aggressive carbon or energy policies attached to them'. Let's not forget that Rusal has a 20 per cent stake in Queensland Alumina, with 1,800 workers in Gladstone. Let's not forget that international capital is fungible and will move overseas if the costs of doing business in Australia are too great. That is why the CEO of BHP, Marius Kloppers, has called the tax a 'deadweight cost'.


If you look at Westfield, nearly 12,000 of their storeholders have had the carbon tax pricing built into their leases. If you look at dairy farmers, they are going to be paying up to $5,000 more per farm. If you look at irrigators, it is $282 a year more for them.

"Stone, Dr Sharman, MP",LP,2012-05-24,"



Dr STONE
 (Murray) (16:30):  I too wish to speak on this incredible situation where in 38 days time we will have a $23 a tonne carbon tax. This is going to have extraordinary impacts across our economy. But there will also be a carbon equivalent levy or tax that, for a lot of our Australian consumers, is still something of a mystery. Mick and Julie, dairy farmers in southern Victoria, have been paying about $12 per kilogram for refrigerant gases to cool their milk. Using the new carbon tax formula for synthetic greenhouse gases to be implemented on 1 July, they will not be paying $12 per kilo but $48.40 per kilo, plus a call-out fee of $1,921, in order to cool their two vats of milk. They cannot afford this, and very few of their fellow dairy farmers can. In their email to me, they said that, to add insult to injury, these new alternative gases they are supposed to use in the future will be 13 per cent less efficient.


There are over 9,000 dairy farmers running at least two refrigerated vats each, and the cost to these farmers alone from this new carbon equivalent tax will be some $25 million if they try to convert. On top of that $25 million for converting their vats, they are going to have to meet the milk factories' passed-on carbon tax itself. Murray Goulburn Co-operative, for example, has already told their farmers that they will have to pick up the $15 million to $20 million extra that it will cost the cooperative each year for energy to manufacture its milk. So these dairy farmers are really beginning to wonder: what did they do to Labor? What is it that this government has against food production in this country? They cannot be competitive against New Zealand dairy farmers, who have to pay a carbon tax of less than $10 a tonne, with a massive range of carve-outs.


This is the most extraordinary tax. What other government in the world is even contemplating anything like a $23 a tonne carbon tax across the entire economy? What is the reason for this? It is just about beyond explanation, but, then again, the reason is also very simple: it was all about the Greens party. They said to the Labor Party at the time of the last election, 'We know you've got problems with your numbers in this minority government situation, but if you introduce a carbon tax according to our dictates you've got the keys to the Lodge.' That is a shocking thing to do to the Australian economy. In my area alone we have already seen, marching out the door to another country, the Heinz tomato sauce factory. You might be a little surprised to think one factory did nothing much more than make magnificent tomato sauce and tomato ketchup. They did a great job, but they are here no more—they have gone. Heinz took themselves off to New Zealand, where they are only going to pay $10 per tonne in carbon tax. I think this is absolutely extraordinary.


This business of refrigerant gases is an absolutely dreadful situation. In many cases there are no standards or licensing requirements for the gases that are alternatives to hydrofluorocarbons. If these gases are to be replaced, we are talking about 300 per cent to 500 per cent increases over the current gases that they use. We are also told that in their supply chain they will be facing additional costs including insurance, administration, finance and lost custom if they do not convert. How will they convert when it costs up to $1 million for a coolstore in my area to move from a hydrofluorocarbon to ammonia? They do not have that cash. They are going to have to pay up to $100 a kilo for HFCs after 1 July. They cannot afford that.


Labor is shrinking their capacity to survive as food producers for this country. This Prime Minister has told us that she thinks the food-growing prospects for our nation are wonderful and that we could perhaps even double our food production in the next two years and meet the growing global demand. At the same time, she is making it impossible for our food producers to survive in her new carbon taxed environment. Come the next 38 days we will see a shrinking of industry right across Australia but particularly in the food-growing areas. (Time expired)

Mr TURNBULL
 (Wentworth) (09:30):  On 13 May, Australia lost a great hero. Don Ritchie died at his home in Vaucluse, where he had lived with his wife, Moya, for more than 50 years. He was born in 1926. Don served in the Australian Navy in the Second World War, on HMAS Hobart. He was in Tokyo Bay when the Japanese unconditional surrender was signed. He led a full life, surrounded by his family, who grieve his passing.


Don is best remembered for being the 'Angel of the Gap'. During the 50 years that Don lived opposite the Gap, he would go out and find people there, hesitating on the edge, about to take their own lives. He would use his remarkable empathy and compassion to bring them back from the edge. He would often bring them back to his house and give them a cup of tea. As he said, 'All I wanted to do was to get them away from the edge, to buy them time, to give them the opportunity to reflect and to give them the chance to realise that things might look better the next morning. I tried to get them to make the decision not to suicide—not now, not then and there. I don't counsel them; I don't tell them what to do with their lives. I just try to get them away from the edge.'


Don Ritchie saved so many lives with his human warmth and his ability to help people who were on the very edge, in every respect—at the end of their tether—and had given up and were about to destroy themselves. He was able to offer them a thread of love which they could then grasp and come back slowly from the edge.


At the funeral service Monsignor Tony Doherty, whom knew Don very well, talked about how he first met Don. Although Don was not a Catholic, and was known in his younger days for having quite uncharitable views about Catholics, he and Tony became very good friends. Tony said that he met Don more than 40 years ago. He described seeing this enormous, tall man—very tall—leaning over the edge of the Gap, flat on his belly, reaching over, talking quietly to a young Vietnamese man who was perched on a ledge about three or four metres below and was just about to jump. Tony said that when he saw Don talking to this young man, who was from a completely different background, he saw there a perfect expression of the love and the compassion that really defines the very best of our humanity. Don Ritchie, rest in peace.

"Katter, Bob, MP",AUS,2012-05-24,"



Mr KATTER
 (Kennedy) (10:02):  The burning question for productive Australia—certainly agriculture but manufacturing probably even more so and tourism even more so again—is interest rates. Our interest rates are wildly out of step with the rest of the world. I keep being accused, with my non-free-trade viewpoint, of being out of step and ridiculous. The only place I am out of step is in this chamber, in this parliament. This is the only place I am out of step. The rest of Australia agrees with me. Eighty per cent of Australians continually say that they would be prepared to pay a few bob more for whatever they are buying to protect and create Australian jobs. Interest rates are a classic example. Europeans are on one per cent; Japanese and Americans, last time I looked, were on 0.1 per cent; and Australia is on over 4½ per cent. Where are you going to park your money? Of course you are going to park your money in Australia, where you get 4½ per cent. You are not going to park it in Europe, where you get only one per cent interest. And also, we have got an appreciating dollar under this regime. So there are two reasons to park your money here. 


It is a self-reinforcing mechanism which has pushed the dollar up. In Mr Costello's second year in office, the dollar was at 52c. The dollar is averaging more than 100c now. Mr Costello can take most of the blame for that, but the Labor Party can most certainly take their part of the blame. They are in office, they should be doing something about it, and they are not. Having said that, we praise the Treasurer because he said that the interest rates coming down is good. I think there was pressure from the Treasurer to bring them down half a per cent. But they are still four per cent above the rest of the world—most certainly 3½ per cent. They are 300 times higher than they are in the rest of the world. So, if you invest your money here, you get 300 per cent more money than if you invest your money there—if the dollar comes down. When the dollar rose under Mr Costello from 52c to 90c, the income for my cattlemen halved and the income for my miners halved. And we closed down mines. We closed down mines; Kagara zinc mine is closed at the present moment—a great company. 


We plead with the government to take the bit between their teeth and do the sensible thing that every other government on earth is doing. I am telling you that, with the Europeans moving to an increase in money supply, money will drain out of Australia, interest will drain out of Australia, their industries will surge forward and ours will continue to die. 


Let me be very specific. As I get up to speak today it looks like this year we will have 82 per cent of motor vehicles in Australia come in from overseas. Mr Keating started this stupidity—and I can remember vividly hearing him on the radio when I crawled out of bed one morning; he said, 'We will be the freest economy on earth.' I thought: 'This imbecile. Are we going to go to Chinese wages or are we going to import all our jobs to China?' Those are the only two possibilities if you move to a free market. 


No-one else in the world moved to a free market. The only two countries on earth that have a free market are Australia and New Zealand—and, if you want to include a third country, it would actually be Canada. One cannot help but believe that the colonial spot marks are showing. Why would these two—arguably three—countries be the only three countries on earth that move to free trade?


Mr Deputy Speaker Scott, you are well aware that we cannot get a pound of beef into Europe. We were allowed technically 6,000 tonne but we cannot even meet the requirements for 6,000 tonne. To put that in perspective for other people here: America takes 400,000 tonne a year, and they are one-half or one-third the size of Europe. What a joke. We cannot sell beef to Europe. We cannot sell a pound of beef to China. These are the two biggest economies on earth, and we cannot sell a pound of beef to either of them. So much for free trade.


When Mr Keating made his wonderful statement that we were going to become a 'free economy', over 72 per cent of the motor vehicles in Australia were Australian made. This year, 82 per cent of them were imported from overseas. We all know that within 10 years there will be no motor vehicle industry in this country. We cannot build a tyre in this country. We cannot build an electric motor in this country. We will not be able to build a motor car in this country. We will be a Third World technology country. 


As for agriculture, Mr Deputy Speaker, you would be well aware that the Fin Review and the Sydney Morning Herald have said loud and clear—this place has not listened to them—that within three years this country will be a net importer of food. It will not be able to feed itself. We are a net importer of fruit and vegetables now. Three years ago we were an exporter of seafood. This year 80 per cent, it would appear, of our seafood will be imported from overseas. We are a net importer of pork. But soon overall we will be a net importer of food. We live in a country that cannot feed itself.


So, to that silly fella that led a party—which I am ashamed to say that I was once a member of—who walked around with his hat turned down and said, 'We will be the food bowl of Asia,' I say: listen, you fool; we are going to be the begging bowl of Asia. All this country now has, as a result of the policies of this place, is an iron ore quarry and a coal quarry. That is all it has. 


I predict the new government, the LNP government in Queensland, will be the worst government in Queensland history, because they have the terrible combination of arrogance and no vision, perspective or intelligence. They have already announced that the Galilee Basin—half of our entire coal reserves in Queensland—will be mined by people from overseas. Thanks to the policies of this place, all six of our great mining companies are now all foreign owned. They were all Australian owned 15 years ago. Now they are all foreign owned. Thanks to this place, we allowed every one of them to be sold overseas. 


We do not own the resource. The resource is owned by China, China and India. Those are the three groups of people that own the resources. We are not going to get any profits out of it. We are not going to get any wages out of it. What the hell will we get out of it? All the machinery and equipment comes from overseas in mining. We do not produce any machinery or equipment for mining in Australia. So what do we get out of it? We get a hole in the ground; that is what we get out of it. 


But a grubby little government like the outgoing ALP government was grasping for some taxation out of it. The grubby little government that has come in, that cannot see around the doorstop, just want to get some taxes out of it and look after their corporate friends. Who are the front men for the two Chinese areas that are owned? The front men are Gina Rinehart and Clive Palmer. Who owns the LNP? Clive Palmer. Surprise, surprise. 


If you are a Chinese person, you say: 'Well, hold on a minute. Our boys back home are getting paid $5,000 a year'—that is the average weekly earnings in China. 'What are we going to pay your people? $160,000 a year?' Fair damn go. I mean, naturally, Clive Palmer, Gina Rinehart and the Indians, the Adani Group that own the top of it, are going to say: 'Hold on a minute. We are going to fly our people in from overseas. None of this paying you Australians $160,000 while our people back home are being paid $5,000. No more of that.' 


We do want to thank the government very sincerely for the $350 million which is still in there for the transmission line. Governments throughout Queensland's history gave us railway lines and ports. The great Theodore governments up to the 1950s, and they were Theodore governments, gave us railway lines and ports. The government built the railway lines and ports and made absolutely unconscionable amounts of money out of it. The great Bejelke-Petersen government created the coal industry and the aluminium industry in Australia. They built the power station for the aluminium industry. They built the railway line for the coal industry. That is why we have a coal industry and an aluminium industry here today. So we thank the government for that $350 million for that transmission line. But, if you give us that transmission line to send coal into the Galilee Basin, you can use that railway line to sell coal. Have the courage to say: 'No, we will not fly in 40,000 workers from overseas. Those jobs are for Australians.' Yes, you might have to pay an extra $10,000 and, yes, you may not be allowed to kick the workers around. God bless the CFMEU. I stand 1,000 per cent behind the CFMEU and their stand against fly-in mining—and that is in Australia. 


I will be out there at every rally and stop-work meeting that the CFMEU have, because, if they are turning it on for fly-in mining in Australia, what are they are going to turn on when the LNP government in Queensland attempts to fly workers in from overseas? I leave it to your imagination. We have a proud history of industrial force in Queensland and we will not be resiling from that position, I can tell you.


If you give that to us and we get those wages out of the coalmines, then we will give back to Australia $75,000 million a year from the Galilee Basin. My homeland is the richest mineral province on earth, with vast uranium, phosphate and iron ore deposits. If you give us a little canal, about 150 kilometres—that is all; most countries have tens and hundreds of thousands of kilometres of canals—so we can get out through the gulf instead of coming all the way back through Townsville, particularly for phosphate and iron ore, then we will gift to Australia an extra $15,000 million a year. That is $90,000 million a year, nearly $100,000 million, into an economy of $1,000 million a year. e will increase your GDP just in the income from those ore and coal reserves by $100 million a year. That is what we will give back to Australia.


We have a commitment from the federal government—$350 million on that transmission line, but the LNP government has knocked the transmission line on the head. They have already announced that they are going to fly the miners in from overseas; they are not going to give you any infrastructure to open up your resources and this is all in two months! They have announced they are tightening the gun laws and, effectively, strangely enough they have announced that they are going to do nothing about flying foxes as well, which of course is the burning question in the state of Queensland.


If we get a government that builds things—a nation-building government—which we have not seen for 30 years in this country; not since Doug Anthony, one of the greatest figures of stature in this country's history. When he left the stage we had no one. When Bjelke-Petersen left the stage we had no one. And to our eternal shame, Ted Theodore is remembered for the Mungana scandal and the Bjelke-Petersen government is remembered for silly, stupid rubbish: there was not a single, solitary minister went to jail for corruption—they went for misuse of their parliamentary expenditure. Be careful, everybody, because what it was for was using their cars for private purposes. That is what the four ministers went to jail for in Queensland—so much corruption!


But these great builders like Theodore and Bjelke-Petersen—I plead, Mr Deputy Speaker, for people to read my book where you will see it in detail and flashing neon lights. Those who may have been brought up in the Labor tradition will walk with very great pride. It is only $39, too, Mr Deputy Speaker.




Ms Saffin:
  Is it in the library here?




Mr KATTER:
  Yes. But the details of what those successive Queensland governments did to hand to their nation the coal industry, the base metals industry and the aluminium industry are in there, and I named the chapter, 'Walking with giants'. Probably Les Thiess was the greatest of them.


We can build again, but we need money from the budget. We thank the government for the $350 million but the government must do a lot more because there will be no enlightened government coming out of Queensland. The one project that was needed for nation building they knocked on the head.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Hon. BC Scott
):  Order! Before I call the parliamentary secretary I will just remind members once again. I was reluctant to pull up the honourable member for Kennedy for the use of the word 'you', the word 'you' referring to the occupier of this chair. It is a reflection on the chair. I have reminded him of that and also other members on both sides of this House before. Next time I will interrupt, and I am sure that members do not want to be interrupted in their precious time of speaking in this chamber or in the main chamber. I just ask members to remember that when they use the word 'you' they are pointing directly to the occupier of the chair, and it is a reflection on the chair. Refer to 'the member' or to 'the government' or other bodies but do not use the word 'you will'. It is a habit that has crept in that I have observed as an occupier of the chair.




Mr Katter:
  Mr Deputy Speaker Scott, I have great respect and friendship for you, and I would never, ever put you in the category of the contempt in which I hold many other members.

Ms BIRD
 (Cunningham—Parliamentary Secretary for Higher Education and Skills) (10:18):  It is a great pleasure to speak to the budget that was presented by the Treasurer this year, and to follow the member for Kennedy in this debate on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2012-13 and cognate bills. Much of what he has contributed I would not agree with, but some of it I do. I think that in talking about the significance of the mining industry in this country he has touched on two very important areas that as a government we have been pursuing since we were first elected. They are: the development of the skills of the people of this nation to ensure they get access to the jobs of the future—exactly the issues he was addressing there—and also that we redirect some of the wealth into infrastructure across this nation to ensure that as a nation we are well positioned to make the best opportunities of the future, and where we sit in particular in the Asian century.


So while I may not always agree with the member for Kennedy's description of history or his prescription for the solving of the problems, I think that we can start with the base of an agreement about what the problems are and to acknowledge that they are certainly priorities for this government, and have been. Indeed, they were priorities for people representing the peak industry associations when I was first elected in 2004, when there were constant reports about backlogs and blockages in our system as a result of a shortage of skills and a shortage of infrastructure. They are two very important issues that the member for Kennedy touched on in his contribution.


This budget, I would argue very much, is a budget in the great tradition of Labor budgets and reflects the values that we seek to represent in this place. I say that for two reasons. Firstly, we do have a great tradition of building the skills and infrastructure of the nation. The Labor government has at the federal level a long history of building road, rail and transport infrastructure and ports and shipping. Indeed, at the moment the minister for transport is undertaking a mammoth task to rebuild the shipping industry of this nation, which has been let wither on the vine so badly for so long. We have a great tradition of putting in place the transport infrastructure on land that is needed to move the goods and services of our nation around what is, at the end of the day, one of our biggest challenges—the tyranny of distance not only internationally in terms of where we sit from major markets but also internally in connecting our cities and regions across the nation. 


This has been really importantly reflected in this budget by the fact that we seek to introduce a new form of profits based tax on the mining industry in order to be able to redirect what is the wealth of this nation. I take the member for Kennedy's point and note that he has some concerns about who owns the companies. But, at the end of the day, the wealth of the nation is owned by the nation. It is owned by the people of this country, and we should ensure that we leverage that to get maximum benefit for diversifying our economies and supporting the sections of industry and the country, in terms of regions, that need to be able to be supported to take advantage of the boom and, indeed, supporting the regions that are experiencing the boom to manage that in an effective way—which I think many members here would, I think, reflect. That is exactly what a large part of the task of this budget is directly aimed at.


In my own region of the Illawarra, clearly we see both of those phenomena happening in one place. We have a very vibrant and strong mining industry. Coming from five generations of coalminers, I am most conscious of the reality of that industry in my region—and it is continues to flourish. I was talking to some of my uncles on the weekend, one of whom said that the biggest job he has had was writing CVs in the 1980s when he was retrenched 12 times when the mining industry was at the other end of the cycle. So we are very conscious in our region of the importance of the mining industry. But we are also a base for manufacturing. People would be aware of the BlueScope restructure last year and the significant flow-ons from that. So we do see both speeds and both challenges.


We are also a region with a major university, and we have seen growth. For example, our university produces the largest number of IT graduates in the nation. We have seen growth in aged care, in a much more professional, developed aged-care sector providing services of a much greater variety to people with different demands as they age in the modern age. We have seen a growth in our service sectors as well. So we reflect that diversity and those various speeds in the economy.


Part of that first part of the task of the budget that I referred to is about delivering on those infrastructure transport links and freight support that we have talked about. I am also very pleased that the budget gave a very strong injection and support to the development of skills in this nation and a continued support for our TAFEs, universities and private providers in this sector to continue to provide the opportunity for people to get the education that they need in order to be able to take advantage of the future.


We are very aware that if somebody leaves high school in this day and age—let alone in the future—without a further tertiary qualification, whether that is a certificate, a diploma or a degree, they are going to significantly struggle to hold a job in the modern economy. That is not something that we should be accepting in any way, shape or form.


Part of my new role as the parliamentary secretary in this area is to look at how we ensure that adults have the language, literacy and numeracy skills to be able to access those educational opportunities I am very pleased to be able to be undertaking that task, because I think it is very important. Indeed, members may have heard some of the stories of people in their own communities who grew up illiterate as adults and have had the opportunity through various governments over time to gain literacy skills. What a difference it makes to not only their own lives but also their kids. If your parents are literate and able to support you in your schooling, you are going to do much better at school. I think those commitments in the budget around education skills are also particularly important.


The other side of it is the micro side: it is what we are attempting to do to support individuals and to support families in order to manage the cost-of-living issues. In my own area of Cunningham I want to acknowledge that, in particular, the additional money—the schoolkids money—is going to be very important. I have talked to lots of local families who are very pleased with this particular initiative. My own sons are adults now, but I have had a lifetime of understanding the challenges, as many of us in this place with children have, of the costs to commence schooling, whether it is uniforms or equipment and so forth. There are just over 7,000 families in my electorate who are going to be eligible for that bonus—that is $410 a year for each child in primary school and $820 for each child in high school. It will be very welcome.


There are about 8,000 families in my electorate who will get the increase of up to $600 in family tax benefit A from 1 July next year—another important initiative to support families. Just over 9½ thousand young people, single parents and unemployed people in my electorate will receive the supplementary allowance. This is designed to help them meet the cost of utilities. The singles will receive $210 and couples $350. I think it is important to acknowledge that sometimes people hear the big stories and think: 'You're just talking about families.' That is not the case; we are also seeking to support young people, single parents and the unemployed with that sort of allowance.


There will be, very importantly, about 47,000 workers in my electorate who will receive a tax cut from 1 July this year. When you add that to the history of tax cuts that we have put in place since coming to government, it is a very important addition to give people more of their own income in order to meet their costs of living. About 4,000 workers in my electorate will no longer pay tax due to the increase in the tax-free threshold. So it is a great incentive to say to low-income workers, 'Get back in the workforce and engage with the workforce, even if it is getting a casual or part-time job, because you can earn up to about $18,000 now before you will even have to put a tax return in. You won't have to pay tax.' It is an enormous initiative. In my area it will be very welcome for 4,000 workers and I am sure it will be welcome in many other members' areas where there are significant issues around unemployment, particularly if that unemployment is connected to people who are disengaged from the workforce, such as disadvantaged young people, single parents or mature workers who have been out of the workforce for a long time. We know that that first step in the door, whether it is a part-time or casual job, can be the turning point to getting someone re-engaged with the workforce. To be able to say to those people, 'You can earn up to $18,000 without paying tax,' is a huge incentive. I am really pleased with that initiative in the budget.


There will also be nearly 23,000 workers in my area who earn up to $37,000 who will receive up to $500 towards their superannuation accounts—again, another great Labor tradition building on superannuation in this country. One of the GFC realities was that one of the strengths of our economy was our investment of over $1 trillion dollar in superannuation and the solid savings base that gives to this nation, so it is good to see that also supported in this budget. About 45½ thousand workers will get increased superannuation benefits when we move from nine to 12 per cent. As we all seek to have a retirement that is long and of quality, we will increasingly appreciate the importance of that increase to superannuation. Just over 15,000 small businesses will be eligible for the instant tax write-off for each asset worth up to $6,500. I think it is really important I make the point to my own local businesses: that is not one a year; that is up to $6,500 on every asset that they purchase, including up to $5,000 on a new vehicle, if that is part of their business requirement. When we initially introduced this as part of the stimulus response to the GFC, local small businesses in my area got a double bang because they bought from each other. It was not just the purchasing business that got the benefit of an instant asset write-off; they were likely to buy their car or their new computer or new piece of equipment from another local business, so that business got the benefit as well. I would argue it is a really good incentive. Some of my local businesses talk to me about the fact that we could not get the one per cent decrease in tax through for them because, sadly, those on the other side opposed it. But they were very supportive of this initiative, which provides the capacity for them to write off these assets and also supports other local businesses. At a more local level, the budget contains just over $1 million towards local roads for the Wollongong City Council, and I know they very much welcome that investment.


There is a commitment in this budget of $25.5 million towards the next stage of the Maldon-Dombarton rail link, something I have been campaigning for since I was first elected. Some members here might have an understanding of it. It was actually half built by the state government. When Mr Greiner was elected as Premier he stopped it. It was in the mid-eighties, when the coal industry took a dive. In a sadly short-sighted way, it was seen as not worth proceeding with. There are magnificent visions of a fly-over bridge across the gorges, but it just stops half-way. It is half built and has sat like that for nearly 30 years now. 


The port of Port Kembla has become a critically significant port for the eastern seaboard of New South Wales. There is real capacity at Port Kembla to utilise it in a greater way and to create more local jobs, but we need that rail link completed. The Minister for Infrastructure and Transport, Minister Albanese, has very much supported us on that project. When the Prime Minister came to the area to respond to the BlueScope announcement, she announced that we would commit to taking that project to the next stage and to get all the engineering and environmental work done. I will continue to lobby to get it included on the next round of nation-building infrastructure priorities. It is not a small task but it is a strategically very important and significant task. 


All round, this is a great Labor budget, doing all the things that the nation needs to do. I absolutely commend these bills to the House.

"Wyatt, Ken, MP",LP,2012-05-24,"



Mr WYATT
 (Hasluck) (10:33):  I rise today to speak on the Appropriation Bill (No.1) 2012-2013 and related bills. Before I examine some of the critical infrastructure needs that have been left off the list for Hasluck yet again, I would like to take the time to speak about the suite of bills in their totality and what they mean for the Australian people. This budget will deliver all the wrong things for the residents of Hasluck and the nation as a whole. 


Inside Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2012-2013 is what amount to bribes to soften the impact of the world's largest carbon tax. There are massive blow-outs in the cost of border protection as the government run around trying to find rooms for asylum seekers as detention centres overflow.  The NDIS is underfunded, while equity funding for the NBN is being kept off the bottom line of the budget. Behind the smoke and mirrors is a government that has hidden the rise in the Commonwealth debt limit from $250 billion to $300 billion in Appropriation Bill (No. 2) to avoid proper scrutiny and debate on the matter.


This government continues to borrow more than $100 million per day and in four years has delivered a cumulative record deficit of $174 billion. The interest on this debt runs into the billions of dollars every year. That is money that could be better spent on many projects in many electorates, but in particular Hasluck, which is being neglected by this Labor government. All of the above comes without taking into account the world's biggest carbon tax, which is being rolled out in a matter of weeks. The carbon tax will hurt the people of Hasluck; make no mistake about that. Despite the fact that Julia Gillard said, five days before the last election, 'There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead,' Budget 2012 is Australia's first carbon tax budget. The world's biggest carbon tax is about to hit families, jobs and investment at the world's worst time. The budget papers confirm that despite falling international prices Labor's toxic tax will go up to $29 a tonne in just three years, and an additional $36 million will be spent on taxpayer funded carbon tax advertising over the next two years. The advertisements mention the cash bribes but do not even mention what they are for—the world's biggest carbon tax. The carbon tax will cascade through the economy. Despite the Labor government's lie that only big emitters will pay the price, the cost of virtually everything will go up and up and up. 


I would like to draw the chamber's attention to the Red Hill Waste Management Facility to the north-east of my electorate. This is managed by the East Metropolitan Regional Council, a conglomerate of local governments in Hasluck and its surrounds. The Department of Environment and Conservation provides the EMRC with an annual licence to operate the site once it has been adequately demonstrated that a range of conditions regarding pollution, buffer distances, noise control and waste types and quantities can be met. The use of modern techniques and principles of sanitary landfill design and operation, including leachate collection and methane gas capture, have contributed to the site successfully operating within DEC conditions for the last 22 years. 


I had the privilege of visiting the Red Hill site with the member for Swan, Steve Irons, earlier this year, and we were blown away by the work and effort that has been put into managing landfill responsibly—educating schools on responsible waste disposal and capturing in excess of 75 per cent of all gases emitted from the landfill. These are just a few of the amazing things that the Red Hill Waste Management facility is doing to protect our environment. You would think that such an initiative would be rewarded by a government—but, no, this facility is one of the entities set to be included in the carbon tax. The reason? Its size.


You would think that the pooling of the resources of six local government authorities to save money and create a better environmental outcome than a typical landfill would be rewarded, but not in this instance. This government and its lazy approach to environmental policy is penalising them. I know they are worried about this tax. They will be forced to put up their prices and inflict an additional cost on constituents within my electorate and surrounding ones. They are worried that this will drive some people away from the landfill to dump their waste illegally as it becomes too expensive to do the right thing. This is another example of Labor's failed policies, which are too numerous to mention, even in a 15-minute speech. 


I turn my attention to small business in Hasluck, which is the engine room of the local economy. They get no compensation for the carbon tax in this suite of appropriation bills. The Gillard government must cut red tape and axe the carbon tax to help improve small business conditions which are well below the five-year average. The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry's May 2012 Small Business Survey states that small business conditions were at low levels, with conditions expected to deteriorate further in the coming quarter.


The Prime Minister has also dumped her promised company tax cuts. Less than two months ago she said, 'If you are against cutting company tax, you are against economic growth. If you are against economic growth, then you are against jobs.' I regularly speak to local business owners in Hasluck when I am visiting shopping centres or precincts or when I am out doorknocking. They all tell me the same thing: this is the worst possible time to introduce the world's biggest carbon tax.


Small businesses are the biggest employers in my electorate and, in uncertain economic times, everyone is concerned that this carbon tax, which will have no environmental benefit to Australia, is the coup de grace to economic growth and many small businesses in Hasluck. If you think I am exaggerating about this, I challenge Labor members to go and visit small business owners in their own electorates. Ask them how things are really going and you will find out there is no popular support for this ridiculous tax. Tourism is a vital sector in the north of Hasluck, particularly the Swan Valley, Kalamunda and Guildford. People travel from afar to visit these areas and incorporate these activities when they are choosing to visit Perth from Asia and even Europe. Once again, this budget does nothing to help this struggling sector. Let me highlight some figures to show just how important tourism is nationally. It is worth 5.2 percent of our gross domestic product; or, in money terms, $73.3 billion. It employs nearly 910,000 people.


However, the tourism sector is feeling the pinch. Domestic tourism numbers are falling as the cost-of-living pressures hit Hasluck and Australian families. International tourists are faced with the strong Australian dollar, that rising debt levels do nothing to address. Although the sector is hurting, this suite of appropriation bills fails to provide adequate carbon tax compensation for tourism. It stands to destroy 6,400 jobs and cut 10 per cent from industry profits. It will also reduce Tourism Australia's budget by 6.2 per cent or $8 million in real terms.


During its peak in the Howard years, Australian tourism made a profit of $3.584 billion. Next year the sector will stand to make a net loss of $8.7 billion under the Gillard government. Shame on this inept government! I am a strong believer in a smaller government that allows citizens to flourish without being saddled with mountains of red tape and regulations. Excessive government interference in the market place creates inequitable outcomes.




Honourable members interjecting
—





Mr WYATT:
  It is good that the members are having the conversation. Instead of spending even more money on creating further bureaucracy, I call on this government to spend money on helping fertile ground where small businesses can flourish. Spend money on actually helping the people of my electorate to be masters of their own destinies instead of spending millions on advertising propaganda with no positive outcome.


In the south of Hasluck there is a desperate need for further services for my constituents. Let me highlight a few areas of desperate need that would create an ideal set of conditions for attracting more businesses and residents who would boost our local and even national economies. This is where a relatively small investment from the federal government would have major benefits to its citizens.


The growth areas in the east of Western Australia are in the Southern River, Gosnells, Huntingdale and Thornlie areas. Many people from these areas are forced to travel up to an hour to their place of employment as house prices rise and they cannot afford to buy closer to the CBD or work centres. Their commute is often slowed down terribly by the inadequate Nicholson Road and Garden Street roundabout. Delays of 30 minutes or more at this one intersection are not uncommon. This is made worse by the fact that a national train line runs just 200 metres from one of the entries to the roundabout. This and the fact that it is close to a major arterial road, the Roe Highway, causes misery for many. An overpass there would allow the free movement of traffic over this rail line and help emergency vehicles clear the area. It would also help small businesses based along Nicholson Road to attract more customers who are not put off by these delays.


To relieve congestion over a period of time, creating an environment where more people can work from home if they choose to is important. Giving businesses better access to faster download speeds is also critical if an area expects to hold its local industry and not lose them to the CBD. The broadband services in this part of Hasluck are very slow, and in some cases non-existent. I regularly receive letters, calls and emails from constituents in these areas who are frustrated about this situation. A common thread that runs throughout these complaints is what happens when they call Telstra.


When they call they are told there is nothing that Telstra can do due to the snail's pace of the NBN rollout. They are also told that they will have to wait anywhere from five to seven years for faster broadband speeds. How is my electorate supposed to grow in a sustainable way when people hear that moving into the south of Hasluck means living with dial-up speeds and shocking traffic congestion? Ten to 15 years ago broadband speeds may have been considered a luxury but everything is pushed online now, and my constituents in the south of Hasluck are being left behind by this woefully inadequate government. At this point I would like to acknowledge the work of the WA state government member Peter Abetz MLA, who has been tireless in his efforts to improve the Garden Street-Nicholson Road intersection and to improve broadband speeds in this area. Between us we have lobbied hard at state and federal levels for two years to see this change realised. I would also like to mention the outstanding work of three local governments in Hasluck—the City of Gosnells, the Shire of Kalamunda and the City of Swan—who all travel regularly to Canberra to lobby for improvements to our area. They go out of their way to facilitate shadow ministers I bring to Hasluck so they can bring these matters to their attention.


What we never see is the actual Labor government ministers venturing into Hasluck to speak to these LGAs. Unfortunately, despite their best effort, it seems the Gillard government is content to ignore their practical approaches to improving parts of Hasluck and seems to be content on rolling out bloated, ill-conceived policies that do more to create blockages in society than to improve things.


Finally, the surge of new residents to this area—particularly Gosnells—has created an unbearable strain on GP services. There are over 90 languages spoken in this area of Hasluck. The government is dumping people into this area with little or no support. This is not news to this government. In a bid to prop up support in the Midland area, the Gillard government chose to build a GP superclinic right across the road from the existing GP superclinic instead of putting one in Gosnells, which has limited access to the range of GP services. This neglect is outrageous and shows how badly it performs with policy. Waiting times and the lack of bulk billing in Gosnells is a major issue for my constituents and has once again not been addressed or funded in this budget.


People want to know when choosing an area to live in whether or not they can have access to the CBD and transport links and whether or not they can shop if they need to. They need to have access to modern technology like broadband and to be able to visit a GP when necessary without month-long waiting times. The Gillard government has repeatedly failed tens of thousands of people in this area of Hasluck not by accident but by ignoring the lobbying of local government, the complaints of local people and the pressures placed on them by political representatives. Instead of spending billions of dollars housing illegal immigrants in this country, Prime Minister, adopt the coalition policy on border protection; use the billions you will save to improve the lives of Australian people; and take greater care of our pensioners, self-funded retirees and service men and women. It is what they deserve.


I know that we live in times in which the global economy will have an impact. Certainly the Department of the Treasury papers say the conditions in some parts of the economy are likely to remain challenging. I think that in challenging circumstances the ability of the people of Australia to access services that they pay for through their taxes and expect to be delivered so that their needs are met also has to be considered.

Mr CHEESEMAN
 (Corangamite) (10:48):  Today I rise to speak on the 2012-2013 budget. I was wondering as I was putting together this speech what Tony Abbott might have said to his party room meeting the day after the Treasurer delivered the speech. I am sure he would have said: 'Let's not worry about facts. They get in the way of the truth. Let's get out there and continue to mislead the Australian community about the state of the economy.'


This budget very much is a Labor budget. It is structured in a way that will support families, particularly in terms of delivering economic growth, supporting low unemployment, supporting low inflation and keeping downward pressure on interest rates. If we look at the state of the economy today with its national unemployment rate of 4.9 per cent, the reality is that our unemployment rate is lower than that of the Howard government. We have created some 800,000 jobs in what has been a remarkably challenging economic environment not just domestically but also globally. And we have heard members on this side of the House indicating very clearly the challenges that we face. This budget very much delivers on Labor's commitment to continue to maintain a surplus, which of course is very, very important. But it also is a Labor budget in that it is structured in a way that will help families, particularly in responding to cost-of-living pressures.


Labor is delivering for my constituents throughout their entire lives to ensure access to services and support and to make sure that no-one is left behind. From Alvie to Belmont, children are getting the best start in life thanks to Labor's paid parental leave scheme. This scheme provides working mums—some 969 of them—support in looking after their children in the very, very early weeks of their lives and supporting mums and dads who might choose to adopt a young one. It is a fantastic Labor initiative. This will ensure that parents have that precious opportunity to bond very early with their child, which I think is certainly very important. Having two young sons myself, I know the importance of not only spending time with a newborn baby but also in assisting our wives and partners in looking after those children.


From Colac to Dereel, Labor is supporting the delivery of high-quality child care. The 50 per cent child-care rebate is very much appreciated by families across my electorate. Indeed, there are about 3,854 families that have been enjoying that benefit to enable young parents to return to work and to continue to support their families. From Elliminyt to Forrest, this budget delivers a boost to family tax benefit A and family tax benefit B provisions. In Corangamite, there are over 10,000 families who rely on family tax benefit B, and that will provide $110 per child per year—again helping to support families. There are around 8,000 families on family tax benefit B, and that will provide those families with an extra $69 per child per year. Once again it is Labor that is delivering money to help support families with children. We know that there are many pressures on families, and anything that Labor can do to support families we will of course do.


There are also around 9,000 families across the electorate who will be receiving the schoolkids bonus. My electorate of Corangamite is a key part of the Geelong growth corridor. Many young families are moving to my electorate to build their first homes and to raise their families. The schoolkids bonus is going to help support them in raising their children—which I know is a very popular aspect of the budget. There will be some $410 per year in support provided to families with children in primary school, and some $820 will be provided to families with kids in secondary school. This is an initiative that will help right across my electorate to support families in their efforts to raise and educate their children. It is absolutely the Labor way; it is what we do. We are providing additional support for teenagers so that families can support young people, particularly during their later high school years, their university studies, their apprenticeship studies and the like. Again that is very important.


Some 50,000 taxpayers in the electorate of Corangamite will be receiving a tax cut on 1 July, and some 40,000 of those 50,000 constituents will receive a tax cut of at least $300 a year. These tax cuts are very well tailored to support my community, in particular to support people who have been out of the workforce for some time, whether it be because they have been raising a family or because they have been made redundant at some point in the years before. These tax cuts will provide a real incentive to get those young and older people back into the workforce. It is a Labor way to go about things. The tax cuts will very much support families in Corangamite, and that is very important.


Labor has historically played a very important role in working, particularly with the trade unions, to build and deliver people's superannuation savings. It was Labor and the trade unions that worked hand in glove to put in place compulsory superannuation savings that enable people to retire with dignity. That very strong Labor initiative was undertaken primarily in the eighties and nineties. It is Labor again that is recognising the importance of superannuation—and we are particularly recognising that a larger percentage of our society is going to be post the age of 65 as the baby boomer generation moves through. We are recognising the importance of providing dignity in retirement to families by increasing superannuation by three per cent. That means that a typical 30-year-old worker today will retire with more than $108,000 in their superannuation account when they get to retirement. That is critically important not only for those individuals but also for the Commonwealth budget, because it will enable future governments to keep our pension costs low. It is important that, wherever we can do that, we do so.


Corangamite—and, indeed, the Greater Geelong area—has a very large number of small businesses. In fact it is often misunderstood how important the small business sector is in the Greater Geelong region. Most people when they think about the Greater Geelong region talk about the very large manufacturing businesses that are in the region—and indeed they are important. But equally important, if not more important in terms of it being the engine room of the Geelong economy from both an employment perspective and a wealth generation perspective, is small business. Labor recognises that, and we are putting in place arrangements to help support it, including the instant asset write-off. These measures, I think, are very important combined with the loss carry-back mechanism—again, something that will support cash flow and liquidity in small business. It is something that I am very pleased with and very proud of.


Unfortunately, we were not able to continue to pursue the one per cent tax cut that we wanted to provide to business across my electorate and the economy. We were not able to do that because Tony Abbott was not prepared to support tax cuts for small business. It is very disappointing, but we have put in place a number of other mechanisms in its stead which we have been able to get through the parliament.


Labor also recognises that for pensioners—and I have some 25,000 pensioners in my electorate—it is a particularly challenging and difficult time. We are putting in place additional money, some $338 a year for singles on the pension and some $510 a year for combined pensions, to support them in meeting the cost of living pressures that are within the economy at the moment.


This budget is very much a Labor budget. Time does not permit me to talk about some of the very local outcomes that we have been able to secure not only in Corangamite but across the Greater Geelong region. I look forward to engaging with my constituency around those matters to highlight the very strong contribution this government, the Labor government, is making to the Greater Geelong region.

Mr TONY SMITH
 (Casey) (11:02):  It is my pleasure to speak on these appropriation bills and the budget itself. In doing so, I want to raise a number of issues with the government's economic approach, which is embodied in their budget. At the outset, let me say that this budget should be judged against the backdrop of the government's believability, against the government's capacity in the past and against the government's performance. Indeed, as the shadow Treasurer said just last week at the National Press Club, a budget is a measure of so many things: a government’s honesty and honour, a government’s competence and capacity. This budget, unfortunately, as so many Australians now know, is a budget that fails all of those critical tests.


Across Australia at the moment, there are various indicators of falling confidence. Just recently the Sydney Morning Herald had the headline 'Consumer confidence wilts'. 'Lack of faith puts Australian economy at risk,' warned Dennis Shanahan in the Australian. 'Small business pessimistic,' pronounced the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Just this week the AustralianFinancial Review proclaimed 'Labor’s image is bad for business.' It is the case that as this is happening the shadow of what is happening overseas, particularly in Europe, is critical. We see Greece threatening to drag the entire eurozone over the brink. We observe America grappling with huge economic difficulties and massive deficits that have driven the US federal government debt to 100 per cent of GDP. We hear the Chinese economy may also be slowing. Indeed, in question time this week the Treasurer spoke of events in Europe that he said 'cast a very dark shadow over the global economy'. He went on to concede that Australia was 'not immune from the global instability'. The Treasurer has a real talent for stating the obvious.


The critical point as we debate this package of bills and the budget is how, in the midst of this global turmoil and turbulence, the government is affecting Australia's ability to withstand these challenges. Has the Treasurer strengthened or weakened Australia's economic position? Is his approach and that of the Prime Minister making the Australian economy more or less robust? Has Australia's economic resilience been buttressed or buffeted by the policies of this government? The answer to these questions is clear: despite Labor's best efforts to obscure and obfuscate the facts, the fact is that unfortunately this government's crisis of competence has spawned a crisis of confidence throughout the Australian economy.


We emerged from the global financial crisis in good shape. The primary reason we emerged from the global financial crisis in good shape is that we entered it in great shape. We have so far weathered the worst of the storm, because Australia was in a very solid fiscal position back in 2008. As we debate these budget bills we should look back to the days of surplus budgets. We should look back to the days of paying off Labor's $96 billion of net government debt. We should look back to the days when not only $96 billion of net government debt was paid off but also $45 billion was left as a nest egg in the budget tables for all to see to buffer against future crises and challenges, just as it did.


Without the policies of the Howard government we would not have been able to emerge from the global financial crisis in the shape that we did. Without the responsible budgeting of Treasurer Costello between 1996 and 2007 we would not have been in a markedly different position on the debt front from many other countries. In fact, if we had kept accumulating debt at the rate that we were in the last five years of the Keating government we would have entered that crisis with much more lead in our saddlebags.


Over the last 4½ years, first with the member for Griffith as Prime Minister and now with the member for Lalor as Prime Minister, we have seen a frenzy of ill-conceived and ill-executed spending. The government have not only burnt through that $45 billion cash nest egg that was left after paying off the $96 million of net government debt but plunged on the forecast to $145 billion of net debt, nearly $200 billion of deterioration over their period of office. The Treasurer likes to claim that it was the government stimulus spending that saw Australia through the global financial crisis. The Treasurer does not like to talk about the waste. The Treasurer does not like to talk about the fact that he has been unable to deliver a surplus budget. 


The Australian public have seen the record of this government on so many things—from the carbon tax which they were told would never happen, to the Treasurer's constant pronouncements about what his budget will do each year. It is worth looking at how he has put this budget together and what that means for the future. Sometimes what he does not mention is more important than what he does mention. In trying to conjure together the projection, the forecast, of a small $1.5 billion surplus, the Treasurer has fiddled with as many programs as possible to shuffle money from one financial year to the next—all so that he can project, as of now, a surplus. The truth, which he did not mention in his budget speech, is that he is seeking to increase the Commonwealth debt limit from $250 billion to $300 billion, in other words increasing the national credit card limit. Instead of stating this in his budget speech, of course, it is buried deeper than the wreck of the Titanic in a vain attempt to escape the blatant contradiction between his record and his rhetoric. Despite his talk of fiscal restraint, this Treasurer will continue to borrow $100 million every day.


If we look back at the current financial year—that is, the financial year that the Treasurer talked about and predicated his last budget on, just over a year and a couple of weeks ago when he stood in the House of Representatives—and when you look at his deficit estimates, it really does provide a window into both his capacity and the extent to which the Australian people should believe his pledge of a $1.5 billion surplus. Just 18 months ago, in the mid-year economic update, the Treasurer said that the deficit for the current financial year—which ends in five weeks or so—would be about $12 billion. By budget night last May, he said that the $12 billion had almost doubled to $22 billion for this financial year. By December last year, in the six-monthly official update, it has risen again, from $22 billion to $37 billion. Then on budget night he estimated that the final outcome would be $44 billion. That is, over 18 months, $12 billion to $44 billion. We will not get the final figure until September—and we ain't finished yet. There are still a few weeks left in this financial year.


But this Treasurer who—and let me be generous and just take the one-year blow-out—forecasts a $22 billion deficit and says it will come in at 44 billion, missed by that much and yet he expects us to believe that he will deliver the small surplus. Even to get those figures into the budget, it meant money-shuffling throughout programs on the most ridiculous level. And this is before he has introduced a carbon tax and all the other taxes that I do not have time to speak about.


It is no wonder that when small business owners and families across Australia look at the economic challenges coming down the pipeline, and then look at the capacity of this Treasurer to deal with them, they lack confidence. They lack confidence because the only thing they can trust with this Treasurer is that his word will not be kept. The only thing they can trust with this Treasurer is that his forecast will not be met. That is the only thing small business owners and families across Australia can trust with this Treasurer.


Small businesses are critical. There are 2.7 million of them. If they lack confidence, that has a huge impact on our economy. It is little wonder that the Dun and Bradstreet business failures and start-up analysis for the December 2011 quarter found that small business start-ups had fallen a staggering 95 per cent. These figures show that small businesses, and the small-business leaders of tomorrow, are looking at this Treasurer and looking at this government's lack of competence and these figures show they do not have the confidence to begin a small business—and that is before we talk about what is going on in the small business sector itself. I make this prediction: when we speak on these bills next year, we will be talking about how, once again, the Treasurer has missed his forecasts and misled the Australian people.

Ms HALL
 (Shortland—Government Whip) (11:18):  Thank you very much, Mr Deputy Speaker, and I congratulate you on your elevation to the chair. This is the first time I have spoken when you have been in the chair and I know that you will be a fine Deputy Speaker.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Thank you.




Ms HALL:
  I rise to support the budget that was brought down on 8 May. I would like to congratulate the Treasurer on the fine work that he has done in putting together a budget that I am proud to take to my electorate. This is a budget that delivers to Australian families and a budget that delivers to older Australians. It is a budget that will see Australia go into surplus by the end of this year. It is a budget that really hones in on the issues that are of greatest importance to the people that I represent in this parliament. It is a budget that delivers on the National Disability Insurance Scheme, and that is something that is very close to my heart, as I worked for 12 years in the area of disability before coming to this place. I know how important it is for people with a disability to have the opportunity to maximise their quality of life and to be able to have opportunities that they are currently denied. I know how important it is for their families and their carers to have certainty about what is going to happen to their child when they are no longer able to care for them. I know how important it is for them to see that their child is respected and offered opportunities that other children are offered. Quite often in the past they have been denied these opportunities. The National Disability Insurance Scheme is creating a new era, an era where people with disabilities will have the opportunity to maximise their independence and to live as long as they possibly can in a situation where, maybe, they can live independently in the community, looking at their options for employment and ensuring that into the future they will have choices and opportunities that they have been denied. I really encourage the opposition to support those particular changes and the National Disability Insurance Scheme. 


The other area that I think was particularly impressive was dental health. For a long time Australians have been denied the opportunity to have the dental health care that they need. In this House earlier this week, we debated a motion—or a bill, I think—that was put forward by the shadow health minister. I was extremely disappointed that in the overall scheme of things he brought a bill to this parliament that actually is about 37 dentists and not about providing dental health care to Australians. The chronic dental health program that is in place at the moment has benefited some people, but there are a lot of people who do not have a chronic dental health issue who are denied access to this scheme. Whilst a millionaire can get access to the chronic dental health scheme, somebody on Newstart or a pensioner who relies on their pension and enjoys reasonably good health is denied any access to dental health care. So the major commitment in this budget to dental health is something that will benefit that people I represent in this place. It means $515 million in funding which will address the immediate dental healthcare needs. All those people who have been languishing on the dental health waiting list will have a chance now to be seen a lot quicker. I checked what the current waiting time is in my electorate. People are waiting months. People come to me in my office and have told me that they have been waiting for over 12 months to get the dental care that they need. I think that is very unfair. This is addressing that issue. This is putting in place a program and funds that will address an area of real need. 


There will $346 million over three years—it is going to blitz this dental health waiting list—and $78 million to help dentists relocate to regional and remote areas. While it might be a problem getting dental health care if you are on a low income in an area like mine, after 12 or 18 months you can access it. But, in some areas, you have absolutely no chance of ever being able to get that dental health assistance. I know when the Howard government was in power and the Leader of the Opposition was the health minister, we were advised that the Commonwealth's contribution to dental health was made through private health insurance. Private health insurance is something that not everybody can afford, and it is those people who cannot afford private health insurance that are the ones languishing on the dental health waiting list. These changes are going to be welcomed by everyone I represent in this parliament.


The money that has been put into the national health reform is something that has also made a big difference within my electorate. There have been big, big changes, and now with the local hospital networks it has really improved the functioning of the health system.


I was a member of the Committee on Health and Ageing in the parliament when the Blame game report was brought down. When that report was brought down it showed how it was a very convoluted system and how it needed to be reformed. The previous government did nothing about it. The Rudd and Gillard governments have embraced it and have undertaken reforms that are benefiting all Australians.


One area of health that received extra funding was the National Bowel Cancer Screening Program. In the first week of June it is the National Bowel Cancer Week. During that week I will be holding a forum within my electorate. A wife of a friend of mine died of bowel cancer earlier this year. If she had had a bowel cancer screening test she would still be with us here today. She had had bowel cancer for five years by the time it was finally discovered and she was being treated for something else at the time. Also at that forum will be somebody from the Cancer Council, obviously, speaking and somebody who has survived bowel cancer.


This money over four years to expand the National Bowel Cancer Screening Program is welcomed by everyone. I was pleased to hear the minister say that in the future she is going to expand it even further. My local Rotary Club is currently gearing up to undertake its bowel screening campaign in the community, where they will go out there and get as many people to have the bowel cancer screening test. It is a really, really important initiative in this budget.


Members of the opposition have been scathing in their criticism of the schoolkids bonus. I would like to share with the opposition the fact that in my electorate it was welcomed. The parents who heard comments made by the opposition that they were going to go and waste that money on gambling and alcohol and drugs were absolutely horrified. These are parents who are buying school uniforms and books for their kids, supporting their kids in their education, and they are being accused by the opposition of going to waste this money. It is absolutely horrific that any opposition in this parliament could come out and be so disparaging of Australian families. I think they stand condemned by their actions in relation to that and I am sure the Australian people will let them know loud and clear just how important this bonus is to them in providing education for their children. The other area that I was particularly pleased with in the budget was the Living Longer, Living Better aged-care reforms. It is a massive reform to the aged-care sector. It is about delivering better access to aged-care services. It is about addressing the critical shortage in aged care. It is about allowing older people to stay in their homes for a lot longer. It is about giving support to carers. It is about addressing the national dementia epidemic. I might add here that, as you well know, Mr Deputy Speaker, the health and ageing committee is now conducting an inquiry into dementia, and I think that we will really become aware of just how important this need is.


This is a new approach to aged care. I moved a private member's motion in this House on Monday and I was absolutely horrified to hear speaker after speaker on the opposition side saying that they did not support this package, that they did not support massive reforms to the aged-care sector that would deliver great outcomes to older people in the community. They were at odds with the pensioners and senior citizens at Lake Munmorah Senior Citizens. When I attended their meeting and explained to them how the system would work, they were really very, very excited about it and they were pleased to hear that they would not be forced to sell their family home. It is a great initiative.


I was a little bit disappointed in the budget in relation to foreign aid. I would have liked us to have kept the previous goal, but the Treasurer has assured us that it is only moving the time frame out by a year. But I would have liked to have seen us uphold our former commitment in relation to foreign aid. In the area of Newstart I think that there was room to provide a little bit more support for people who are on Newstart. But, overwhelmingly, I see that this is a budget that will benefit the people I represent in this parliament.


It is a budget that has delivered many things to the people of the Shortland electorate, particularly through the programs that have been funded through this budget—for example, the Energy Efficiency Scheme that has delivered in excess of $353,000 to the Lake Macquarie Business Enterprise Centre. They are welcome initiatives that are going to benefit the people I represent in this parliament. (Time expired)

Mr CIOBO
 (Moncrieff) (11:33):  I rise to speak about yet another federal Labor government budget—yet another great disappointment for my constituency on the Gold Coast and yet another squandered opportunity. The reality is that this was a typical Labor budget in that, despite its headline surplus figure of $1.5 billion, it will in reality be another significant budget deficit. We have remarked that it will take 100 years of Wayne Swan surpluses to repay four years of Wayne Swan deficit. The fundamentals are this: Labor are bad economic managers. That Australia is still in relatively good shape is a consequence of the longevity of the reforms that were implemented by the Howard government and the very strong economic footing that the Howard government provided the people of Australia with and indeed the way in which our institutions were funded and the debt repaid.


There are several inescapable facts. Most fundamental of these is the key driver of Australia's debt-to-GDP ratio, which was 100 per cent a consequence of the fact that the previous Howard government and the then Treasurer, Peter Costello, left Australia with zero public debt—zero public debt. In fact, Australia was left at the end of the Howard government's period in office with net assets of $70 billion. In the short four or five years since the Labor Party was elected, we have seen that position erode from a $70 billion net asset position to now a negative $130 billion of debt. That is, for all intents and purposes, a $200 billion turnaround in the space of about four years. That, of itself, speaks volumes about the Australian Labor Party.


If you listened to the Australian Labor Party, you would think that this complete erosion of our nation's finances was a consequence of external factors. If you listened to the narrative from the Australian Labor Party, you would think, 'Look, we just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time, and that is why Australia's finances have been completely eroded.' That is a nice cover, but it is not the reason for the turnaround. The reason Australia's finances have gone backwards at an incredible rate of knots is the reckless spending and the badly applied use of taxpayers' funds by this Labor government. We have seen billions upon billions upon billions of dollars utterly wasted by this government; which, frankly, in my view, borders on economic incompetence. 


Speakers from the government in this debate have stood up, puffed their chests out and said: 'We are proud to give money out to Australian kids through their families. We are proud about what we did with the Investing in Our Schools Program.' Do you know what? I do not share that pride. It is not because I begrudge Aussie kids having brand-new school halls. It is not because I think that parents are going to waste money. The reason I begrudge the Australian Labor Party, when they stand up to crow about their so-called economic achievements, is that those Aussie kids that they talk about—who are sitting in those school halls, whose parents are receiving $800 or $900 or $1,000 in cash handouts from this Labor government—will be paying off the debt that Labor has left us for the next 20 years. So, when they sit in a school hall, they are not sitting in that school hall with the full knowledge that that school hall was built by borrowing money from overseas, money that those kids will have to pay off for 20 years before Australia is even back in the position of starting to save for our future. That is the real legacy of the Australian Labor Party. It is entirely consistent with Labor's form when it has been in federal government before and with Labor's form in every single state across this Federation.


It is extraordinary when you look at the state of Queensland. For so long Queensland was the economic beacon of Australia. We were the lowest taxed state in the Federation and we were the central hub for economic activity in our Federation. After 20 years of Labor government in Queensland that has all been erased. Queensland is no longer the lowest taxed state in the Federation. We are about third or fourth. Queensland no longer is the epicentre of economic activity. Population growth in the state has declined to now being in net terms nearly zero. Economic growth has slowed down. The previous Bligh and Beattie Labor governments have left Queensland with debt of around $60 billion to $80 billion. 


It is a farce that members of the Australian Labor Party stand up and try to whitewash these things, as if in some way they are good, because they care about the people, because they want to hand out money hand over fist, and say that it is the coalition who are the problem because we say no. That is right; we do say no. We say no repeatedly to this government when it comes to economic stewardship, because this government has frankly no idea. It is not bold. It is not visionary. It is not good governance to say: 'We want to hand out $900 here. We want to build $16 billion worth of school halls there. We want to spend money doing this and that and the other. It is the coalition who always stands in our way.' That is right. I am proud to stand in the way of the Australian Labor Party. I am proud to say to the Australian Labor Party, 'Your reckless spending must stop,' because I have two children and I know that it is my kids who will be paying off for decades the debt that the Australian Labor Party leaves behind. 


At what point does the Australian Labor Party wake up, look in the mirror and say to the next generation of Australians, 'I am sorry; we have betrayed you'? At what point does the Australian Labor Party say to the Australian people, 'I am sorry; whereas the previous coalition government meant that we paid zero when it comes to paying off interest on debt, we now have to pay $8 billion a year in servicing interest that this government has racked up'? 


I recall when the Labor Party first came to office, roughly four short years ago. At that time they wanted to increase Australia's debt ceiling to $75 billion. They said: 'Don't worry about it. We'll never reach it. $75 billion will be more than enough to see us through. We are never going to get to it.' Well, guess what? We got to $75 billion. So then the Labor Party said: 'We need to increase our debt ceiling to $100 billion. But don't worry. We'll never get to it. It is just a precaution. It is just there as part of our financial manoeuvring.' Guess what? We reached $100 billion. Then the Labor Party said: 'We need to increase our debt ceiling again, up to $200 billion.' And now the current debt ceiling is at $250 billion. Do you know what Labor is doing in these budget papers? In these budget papers the Labor Party says: 'Look, we are going to have to increase the debt ceiling again. We are just going to push it up to $300 billion. But don't worry about it. We will never get to it. $300 billion. It is okay. Our debt to GDP ratio is low by world standards.' 


The audacity of the Australian Labor Party is extraordinary—their spending and the way they portray themselves. They constantly sap people's aspirations in this country by punishing those that are successful by saying, 'If you earn over $150,000, we are going to effectively tax the bejesus out of you.' It escapes them that this erodes the desire to move ahead in this country. They punish those who are successful, they punish those who generate wealth, they punish those who create employment, they punish the industries that are the entire reason the Australian economy is still moving forward, and then they redistribute all of that and give it to those who are not in that situation. Then they wonder why Australians say: 'Do you know what? This is just too hard. We would rather take our money and invest our capital elsewhere.' They seem to think that we live in a closed environment, where Australians do not have options to invest that capital in overseas markets—which they are doing, because that is more profitable for them than retaining their capital here. 


In addition, it is important to recognise the opportunity cost of the way Labor wastes money; there are two ways Labor has wasted money. We have seen the billions of dollars that have been wasted on the school halls program, the pink batts scheme, GroceryWatch, Fuelwatch, the green car fund—the list is endless. You name it. Billions upon billions upon billions of dollars of money has been channelled into all of these harebrained schemes that Labor backs wholeheartedly the one minute and walks away from the next. That is the first opportunity cost. 


The second opportunity cost relates to the fact that now, as I said, we are paying an interest bill of $8 billion a year. Under the coalition that $8 billion a year could have been spent on programs. There could have been new hospitals, new roads, infrastructure spending—a whole range of different things. That is what the coalition did. 


What we are doing now as a direct consequence of Labor's spending is paying $8 billion a year in interest. I have to say to my constituents: 'I am sorry; we can't extend the heavy rail down to Gold Coast Airport—a cost of $2.8 billion—even though that money would have been available, because now that money has to go towards servicing Labor's debt. We cannot have $30 million for a cruise ship terminal on the Gold Coast—something that would drive employment and tourism—because now that money goes on repaying Labor's debt. We cannot find $2 billion to cover the cost of hosting the Commonwealth Games—something that would showcase my city and indeed all of Australia to the world—because now that money has to be spent on servicing Labor's debt. And we can't find $280 million for the cultural precinct at Evandale, because now that money has to be spent on servicing Labor's debt. We cannot find $1.8 billion to pay for light rail on the Gold Coast, because now that money has to be spent on Labor's debt.' n fact, one of the announcements that I made prior to the 2007 election was for $455 million for the widening of the M1 between Nerang and Tugun. Guess what? This government, in collaboration with the Queensland Labor government, tore that money away from the Gold Coast, ripped it away from my constituents and funnelled some of that money up the road. Instead of having an eight-lane carriageway on the M1, a national road between Brisbane and Sydney, we now have parts that are three lanes and other parts that are two lanes in each direction. That is Labor's legacy.


When people of the Gold Coast in my constituency look around and say, 'Where is the money for the light rail? Where is the money for the Commonwealth Games? Why aren't we improving heavy rail to the Gold Coast airport? Why aren't we doing something with the cruise ship terminal? Why aren't we seeing more funding like, for example, the local Roads to Recovery program, which was a coalition initiative—why aren't we seeing more funding there?' the answer is straightforward, and there are two reasons. Firstly, because that money now has to be spent to service the massive debt that the Labor Party has left us and, secondly, because that money was simply blown. Wasted. It may as well have been thrown on a fire and gone up in smoke; ridiculous programs, like their pink batts scheme—so-called stimulus programs.


If you want a good example of the way that this government has just absolutely wallowed in ineptitude, look at their set top box scheme, an announcement that I think was in the last federal budget. An allocation of around $450 per set top box installation to transform an old analogue TV to be digital-ready now—$450 per installation. The simple fact that you can buy a 42-inch plasma screen, delivered and installed, for less money than that—go to kogan.com.au if you need to verify it—escapes the Labor Party.


The reality is that this certainly has all the hallmarks of a Labor budget. It is a failed budget, and it fails because their centrepiece of this budget—which is to crow about additional compensation for Australian families as part of Labor's attempt to buy them off, frankly, before the introduction of the carbon tax—is nothing more than a laundering exercise. It is a laundering exercise, because Labor is borrowing that money from overseas, then taking that money and giving it to Australian families and saying, 'Aren't we great?' But there is a little asterisk at the end of that sentence. That little asterisk is this: that those Aussie kids who are supposedly the beneficiaries of that money will be the people who for the next two decades are forced to pay higher taxes in order to repay the massive debt that this government has racked up in four short years. One hundred years of Labor Party surpluses are required in order to repay four years of Labor Party debt and deficit. The Labor Party stands condemned for their reckless spending, for the opportunity costs that they have brought about on the Australian people and, most fundamentally, because they have betrayed future generations of Australians, who will have to repay the debt in order to get Australia back to square one.

Mr FITZGIBBON
 (Hunter—Chief Government Whip) (11:48):  I like the member for Moncrieff, and I have a healthy respect for his ability and capacity. I really cannot understand why he is not serving on the front bench, representing his party, but I am sure his time will come. But when we come to speak on the budget we come largely to speak about our local communities, and I have never heard such rubbish from him. I cannot believe the dissertation I have just heard from the member for Moncrieff. He represents a thriving tourism area. Where would it be now if Australia were in recession? How would the member for Moncrieff's electorate now be faring if, like Europe in particular, we were now in recession as a country?


As we speak today, in every corner of Europe they are wondering what they will do next about their economic situation. The eurozone is falling apart and they are wondering how they get growth back into their local economies, and they wonder how they are going to deal with the debt crisis of southern Europe. Meanwhile, back in Australia, of course, we still enjoy healthy growth. We managed to avoid recession, one of the only Western democracies to do so, and of course that has left us with a little bit of debt. The member for Moncrieff's alternative was not to spend that money and allow Australia to sink into a deep recession. All those things he was just talking about, which are no doubt worthy projects in his electorate, would not be funded today, because government revenues would have fallen considerably as the economy went into negative, and government outlays would have risen considerably as people joined the unemployment queues. Unemployment now in the Hunter region is at 3.9 per cent. In my electorate it is 3½ per cent. That would not be the case—




Mr Ciobo:
  No, it isn't.




Mr FITZGIBBON:
  I will take the interjection. I am not sure what it was, but I suspect I know. I do not take all the credit for that, nor does the current Labor government. The Hunter region is transforming itself off the back of reforms over a period of more than 20 years, started by the Hawke and Keating governments, continued by the Howard government and now kicked along again by the current Labor government.


But let us not have this rubbish that this debt, which as a percentage of GDP is very small in Australia, is somehow a problem for us and that, if we had not had it, we would be funding things in the member for Moncrieff's electorate. That is not true. If we had gone down the path he has suggested, his electorate would be in much worse shape today than it is thanks to the intervention of this government—intervention recommended by no less a person than the then Treasury secretary, Ken Henry, who was very persuasive recently on 7.30. I can advise the member for Moncrieff that that full interview can be seen, by the way, on the ABC website, and he should read it. I would ask those who might be listening to this debate this morning to ask themselves who has it right—Ken Henry or the member for Moncrieff? I know where my money is, and I suspect most of them will come to the conclusion that Ken Henry probably has a better idea about these things than the member for Moncrieff, as talented as the member for Moncrieff might be. I suspect they would also see Ken Henry as being just a little more independent in his pronouncements than the member for Moncrieff is, because as you would expect the member for Moncrieff is in here playing the political game. I am not saying I have never done that. I am sure I did in my younger days, but I have come to mature and I have come to understand that you do better in this place if you speak frankly about the challenges facing us and the opportunities before us, and that is what I will do this morning in the time afforded me.


On that theme, I want to say this: when I was elected to the Cessnock City Council in 1987, the Cessnock LGA was in pretty bad shape. Historically the area affectionately known as the Coalfields was established on the back of pit tops. Cessnock, Paxton, Ellalong and Millfield—I could go on and on—were there because there were mines there. The mines were sunk first and the communities were established around them. Of course, eventually the mines moved on and the people did not. That left the Coalfields in pretty bad shape. When I was elected, unemployment in Cessnock, for example, was more than 13 per cent. Youth unemployment was probably around 30 per cent. Things were pretty rough. Our roads were goat tracks. Roads like Allandale Road, Maitland Road, Aberdare Road, Lang Street in Kurri, Mitchell Avenue in Kurri and Victoria Street in Kurri were just goat tracks. We still have some problems with roads; all of us continue to work on those. We have more than our fair share, but basically our roads have come a long way. We did not have recreational facilities to speak of. We did not have any decent parks. We do now. We did not have any traffic lights. When I was elected to the Cessnock council in 1987, there was not a set of traffic lights in the whole city—a city covering Cessnock, Kurri and many communities around them. We have many now. Many of these things come naturally as the city grows, but the Cessnock LGA is a very different place today from what it was then.


If we wanted entertainment in the Cessnock LGA in those days, we went to the club or the pub. There was nothing wrong with that; they are good pubs and clubs and they are getting even better. But, if we wanted to do something beyond that, we drove to Newcastle or, more likely, we drove to Sydney. Today Sydney comes to us. The vineyard concerts are becoming very famous and well attended.


The whole Cessnock economy has been transformed, driven by the services and retail sectors. Coalmining is very important. We are very fortunate, because we are part of the boom, but the boom is not in our backyard. A large proportion of our workforce still works in mining by travelling down to areas like the member for Charlton's area and more particularly to the Upper Hunter. But things have improved dramatically. I said that I think the unemployment then in Cessnock was 13 per cent. Today it is a six per cent unemployment rate in Cessnock, and 3.5 per cent is the unemployment rate in the Hunter electorate.


We have the Hunter Expressway now coming through our area—a federal government investment of $1.45 billion, which will transform traffic flows through the region and provide towns like Cessnock and Maitland and a number of communities in between—Lochinvar, Greta, Branxton, Mount Vincent, Mulbring et cetera—with much-needed bypasses of their local communities and much needed relief from heavy vehicle traffic in particular. The Hunter Expressway is going to significantly impact positively on the Hunter's economy.


I say all these things not to take credit for them, although I like to think that over 16 years in this place and then eight years before that on Cessnock council I played my role. I will say again that for 11½ years of that period the conservatives were in power here in Canberra, and they take some credit for some of the transformations we have seen in the Hunter's economy and social fabric over those years. It has been a team effort. When John Howard was the Prime Minister, I like to think that I worked pretty well with his government to do what was right for my electorate, including the Cessnock LGA, which I love very, very much. I have lived there all of my life and I suspect I will live there for the balance of my life.


One of the reasons I make this point is that yesterday Norsk Hydro announced that it has finally taken the decision to close down its aluminium-manufacturing plant in Kurri Kurri, with the loss of around 400 jobs. Already a number of months ago they closed down one potline, which caused them to shed about 150 jobs. This is very, very unfortunate, disappointing and distressing for those directly affected—either those who have been working at Hydro, some of them for many years, or those working in the industries would support Hydro, whether they be supplying food or doing other manufacturing and works associated with the plant.


What concerns me is the way people talk down the town in the wake of these things. Hydro have been making it clear for a while that aluminium prices and the Australian dollar were killing them. They have had the additional frustration of their inability to secure an appropriate and acceptable long-term power supply contract with the New South Wales government. We knew this was coming, as sad as we find it. But it is not the end of Kurri Kurri, it is not the end of the Cessnock LGA and it is certainly not the end of the Hunter electorate. We are a booming community. We are very fortunate. We have much at our disposal. With unemployment at 3.5 per cent in the Hunter electorate and six per cent in the Cessnock LGA or thereabouts, most of those workers, in my view, will have very good employment prospects. They are semiskilled and skilled, and well placed to pick up the enormous amount of job opportunities in the Hunter region, including very close to home. The biggest challenge for me when I became the member for Hunter was finding jobs to put people in. Today my biggest challenge is finding the people to fill the jobs. I regularly talk with employers who are simply crying out for employees.




A division having been called in the House of Representatives—





Sitting suspended from 
11:59
 to 
12:15





Mr FITZGIBBON:
  If I were one to write and read my speeches, I might know where I was before I was interrupted by the division—a first for me—but I know what theme I was on, and it is this. The Cessnock LGA is in great shape. It is more beautiful than it once was and more vibrant than it once was. The unemployment rate has never been so low. We have never had such economic diversity and I am sure that all those who are looking for a job post-Hydro will find themselves a job in a labour market—and I remember where I was up to in my speech now—where employers are screaming for employees with the sorts of skills held by those who, very unfortunately, will be made redundant as a result of Hydro's closure. So my main message to the many out there talking the area down is: please stop it. It does not help. We are in very good shape and our future is a very bright one indeed. Please stop this rubbish about blaming the carbon price for the closure and, in doing so, making political capital out of what is a pretty distressing time for those who were directly affected.


In the minutes left to me, I want to mention a couple of people who have, sadly, passed on in recent times. I spoke about Mrs Lola Neilly in the adjournment debate on Monday, and I want to quickly mention two other people. One is Bill Parker, who was a Kurri resident, served for many, many years on Cessnock City Council, including a term as deputy mayor, and served with me for the eight years I was on Cessnock council. He was a wonderful individual of unchallenged integrity and a talented councillor who always put his city first. He will be sadly missed.


The second person I want to mention is Mr Kevin Levido. Kevin Levido was a very well known Cessnock resident from a very well-known family. He for many years managed the local Bandag tyre-retreading business for the O'Neill family. He was very active, like Bill Parker, in the Labor Party. He was also involved in a range of other organisations, including the local Masonic lodge. He was a very disciplined character and always very fit, even in his later years, but, again, like Bill Parker, he was a man of very great honesty and integrity. He was known to be pretty tough too, including on his employees and, indeed, those close to him. But that was his way—we are all different. He remained a person who was very highly respected in the local community. To both of those families once again go my sympathies and condolences.


Although we lost Bill probably some months ago now, this has been my first opportunity to acknowledge his passing and to thank him again for his contribution and to thank his family for allowing him to spend so much of his time doing what he loved, trying to improve his local community. It is the very community that I have just been talking about, of course—Kurri Kurri. If Bill were here, I have no doubt that he would agree with me that we have gone ahead in leaps and bounds since the days when we enjoyed one another's company on Cessnock council. He would not be happy to hear people talking down the local area. He, like me, would say, 'It's a tragedy we've lost Hydro, but, gee, we've got so much else going for us.'

"Griggs, Natasha, MP",CLP,2012-05-24,"



Mrs GRIGGS
 (Solomon) (12:20):  I rise to speak on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2012-2013 and cognate bills. As I have said before, while I am in this place I will do whatever is possible to ensure that my electorate of Solomon—and, indeed, the Northern Territory—receive their fair share of funding from the Commonwealth government. Once again, despite the endless rhetoric from Labor in the lead-up to the budget, this was not a tough budget. There was more borrowing, more debt and more taxes and then a sugar-hit cash giveaway to offset the carbon tax.


The government have resorted to accounting tricks and money shuffling to manufacture the appearance of a wafer-thin budget surplus of $1.5 billion in the 2012-13 financial year. If the Gillard Labor government really believe they can deliver a surplus, why are they moving to increase the Commonwealth debt limit from $250 billion to $300 billion? They are increasing the government's credit card limit, and we all know that we cannot trust Labor with credit cards. They have tried to hide the fact that they need to increase the credit card limit by having the proposal buried in the Appropriation Bill (No. 2) in order to avoid proper scrutiny and a specific vote on the debt limit. This government are embarrassed that government debt levels are at absolutely unprecedented levels. They do not want Australians to know that they have maxed out the credit card again.


The Treasurer did not even mention the plan to raise the debt limit in his budget night speech, and, when he was asked later why he needed to lift the debt limit if he was returning the budget to surplus, he responded, 'Well, very simply, this is no big deal.' Net debt is rising to $145 billion. This dwarfs the previous record of $96 billion left by Paul Keating—and this is no big deal? That is not what my constituents tell me; they tell me it is a big deal.


This government tell us about restraint, but they are now spending $100 million more per year than they were when they came to office. This represents an almost 40 per cent increase over a time when inflation has risen to 13.2 per cent. Look at what Labor do; do not listen to what they say. They are continuing to borrow $100 million per day. That is $100 million for every day that this Labor government are in power. In 18 months, the government's estimated deficit on the 2012-13 financial year has blown out from $12 billion to $44 billion—and it may blow out even further, because the year is not over. In the last four years Labor have delivered record cumulative deficits of $174 billion. The interest payments on Labor's debt alone are set to reach an alarming $8 billion per year.


What this budget did was very simple: it confirmed to every Australian that this government are not fit to lead. The government are so swept up in holding onto power and improving the polls that they have forgotten their core responsibility to the Australian people. To a nation that is facing high costs of living, and dealing with a failed immigration policy, the Gillard Labor government give the following: the world's biggest carbon tax; cynical bribes to soften the impact of the carbon tax; broken promises on corporate tax cuts; higher unemployment; blowouts in the cost of border protection; an underfunded NDIS, which is nothing more than a cruel hoax; and equity funding for the NBN which is being kept off-budget. That is what this Labor government give us.


Despite Julia Gillard saying five days before the last election, 'There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead', budget 2012 is Australia's first carbon-tax budget. The world's biggest carbon tax is about to hit families, jobs and investment at the world's worst time. The budget papers confirm that despite falling international prices Labor's toxic tax will go up to $29 a tonne in just three years and that an additional $36 million will be spent on taxpayer-funded carbon tax advertising over the next two years. The advertisements, as we know, do not even mention the carbon tax. They mention that cash bribes, but they do not mention the phrase 'carbon tax'. The carbon tax will cascade through the economy. Despite Labor's lie that only the big emitters will pay the price, the cost of virtually everything will go up, up and up. Small businesses, which are the engine room of the economy, will receive no compensation for the carbon tax.


We have had four deficits in four years. The overall budget for 2012 delivers a deterioration of $26 billion in the cumulative Commonwealth budget position over the forward estimates since last year's budget. The blow-out in this year's deficit from $23 billion to $44 billion means more borrowing and more debt, which future generations will have to repay. All of this is despite the fact that in real terms the government is experiencing the fastest growth in revenue since the mid-1980s. This is the fourth Labor deficit in four years, and together they total $174 billion.


Treasurer Swan has never managed to get his figures right. The 2011-12 budget deficit has now blown out, as I said, three times, from $12 billion to $23 billion to $37 billion to $44 billion, and this year has not even finished. This year's budget, as I have said, was all about cooking the books. In headline cash terms, the Gillard Labor government will spend $8.7 billion more than it earns in the 2012-13 financial year, because the government continues to spend on projects such as the NBN, which have been taken off budget. If the government were honest and included the NBN expenditure, the budget would show deficits over the next three years. To put it simply, there would be no surplus if the NBN were on the books. In fact, by bringing forward just two programs, the back to school payment and the Commonwealth grants to local government, the government artificially saves more than $1.5 billion in the 2012-13 financial year. Honest budget treatment of these two programs alone would wipe our Treasurer Swan's wafer-thin surplus.


We now have record debt. As I have already said, this government seeks to increase Australia's debt ceiling to a record $300 billion, which is four times higher than it was in 2008. Australians are right to be concerned about Treasurer Swan, with yet another increase in our nation's credit card limit. Net government debt will climb to a record $144.9 billion in 2013-14. That is an increase of almost $40 billion since last year's budget. By 2015-16, the government will be spending over $8 billion a year, or around $22 million a day, on interest payments alone. This is the price tag of Labor's legacy of waste and reckless spending.


With the higher unemployment, last year's budget promised 500,000 new jobs over two years, but the government now expects to miss its target by 300,000 jobs. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate is forecast to increase to 5.5 per cent, while the government is cutting $200 million out of job service programs. This government is all about high taxes. The budget includes another six new tax hikes, including through heavy vehicle road user charges and reduced tax offsets for families with higher medical bills. This brings to 26 the number of new or increased taxes the Rudd/Gillard Labor governments have delivered since 2007.


Let us get to the broken promises. The Gillard Labor government has dumped the Prime Minister's promise about company tax cuts. Less than two months ago in the House of Reps on 14 March, she said:


If you are against cutting company tax, you are against economic growth». If you are against economic growth, then you are against jobs.


The Prime Minister has also broken her solemn promise set out in the 2009 defence white paper to increase defence spending by three per cent in real terms until the 2017-18 financial year. In this budget, the Prime Minister and Treasurer Swan cut a further $5.5 billion out of Australia's defence budget, on top of the $2.5 billion they cut out of the defence budget last year. As a percentage of GDP, defence spending is now at historically low levels. While defence continues to be cut, Prime Minister Gillard's broken border protection and onshore processing policy has delivered another $1.4 billion blowout in asylum seeker management. Yet, despite the Gillard Labor government's big talk, the $1 billion committed over the forward estimates to the National Disability Insurance Scheme is almost $3 billion less than the Productivity Commission recommended. Australians with disabilities will be forgiven for feeling short-changed by the Gillard Labor government's budget. The budget also set aside just $5 billion towards the Gonski review. The $5-billion-a-year price tag means Labor's independent schools hit list is not far away.


Australians want a government which can deliver an economic strategy to build a strong Australia, reduce the cost-of-living pressures and create secure jobs. Instead, they have a government mired in chaos and a Prime Minister with no judgment. My electorate of Solomon is in desperate need of infrastructure to make its economy more productive. In Solomon, we are also in desperate need of health infrastructure to give our people better access to health services. There are more disappointing elements in the budget: in particular that families have been targeted and the perception of a wealthy family is now a family on $150,000. With the higher cost of living continuing to apply pressure on families' budgets and interest rates, we all know that a family on $150,000 is far from being wealthy, especially in regional Australia, where the cost of living in high.


Many people in my electorate and my family and friends across Australia have raised with me their concerns regarding the significant expenditure on housing associated with asylum seekers in the Territory. The general view is that this money could be better spent on infrastructure to build on the Territory's potential and on funding longer term projects within my electorate. This Labor government's short-sighted measures and poor fiscal management are set to continue to the pain for families within my electorate of Solomon. Despite Labor talking down the impact of the these changes, the truth is that, at a time when families are struggling with costs of living pressures, the carbon tax will hurt families. I remind the House again of the pink batts fiasco, which resulted in the deaths of Australians. I remind the house of the Building the Education Revolution scheme, which directed funds to building halls at schools already scheduled for closure. I remind the House of the hard-earned taxpayers' money spent on an inefficient solar rebate program—a program that not only was economically inefficient but did almost nothing for environmental outcomes. How can we forget the exorbitant and unnecessary cost of giving set-top boxes to pensioners at a cost higher than that of a whole new television? Nor have we forgotten the $900 of stimulus payments that were sent to people living overseas and to people who were in fact dead.


On another note, after the 2010 federal election the Prime Minister was asked by the member for Denison what Labor would do with the promises made by Labor candidates in seats where Labor did not win. The Prime Minister stood at the dispatch box, hand on heart and said, 'Our promises were fully costed—every single one of them. Of course they will be delivered. Of course they will. We don't go around making promises that we won't fulfil.


Following on from that passionate statement of commitment in the chamber, I wrote letters to the Prime Minister on behalf of the electorate asking for clarification as to when the pre-election commitments made by Labor would be delivered in my electorate of Solomon. One promise I would like to touch on quickly was the promise of 1,200 new affordable rental homes in the Northern Territory, priced at at least 20 per cent below market rates under the National Rental Affordability Scheme. This promise was rebadged from the previous election. Now, according to a recent National Rental Affordability Scheme monthly performance report dated 30 April 2012, out of the 1,696 NRAS incentives, the Northern Territory has currently a grand total of—wait for it—14 allocated incentives. That was 14 out of 1,696 in the Northern Territory. As I have said many times in this place, the Northern Territory and indeed my electorate of Solomon is experiencing a housing crisis, and the best number this government can come up with is 14. Mind you, this comes at the same time this Labor government is introducing its toxic carbon tax. This Labor government is definitely toxic and cannot go through with its plans. It really is a mess. At the same time, this government is demolishing houses in my electorate. The RAAF base is fantastic, with really good houses, but this government is knocking them down. It just beggars belief. It is just a disgrace. The coalition government said that it would save those houses, and I am here again today to say that it should.


I would like to end by reminding the House that the carbon tax will hurt families, small businesses and all the people in the Northern Territory, and they are very clear that they do not want a carbon tax. This budget was all about the carbon tax.


Debate adjourned.

"Katter, Bob, MP",AUS,2012-05-24,"



Mr KATTER
 (Kennedy) (10:02):  The burning question for productive Australia—certainly agriculture but manufacturing probably even more so and tourism even more so again—is interest rates. Our interest rates are wildly out of step with the rest of the world. I keep being accused, with my non-free-trade viewpoint, of being out of step and ridiculous. The only place I am out of step is in this chamber, in this parliament. This is the only place I am out of step. The rest of Australia agrees with me. Eighty per cent of Australians continually say that they would be prepared to pay a few bob more for whatever they are buying to protect and create Australian jobs. Interest rates are a classic example. Europeans are on one per cent; Japanese and Americans, last time I looked, were on 0.1 per cent; and Australia is on over 4½ per cent. Where are you going to park your money? Of course you are going to park your money in Australia, where you get 4½ per cent. You are not going to park it in Europe, where you get only one per cent interest. And also, we have got an appreciating dollar under this regime. So there are two reasons to park your money here. 


It is a self-reinforcing mechanism which has pushed the dollar up. In Mr Costello's second year in office, the dollar was at 52c. The dollar is averaging more than 100c now. Mr Costello can take most of the blame for that, but the Labor Party can most certainly take their part of the blame. They are in office, they should be doing something about it, and they are not. Having said that, we praise the Treasurer because he said that the interest rates coming down is good. I think there was pressure from the Treasurer to bring them down half a per cent. But they are still four per cent above the rest of the world—most certainly 3½ per cent. They are 300 times higher than they are in the rest of the world. So, if you invest your money here, you get 300 per cent more money than if you invest your money there—if the dollar comes down. When the dollar rose under Mr Costello from 52c to 90c, the income for my cattlemen halved and the income for my miners halved. And we closed down mines. We closed down mines; Kagara zinc mine is closed at the present moment—a great company. 


We plead with the government to take the bit between their teeth and do the sensible thing that every other government on earth is doing. I am telling you that, with the Europeans moving to an increase in money supply, money will drain out of Australia, interest will drain out of Australia, their industries will surge forward and ours will continue to die. 


Let me be very specific. As I get up to speak today it looks like this year we will have 82 per cent of motor vehicles in Australia come in from overseas. Mr Keating started this stupidity—and I can remember vividly hearing him on the radio when I crawled out of bed one morning; he said, 'We will be the freest economy on earth.' I thought: 'This imbecile. Are we going to go to Chinese wages or are we going to import all our jobs to China?' Those are the only two possibilities if you move to a free market. 


No-one else in the world moved to a free market. The only two countries on earth that have a free market are Australia and New Zealand—and, if you want to include a third country, it would actually be Canada. One cannot help but believe that the colonial spot marks are showing. Why would these two—arguably three—countries be the only three countries on earth that move to free trade?


Mr Deputy Speaker Scott, you are well aware that we cannot get a pound of beef into Europe. We were allowed technically 6,000 tonne but we cannot even meet the requirements for 6,000 tonne. To put that in perspective for other people here: America takes 400,000 tonne a year, and they are one-half or one-third the size of Europe. What a joke. We cannot sell beef to Europe. We cannot sell a pound of beef to China. These are the two biggest economies on earth, and we cannot sell a pound of beef to either of them. So much for free trade.


When Mr Keating made his wonderful statement that we were going to become a 'free economy', over 72 per cent of the motor vehicles in Australia were Australian made. This year, 82 per cent of them were imported from overseas. We all know that within 10 years there will be no motor vehicle industry in this country. We cannot build a tyre in this country. We cannot build an electric motor in this country. We will not be able to build a motor car in this country. We will be a Third World technology country. 


As for agriculture, Mr Deputy Speaker, you would be well aware that the Fin Review and the Sydney Morning Herald have said loud and clear—this place has not listened to them—that within three years this country will be a net importer of food. It will not be able to feed itself. We are a net importer of fruit and vegetables now. Three years ago we were an exporter of seafood. This year 80 per cent, it would appear, of our seafood will be imported from overseas. We are a net importer of pork. But soon overall we will be a net importer of food. We live in a country that cannot feed itself.


So, to that silly fella that led a party—which I am ashamed to say that I was once a member of—who walked around with his hat turned down and said, 'We will be the food bowl of Asia,' I say: listen, you fool; we are going to be the begging bowl of Asia. All this country now has, as a result of the policies of this place, is an iron ore quarry and a coal quarry. That is all it has. 


I predict the new government, the LNP government in Queensland, will be the worst government in Queensland history, because they have the terrible combination of arrogance and no vision, perspective or intelligence. They have already announced that the Galilee Basin—half of our entire coal reserves in Queensland—will be mined by people from overseas. Thanks to the policies of this place, all six of our great mining companies are now all foreign owned. They were all Australian owned 15 years ago. Now they are all foreign owned. Thanks to this place, we allowed every one of them to be sold overseas. 


We do not own the resource. The resource is owned by China, China and India. Those are the three groups of people that own the resources. We are not going to get any profits out of it. We are not going to get any wages out of it. What the hell will we get out of it? All the machinery and equipment comes from overseas in mining. We do not produce any machinery or equipment for mining in Australia. So what do we get out of it? We get a hole in the ground; that is what we get out of it. 


But a grubby little government like the outgoing ALP government was grasping for some taxation out of it. The grubby little government that has come in, that cannot see around the doorstop, just want to get some taxes out of it and look after their corporate friends. Who are the front men for the two Chinese areas that are owned? The front men are Gina Rinehart and Clive Palmer. Who owns the LNP? Clive Palmer. Surprise, surprise. 


If you are a Chinese person, you say: 'Well, hold on a minute. Our boys back home are getting paid $5,000 a year'—that is the average weekly earnings in China. 'What are we going to pay your people? $160,000 a year?' Fair damn go. I mean, naturally, Clive Palmer, Gina Rinehart and the Indians, the Adani Group that own the top of it, are going to say: 'Hold on a minute. We are going to fly our people in from overseas. None of this paying you Australians $160,000 while our people back home are being paid $5,000. No more of that.' 


We do want to thank the government very sincerely for the $350 million which is still in there for the transmission line. Governments throughout Queensland's history gave us railway lines and ports. The great Theodore governments up to the 1950s, and they were Theodore governments, gave us railway lines and ports. The government built the railway lines and ports and made absolutely unconscionable amounts of money out of it. The great Bejelke-Petersen government created the coal industry and the aluminium industry in Australia. They built the power station for the aluminium industry. They built the railway line for the coal industry. That is why we have a coal industry and an aluminium industry here today. So we thank the government for that $350 million for that transmission line. But, if you give us that transmission line to send coal into the Galilee Basin, you can use that railway line to sell coal. Have the courage to say: 'No, we will not fly in 40,000 workers from overseas. Those jobs are for Australians.' Yes, you might have to pay an extra $10,000 and, yes, you may not be allowed to kick the workers around. God bless the CFMEU. I stand 1,000 per cent behind the CFMEU and their stand against fly-in mining—and that is in Australia. 


I will be out there at every rally and stop-work meeting that the CFMEU have, because, if they are turning it on for fly-in mining in Australia, what are they are going to turn on when the LNP government in Queensland attempts to fly workers in from overseas? I leave it to your imagination. We have a proud history of industrial force in Queensland and we will not be resiling from that position, I can tell you.


If you give that to us and we get those wages out of the coalmines, then we will give back to Australia $75,000 million a year from the Galilee Basin. My homeland is the richest mineral province on earth, with vast uranium, phosphate and iron ore deposits. If you give us a little canal, about 150 kilometres—that is all; most countries have tens and hundreds of thousands of kilometres of canals—so we can get out through the gulf instead of coming all the way back through Townsville, particularly for phosphate and iron ore, then we will gift to Australia an extra $15,000 million a year. That is $90,000 million a year, nearly $100,000 million, into an economy of $1,000 million a year. e will increase your GDP just in the income from those ore and coal reserves by $100 million a year. That is what we will give back to Australia.


We have a commitment from the federal government—$350 million on that transmission line, but the LNP government has knocked the transmission line on the head. They have already announced that they are going to fly the miners in from overseas; they are not going to give you any infrastructure to open up your resources and this is all in two months! They have announced they are tightening the gun laws and, effectively, strangely enough they have announced that they are going to do nothing about flying foxes as well, which of course is the burning question in the state of Queensland.


If we get a government that builds things—a nation-building government—which we have not seen for 30 years in this country; not since Doug Anthony, one of the greatest figures of stature in this country's history. When he left the stage we had no one. When Bjelke-Petersen left the stage we had no one. And to our eternal shame, Ted Theodore is remembered for the Mungana scandal and the Bjelke-Petersen government is remembered for silly, stupid rubbish: there was not a single, solitary minister went to jail for corruption—they went for misuse of their parliamentary expenditure. Be careful, everybody, because what it was for was using their cars for private purposes. That is what the four ministers went to jail for in Queensland—so much corruption!


But these great builders like Theodore and Bjelke-Petersen—I plead, Mr Deputy Speaker, for people to read my book where you will see it in detail and flashing neon lights. Those who may have been brought up in the Labor tradition will walk with very great pride. It is only $39, too, Mr Deputy Speaker.




Ms Saffin:
  Is it in the library here?




Mr KATTER:
  Yes. But the details of what those successive Queensland governments did to hand to their nation the coal industry, the base metals industry and the aluminium industry are in there, and I named the chapter, 'Walking with giants'. Probably Les Thiess was the greatest of them.


We can build again, but we need money from the budget. We thank the government for the $350 million but the government must do a lot more because there will be no enlightened government coming out of Queensland. The one project that was needed for nation building they knocked on the head.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Hon. BC Scott
):  Order! Before I call the parliamentary secretary I will just remind members once again. I was reluctant to pull up the honourable member for Kennedy for the use of the word 'you', the word 'you' referring to the occupier of this chair. It is a reflection on the chair. I have reminded him of that and also other members on both sides of this House before. Next time I will interrupt, and I am sure that members do not want to be interrupted in their precious time of speaking in this chamber or in the main chamber. I just ask members to remember that when they use the word 'you' they are pointing directly to the occupier of the chair, and it is a reflection on the chair. Refer to 'the member' or to 'the government' or other bodies but do not use the word 'you will'. It is a habit that has crept in that I have observed as an occupier of the chair.




Mr Katter:
  Mr Deputy Speaker Scott, I have great respect and friendship for you, and I would never, ever put you in the category of the contempt in which I hold many other members.

"Bird, Sharon, MP",ALP,2012-05-24,"



Ms BIRD
 (Cunningham—Parliamentary Secretary for Higher Education and Skills) (10:18):  It is a great pleasure to speak to the budget that was presented by the Treasurer this year, and to follow the member for Kennedy in this debate on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2012-13 and cognate bills. Much of what he has contributed I would not agree with, but some of it I do. I think that in talking about the significance of the mining industry in this country he has touched on two very important areas that as a government we have been pursuing since we were first elected. They are: the development of the skills of the people of this nation to ensure they get access to the jobs of the future—exactly the issues he was addressing there—and also that we redirect some of the wealth into infrastructure across this nation to ensure that as a nation we are well positioned to make the best opportunities of the future, and where we sit in particular in the Asian century.


So while I may not always agree with the member for Kennedy's description of history or his prescription for the solving of the problems, I think that we can start with the base of an agreement about what the problems are and to acknowledge that they are certainly priorities for this government, and have been. Indeed, they were priorities for people representing the peak industry associations when I was first elected in 2004, when there were constant reports about backlogs and blockages in our system as a result of a shortage of skills and a shortage of infrastructure. They are two very important issues that the member for Kennedy touched on in his contribution.


This budget, I would argue very much, is a budget in the great tradition of Labor budgets and reflects the values that we seek to represent in this place. I say that for two reasons. Firstly, we do have a great tradition of building the skills and infrastructure of the nation. The Labor government has at the federal level a long history of building road, rail and transport infrastructure and ports and shipping. Indeed, at the moment the minister for transport is undertaking a mammoth task to rebuild the shipping industry of this nation, which has been let wither on the vine so badly for so long. We have a great tradition of putting in place the transport infrastructure on land that is needed to move the goods and services of our nation around what is, at the end of the day, one of our biggest challenges—the tyranny of distance not only internationally in terms of where we sit from major markets but also internally in connecting our cities and regions across the nation. 


This has been really importantly reflected in this budget by the fact that we seek to introduce a new form of profits based tax on the mining industry in order to be able to redirect what is the wealth of this nation. I take the member for Kennedy's point and note that he has some concerns about who owns the companies. But, at the end of the day, the wealth of the nation is owned by the nation. It is owned by the people of this country, and we should ensure that we leverage that to get maximum benefit for diversifying our economies and supporting the sections of industry and the country, in terms of regions, that need to be able to be supported to take advantage of the boom and, indeed, supporting the regions that are experiencing the boom to manage that in an effective way—which I think many members here would, I think, reflect. That is exactly what a large part of the task of this budget is directly aimed at.


In my own region of the Illawarra, clearly we see both of those phenomena happening in one place. We have a very vibrant and strong mining industry. Coming from five generations of coalminers, I am most conscious of the reality of that industry in my region—and it is continues to flourish. I was talking to some of my uncles on the weekend, one of whom said that the biggest job he has had was writing CVs in the 1980s when he was retrenched 12 times when the mining industry was at the other end of the cycle. So we are very conscious in our region of the importance of the mining industry. But we are also a base for manufacturing. People would be aware of the BlueScope restructure last year and the significant flow-ons from that. So we do see both speeds and both challenges.


We are also a region with a major university, and we have seen growth. For example, our university produces the largest number of IT graduates in the nation. We have seen growth in aged care, in a much more professional, developed aged-care sector providing services of a much greater variety to people with different demands as they age in the modern age. We have seen a growth in our service sectors as well. So we reflect that diversity and those various speeds in the economy.


Part of that first part of the task of the budget that I referred to is about delivering on those infrastructure transport links and freight support that we have talked about. I am also very pleased that the budget gave a very strong injection and support to the development of skills in this nation and a continued support for our TAFEs, universities and private providers in this sector to continue to provide the opportunity for people to get the education that they need in order to be able to take advantage of the future.


We are very aware that if somebody leaves high school in this day and age—let alone in the future—without a further tertiary qualification, whether that is a certificate, a diploma or a degree, they are going to significantly struggle to hold a job in the modern economy. That is not something that we should be accepting in any way, shape or form.


Part of my new role as the parliamentary secretary in this area is to look at how we ensure that adults have the language, literacy and numeracy skills to be able to access those educational opportunities I am very pleased to be able to be undertaking that task, because I think it is very important. Indeed, members may have heard some of the stories of people in their own communities who grew up illiterate as adults and have had the opportunity through various governments over time to gain literacy skills. What a difference it makes to not only their own lives but also their kids. If your parents are literate and able to support you in your schooling, you are going to do much better at school. I think those commitments in the budget around education skills are also particularly important.


The other side of it is the micro side: it is what we are attempting to do to support individuals and to support families in order to manage the cost-of-living issues. In my own area of Cunningham I want to acknowledge that, in particular, the additional money—the schoolkids money—is going to be very important. I have talked to lots of local families who are very pleased with this particular initiative. My own sons are adults now, but I have had a lifetime of understanding the challenges, as many of us in this place with children have, of the costs to commence schooling, whether it is uniforms or equipment and so forth. There are just over 7,000 families in my electorate who are going to be eligible for that bonus—that is $410 a year for each child in primary school and $820 for each child in high school. It will be very welcome.


There are about 8,000 families in my electorate who will get the increase of up to $600 in family tax benefit A from 1 July next year—another important initiative to support families. Just over 9½ thousand young people, single parents and unemployed people in my electorate will receive the supplementary allowance. This is designed to help them meet the cost of utilities. The singles will receive $210 and couples $350. I think it is important to acknowledge that sometimes people hear the big stories and think: 'You're just talking about families.' That is not the case; we are also seeking to support young people, single parents and the unemployed with that sort of allowance.


There will be, very importantly, about 47,000 workers in my electorate who will receive a tax cut from 1 July this year. When you add that to the history of tax cuts that we have put in place since coming to government, it is a very important addition to give people more of their own income in order to meet their costs of living. About 4,000 workers in my electorate will no longer pay tax due to the increase in the tax-free threshold. So it is a great incentive to say to low-income workers, 'Get back in the workforce and engage with the workforce, even if it is getting a casual or part-time job, because you can earn up to about $18,000 now before you will even have to put a tax return in. You won't have to pay tax.' It is an enormous initiative. In my area it will be very welcome for 4,000 workers and I am sure it will be welcome in many other members' areas where there are significant issues around unemployment, particularly if that unemployment is connected to people who are disengaged from the workforce, such as disadvantaged young people, single parents or mature workers who have been out of the workforce for a long time. We know that that first step in the door, whether it is a part-time or casual job, can be the turning point to getting someone re-engaged with the workforce. To be able to say to those people, 'You can earn up to $18,000 without paying tax,' is a huge incentive. I am really pleased with that initiative in the budget.


There will also be nearly 23,000 workers in my area who earn up to $37,000 who will receive up to $500 towards their superannuation accounts—again, another great Labor tradition building on superannuation in this country. One of the GFC realities was that one of the strengths of our economy was our investment of over $1 trillion dollar in superannuation and the solid savings base that gives to this nation, so it is good to see that also supported in this budget. About 45½ thousand workers will get increased superannuation benefits when we move from nine to 12 per cent. As we all seek to have a retirement that is long and of quality, we will increasingly appreciate the importance of that increase to superannuation. Just over 15,000 small businesses will be eligible for the instant tax write-off for each asset worth up to $6,500. I think it is really important I make the point to my own local businesses: that is not one a year; that is up to $6,500 on every asset that they purchase, including up to $5,000 on a new vehicle, if that is part of their business requirement. When we initially introduced this as part of the stimulus response to the GFC, local small businesses in my area got a double bang because they bought from each other. It was not just the purchasing business that got the benefit of an instant asset write-off; they were likely to buy their car or their new computer or new piece of equipment from another local business, so that business got the benefit as well. I would argue it is a really good incentive. Some of my local businesses talk to me about the fact that we could not get the one per cent decrease in tax through for them because, sadly, those on the other side opposed it. But they were very supportive of this initiative, which provides the capacity for them to write off these assets and also supports other local businesses. At a more local level, the budget contains just over $1 million towards local roads for the Wollongong City Council, and I know they very much welcome that investment.


There is a commitment in this budget of $25.5 million towards the next stage of the Maldon-Dombarton rail link, something I have been campaigning for since I was first elected. Some members here might have an understanding of it. It was actually half built by the state government. When Mr Greiner was elected as Premier he stopped it. It was in the mid-eighties, when the coal industry took a dive. In a sadly short-sighted way, it was seen as not worth proceeding with. There are magnificent visions of a fly-over bridge across the gorges, but it just stops half-way. It is half built and has sat like that for nearly 30 years now. 


The port of Port Kembla has become a critically significant port for the eastern seaboard of New South Wales. There is real capacity at Port Kembla to utilise it in a greater way and to create more local jobs, but we need that rail link completed. The Minister for Infrastructure and Transport, Minister Albanese, has very much supported us on that project. When the Prime Minister came to the area to respond to the BlueScope announcement, she announced that we would commit to taking that project to the next stage and to get all the engineering and environmental work done. I will continue to lobby to get it included on the next round of nation-building infrastructure priorities. It is not a small task but it is a strategically very important and significant task. 


All round, this is a great Labor budget, doing all the things that the nation needs to do. I absolutely commend these bills to the House.

"Wyatt, Ken, MP",LP,2012-05-24,"



Mr WYATT
 (Hasluck) (10:33):  I rise today to speak on the Appropriation Bill (No.1) 2012-2013 and related bills. Before I examine some of the critical infrastructure needs that have been left off the list for Hasluck yet again, I would like to take the time to speak about the suite of bills in their totality and what they mean for the Australian people. This budget will deliver all the wrong things for the residents of Hasluck and the nation as a whole. 


Inside Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2012-2013 is what amount to bribes to soften the impact of the world's largest carbon tax. There are massive blow-outs in the cost of border protection as the government run around trying to find rooms for asylum seekers as detention centres overflow.  The NDIS is underfunded, while equity funding for the NBN is being kept off the bottom line of the budget. Behind the smoke and mirrors is a government that has hidden the rise in the Commonwealth debt limit from $250 billion to $300 billion in Appropriation Bill (No. 2) to avoid proper scrutiny and debate on the matter.


This government continues to borrow more than $100 million per day and in four years has delivered a cumulative record deficit of $174 billion. The interest on this debt runs into the billions of dollars every year. That is money that could be better spent on many projects in many electorates, but in particular Hasluck, which is being neglected by this Labor government. All of the above comes without taking into account the world's biggest carbon tax, which is being rolled out in a matter of weeks. The carbon tax will hurt the people of Hasluck; make no mistake about that. Despite the fact that Julia Gillard said, five days before the last election, 'There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead,' Budget 2012 is Australia's first carbon tax budget. The world's biggest carbon tax is about to hit families, jobs and investment at the world's worst time. The budget papers confirm that despite falling international prices Labor's toxic tax will go up to $29 a tonne in just three years, and an additional $36 million will be spent on taxpayer funded carbon tax advertising over the next two years. The advertisements mention the cash bribes but do not even mention what they are for—the world's biggest carbon tax. The carbon tax will cascade through the economy. Despite the Labor government's lie that only big emitters will pay the price, the cost of virtually everything will go up and up and up. 


I would like to draw the chamber's attention to the Red Hill Waste Management Facility to the north-east of my electorate. This is managed by the East Metropolitan Regional Council, a conglomerate of local governments in Hasluck and its surrounds. The Department of Environment and Conservation provides the EMRC with an annual licence to operate the site once it has been adequately demonstrated that a range of conditions regarding pollution, buffer distances, noise control and waste types and quantities can be met. The use of modern techniques and principles of sanitary landfill design and operation, including leachate collection and methane gas capture, have contributed to the site successfully operating within DEC conditions for the last 22 years. 


I had the privilege of visiting the Red Hill site with the member for Swan, Steve Irons, earlier this year, and we were blown away by the work and effort that has been put into managing landfill responsibly—educating schools on responsible waste disposal and capturing in excess of 75 per cent of all gases emitted from the landfill. These are just a few of the amazing things that the Red Hill Waste Management facility is doing to protect our environment. You would think that such an initiative would be rewarded by a government—but, no, this facility is one of the entities set to be included in the carbon tax. The reason? Its size.


You would think that the pooling of the resources of six local government authorities to save money and create a better environmental outcome than a typical landfill would be rewarded, but not in this instance. This government and its lazy approach to environmental policy is penalising them. I know they are worried about this tax. They will be forced to put up their prices and inflict an additional cost on constituents within my electorate and surrounding ones. They are worried that this will drive some people away from the landfill to dump their waste illegally as it becomes too expensive to do the right thing. This is another example of Labor's failed policies, which are too numerous to mention, even in a 15-minute speech. 


I turn my attention to small business in Hasluck, which is the engine room of the local economy. They get no compensation for the carbon tax in this suite of appropriation bills. The Gillard government must cut red tape and axe the carbon tax to help improve small business conditions which are well below the five-year average. The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry's May 2012 Small Business Survey states that small business conditions were at low levels, with conditions expected to deteriorate further in the coming quarter.


The Prime Minister has also dumped her promised company tax cuts. Less than two months ago she said, 'If you are against cutting company tax, you are against economic growth. If you are against economic growth, then you are against jobs.' I regularly speak to local business owners in Hasluck when I am visiting shopping centres or precincts or when I am out doorknocking. They all tell me the same thing: this is the worst possible time to introduce the world's biggest carbon tax.


Small businesses are the biggest employers in my electorate and, in uncertain economic times, everyone is concerned that this carbon tax, which will have no environmental benefit to Australia, is the coup de grace to economic growth and many small businesses in Hasluck. If you think I am exaggerating about this, I challenge Labor members to go and visit small business owners in their own electorates. Ask them how things are really going and you will find out there is no popular support for this ridiculous tax. Tourism is a vital sector in the north of Hasluck, particularly the Swan Valley, Kalamunda and Guildford. People travel from afar to visit these areas and incorporate these activities when they are choosing to visit Perth from Asia and even Europe. Once again, this budget does nothing to help this struggling sector. Let me highlight some figures to show just how important tourism is nationally. It is worth 5.2 percent of our gross domestic product; or, in money terms, $73.3 billion. It employs nearly 910,000 people.


However, the tourism sector is feeling the pinch. Domestic tourism numbers are falling as the cost-of-living pressures hit Hasluck and Australian families. International tourists are faced with the strong Australian dollar, that rising debt levels do nothing to address. Although the sector is hurting, this suite of appropriation bills fails to provide adequate carbon tax compensation for tourism. It stands to destroy 6,400 jobs and cut 10 per cent from industry profits. It will also reduce Tourism Australia's budget by 6.2 per cent or $8 million in real terms.


During its peak in the Howard years, Australian tourism made a profit of $3.584 billion. Next year the sector will stand to make a net loss of $8.7 billion under the Gillard government. Shame on this inept government! I am a strong believer in a smaller government that allows citizens to flourish without being saddled with mountains of red tape and regulations. Excessive government interference in the market place creates inequitable outcomes.




Honourable members interjecting
—





Mr WYATT:
  It is good that the members are having the conversation. Instead of spending even more money on creating further bureaucracy, I call on this government to spend money on helping fertile ground where small businesses can flourish. Spend money on actually helping the people of my electorate to be masters of their own destinies instead of spending millions on advertising propaganda with no positive outcome.


In the south of Hasluck there is a desperate need for further services for my constituents. Let me highlight a few areas of desperate need that would create an ideal set of conditions for attracting more businesses and residents who would boost our local and even national economies. This is where a relatively small investment from the federal government would have major benefits to its citizens.


The growth areas in the east of Western Australia are in the Southern River, Gosnells, Huntingdale and Thornlie areas. Many people from these areas are forced to travel up to an hour to their place of employment as house prices rise and they cannot afford to buy closer to the CBD or work centres. Their commute is often slowed down terribly by the inadequate Nicholson Road and Garden Street roundabout. Delays of 30 minutes or more at this one intersection are not uncommon. This is made worse by the fact that a national train line runs just 200 metres from one of the entries to the roundabout. This and the fact that it is close to a major arterial road, the Roe Highway, causes misery for many. An overpass there would allow the free movement of traffic over this rail line and help emergency vehicles clear the area. It would also help small businesses based along Nicholson Road to attract more customers who are not put off by these delays.


To relieve congestion over a period of time, creating an environment where more people can work from home if they choose to is important. Giving businesses better access to faster download speeds is also critical if an area expects to hold its local industry and not lose them to the CBD. The broadband services in this part of Hasluck are very slow, and in some cases non-existent. I regularly receive letters, calls and emails from constituents in these areas who are frustrated about this situation. A common thread that runs throughout these complaints is what happens when they call Telstra.


When they call they are told there is nothing that Telstra can do due to the snail's pace of the NBN rollout. They are also told that they will have to wait anywhere from five to seven years for faster broadband speeds. How is my electorate supposed to grow in a sustainable way when people hear that moving into the south of Hasluck means living with dial-up speeds and shocking traffic congestion? Ten to 15 years ago broadband speeds may have been considered a luxury but everything is pushed online now, and my constituents in the south of Hasluck are being left behind by this woefully inadequate government. At this point I would like to acknowledge the work of the WA state government member Peter Abetz MLA, who has been tireless in his efforts to improve the Garden Street-Nicholson Road intersection and to improve broadband speeds in this area. Between us we have lobbied hard at state and federal levels for two years to see this change realised. I would also like to mention the outstanding work of three local governments in Hasluck—the City of Gosnells, the Shire of Kalamunda and the City of Swan—who all travel regularly to Canberra to lobby for improvements to our area. They go out of their way to facilitate shadow ministers I bring to Hasluck so they can bring these matters to their attention.


What we never see is the actual Labor government ministers venturing into Hasluck to speak to these LGAs. Unfortunately, despite their best effort, it seems the Gillard government is content to ignore their practical approaches to improving parts of Hasluck and seems to be content on rolling out bloated, ill-conceived policies that do more to create blockages in society than to improve things.


Finally, the surge of new residents to this area—particularly Gosnells—has created an unbearable strain on GP services. There are over 90 languages spoken in this area of Hasluck. The government is dumping people into this area with little or no support. This is not news to this government. In a bid to prop up support in the Midland area, the Gillard government chose to build a GP superclinic right across the road from the existing GP superclinic instead of putting one in Gosnells, which has limited access to the range of GP services. This neglect is outrageous and shows how badly it performs with policy. Waiting times and the lack of bulk billing in Gosnells is a major issue for my constituents and has once again not been addressed or funded in this budget.


People want to know when choosing an area to live in whether or not they can have access to the CBD and transport links and whether or not they can shop if they need to. They need to have access to modern technology like broadband and to be able to visit a GP when necessary without month-long waiting times. The Gillard government has repeatedly failed tens of thousands of people in this area of Hasluck not by accident but by ignoring the lobbying of local government, the complaints of local people and the pressures placed on them by political representatives. Instead of spending billions of dollars housing illegal immigrants in this country, Prime Minister, adopt the coalition policy on border protection; use the billions you will save to improve the lives of Australian people; and take greater care of our pensioners, self-funded retirees and service men and women. It is what they deserve.


I know that we live in times in which the global economy will have an impact. Certainly the Department of the Treasury papers say the conditions in some parts of the economy are likely to remain challenging. I think that in challenging circumstances the ability of the people of Australia to access services that they pay for through their taxes and expect to be delivered so that their needs are met also has to be considered.

"Cheeseman, Darren, MP",ALP,2012-05-24,"



Mr CHEESEMAN
 (Corangamite) (10:48):  Today I rise to speak on the 2012-2013 budget. I was wondering as I was putting together this speech what Tony Abbott might have said to his party room meeting the day after the Treasurer delivered the speech. I am sure he would have said: 'Let's not worry about facts. They get in the way of the truth. Let's get out there and continue to mislead the Australian community about the state of the economy.'


This budget very much is a Labor budget. It is structured in a way that will support families, particularly in terms of delivering economic growth, supporting low unemployment, supporting low inflation and keeping downward pressure on interest rates. If we look at the state of the economy today with its national unemployment rate of 4.9 per cent, the reality is that our unemployment rate is lower than that of the Howard government. We have created some 800,000 jobs in what has been a remarkably challenging economic environment not just domestically but also globally. And we have heard members on this side of the House indicating very clearly the challenges that we face. This budget very much delivers on Labor's commitment to continue to maintain a surplus, which of course is very, very important. But it also is a Labor budget in that it is structured in a way that will help families, particularly in responding to cost-of-living pressures.


Labor is delivering for my constituents throughout their entire lives to ensure access to services and support and to make sure that no-one is left behind. From Alvie to Belmont, children are getting the best start in life thanks to Labor's paid parental leave scheme. This scheme provides working mums—some 969 of them—support in looking after their children in the very, very early weeks of their lives and supporting mums and dads who might choose to adopt a young one. It is a fantastic Labor initiative. This will ensure that parents have that precious opportunity to bond very early with their child, which I think is certainly very important. Having two young sons myself, I know the importance of not only spending time with a newborn baby but also in assisting our wives and partners in looking after those children.


From Colac to Dereel, Labor is supporting the delivery of high-quality child care. The 50 per cent child-care rebate is very much appreciated by families across my electorate. Indeed, there are about 3,854 families that have been enjoying that benefit to enable young parents to return to work and to continue to support their families. From Elliminyt to Forrest, this budget delivers a boost to family tax benefit A and family tax benefit B provisions. In Corangamite, there are over 10,000 families who rely on family tax benefit B, and that will provide $110 per child per year—again helping to support families. There are around 8,000 families on family tax benefit B, and that will provide those families with an extra $69 per child per year. Once again it is Labor that is delivering money to help support families with children. We know that there are many pressures on families, and anything that Labor can do to support families we will of course do.


There are also around 9,000 families across the electorate who will be receiving the schoolkids bonus. My electorate of Corangamite is a key part of the Geelong growth corridor. Many young families are moving to my electorate to build their first homes and to raise their families. The schoolkids bonus is going to help support them in raising their children—which I know is a very popular aspect of the budget. There will be some $410 per year in support provided to families with children in primary school, and some $820 will be provided to families with kids in secondary school. This is an initiative that will help right across my electorate to support families in their efforts to raise and educate their children. It is absolutely the Labor way; it is what we do. We are providing additional support for teenagers so that families can support young people, particularly during their later high school years, their university studies, their apprenticeship studies and the like. Again that is very important.


Some 50,000 taxpayers in the electorate of Corangamite will be receiving a tax cut on 1 July, and some 40,000 of those 50,000 constituents will receive a tax cut of at least $300 a year. These tax cuts are very well tailored to support my community, in particular to support people who have been out of the workforce for some time, whether it be because they have been raising a family or because they have been made redundant at some point in the years before. These tax cuts will provide a real incentive to get those young and older people back into the workforce. It is a Labor way to go about things. The tax cuts will very much support families in Corangamite, and that is very important.


Labor has historically played a very important role in working, particularly with the trade unions, to build and deliver people's superannuation savings. It was Labor and the trade unions that worked hand in glove to put in place compulsory superannuation savings that enable people to retire with dignity. That very strong Labor initiative was undertaken primarily in the eighties and nineties. It is Labor again that is recognising the importance of superannuation—and we are particularly recognising that a larger percentage of our society is going to be post the age of 65 as the baby boomer generation moves through. We are recognising the importance of providing dignity in retirement to families by increasing superannuation by three per cent. That means that a typical 30-year-old worker today will retire with more than $108,000 in their superannuation account when they get to retirement. That is critically important not only for those individuals but also for the Commonwealth budget, because it will enable future governments to keep our pension costs low. It is important that, wherever we can do that, we do so.


Corangamite—and, indeed, the Greater Geelong area—has a very large number of small businesses. In fact it is often misunderstood how important the small business sector is in the Greater Geelong region. Most people when they think about the Greater Geelong region talk about the very large manufacturing businesses that are in the region—and indeed they are important. But equally important, if not more important in terms of it being the engine room of the Geelong economy from both an employment perspective and a wealth generation perspective, is small business. Labor recognises that, and we are putting in place arrangements to help support it, including the instant asset write-off. These measures, I think, are very important combined with the loss carry-back mechanism—again, something that will support cash flow and liquidity in small business. It is something that I am very pleased with and very proud of.


Unfortunately, we were not able to continue to pursue the one per cent tax cut that we wanted to provide to business across my electorate and the economy. We were not able to do that because Tony Abbott was not prepared to support tax cuts for small business. It is very disappointing, but we have put in place a number of other mechanisms in its stead which we have been able to get through the parliament.


Labor also recognises that for pensioners—and I have some 25,000 pensioners in my electorate—it is a particularly challenging and difficult time. We are putting in place additional money, some $338 a year for singles on the pension and some $510 a year for combined pensions, to support them in meeting the cost of living pressures that are within the economy at the moment.


This budget is very much a Labor budget. Time does not permit me to talk about some of the very local outcomes that we have been able to secure not only in Corangamite but across the Greater Geelong region. I look forward to engaging with my constituency around those matters to highlight the very strong contribution this government, the Labor government, is making to the Greater Geelong region.

"Smith, Tony, MP",LP,2012-05-24,"



Mr TONY SMITH
 (Casey) (11:02):  It is my pleasure to speak on these appropriation bills and the budget itself. In doing so, I want to raise a number of issues with the government's economic approach, which is embodied in their budget. At the outset, let me say that this budget should be judged against the backdrop of the government's believability, against the government's capacity in the past and against the government's performance. Indeed, as the shadow Treasurer said just last week at the National Press Club, a budget is a measure of so many things: a government’s honesty and honour, a government’s competence and capacity. This budget, unfortunately, as so many Australians now know, is a budget that fails all of those critical tests.


Across Australia at the moment, there are various indicators of falling confidence. Just recently the Sydney Morning Herald had the headline 'Consumer confidence wilts'. 'Lack of faith puts Australian economy at risk,' warned Dennis Shanahan in the Australian. 'Small business pessimistic,' pronounced the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Just this week the AustralianFinancial Review proclaimed 'Labor’s image is bad for business.' It is the case that as this is happening the shadow of what is happening overseas, particularly in Europe, is critical. We see Greece threatening to drag the entire eurozone over the brink. We observe America grappling with huge economic difficulties and massive deficits that have driven the US federal government debt to 100 per cent of GDP. We hear the Chinese economy may also be slowing. Indeed, in question time this week the Treasurer spoke of events in Europe that he said 'cast a very dark shadow over the global economy'. He went on to concede that Australia was 'not immune from the global instability'. The Treasurer has a real talent for stating the obvious.


The critical point as we debate this package of bills and the budget is how, in the midst of this global turmoil and turbulence, the government is affecting Australia's ability to withstand these challenges. Has the Treasurer strengthened or weakened Australia's economic position? Is his approach and that of the Prime Minister making the Australian economy more or less robust? Has Australia's economic resilience been buttressed or buffeted by the policies of this government? The answer to these questions is clear: despite Labor's best efforts to obscure and obfuscate the facts, the fact is that unfortunately this government's crisis of competence has spawned a crisis of confidence throughout the Australian economy.


We emerged from the global financial crisis in good shape. The primary reason we emerged from the global financial crisis in good shape is that we entered it in great shape. We have so far weathered the worst of the storm, because Australia was in a very solid fiscal position back in 2008. As we debate these budget bills we should look back to the days of surplus budgets. We should look back to the days of paying off Labor's $96 billion of net government debt. We should look back to the days when not only $96 billion of net government debt was paid off but also $45 billion was left as a nest egg in the budget tables for all to see to buffer against future crises and challenges, just as it did.


Without the policies of the Howard government we would not have been able to emerge from the global financial crisis in the shape that we did. Without the responsible budgeting of Treasurer Costello between 1996 and 2007 we would not have been in a markedly different position on the debt front from many other countries. In fact, if we had kept accumulating debt at the rate that we were in the last five years of the Keating government we would have entered that crisis with much more lead in our saddlebags.


Over the last 4½ years, first with the member for Griffith as Prime Minister and now with the member for Lalor as Prime Minister, we have seen a frenzy of ill-conceived and ill-executed spending. The government have not only burnt through that $45 billion cash nest egg that was left after paying off the $96 million of net government debt but plunged on the forecast to $145 billion of net debt, nearly $200 billion of deterioration over their period of office. The Treasurer likes to claim that it was the government stimulus spending that saw Australia through the global financial crisis. The Treasurer does not like to talk about the waste. The Treasurer does not like to talk about the fact that he has been unable to deliver a surplus budget. 


The Australian public have seen the record of this government on so many things—from the carbon tax which they were told would never happen, to the Treasurer's constant pronouncements about what his budget will do each year. It is worth looking at how he has put this budget together and what that means for the future. Sometimes what he does not mention is more important than what he does mention. In trying to conjure together the projection, the forecast, of a small $1.5 billion surplus, the Treasurer has fiddled with as many programs as possible to shuffle money from one financial year to the next—all so that he can project, as of now, a surplus. The truth, which he did not mention in his budget speech, is that he is seeking to increase the Commonwealth debt limit from $250 billion to $300 billion, in other words increasing the national credit card limit. Instead of stating this in his budget speech, of course, it is buried deeper than the wreck of the Titanic in a vain attempt to escape the blatant contradiction between his record and his rhetoric. Despite his talk of fiscal restraint, this Treasurer will continue to borrow $100 million every day.


If we look back at the current financial year—that is, the financial year that the Treasurer talked about and predicated his last budget on, just over a year and a couple of weeks ago when he stood in the House of Representatives—and when you look at his deficit estimates, it really does provide a window into both his capacity and the extent to which the Australian people should believe his pledge of a $1.5 billion surplus. Just 18 months ago, in the mid-year economic update, the Treasurer said that the deficit for the current financial year—which ends in five weeks or so—would be about $12 billion. By budget night last May, he said that the $12 billion had almost doubled to $22 billion for this financial year. By December last year, in the six-monthly official update, it has risen again, from $22 billion to $37 billion. Then on budget night he estimated that the final outcome would be $44 billion. That is, over 18 months, $12 billion to $44 billion. We will not get the final figure until September—and we ain't finished yet. There are still a few weeks left in this financial year.


But this Treasurer who—and let me be generous and just take the one-year blow-out—forecasts a $22 billion deficit and says it will come in at 44 billion, missed by that much and yet he expects us to believe that he will deliver the small surplus. Even to get those figures into the budget, it meant money-shuffling throughout programs on the most ridiculous level. And this is before he has introduced a carbon tax and all the other taxes that I do not have time to speak about.


It is no wonder that when small business owners and families across Australia look at the economic challenges coming down the pipeline, and then look at the capacity of this Treasurer to deal with them, they lack confidence. They lack confidence because the only thing they can trust with this Treasurer is that his word will not be kept. The only thing they can trust with this Treasurer is that his forecast will not be met. That is the only thing small business owners and families across Australia can trust with this Treasurer.


Small businesses are critical. There are 2.7 million of them. If they lack confidence, that has a huge impact on our economy. It is little wonder that the Dun and Bradstreet business failures and start-up analysis for the December 2011 quarter found that small business start-ups had fallen a staggering 95 per cent. These figures show that small businesses, and the small-business leaders of tomorrow, are looking at this Treasurer and looking at this government's lack of competence and these figures show they do not have the confidence to begin a small business—and that is before we talk about what is going on in the small business sector itself. I make this prediction: when we speak on these bills next year, we will be talking about how, once again, the Treasurer has missed his forecasts and misled the Australian people.

Ms HALL
 (Shortland—Government Whip) (11:18):  Thank you very much, Mr Deputy Speaker, and I congratulate you on your elevation to the chair. This is the first time I have spoken when you have been in the chair and I know that you will be a fine Deputy Speaker.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Thank you.




Ms HALL:
  I rise to support the budget that was brought down on 8 May. I would like to congratulate the Treasurer on the fine work that he has done in putting together a budget that I am proud to take to my electorate. This is a budget that delivers to Australian families and a budget that delivers to older Australians. It is a budget that will see Australia go into surplus by the end of this year. It is a budget that really hones in on the issues that are of greatest importance to the people that I represent in this parliament. It is a budget that delivers on the National Disability Insurance Scheme, and that is something that is very close to my heart, as I worked for 12 years in the area of disability before coming to this place. I know how important it is for people with a disability to have the opportunity to maximise their quality of life and to be able to have opportunities that they are currently denied. I know how important it is for their families and their carers to have certainty about what is going to happen to their child when they are no longer able to care for them. I know how important it is for them to see that their child is respected and offered opportunities that other children are offered. Quite often in the past they have been denied these opportunities. The National Disability Insurance Scheme is creating a new era, an era where people with disabilities will have the opportunity to maximise their independence and to live as long as they possibly can in a situation where, maybe, they can live independently in the community, looking at their options for employment and ensuring that into the future they will have choices and opportunities that they have been denied. I really encourage the opposition to support those particular changes and the National Disability Insurance Scheme. 


The other area that I think was particularly impressive was dental health. For a long time Australians have been denied the opportunity to have the dental health care that they need. In this House earlier this week, we debated a motion—or a bill, I think—that was put forward by the shadow health minister. I was extremely disappointed that in the overall scheme of things he brought a bill to this parliament that actually is about 37 dentists and not about providing dental health care to Australians. The chronic dental health program that is in place at the moment has benefited some people, but there are a lot of people who do not have a chronic dental health issue who are denied access to this scheme. Whilst a millionaire can get access to the chronic dental health scheme, somebody on Newstart or a pensioner who relies on their pension and enjoys reasonably good health is denied any access to dental health care. So the major commitment in this budget to dental health is something that will benefit that people I represent in this place. It means $515 million in funding which will address the immediate dental healthcare needs. All those people who have been languishing on the dental health waiting list will have a chance now to be seen a lot quicker. I checked what the current waiting time is in my electorate. People are waiting months. People come to me in my office and have told me that they have been waiting for over 12 months to get the dental care that they need. I think that is very unfair. This is addressing that issue. This is putting in place a program and funds that will address an area of real need. 


There will $346 million over three years—it is going to blitz this dental health waiting list—and $78 million to help dentists relocate to regional and remote areas. While it might be a problem getting dental health care if you are on a low income in an area like mine, after 12 or 18 months you can access it. But, in some areas, you have absolutely no chance of ever being able to get that dental health assistance. I know when the Howard government was in power and the Leader of the Opposition was the health minister, we were advised that the Commonwealth's contribution to dental health was made through private health insurance. Private health insurance is something that not everybody can afford, and it is those people who cannot afford private health insurance that are the ones languishing on the dental health waiting list. These changes are going to be welcomed by everyone I represent in this parliament.


The money that has been put into the national health reform is something that has also made a big difference within my electorate. There have been big, big changes, and now with the local hospital networks it has really improved the functioning of the health system.


I was a member of the Committee on Health and Ageing in the parliament when the Blame game report was brought down. When that report was brought down it showed how it was a very convoluted system and how it needed to be reformed. The previous government did nothing about it. The Rudd and Gillard governments have embraced it and have undertaken reforms that are benefiting all Australians.


One area of health that received extra funding was the National Bowel Cancer Screening Program. In the first week of June it is the National Bowel Cancer Week. During that week I will be holding a forum within my electorate. A wife of a friend of mine died of bowel cancer earlier this year. If she had had a bowel cancer screening test she would still be with us here today. She had had bowel cancer for five years by the time it was finally discovered and she was being treated for something else at the time. Also at that forum will be somebody from the Cancer Council, obviously, speaking and somebody who has survived bowel cancer.


This money over four years to expand the National Bowel Cancer Screening Program is welcomed by everyone. I was pleased to hear the minister say that in the future she is going to expand it even further. My local Rotary Club is currently gearing up to undertake its bowel screening campaign in the community, where they will go out there and get as many people to have the bowel cancer screening test. It is a really, really important initiative in this budget.


Members of the opposition have been scathing in their criticism of the schoolkids bonus. I would like to share with the opposition the fact that in my electorate it was welcomed. The parents who heard comments made by the opposition that they were going to go and waste that money on gambling and alcohol and drugs were absolutely horrified. These are parents who are buying school uniforms and books for their kids, supporting their kids in their education, and they are being accused by the opposition of going to waste this money. It is absolutely horrific that any opposition in this parliament could come out and be so disparaging of Australian families. I think they stand condemned by their actions in relation to that and I am sure the Australian people will let them know loud and clear just how important this bonus is to them in providing education for their children. The other area that I was particularly pleased with in the budget was the Living Longer, Living Better aged-care reforms. It is a massive reform to the aged-care sector. It is about delivering better access to aged-care services. It is about addressing the critical shortage in aged care. It is about allowing older people to stay in their homes for a lot longer. It is about giving support to carers. It is about addressing the national dementia epidemic. I might add here that, as you well know, Mr Deputy Speaker, the health and ageing committee is now conducting an inquiry into dementia, and I think that we will really become aware of just how important this need is.


This is a new approach to aged care. I moved a private member's motion in this House on Monday and I was absolutely horrified to hear speaker after speaker on the opposition side saying that they did not support this package, that they did not support massive reforms to the aged-care sector that would deliver great outcomes to older people in the community. They were at odds with the pensioners and senior citizens at Lake Munmorah Senior Citizens. When I attended their meeting and explained to them how the system would work, they were really very, very excited about it and they were pleased to hear that they would not be forced to sell their family home. It is a great initiative.


I was a little bit disappointed in the budget in relation to foreign aid. I would have liked us to have kept the previous goal, but the Treasurer has assured us that it is only moving the time frame out by a year. But I would have liked to have seen us uphold our former commitment in relation to foreign aid. In the area of Newstart I think that there was room to provide a little bit more support for people who are on Newstart. But, overwhelmingly, I see that this is a budget that will benefit the people I represent in this parliament.


It is a budget that has delivered many things to the people of the Shortland electorate, particularly through the programs that have been funded through this budget—for example, the Energy Efficiency Scheme that has delivered in excess of $353,000 to the Lake Macquarie Business Enterprise Centre. They are welcome initiatives that are going to benefit the people I represent in this parliament. (Time expired)

"Ciobo, Steven, MP",LP,2012-05-24,"



Mr CIOBO
 (Moncrieff) (11:33):  I rise to speak about yet another federal Labor government budget—yet another great disappointment for my constituency on the Gold Coast and yet another squandered opportunity. The reality is that this was a typical Labor budget in that, despite its headline surplus figure of $1.5 billion, it will in reality be another significant budget deficit. We have remarked that it will take 100 years of Wayne Swan surpluses to repay four years of Wayne Swan deficit. The fundamentals are this: Labor are bad economic managers. That Australia is still in relatively good shape is a consequence of the longevity of the reforms that were implemented by the Howard government and the very strong economic footing that the Howard government provided the people of Australia with and indeed the way in which our institutions were funded and the debt repaid.


There are several inescapable facts. Most fundamental of these is the key driver of Australia's debt-to-GDP ratio, which was 100 per cent a consequence of the fact that the previous Howard government and the then Treasurer, Peter Costello, left Australia with zero public debt—zero public debt. In fact, Australia was left at the end of the Howard government's period in office with net assets of $70 billion. In the short four or five years since the Labor Party was elected, we have seen that position erode from a $70 billion net asset position to now a negative $130 billion of debt. That is, for all intents and purposes, a $200 billion turnaround in the space of about four years. That, of itself, speaks volumes about the Australian Labor Party.


If you listened to the Australian Labor Party, you would think that this complete erosion of our nation's finances was a consequence of external factors. If you listened to the narrative from the Australian Labor Party, you would think, 'Look, we just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time, and that is why Australia's finances have been completely eroded.' That is a nice cover, but it is not the reason for the turnaround. The reason Australia's finances have gone backwards at an incredible rate of knots is the reckless spending and the badly applied use of taxpayers' funds by this Labor government. We have seen billions upon billions upon billions of dollars utterly wasted by this government; which, frankly, in my view, borders on economic incompetence. 


Speakers from the government in this debate have stood up, puffed their chests out and said: 'We are proud to give money out to Australian kids through their families. We are proud about what we did with the Investing in Our Schools Program.' Do you know what? I do not share that pride. It is not because I begrudge Aussie kids having brand-new school halls. It is not because I think that parents are going to waste money. The reason I begrudge the Australian Labor Party, when they stand up to crow about their so-called economic achievements, is that those Aussie kids that they talk about—who are sitting in those school halls, whose parents are receiving $800 or $900 or $1,000 in cash handouts from this Labor government—will be paying off the debt that Labor has left us for the next 20 years. So, when they sit in a school hall, they are not sitting in that school hall with the full knowledge that that school hall was built by borrowing money from overseas, money that those kids will have to pay off for 20 years before Australia is even back in the position of starting to save for our future. That is the real legacy of the Australian Labor Party. It is entirely consistent with Labor's form when it has been in federal government before and with Labor's form in every single state across this Federation.


It is extraordinary when you look at the state of Queensland. For so long Queensland was the economic beacon of Australia. We were the lowest taxed state in the Federation and we were the central hub for economic activity in our Federation. After 20 years of Labor government in Queensland that has all been erased. Queensland is no longer the lowest taxed state in the Federation. We are about third or fourth. Queensland no longer is the epicentre of economic activity. Population growth in the state has declined to now being in net terms nearly zero. Economic growth has slowed down. The previous Bligh and Beattie Labor governments have left Queensland with debt of around $60 billion to $80 billion. 


It is a farce that members of the Australian Labor Party stand up and try to whitewash these things, as if in some way they are good, because they care about the people, because they want to hand out money hand over fist, and say that it is the coalition who are the problem because we say no. That is right; we do say no. We say no repeatedly to this government when it comes to economic stewardship, because this government has frankly no idea. It is not bold. It is not visionary. It is not good governance to say: 'We want to hand out $900 here. We want to build $16 billion worth of school halls there. We want to spend money doing this and that and the other. It is the coalition who always stands in our way.' That is right. I am proud to stand in the way of the Australian Labor Party. I am proud to say to the Australian Labor Party, 'Your reckless spending must stop,' because I have two children and I know that it is my kids who will be paying off for decades the debt that the Australian Labor Party leaves behind. 


At what point does the Australian Labor Party wake up, look in the mirror and say to the next generation of Australians, 'I am sorry; we have betrayed you'? At what point does the Australian Labor Party say to the Australian people, 'I am sorry; whereas the previous coalition government meant that we paid zero when it comes to paying off interest on debt, we now have to pay $8 billion a year in servicing interest that this government has racked up'? 


I recall when the Labor Party first came to office, roughly four short years ago. At that time they wanted to increase Australia's debt ceiling to $75 billion. They said: 'Don't worry about it. We'll never reach it. $75 billion will be more than enough to see us through. We are never going to get to it.' Well, guess what? We got to $75 billion. So then the Labor Party said: 'We need to increase our debt ceiling to $100 billion. But don't worry. We'll never get to it. It is just a precaution. It is just there as part of our financial manoeuvring.' Guess what? We reached $100 billion. Then the Labor Party said: 'We need to increase our debt ceiling again, up to $200 billion.' And now the current debt ceiling is at $250 billion. Do you know what Labor is doing in these budget papers? In these budget papers the Labor Party says: 'Look, we are going to have to increase the debt ceiling again. We are just going to push it up to $300 billion. But don't worry about it. We will never get to it. $300 billion. It is okay. Our debt to GDP ratio is low by world standards.' 


The audacity of the Australian Labor Party is extraordinary—their spending and the way they portray themselves. They constantly sap people's aspirations in this country by punishing those that are successful by saying, 'If you earn over $150,000, we are going to effectively tax the bejesus out of you.' It escapes them that this erodes the desire to move ahead in this country. They punish those who are successful, they punish those who generate wealth, they punish those who create employment, they punish the industries that are the entire reason the Australian economy is still moving forward, and then they redistribute all of that and give it to those who are not in that situation. Then they wonder why Australians say: 'Do you know what? This is just too hard. We would rather take our money and invest our capital elsewhere.' They seem to think that we live in a closed environment, where Australians do not have options to invest that capital in overseas markets—which they are doing, because that is more profitable for them than retaining their capital here. 


In addition, it is important to recognise the opportunity cost of the way Labor wastes money; there are two ways Labor has wasted money. We have seen the billions of dollars that have been wasted on the school halls program, the pink batts scheme, GroceryWatch, Fuelwatch, the green car fund—the list is endless. You name it. Billions upon billions upon billions of dollars of money has been channelled into all of these harebrained schemes that Labor backs wholeheartedly the one minute and walks away from the next. That is the first opportunity cost. 


The second opportunity cost relates to the fact that now, as I said, we are paying an interest bill of $8 billion a year. Under the coalition that $8 billion a year could have been spent on programs. There could have been new hospitals, new roads, infrastructure spending—a whole range of different things. That is what the coalition did. 


What we are doing now as a direct consequence of Labor's spending is paying $8 billion a year in interest. I have to say to my constituents: 'I am sorry; we can't extend the heavy rail down to Gold Coast Airport—a cost of $2.8 billion—even though that money would have been available, because now that money has to go towards servicing Labor's debt. We cannot have $30 million for a cruise ship terminal on the Gold Coast—something that would drive employment and tourism—because now that money goes on repaying Labor's debt. We cannot find $2 billion to cover the cost of hosting the Commonwealth Games—something that would showcase my city and indeed all of Australia to the world—because now that money has to be spent on servicing Labor's debt. And we can't find $280 million for the cultural precinct at Evandale, because now that money has to be spent on servicing Labor's debt. We cannot find $1.8 billion to pay for light rail on the Gold Coast, because now that money has to be spent on Labor's debt.' n fact, one of the announcements that I made prior to the 2007 election was for $455 million for the widening of the M1 between Nerang and Tugun. Guess what? This government, in collaboration with the Queensland Labor government, tore that money away from the Gold Coast, ripped it away from my constituents and funnelled some of that money up the road. Instead of having an eight-lane carriageway on the M1, a national road between Brisbane and Sydney, we now have parts that are three lanes and other parts that are two lanes in each direction. That is Labor's legacy.


When people of the Gold Coast in my constituency look around and say, 'Where is the money for the light rail? Where is the money for the Commonwealth Games? Why aren't we improving heavy rail to the Gold Coast airport? Why aren't we doing something with the cruise ship terminal? Why aren't we seeing more funding like, for example, the local Roads to Recovery program, which was a coalition initiative—why aren't we seeing more funding there?' the answer is straightforward, and there are two reasons. Firstly, because that money now has to be spent to service the massive debt that the Labor Party has left us and, secondly, because that money was simply blown. Wasted. It may as well have been thrown on a fire and gone up in smoke; ridiculous programs, like their pink batts scheme—so-called stimulus programs.


If you want a good example of the way that this government has just absolutely wallowed in ineptitude, look at their set top box scheme, an announcement that I think was in the last federal budget. An allocation of around $450 per set top box installation to transform an old analogue TV to be digital-ready now—$450 per installation. The simple fact that you can buy a 42-inch plasma screen, delivered and installed, for less money than that—go to kogan.com.au if you need to verify it—escapes the Labor Party.


The reality is that this certainly has all the hallmarks of a Labor budget. It is a failed budget, and it fails because their centrepiece of this budget—which is to crow about additional compensation for Australian families as part of Labor's attempt to buy them off, frankly, before the introduction of the carbon tax—is nothing more than a laundering exercise. It is a laundering exercise, because Labor is borrowing that money from overseas, then taking that money and giving it to Australian families and saying, 'Aren't we great?' But there is a little asterisk at the end of that sentence. That little asterisk is this: that those Aussie kids who are supposedly the beneficiaries of that money will be the people who for the next two decades are forced to pay higher taxes in order to repay the massive debt that this government has racked up in four short years. One hundred years of Labor Party surpluses are required in order to repay four years of Labor Party debt and deficit. The Labor Party stands condemned for their reckless spending, for the opportunity costs that they have brought about on the Australian people and, most fundamentally, because they have betrayed future generations of Australians, who will have to repay the debt in order to get Australia back to square one.

Mr FITZGIBBON
 (Hunter—Chief Government Whip) (11:48):  I like the member for Moncrieff, and I have a healthy respect for his ability and capacity. I really cannot understand why he is not serving on the front bench, representing his party, but I am sure his time will come. But when we come to speak on the budget we come largely to speak about our local communities, and I have never heard such rubbish from him. I cannot believe the dissertation I have just heard from the member for Moncrieff. He represents a thriving tourism area. Where would it be now if Australia were in recession? How would the member for Moncrieff's electorate now be faring if, like Europe in particular, we were now in recession as a country?


As we speak today, in every corner of Europe they are wondering what they will do next about their economic situation. The eurozone is falling apart and they are wondering how they get growth back into their local economies, and they wonder how they are going to deal with the debt crisis of southern Europe. Meanwhile, back in Australia, of course, we still enjoy healthy growth. We managed to avoid recession, one of the only Western democracies to do so, and of course that has left us with a little bit of debt. The member for Moncrieff's alternative was not to spend that money and allow Australia to sink into a deep recession. All those things he was just talking about, which are no doubt worthy projects in his electorate, would not be funded today, because government revenues would have fallen considerably as the economy went into negative, and government outlays would have risen considerably as people joined the unemployment queues. Unemployment now in the Hunter region is at 3.9 per cent. In my electorate it is 3½ per cent. That would not be the case—




Mr Ciobo:
  No, it isn't.




Mr FITZGIBBON:
  I will take the interjection. I am not sure what it was, but I suspect I know. I do not take all the credit for that, nor does the current Labor government. The Hunter region is transforming itself off the back of reforms over a period of more than 20 years, started by the Hawke and Keating governments, continued by the Howard government and now kicked along again by the current Labor government.


But let us not have this rubbish that this debt, which as a percentage of GDP is very small in Australia, is somehow a problem for us and that, if we had not had it, we would be funding things in the member for Moncrieff's electorate. That is not true. If we had gone down the path he has suggested, his electorate would be in much worse shape today than it is thanks to the intervention of this government—intervention recommended by no less a person than the then Treasury secretary, Ken Henry, who was very persuasive recently on 7.30. I can advise the member for Moncrieff that that full interview can be seen, by the way, on the ABC website, and he should read it. I would ask those who might be listening to this debate this morning to ask themselves who has it right—Ken Henry or the member for Moncrieff? I know where my money is, and I suspect most of them will come to the conclusion that Ken Henry probably has a better idea about these things than the member for Moncrieff, as talented as the member for Moncrieff might be. I suspect they would also see Ken Henry as being just a little more independent in his pronouncements than the member for Moncrieff is, because as you would expect the member for Moncrieff is in here playing the political game. I am not saying I have never done that. I am sure I did in my younger days, but I have come to mature and I have come to understand that you do better in this place if you speak frankly about the challenges facing us and the opportunities before us, and that is what I will do this morning in the time afforded me.


On that theme, I want to say this: when I was elected to the Cessnock City Council in 1987, the Cessnock LGA was in pretty bad shape. Historically the area affectionately known as the Coalfields was established on the back of pit tops. Cessnock, Paxton, Ellalong and Millfield—I could go on and on—were there because there were mines there. The mines were sunk first and the communities were established around them. Of course, eventually the mines moved on and the people did not. That left the Coalfields in pretty bad shape. When I was elected, unemployment in Cessnock, for example, was more than 13 per cent. Youth unemployment was probably around 30 per cent. Things were pretty rough. Our roads were goat tracks. Roads like Allandale Road, Maitland Road, Aberdare Road, Lang Street in Kurri, Mitchell Avenue in Kurri and Victoria Street in Kurri were just goat tracks. We still have some problems with roads; all of us continue to work on those. We have more than our fair share, but basically our roads have come a long way. We did not have recreational facilities to speak of. We did not have any decent parks. We do now. We did not have any traffic lights. When I was elected to the Cessnock council in 1987, there was not a set of traffic lights in the whole city—a city covering Cessnock, Kurri and many communities around them. We have many now. Many of these things come naturally as the city grows, but the Cessnock LGA is a very different place today from what it was then.


If we wanted entertainment in the Cessnock LGA in those days, we went to the club or the pub. There was nothing wrong with that; they are good pubs and clubs and they are getting even better. But, if we wanted to do something beyond that, we drove to Newcastle or, more likely, we drove to Sydney. Today Sydney comes to us. The vineyard concerts are becoming very famous and well attended.


The whole Cessnock economy has been transformed, driven by the services and retail sectors. Coalmining is very important. We are very fortunate, because we are part of the boom, but the boom is not in our backyard. A large proportion of our workforce still works in mining by travelling down to areas like the member for Charlton's area and more particularly to the Upper Hunter. But things have improved dramatically. I said that I think the unemployment then in Cessnock was 13 per cent. Today it is a six per cent unemployment rate in Cessnock, and 3.5 per cent is the unemployment rate in the Hunter electorate.


We have the Hunter Expressway now coming through our area—a federal government investment of $1.45 billion, which will transform traffic flows through the region and provide towns like Cessnock and Maitland and a number of communities in between—Lochinvar, Greta, Branxton, Mount Vincent, Mulbring et cetera—with much-needed bypasses of their local communities and much needed relief from heavy vehicle traffic in particular. The Hunter Expressway is going to significantly impact positively on the Hunter's economy.


I say all these things not to take credit for them, although I like to think that over 16 years in this place and then eight years before that on Cessnock council I played my role. I will say again that for 11½ years of that period the conservatives were in power here in Canberra, and they take some credit for some of the transformations we have seen in the Hunter's economy and social fabric over those years. It has been a team effort. When John Howard was the Prime Minister, I like to think that I worked pretty well with his government to do what was right for my electorate, including the Cessnock LGA, which I love very, very much. I have lived there all of my life and I suspect I will live there for the balance of my life.


One of the reasons I make this point is that yesterday Norsk Hydro announced that it has finally taken the decision to close down its aluminium-manufacturing plant in Kurri Kurri, with the loss of around 400 jobs. Already a number of months ago they closed down one potline, which caused them to shed about 150 jobs. This is very, very unfortunate, disappointing and distressing for those directly affected—either those who have been working at Hydro, some of them for many years, or those working in the industries would support Hydro, whether they be supplying food or doing other manufacturing and works associated with the plant.


What concerns me is the way people talk down the town in the wake of these things. Hydro have been making it clear for a while that aluminium prices and the Australian dollar were killing them. They have had the additional frustration of their inability to secure an appropriate and acceptable long-term power supply contract with the New South Wales government. We knew this was coming, as sad as we find it. But it is not the end of Kurri Kurri, it is not the end of the Cessnock LGA and it is certainly not the end of the Hunter electorate. We are a booming community. We are very fortunate. We have much at our disposal. With unemployment at 3.5 per cent in the Hunter electorate and six per cent in the Cessnock LGA or thereabouts, most of those workers, in my view, will have very good employment prospects. They are semiskilled and skilled, and well placed to pick up the enormous amount of job opportunities in the Hunter region, including very close to home. The biggest challenge for me when I became the member for Hunter was finding jobs to put people in. Today my biggest challenge is finding the people to fill the jobs. I regularly talk with employers who are simply crying out for employees.




A division having been called in the House of Representatives—





Sitting suspended from 
11:59
 to 
12:15





Mr FITZGIBBON:
  If I were one to write and read my speeches, I might know where I was before I was interrupted by the division—a first for me—but I know what theme I was on, and it is this. The Cessnock LGA is in great shape. It is more beautiful than it once was and more vibrant than it once was. The unemployment rate has never been so low. We have never had such economic diversity and I am sure that all those who are looking for a job post-Hydro will find themselves a job in a labour market—and I remember where I was up to in my speech now—where employers are screaming for employees with the sorts of skills held by those who, very unfortunately, will be made redundant as a result of Hydro's closure. So my main message to the many out there talking the area down is: please stop it. It does not help. We are in very good shape and our future is a very bright one indeed. Please stop this rubbish about blaming the carbon price for the closure and, in doing so, making political capital out of what is a pretty distressing time for those who were directly affected.


In the minutes left to me, I want to mention a couple of people who have, sadly, passed on in recent times. I spoke about Mrs Lola Neilly in the adjournment debate on Monday, and I want to quickly mention two other people. One is Bill Parker, who was a Kurri resident, served for many, many years on Cessnock City Council, including a term as deputy mayor, and served with me for the eight years I was on Cessnock council. He was a wonderful individual of unchallenged integrity and a talented councillor who always put his city first. He will be sadly missed.


The second person I want to mention is Mr Kevin Levido. Kevin Levido was a very well known Cessnock resident from a very well-known family. He for many years managed the local Bandag tyre-retreading business for the O'Neill family. He was very active, like Bill Parker, in the Labor Party. He was also involved in a range of other organisations, including the local Masonic lodge. He was a very disciplined character and always very fit, even in his later years, but, again, like Bill Parker, he was a man of very great honesty and integrity. He was known to be pretty tough too, including on his employees and, indeed, those close to him. But that was his way—we are all different. He remained a person who was very highly respected in the local community. To both of those families once again go my sympathies and condolences.


Although we lost Bill probably some months ago now, this has been my first opportunity to acknowledge his passing and to thank him again for his contribution and to thank his family for allowing him to spend so much of his time doing what he loved, trying to improve his local community. It is the very community that I have just been talking about, of course—Kurri Kurri. If Bill were here, I have no doubt that he would agree with me that we have gone ahead in leaps and bounds since the days when we enjoyed one another's company on Cessnock council. He would not be happy to hear people talking down the local area. He, like me, would say, 'It's a tragedy we've lost Hydro, but, gee, we've got so much else going for us.'

"Griggs, Natasha, MP",CLP,2012-05-24,"



Mrs GRIGGS
 (Solomon) (12:20):  I rise to speak on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2012-2013 and cognate bills. As I have said before, while I am in this place I will do whatever is possible to ensure that my electorate of Solomon—and, indeed, the Northern Territory—receive their fair share of funding from the Commonwealth government. Once again, despite the endless rhetoric from Labor in the lead-up to the budget, this was not a tough budget. There was more borrowing, more debt and more taxes and then a sugar-hit cash giveaway to offset the carbon tax.


The government have resorted to accounting tricks and money shuffling to manufacture the appearance of a wafer-thin budget surplus of $1.5 billion in the 2012-13 financial year. If the Gillard Labor government really believe they can deliver a surplus, why are they moving to increase the Commonwealth debt limit from $250 billion to $300 billion? They are increasing the government's credit card limit, and we all know that we cannot trust Labor with credit cards. They have tried to hide the fact that they need to increase the credit card limit by having the proposal buried in the Appropriation Bill (No. 2) in order to avoid proper scrutiny and a specific vote on the debt limit. This government are embarrassed that government debt levels are at absolutely unprecedented levels. They do not want Australians to know that they have maxed out the credit card again.


The Treasurer did not even mention the plan to raise the debt limit in his budget night speech, and, when he was asked later why he needed to lift the debt limit if he was returning the budget to surplus, he responded, 'Well, very simply, this is no big deal.' Net debt is rising to $145 billion. This dwarfs the previous record of $96 billion left by Paul Keating—and this is no big deal? That is not what my constituents tell me; they tell me it is a big deal.


This government tell us about restraint, but they are now spending $100 million more per year than they were when they came to office. This represents an almost 40 per cent increase over a time when inflation has risen to 13.2 per cent. Look at what Labor do; do not listen to what they say. They are continuing to borrow $100 million per day. That is $100 million for every day that this Labor government are in power. In 18 months, the government's estimated deficit on the 2012-13 financial year has blown out from $12 billion to $44 billion—and it may blow out even further, because the year is not over. In the last four years Labor have delivered record cumulative deficits of $174 billion. The interest payments on Labor's debt alone are set to reach an alarming $8 billion per year.


What this budget did was very simple: it confirmed to every Australian that this government are not fit to lead. The government are so swept up in holding onto power and improving the polls that they have forgotten their core responsibility to the Australian people. To a nation that is facing high costs of living, and dealing with a failed immigration policy, the Gillard Labor government give the following: the world's biggest carbon tax; cynical bribes to soften the impact of the carbon tax; broken promises on corporate tax cuts; higher unemployment; blowouts in the cost of border protection; an underfunded NDIS, which is nothing more than a cruel hoax; and equity funding for the NBN which is being kept off-budget. That is what this Labor government give us.


Despite Julia Gillard saying five days before the last election, 'There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead', budget 2012 is Australia's first carbon-tax budget. The world's biggest carbon tax is about to hit families, jobs and investment at the world's worst time. The budget papers confirm that despite falling international prices Labor's toxic tax will go up to $29 a tonne in just three years and that an additional $36 million will be spent on taxpayer-funded carbon tax advertising over the next two years. The advertisements, as we know, do not even mention the carbon tax. They mention that cash bribes, but they do not mention the phrase 'carbon tax'. The carbon tax will cascade through the economy. Despite Labor's lie that only the big emitters will pay the price, the cost of virtually everything will go up, up and up. Small businesses, which are the engine room of the economy, will receive no compensation for the carbon tax.


We have had four deficits in four years. The overall budget for 2012 delivers a deterioration of $26 billion in the cumulative Commonwealth budget position over the forward estimates since last year's budget. The blow-out in this year's deficit from $23 billion to $44 billion means more borrowing and more debt, which future generations will have to repay. All of this is despite the fact that in real terms the government is experiencing the fastest growth in revenue since the mid-1980s. This is the fourth Labor deficit in four years, and together they total $174 billion.


Treasurer Swan has never managed to get his figures right. The 2011-12 budget deficit has now blown out, as I said, three times, from $12 billion to $23 billion to $37 billion to $44 billion, and this year has not even finished. This year's budget, as I have said, was all about cooking the books. In headline cash terms, the Gillard Labor government will spend $8.7 billion more than it earns in the 2012-13 financial year, because the government continues to spend on projects such as the NBN, which have been taken off budget. If the government were honest and included the NBN expenditure, the budget would show deficits over the next three years. To put it simply, there would be no surplus if the NBN were on the books. In fact, by bringing forward just two programs, the back to school payment and the Commonwealth grants to local government, the government artificially saves more than $1.5 billion in the 2012-13 financial year. Honest budget treatment of these two programs alone would wipe our Treasurer Swan's wafer-thin surplus.


We now have record debt. As I have already said, this government seeks to increase Australia's debt ceiling to a record $300 billion, which is four times higher than it was in 2008. Australians are right to be concerned about Treasurer Swan, with yet another increase in our nation's credit card limit. Net government debt will climb to a record $144.9 billion in 2013-14. That is an increase of almost $40 billion since last year's budget. By 2015-16, the government will be spending over $8 billion a year, or around $22 million a day, on interest payments alone. This is the price tag of Labor's legacy of waste and reckless spending.


With the higher unemployment, last year's budget promised 500,000 new jobs over two years, but the government now expects to miss its target by 300,000 jobs. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate is forecast to increase to 5.5 per cent, while the government is cutting $200 million out of job service programs. This government is all about high taxes. The budget includes another six new tax hikes, including through heavy vehicle road user charges and reduced tax offsets for families with higher medical bills. This brings to 26 the number of new or increased taxes the Rudd/Gillard Labor governments have delivered since 2007.


Let us get to the broken promises. The Gillard Labor government has dumped the Prime Minister's promise about company tax cuts. Less than two months ago in the House of Reps on 14 March, she said:


If you are against cutting company tax, you are against economic growth». If you are against economic growth, then you are against jobs.


The Prime Minister has also broken her solemn promise set out in the 2009 defence white paper to increase defence spending by three per cent in real terms until the 2017-18 financial year. In this budget, the Prime Minister and Treasurer Swan cut a further $5.5 billion out of Australia's defence budget, on top of the $2.5 billion they cut out of the defence budget last year. As a percentage of GDP, defence spending is now at historically low levels. While defence continues to be cut, Prime Minister Gillard's broken border protection and onshore processing policy has delivered another $1.4 billion blowout in asylum seeker management. Yet, despite the Gillard Labor government's big talk, the $1 billion committed over the forward estimates to the National Disability Insurance Scheme is almost $3 billion less than the Productivity Commission recommended. Australians with disabilities will be forgiven for feeling short-changed by the Gillard Labor government's budget. The budget also set aside just $5 billion towards the Gonski review. The $5-billion-a-year price tag means Labor's independent schools hit list is not far away.


Australians want a government which can deliver an economic strategy to build a strong Australia, reduce the cost-of-living pressures and create secure jobs. Instead, they have a government mired in chaos and a Prime Minister with no judgment. My electorate of Solomon is in desperate need of infrastructure to make its economy more productive. In Solomon, we are also in desperate need of health infrastructure to give our people better access to health services. There are more disappointing elements in the budget: in particular that families have been targeted and the perception of a wealthy family is now a family on $150,000. With the higher cost of living continuing to apply pressure on families' budgets and interest rates, we all know that a family on $150,000 is far from being wealthy, especially in regional Australia, where the cost of living in high.


Many people in my electorate and my family and friends across Australia have raised with me their concerns regarding the significant expenditure on housing associated with asylum seekers in the Territory. The general view is that this money could be better spent on infrastructure to build on the Territory's potential and on funding longer term projects within my electorate. This Labor government's short-sighted measures and poor fiscal management are set to continue to the pain for families within my electorate of Solomon. Despite Labor talking down the impact of the these changes, the truth is that, at a time when families are struggling with costs of living pressures, the carbon tax will hurt families. I remind the House again of the pink batts fiasco, which resulted in the deaths of Australians. I remind the house of the Building the Education Revolution scheme, which directed funds to building halls at schools already scheduled for closure. I remind the House of the hard-earned taxpayers' money spent on an inefficient solar rebate program—a program that not only was economically inefficient but did almost nothing for environmental outcomes. How can we forget the exorbitant and unnecessary cost of giving set-top boxes to pensioners at a cost higher than that of a whole new television? Nor have we forgotten the $900 of stimulus payments that were sent to people living overseas and to people who were in fact dead.


On another note, after the 2010 federal election the Prime Minister was asked by the member for Denison what Labor would do with the promises made by Labor candidates in seats where Labor did not win. The Prime Minister stood at the dispatch box, hand on heart and said, 'Our promises were fully costed—every single one of them. Of course they will be delivered. Of course they will. We don't go around making promises that we won't fulfil.


Following on from that passionate statement of commitment in the chamber, I wrote letters to the Prime Minister on behalf of the electorate asking for clarification as to when the pre-election commitments made by Labor would be delivered in my electorate of Solomon. One promise I would like to touch on quickly was the promise of 1,200 new affordable rental homes in the Northern Territory, priced at at least 20 per cent below market rates under the National Rental Affordability Scheme. This promise was rebadged from the previous election. Now, according to a recent National Rental Affordability Scheme monthly performance report dated 30 April 2012, out of the 1,696 NRAS incentives, the Northern Territory has currently a grand total of—wait for it—14 allocated incentives. That was 14 out of 1,696 in the Northern Territory. As I have said many times in this place, the Northern Territory and indeed my electorate of Solomon is experiencing a housing crisis, and the best number this government can come up with is 14. Mind you, this comes at the same time this Labor government is introducing its toxic carbon tax. This Labor government is definitely toxic and cannot go through with its plans. It really is a mess. At the same time, this government is demolishing houses in my electorate. The RAAF base is fantastic, with really good houses, but this government is knocking them down. It just beggars belief. It is just a disgrace. The coalition government said that it would save those houses, and I am here again today to say that it should.


I would like to end by reminding the House that the carbon tax will hurt families, small businesses and all the people in the Northern Territory, and they are very clear that they do not want a carbon tax. This budget was all about the carbon tax.


Debate adjourned.

"Southcott, Dr Andrew, MP",LP,2012-05-24,"



Dr SOUTHCOTT
 (Boothby) (12:35):  As I get around my electorate and talk to small business the thing that I increasingly hear about is the tough conditions that small business is facing and the fact that there is just no confidence—no confidence to invest, no confidence to plan for the future and very tough conditions in the economic climate.


Small businesses are known as the backbone of our economy, but what we see is a government who are intent on crippling small business—the mum and dad shops that we all rely on. The Labor Party are failing small business right across the country. Their promise of one-in, one-out small business regulation has been a complete failure. The Labor Party have introduced 18,089 new regulations to cripple our small businesses but have only repealed 86. This makes it essential that we get rid of the red tape, that we remove red tape from small businesses. It is something that we have committed to doing in government.


The world's biggest carbon tax is only 37 days away, and this budget will do nothing to restore confidence. It will increase the cost of everything that small businesses need: the cost of their electricity will go up 10 per cent and the cost of gas will go up nine per cent. All of this will have an impact on small business. The best thing that the government could do to restore confidence and improve the conditions of small business would be to dump the carbon tax.


Small businesses are struggling, and that is why I recently held a small business forum in Boothby with the shadow minister for small business, the member for Dunkley. The forum was held in Blackwood and was well attended by a number of concerned small businesses in the electorate. The response from the meeting was very much along the same lines—concern around the fragile state of the economy, concern about the rising costs of doing business and concern over the carbon tax. While the member for Dunkley was visiting the electorate we also took a walk through Westfield Marion, a major shopping centre in my electorate. This was a perfect opportunity to touch base with small business owners in the electorate, and they raised similar concerns.


While on the topic of Westfield Marion, I have had a number of small businesses contact me, concerned about the decision by Westfield to implement paid parking at the centre. The local traders in the centre are extremely concerned that the paid parking proposal is going to put further pressure on their retail sales. They are concerned that paid parking is going to have a significant negative impact on foot traffic through the centre. Fewer people will be fewer sales, and this is at a time when small businesses are already struggling.


As well as small business local residents have voiced their disapproval of the paid parking proposal, suggesting that it will lead to increased congestion in the suburbs surrounding the centre. I am concerned about this proposal, particularly coming at a time when small businesses are really struggling and really doing it tough. I am very disappointed that the South Australian government allowed this proposal to go ahead, given that they operate the GP Plus Health Care Centre at the site and given that they own the SA Aquatic & Leisure Centre. This is something that the South Australian government should have put the line through, and instead it allowed it to go ahead. The thing that small business now needs most of all is a return to confidence and a return to a government which is looking forward to the future and not simply focused on its own survival.
